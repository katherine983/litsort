In 1985, this small journal dramatically expanded its content and readership by embracing the overlapping disciplines of ostomy care, wound care, incontinence care, and related skin and nutritional issues and became the premier journal of its kind. Ostomy Wound Management's readers include health care professionals from multiple disciplines. The name was changed in 2019 to better reflect health care's shifting focus to evidence-based management and prevention of all aspects of wound care. 

Today, readers of Wound Management & Prevention will continue to benefit from contemporary and comprehensive review and research papers that are practical, clinically oriented, and cutting edge. Each feature article published has undergone a rigorous double-blind peer review by members of the Editorial Advisory Board. Sponsored columns are provided by manufacturers to elucidate the science behind their products and to offer evidence of their appropriate and successful use. Additionally, Wound Management & Prevention departments include Children With Wounds: Asking the Right Questions (case studies illustrating the latest neonatal and pediatric relevant to this clinical niche), My Scope of Practice (featuring a day-in-the-life of a peer-nominated clinician), Special Report (miscellaneous news of interest), and various opportunities for editorial insights and feedback. Material available exclusively online includes Industry Spotlight and several rotating columns addressing quality and safety, quick practice tips, and case studies.",Barbara Zeiger,bzeiger@hmpglobal.com,https://goo.gl/SwyX8W,HMP Communications,checked
