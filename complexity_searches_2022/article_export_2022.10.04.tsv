1	What Matters To People Aged 80 And Over Regarding Ambulatory Care? A Systematic Review And Meta-Synthesis Of Qualitative Studies	2022	1	10.1007/s10433-021-00633-7			1	19	3	325.0	The growing percentage of the population aged 80 and over is challenging for healthcare systems, as frailty and other complex health issues are common in this age group. In order to provide patient-centered ambulatory healthcare, their preferences and expectations need to be explored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically search for and synthesize qualitative evidence on how people aged 80 and over believe ambulatory healthcare (medical and nursing care) should be delivered to them. Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection and Google Scholar were searched for full research reports of qualitative studies focusing on the preferences, wishes, needs, expectations and experiences of people aged 80 and over regarding ambulatory medical and nursing care. The results were screened by two independent reviewers using a two-step approach. The included studies were meta-synthesized using Thomas and Harden’s ‘thematic synthesis’ approach in order to gain a new, second-order interpretation of the findings of the primary studies. In the intermediate synthesis step, 14 aspects of healthcare structures and care relationships were identified as relevant. Based on these, three underlying wishes were found: feeling safe, feeling like a meaningful human being, and maintaining control and independence. The results of this review are in line with other research, such as reviews focusing on the preferences of the younger age group (65–80). However, the importance of aspects of care relationships as an integral part of favorable ambulatory healthcare and the wish to be strengthened as a meaningful human being are emphasized more strongly.

2	Clinical Determinants And Neural Correlates Of Presbyphagia In Community-Dwelling Older Adults	2022	2	10.3389/fnagi.2022.912691			2	14			Background: “Presbyphagia” refers to characteristic age-related changes in the complex neuromuscular swallowing mechanism. It has been hypothesized that cumulative impairments in multiple domains affect functional reserve of swallowing with age, but the multifactorial etiology and postulated compensatory strategies of the brain are incompletely understood. This study investigates presbyphagia and its neural correlates, focusing on the clinical determinants associated with adaptive neuroplasticity. Materials and methods: 64 subjects over 70 years of age free of typical diseases explaining dysphagia received comprehensive workup including flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), magnetoencephalography (MEG) during swallowing and pharyngeal stimulation, volumetry of swallowing muscles, laboratory analyzes, and assessment of hand-grip-strength, nutritional status, frailty, olfaction, cognition and mental health. Neural MEG activation was compared between participants with and without presbyphagia in FEES, and associated clinical influencing factors were analyzed. Presbyphagia was defined as the presence of oropharyngeal swallowing alterations e.g., penetration, aspiration, pharyngeal residue pooling or premature bolus spillage into the piriform sinus and/or laryngeal vestibule. Results: 32 of 64 participants showed swallowing alterations, mainly characterized by pharyngeal residue, whereas the airway was rarely compromised. In the MEG analysis, participants with presbyphagia activated an increased cortical sensorimotor network during swallowing. As major clinical determinant, participants with swallowing alterations exhibited reduced pharyngeal sensation. Presbyphagia was an independent predictor of a reduced nutritional status in a linear regression model. Conclusions: Swallowing alterations frequently occur in otherwise healthy older adults and are associated with decreased nutritional status. Increased sensorimotor cortical activation may constitute a compensation attempt to uphold swallowing function due to sensory decline. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the swallowing alterations observed can be considered physiological per se or whether the concept of presbyphagia may need to be extended to a theory with a continuous transition between presbyphagia and dysphagia.

3	The Changing Role Of Advanced Clinical Practitioners Working With Older People During The Covid- 19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Research Study	2022	3	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2022.104235			3	130			Background: COVID-19 was identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in December 2020. Advanced Clinical Practitioners (ACPs) in England working with older people with frailty, experienced their clinical role changing in response to the emergency health needs of this complex population group. In contrast to other countries, in England Advanced Clinical Practitioners are drawn from both nursing and allied health professions. Whilst much of the literature emphasises the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the Advanced Clinical Practitioners’ role, the pandemic threw further light on its potential and challenges. However, an initial review of the literature highlighted a lack of research of Advanced Clinical Practitioners’ capabilities working with uncertainty in disaster response situations. Aim: To capture the lived experience of how English Advanced Clinical Practitioners working with older people adapted their roles in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2020–January 2021). Design, setting and participants: A qualitative research design was used. Following ethical approval, 23 Advanced Clinical Practitioner volunteer participants from across England with varied health professional backgrounds were recruited from Advanced Clinical Practitioners’ professional and social media networks on Twitter using a snowballing technique. Methods: Depending on preference or availability, 23 participants (nurses (18), physiotherapists (2), paramedics (2) and a pharmacist (1)) were interviewed singularly ( n = 9) or as part of 3 focus groups ( n = 14) using Zoom video communication. Audio recordings were transcribed and using qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 12 pro, coded for an essentialist thematic analysis of Advanced Clinical Practitioners’ responses using an inductive approach. 27 codes were identified and collated into five themes. For the purposes of this paper, four themes are discussed: experiencing different work, developing attributes, negotiating barriers and changing future provision. Findings: Advanced Clinical Practitioners successfully transferred their advanced practice skills into areas of clinical need during the pandemic. Their autonomous and generic, high level of expertise equipped them for management and leadership positions where speed of change, and the dissolution of traditional professional boundaries, were prioritised. Barriers to progress included a lack of knowledge of the Advanced Clinical Practitioner role and friction between Advanced Clinical Practitioners and physicians. Discussion and conclusion: The study demonstrated the successful adaption of the Advanced Clinical Practitioner role to enable more creative, personalised and sustainable solutions in the care of older people living with frailty during the pandemic. The potential of Advanced Clinical Practitioner development is in a juxtaposition to the threat of pandemic services being dismantled once the emergency nature of care has passed. Healthcare organisations have a vital part to play in considering the enablers and barriers of Advanced Clinical Practitioner capability-based practice when responding to uncertainty.

4	Author'S Response To “Comment On Kong Et Al. (2021) 'The Prevalence Of Frailty Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis'”	2022	4	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2021.104156			3	126			Reply by the current authors to the comments on Comment on Kong et al. (2021) “The prevalence of frailty among community-dwelling older adults with diabetes: a meta-analysis” made by H. Liu et al. (2021) on the original article The prevalence of frailty among community-dwelling older adults with diabetes: a meta-analysis (2021). The authors strongly agree with Liu et al. on the role of characteristics of diabetes in the development of physical frailty. Existing evidence has shown that diabetes tends to cause impairment of muscle and nerve function, cardiopulmonary reserve and executive function, leading to the development and progression of frailty. Diabetes-related complications particularly renal impairment, dementia and hypertension were significantly associated with frailty in older adults. Additionally, older adults with diabetes have a higher risk of malnutrition due to overly restricted diet, reduced appetite and swallowing difficulties. In the meta-analysis, the pooled estimate showed no significant association between age and frailty in diabetes based on data from two studies. Age may also have a similar effect on frailty in older adults with diabetes. Due to limited studies focused on frailty in diabetes, future prospective studies are needed to further confirm the relationship between age and frailty in diabetes. Higher consistency in measurement of frailty can improve our understanding of the implications of frailty. However, multifaceted and complex nature of frailty makes unlikely broad agreement upon a single definition of frailty. Moreover, just as Liu et al. pointed out, the cut-off point of the instrument may need to be adjusted when it is used in different ethnic groups to improve the diagnostic accuracy.

5	Occupational Therapy In The Emergency Department: Patient Frailty And Unscheduled Return Visits	2021	5	10.1177/00084174211051165			5	88	4	395.0	Background: Occupational therapy facilitates care for complex frail emergency department (ED) patients who may have unscheduled return visits (URVs). Purpose: To determine the prevalence of frailty amongst ED patients referred to occupational therapy and if frailty affected the rates and reasons for URVs. Methods: A mixed-methods health records review was conducted of older adults referred to an ED-based occupational therapy program. Findings: Most patients were frail (60.6%). 31.0% of patients discharged home had a URV within 30 days, with no difference in URV rates between frail and non-frail populations. Providing occupational therapy education reduced the frequency of URVs. Frail patients had complex reasons for their URVs, including functional, social/environmental, safety concerns, and/or “failure to thrive”. Occupational therapy ED patients were typically vulnerable to moderately frail, dependent in some activities of daily living, and complex. Implications: ED-based occupational therapists must be aware of their patient's frailty and risk of URVs.

6	„Frailty“ Bei Nephrologischen Erkrankungen	2021	6	10.1007/s00391-021-01953-0			6	54	7	708.0	The term frailty describes a complex syndrome of reduced resistance to stress factors as a consequence of age-related degeneration in various organ systems. In the general population frailty is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including an increased risk of falls, hospitalization, functional impairment and mortality. Frailty occurs earlier and its prevalence is higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared to the general population. Frail patients with CKD, on dialysis or not, have reduced quality of life and increased hospitalization and mortality rates, regardless of age, sex or comorbidities. The identification of frailty in patients with CKD can lead to the detection of important and potentially modifiable risk factors. Early nephrological evaluation coupled with an interdisciplinary approach including primary care physicians, geriatricians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and nutritionists, is fundamental in the prevention of frailty as well as in the management of frail patients with CKD. Several instruments have been developed to screen for and assess the degree of frailty; however, there is currently no recommendation as to which should be used in nephrology and how to manage frail patients with CKD. In this article we suggest an approach based on a multidimensional, interdisciplinary evaluation aimed at the early identification and management of frail CKD patients independent of the clinical setting of admission; however, more important than the method used is the need to identify and follow-up on frail CKD patients.

7	Education, Wealth, And Duration Of Life Expected In Various Degrees Of Frailty	2021	7	10.1007/s10433-020-00587-2			1	18	3	393.0	Multistate life tables are used to estimate life expected in three frailty states: frailty free, mild/moderate frailty, severe frailty. Estimates are provided for the combination of education and wealth by age, stratified by sex. Data consider 17,115 cases from the Health and Retirement Study, 2000–2014. Frailty is measured using a 59 item frailty index based on deficit accumulation. Estimates are derived using stochastic population analysis for complex events. Population-based and status-based results are reported. Findings confirm a hypothesis that the combination of higher education and wealth results in longer lives in more favorable degrees of frailty. Also, as hypothesized, wealth generally affords a greater advantage than does education among those with severe frailty at baseline. For instance, high wealth provides a 70-year-old woman with severe frailty at baseline 0.70 more total years and 0.81 more frailty free years then her counterpart with low wealth, compared to gains of 0.39 and 0.54, respectively, for those with high education. Unexpectedly, wealth also has a greater role among those frailty free at baseline. A 70-year-old woman frailty free at baseline with high wealth lives 3.19 more net years and 4.13 more years frailty free than her counterpart with low wealth, while the same comparison for high versus low education indicates advantages of 2.00 total and 1.96 frailty free years. Relative change ratios also indicate more robust results for wealth versus education. In sum, there is evidence that inequality in duration of life in degrees of frailty is socially patterned.

8	The Relationship Between Insomnia Symptoms And Frailty In Community-Dwelling Older Persons: A Path Analysis	2021	8	10.1016/j.sleep.2021.05.039			8	84		237.0	Background: The relationship between sleep and frailty in older age is complex. Most previous studies focused on sleep duration, while insomnia, a common sleep problem in older adults, has not been adequately examined and the factors implicated in its association with frailty were under-explored. Methods: A community-based sample of 345 prefrail and frail older adults were recruited and completed the measures on insomnia symptoms (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and frailty status (FRAIL Scale). The relationship between insomnia symptoms and frailty, with potential mediators including physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and level of physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly), were tested in path analysis adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and sleep medications. Results: The prevalence of sleep-onset insomnia was higher in frail participants than their prefrail counterparts (48% vs. 34%, aOR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.09, 2.76; p = 0.02), but there was no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep-maintenance insomnia (61% vs. 54%). The association between sleep-onset insomnia and frailty was explained by reduced physical performance (standardized coefficient = 0.11; 95% BCa CI [0.002, 0.233]), but not depression and level of physical activity. Sleep-maintenance insomnia was not associated with frailty. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms are prevalent in frail and prefrail older adults. Sleep-onset insomnia is associated with poorer physical performance, which is further linked to a higher risk for frailty in older persons. The findings highlight the importance of timely assessing and managing insomnia among older adults at risk of frailty.

9	Efficiency And Effectiveness Of Geriatric Drug Infographics: A Randomized, Controlled Trial	2021	9	10.1111/jgs.17193			9	69	8	2355.0	The letter presents a study on the efficiency and effectiveness of geriatric drug infographics. Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), authors sought to develop geriatric drug infographics (GDIs) and evaluate their potential to improve clinician pharmacotherapy learning to mitigate ADEs in older, medically complex, and frail adults. This is the first study describing the development and evaluation of infographics to facilitate clinician learning about pharmacotherapy for older adults. Combining text and graphic depictions of information stems from dual-coding and cognitive load theories and improve knowledge retention.9,10 GDIs enhanced retrieval and retention of clinically relevant prescribing information compared to usual resources; however, the time required varied considerably, and may reflect the unfamiliarity with the novel infographics’ iconography, or the possibility of insufficient study power. With repeated use or explanatory aides (e.g., legend), the time required may decrease. Limitations include using clinical scenarios with multiple choice and very short answer questions rather than observing actual clinical practice due to feasibility. We were also unable to detect or prevent contamination between groups. Although we developed the GDIs and set the knowledge tests, they reflected real-world clinical questions, and were validated by external clinicians from multiple disciplines.

10	Can An Individualized Adherence Education Program Delivered By Nurses Improve Therapeutic Adherence In Elderly People With Acute Myocardial Infarction?: A Randomized Controlled Study	2021	10	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2021.103975			3	120			Background: The ageing of the population is leading to an increase in the number of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. These patients are at higher risk for complications and poor medication adherence, which in turn are associated with higher healthcare resource expenditures. Nursing programmes might help to improve adherence in these complex patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a nursing intervention on therapeutic adherence in elderly patients after myocardial infarction compared to a control group. Design: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Settings: Heart disease institute of a tertiary care hospital. Participants: Patients aged ≥75 years with myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods: A comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed during the admission in all patients (N=143). Patients were randomly allocated to a nursing intervention group (n=68) or a usual care group (n=75). In patients from the intervention group, a nursing intervention programme was performed 3 months after admission based on education support and patient monitoring to improve therapeutic adherence. The main outcome measured was 12-months therapeutic adherence, as defined by a combination of measurement tools (Morisky-Green and Hayness-Sacket scales, attendance at visits and withdrawal of medication from the pharmacy). Therapeutic adherence was assessed by nurses blinded to the assignment group. Results: The mean age was 82.2 years. The proportion of comorbidities was significant (diabetes mellitus 51/143 (35.7%), hypertension 110/143 (76.9%), prior stroke 22/143 (15.4%)). Likewise, the proportion of geriatric syndromes was noticeable (frailty 26/143 (18.2%), risk of malnutrition 38/143 (26.6%), cognitive impairment 28/143 (19.6%)). Most patients (92.3%) had a low educational level. A total of 119 patients achieved 12-month assessment adherence. Among these patients, the proportions of adherence were as follows: Morisky-Green test: 76/119 (63.9%), Haynes-Sackett test 99/119 (83.2%), medical visits compliance 95/119 (79.8%), and correct acquisition of drugs in the pharmacy 74/119 (62.2%). A total of 42/119 patients (35.3%) were adherent as defined by the combination of the 4 measures. Therapeutic adherence at 12 months was achieved in a significantly higher proportion of patients from the nursing intervention group (51.9% vs 21.5%, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: A significant proportion of elderly patients with myocardial infarction were non-adherent at 12 months. The proportion of adherent patients was highly variable according to the different tools used. A structured nursing intervention was independently associated with a higher adherence rate, as assessed by a multidimensional measurement, in this subset of complex high-risk elderly patients with myocardial infarction.

11	Linking Hospital And Residential Aged Care: A Nurse-Led Vascular-Geriatric Model Of Care.	2021	11	10.1080/10376178.2021.1991414	34623222		11	57	3-4	224	The interplay of frailty, multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the older person results in complex care needs. Monitoring and proactive management of chronic diseases in this context can be challenging. Early identification of deterioration reduces the risk of hospitalisation in older people, particularly in residential care, where the person can be particularly vulnerable. Deterioration of a resident often results in an expectation of in-hospital care, which especially where there are life-limiting conditions, may not align to the wishes of the person and their family. However, links between tertiary hospital services with the expertise to upskill and mentor those providing the more complex care to residents of aged care facilities need to be developed. Current models of care need to be adapted to incorporate the provision of specialist nursing within residential facilities to support higher-level care delivered in the person's familiar environment, improve the person and family experience, and reduce the costs and potential for iatrogenic problems associated with hospitalisation. Vascular dysfunction is common in aged care and results in impaired healing and complex wounds. We developed a Vascular and Geriatric (VaG) model of care to support specialist care for aged care residents with vascular dysfunction. The VaG model enhances existing links between hospital and residential care settings and builds workforce capacity in residential care facilities by the use of clinical consultation, peer learning and networking to increase the vascular skill set initially of the hospital outreach nurse and then modelled to residential care clinicians. This paper reports the development and implementation of the VaG model as part of the Aged Care Outreach Service.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	11	Contemporary Nurse	1	11	schasser,suzy	Schasser	Suzy
12	Impact Of Social Frailty On Relocation Of Older Adults.	2021	12	10.14283/jfa.2021.3	34105710		12	10	3	254	BACKGROUND: The relationship between frailty and variables such as housing are the least included in models of frailty and research on frailty or social frailty and relocation is negligible. The decision to relocate is complex and demanding for older adults with a loss of independence but little is known about what makes older adults relocate to congregated housing designated for older adults, let alone in combination with social frailty, and how they navigate this transition. OBJECTIVES: This mixed method descriptive study aims to understand the influence of social frailty for a population of French-speaking semi-independent older adults relocating to a housing continuum community. DESIGN: Semi-structured individual interviews including sociodemographic data and the PRISMA-7 Frailty Scale were conducted with recently relocated older adults. SETTING: A newly opened French-speaking housing continuum community in Eastern Canada that offers luxury apartments for independent older adults, two assisted living facilities for semi-independent older adults along with a long-term care facility. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine older adults with a mean age of 85 years, mostly female, married or widowed and highly educated. MEASUREMENTS: Content analysis of the transcribed recorded interviews and descriptive statistical analyses to examine relationships between the frailty PRISMA-7 scale, answers to additional questions and the sociodemographic data. RESULTS: There was not a significant difference in the scores for socialization before and after relocation nor between prior help and current help; however, there was a significant negative correlation between help and socialization before and after relocation. Three main themes included: imposed influences, push and pull factors and post relocation. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that several social factors contributed to relocation and that participants were experiencing social frailty. Participants were at the crossover point of being vulnerable to experiencing additional deficits which would potentially have led to higher frailty had they not relocated.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	12	The Journal Of Frailty & Aging		12	dupuis-blanchard,s	Dupuis-Blanchard	S
13	Recognizing And Responding To Deterioration In Care Homes: A Scoping Review Protocol.	2021	13	10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00413	33230017		13	19	2	447	OBJECTIVE: To identify the available published primary research and any relevant policies, guidelines, or protocols regarding how care home staff recognize and respond to an acutely deteriorating resident. INTRODUCTION: Older people living in care homes have complex health care needs. Chronic illnesses, comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and physical dependency can contribute to unpredictable changes in their health status that can lead to residents becoming unwell and acutely deteriorating. Exploring how care home staff recognize and respond to acutely deteriorating health among residents is important to understand whether opportunities exist to minimize these unpredictable changes in health. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will consider studies that feature the recognition and response to acute deterioration in care home residents. This review will consider qualitative and quantitative primary research. Non-indexed and gray literature such as policies, deterioration tools, and reports from health policy organizations will also be included. METHODS: The searches will be conducted using bibliographic databases, university repositories, and non-indexed and gray literature, such as reports by health care and health policy organizations. The studies will be independently selected from the inclusion criteria by two researchers based on their title and abstract. In case of disagreement, a third researcher will be consulted. An adapted version of the JBI data extraction form will be used to extrapolate data from included studies. The results will be presented in tabular form, accompanied by a narrative summary related to the objectives of the scoping review.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	13	Jbi Evidence Synthesis		13	hodge,sevim.y	Hodge	Sevim Y
14	Frailty Assessment Using Routine Clinical Data: An Integrative Review.	2022	14	10.1016/j.archger.2021.104612	34986459		14	99		104612	BACKGROUND: Frailty is a common but complex problem in older adults. Frailty assessment using routine clinical data has been suggested as a pragmatic approach based on electronic health records from primary care center or hospital settings. PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the tools and outcome variables used in the published studies on frailty assessment using routine clinical data. METHODS: An integrative literature review was conducted using the method of Whittemore and Knafl. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from January 2010 to October 2021. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies and thirteen frailty assessment tools were analyzed. The assessment items were generally biased toward frailty's risk factors rather than the mechanisms or phenotypes of frailty. Similar to using conventional tools, routine clinical data-based frailty was associated with adverse health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessment based on routine clinical data could efficiently evaluate frailty using electronic health records from primary care centers or hospitals. However, they need refinement to consider the risk factors, mechanisms, and frailty phenotypes.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	14	Archives Of Gerontology And Geriatrics		14	lim,arum	Lim	Arum
15	Relationship Between Multimorbidity And Disability In Elderly Patients With Coexisting Frailty Syndrome.	2022	15	10.3390/ijerph19063461	35329148		15	19	6	None	BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is a common problem worldwide. It carries the risk of reduced quality of life, disability, frequent hospitalizations, and death. The present study was designed to assess the relationships that exist between multimorbidity and disability in elderly patients. METHODS: The study included 100 patients and was conducted between October 2020 and January 2021. Inclusion criteria included age &gt;65 years, presence of a minimum of two comorbidities in the subject, and consent to participate in the study. Standardized survey instruments such as Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), Charlson Comorbidities Index (CCI), Assessment of Basic Activities of Daily Living-Katz Scale (ADL), and Assessment of Complex Activities of Daily Living-Lawton Scale (IADL) were used in the study. RESULTS: The majority of the subjects (92) had a frailty syndrome (TFI). A small group of respondents (8%) suffered from severe comorbidities (CCI). Among the subjects surveyed, 71% maintained full function in performing simple activities of daily living (ADL), while 29% demonstrated moderate disability on the scale. Full independence in performing complex activities of daily living (IADL) was present in 33% of the respondents, and 67% were partially independent. Independence in complex activities of daily living (IADL) was significantly higher in patients with fewer comorbidities. The severity of comorbidities (CCI) had a significant effect on the decrease in the level of independence (ADL and IADL). Independence in performing complex activities (IADL) was worse among older patients. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the number of comorbidities contributes to a decrease in the level of performance of complex activities of daily living. The severity of comorbidities significantly reduces the level of independence of the subjects in simple and complex activities of daily living. In patients with a higher level of independence in performing simple and complex activities, the co-occurrence of frailty syndrome was less severe. As the age of the subjects increases, the frequency in which they show moderate dependence on third parties in performing complex activities of daily living increases.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		15	jędrzejczyk,maria	Jędrzejczyk	Maria
16	Relatives' Experiences With Abuse And Neglect In Norwegian Nursing Homes. A Qualitative Study.	2021	16	10.1186/s12913-021-06713-9	34247595		16	21	1	684	BACKGROUND: Elder abuse in nursing homes (NH) is a widespread and complex problem. Residents' ability to share their experiences are impeded, due to a high degree of cognitive problems and frailty, and previous studies are thus mainly based on reports from staff. Therefore, we aimed to give voice to the residents by investigating their relatives' experiences with elder abuse in NH. METHODS: Qualitative individual interviews were conducted with 16 relatives of residents with experience of abuse and/or neglect in NH. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Relatives perceived neglect as most pervasive and staff-to-resident psychological abuse as a key problem. Physical abuse was mostly related to resident-to-resident aggression. Relatives perceived elder abuse in NH to be related to low competence among staff, low staffing, poor NH leadership, working cultures characterized by fear and loyalty to employer or co-workers, and a lack of individualized care for the residents. Furthermore, relatives themselves experienced maltreatment from NH, which caused them to suffer stress, anxiety and distrust. Relatives also expressed a need to compensate for lack of care. CONCLUSIONS: Relatives of NH residents who had experienced abuse reported that neglect of basic care and individual rights was predominant and viewed organizational explanations as most important. Relatives perceive themselves as collaborators in care and are emotionally attached to their family member. Therefore, if relatives experience resident abuse or neglect, it inflicts a feeling of being mistreated themselves, particularly if they are not listened to or their notice of abuse on the part of the resident is ignored or trivialized. Including relatives in a committed partnership with NH in care practices is not only a valuable path to reduce the risk of abuse, but it also leads to a more sustainable healthcare with high standards of quality and safety.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	16	Bmc Health Services Research		16	saga,susan	Saga	Susan
17	Association Between Preoperative Frailty And Outcomes Among Adults Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study.	2021	17	10.9778/cmajo.20200034	34285057		17	9	3	E777	BACKGROUND: The identification of frailty before complex and invasive procedures may have relevance for prognostic and recovery purposes, to optimally inform patients, caregivers and clinicians about perioperative risk and postoperative care needs. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of frailty and describe the associated clinical course and outcomes of patients referred for nonemergent cardiac surgery. METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients aged 50 years and older referred for nonemergent cardiac surgery in Alberta, Canada, from November 2011 to March 2014 were screened preoperatively for frailty, defined as a Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score of 5 or greater. Postoperatively, patients were followed by telephone to assess CFS score, health services use and vital status. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included health services use, hospital discharge disposition, 1-year health-related quality of life and all-cause 5-year mortality. RESULTS: The cohort (n = 529) had a mean age of 67 (standard deviation [SD] 9) years; 25.9% were female, and the prevalence of frailty was 9.6% (n = 51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.3%-12.5%). Frail patients were older (median age 75, interquartile range [IQR] 65-80 v. 67, IQR 60-73, yr; p < 0.001), were more likely to be female (51.0% v. 23.2%; p < 0.001), had a higher mean EuroSCORE II (8, SD 3 v. 5, SD 3; p < 0.001) and received combined coronary artery bypass grafting and valve procedures more frequently (29.4% v. 15.9%; p = 0.02) than nonfrail patients. Postoperatively, frail patients had a longer median duration of stay in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (median difference 2.2, 95% CI 1.60-2.79) and hospital (median difference 9.3, 95% CI 8.2-10.3). Hospital mortality was 9.8% among frail patients and 1.0% among nonfrail patients (adjusted hazard ratio 3.84, 95% CI 0.90-16.34). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative frailty was present in 10% of patients and was associated with a higher risk of morbidity and greater health services use. Preoperative frailty has important implications for the postoperative clinical course and resource utilization of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	17	Cmaj Open		17	montgomery,carmel	Montgomery	Carmel
18	Integrated Care For Older Adults During The Covid-19 Pandemic In Belgium: Lessons Learned The Hard Way.	2021	18	10.1111/opn.12366	33570259		18	16	3	e12366	The corona pandemic challenges countries worldwide in many different ways. Due to its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	18	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	18	deschacht,martha	Deschacht	Martha
19	The Impact Of Frailty Screening Of Older Adults With Multidisciplinary Assessment Of Those At Risk During Emergency Hospital Attendance On The Quality, Safety And Cost-Effectiveness Of Care (Solar): A Randomised Controlled Trial.	2021	19	10.1186/s13063-021-05525-w	34465368		19	22	1	581	BACKGROUND: Older people account for 25% of all Emergency Department (ED) admissions. This is expected to rise with an ageing demographic. Older people often present to the ED with complex medical needs in the setting of multiple comorbidities. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been shown to improve outcomes in an inpatient setting but clear evidence of benefit in the ED setting has not been established. It is not feasible to offer this resource-intensive assessment to all older adults in a timely fashion. Screening tools for frailty have been used to identify those at most risk for adverse outcomes following ED visit. The overall aim of this study is to examine the impact of CGA on the quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of care in an undifferentiated population of frail older people with medical complaints who present to the ED and Acute Medical Assessment Unit. METHODS: This will be a parallel 1:1 allocation randomised control trial. All patients who are ≥ 75 years will be screened for frailty using the Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) tool. Those with a score of ≥ 2 on the ISAR will be randomised. The treatment arm will undergo geriatric medicine team-led CGA in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit whereas the non-treatment arm will undergo usual patient care. A dedicated multidisciplinary team of a specialist geriatric medicine doctor, senior physiotherapist, specialist nurse, pharmacist, senior occupational therapist and senior medical social worker will carry out the assessment, as well as interventions that arise from that assessment. Primary outcomes will be the length of stay in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit. Secondary outcomes will include ED re-attendance, re-hospitalisation, functional decline, quality of life and mortality at 30 days and 180 days. These will be determined by telephone consultation and electronic records by a research nurse blinded to group allocation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Service Executive (HSE) Mid-Western Regional Hospital Research Ethics Committee (088/2020). Our lay dissemination strategy will be developed in collaboration with our Patient and Public Involvement stakeholder panel of older people at the Ageing Research Centre and we will present our findings in peer-reviewed journals and national and international conferences.

20	Being Your Best: Protocol For A Feasibility Study Of A Codesigned Approach To Reduce Symptoms Of Frailty In People Aged 65 Years Or More After Transition From Hospital.	2021	21	10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043223	33674372		21	11	3	e043223	INTRODUCTION: The population is ageing, with increasing health and supportive care needs. For older people, complex chronic health conditions and frailty can lead to a cascade of repeated hospitalisations and further decline. Existing solutions are fragmented and not person centred. The proposed Being Your Best programme integrates care across hospital and community settings to address symptoms of frailty. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre pragmatic mixed methods study aiming to recruit 80 community-dwelling patients aged ≥65 years recently discharged from hospital. Being Your Best is a codesigned 6-month programme that provides referral and linkage with existing services comprising four modules to prevent or mitigate symptoms of physical, nutritional, cognitive and social frailty. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of recruitment, acceptability of the intervention to participants and level of retention in the programme. Changes in frailty (Modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), functional ability (Barthel and Lawton), loneliness (University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-3 items) and nutrition (Malnutrition Screening Tool) will also be measured at 6 and 12 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from Monash Health Human Research Ethics Committee (RES-19-0000904L). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference and seminar presentations.

21	Blood Pressure Control And Complex Health Conditions In Older Adults: Impact Of Recent Hypertension Management Guidelines.	2021	22	10.1038/s41371-020-0334-4	32346124		22	35	3	280	The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017 guidelines for hypertension management lowered blood pressure (BP) thresholds to 130/80 mmHg to define hypertension while the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) 2018 guidelines retained 140/90 mmHg. Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65+ aged between 67 and 80 years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how to manage hypertension.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	22	Journal Of Human Hypertension		22	anker,daniela	Anker	Daniela
22	Factors Affecting Missed Nursing Care In Hospitalized Frail Older Adults In The Medical Wards: A Qualitative Study.	2021	23	10.1186/s12877-021-02524-z	34649518		23	21	1	555	"BACKGROUND: Frail older adults who are hospitalized, are more likely to experience missed nursing care (MNC) due to high care needs, communication problems, and complexity of nursing care. We conducted a qualitative study to examine the factors affecting MNC among hospitalized frail older adults in the medical units. METHODS: This qualitative study was carried using the conventional content analysis approach in three teaching hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 nurses through purposive and snowball sampling. The inclusion criteria for the nurses were: at least two years of clinical work experience on a medical ward, caring for frail older people in hospital and willingness to participate. Data were analyzed in accordance with the process described by Graneheim and Lundman. In addition, trustworthiness of the study was assessed using the criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba. RESULTS: In general, 20 interviews were conducted with nurses. A total of 1320 primary codes were extracted, which were classified into two main categories: MNC aggravating and moderating factors. Factors such as ""age-unfriendly structure,"" ""inefficient care,"" and ""frailty of older adults"" could increase the risk of MNC. In addition, factors such as ""support capabilities"" and ""ethical and legal requirements"" will moderate MNC. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized frail older adults are more at risk of MNC due to high care needs, communication problems, and nursing care complexity. Nursing managers can take practical steps to improve the quality of care by addressing the aggravating and moderating factors of MNC. In addition, nurses with a humanistic perspective who understand the multidimensional problems of frail older adults and pay attention to their weakness in expressing needs, can create a better experience for them in the hospital and improve patient safety."		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	23	Bmc Geriatrics		23	rezaei-shahsavarloo,zahra	Rezaei-Shahsavarloo	Zahra
23	Impact Of Organizational Context On Patient Outcomes In A Proactive Primary Care Program:A Longitudinal Observational Study.	2021	24	10.1186/s12877-021-02539-6	34666699		23	21	1	578	BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of health care interventions is co-determined by contextual factors. Unknown is the extent of this impact on patient outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore which characteristics of general practices are associated with patient outcomes in a proactive primary care program, the U-PROFIT 2.0. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was conducted from January 2016 till October 2017. Two questionnaires were send out, one to collect characteristics of general practices such as practice neighbourhood socio-economic status, general practice versus healthcare centre (involving multiple primary care professionals), and professional- frail older patient ratio per practice of general practitioners and practice nurses. Regarding delivering the program, the practice or district nurse who delivered the program, number of years since the start of the implementation, and choice of age threshold for frailty screening were collected. Patient outcomes collected by the second questionnaire and send to frail patients were daily functioning, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and general practice out-of-hours consultations. Linear and generalized linear mixed models were used. RESULTS: A total of 827 frail older people were included at baseline. Delivery of the program by a district nurse compared to a practice nurse was significantly associated with a decrease in daily functioning on patient-level (β = 2.19; P = < 0.001). Duration since implementation of 3 years compared to 9 years was significantly associated with less out-of-hours consultations to a general practice (OR 0.11; P = 0.001). Applying frailty screening from the age of 75 compared to those targeted from the age of 60 showed a significant increase in emergency visits (OR 5.26; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Three associations regarding the organizational context 1) the nurse who delivered the program, 2) the number of years the program was implemented and 3) the age threshold for defining a frail patient are significant and clinically relevant for frail patients that receive a proactive primary care program. In general, contextual factors need more attention when implementing complex primary care programs which can result in better balanced choices to enhance effective proactive care for older people living in the community.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	23	Bmc Geriatrics		24	smit,linda.c	Smit	Linda C
24	Evaluating An Integrated Care Pathway For Frail Elderly Patients In Norway Using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.	2021	25	10.1186/s12913-021-06805-6	34454494		16	21	1	884	"BACKGROUND: To provide value-based care for patients with multi-morbidity, innovative integrated care programmes and comprehensive evaluations of such programmes are required. In Norway, a new programme called ""Holistic Continuity of Patient Care"" (HCPC) addresses the issue of multi-morbidity by providing integrated care within learning networks for frail elderly patients who receive municipal home care services or a short-term stay in a nursing home. This study conducts a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate whether the HCPC programme performs better on a large set of outcomes corresponding to the 'triple aim' compared to usual care. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal survey data were collected at baseline and follow-up after 6-months. The assessment of HCPC was implemented by a novel MCDA framework. The relative weights of importance of the outcomes used in the MCDA were obtained from a discrete choice experiment among five different groups of stakeholders. The performance score was estimated using a quasi-experimental design and linear mixed methods. Performance scores were standardized and multiplied by their weights of importance to obtain the overall MCDA value by stakeholder group. RESULTS: At baseline in the HCPC and usual care groups, respectively, 120 and 89 patients responded, of whom 87 and 41 responded at follow-up. The average age at baseline was 80.0 years for HCPC and 83.6 for usual care. Matching reduced the standardized differences between the groups for patient background characteristics and outcome variables. The MCDA results indicated that HCPC was preferred to usual care irrespective of stakeholders. The better performance of HCPC was mostly driven by improvements in enjoyment of life, psychological well-being, and social relationships and participation. Results were consistent with sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation. CONCLUSION: Frail elderly with multi-morbidity represent complex health problems at large costs for society in terms of health- and social care. This study is a novel contribution to assessing and understanding HCPC programme performance respecting the multi-dimensionality of desired outcomes. Integrated care programmes like HCPC may improve well-being of patients, be cost-saving, and contribute to the pursuit of evidence based gradual reforms in the care of frail elderly."		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	16	Bmc Health Services Research		25	islam,m.kamrul	Islam	M Kamrul
25	Implications Of The Metabolic Control Of Diabetes In Patients With Frailty Syndrome.	2022	26	10.3390/ijerph191610327	36011979		15	19	16	None	INTRODUCTION: Frailty syndrome occurs more frequently in patients with diabetes than in the general population. The reasons for this more frequent occurrence and the interdependence of the two conditions are not well understood. To date, there is no fully effective method for the diagnosis, prevention, and monitoring of frailty syndrome. This study aimed to assess the degree of metabolic control of diabetes in patients with frailty syndrome and to determine the impact of frailty on the course of diabetes using a retrospective analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 103 individuals aged 60+ with diabetes were studied. The study population included 65 women (63.1%) and 38 men (36.9%). The mean age was 72.96 years (SD 7.55). The study was conducted in the practice of a general practitioner in Wielkopolska in 2018-2019. The research instrument was the authors' original medical history questionnaire. The questions of the questionnaire were related to age, education, and sociodemographic situation of the respondents, as well as their dietary habits, health status, and use of stimulants. Other instruments used were: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Lawton Scale (IADL-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), Katz Scale (ADL-Activities of Daily Living), Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS), and SHARE-FI scale (Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe). Anthropometric and biochemical tests were performed. RESULTS: In the study, frailty syndrome was diagnosed using the SHARE-FI scale in 26 individuals (25%): 32 (31.1%) were pre-frailty and 45 (43.7%) represented a non-frailty group. Statistical analysis revealed that elevated HbA1c levels were associated with a statistically significant risk of developing frailty syndrome (p = 0.048). In addition, the co-occurrence of diabetes and frailty syndrome was found to be a risk factor for loss of functional capacity or limitation in older adults (p = 0.00) and was associated with the risk of developing depression (p &lt; 0.001) and cognitive impairment (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Concerning metabolic control of diabetes, higher HbA1c levels in the elderly are a predictive factor for the development of frailty syndrome. No statistical significance was found for the other parameters of metabolic control in diabetes. People with frailty syndrome scored significantly higher on the Geriatric Depression Rating Scale and lower on the MMSE cognitive rating scale than the comparison group. This suggests that frailty is a predictive factor for depression and cognitive impairment. Patients with frailty and diabetes have significantly lower scores on the Basic Activities of Daily Living Rating Scale and the Complex Activities of Daily Living Rating Scale, which are associated with loss or limitation of functioning. Frailty syndrome is a predictive factor for loss of functional capacity in the elderly.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		26	muszalik,marta	Muszalik	Marta

Methods Papers on multimorbidity were retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science (from inception to August 11,2021).BICOMB and gCLUTO were used for bibliometric and clustering analysis,and CiteSpace was employed for analysis of authors and citations,and burst detection of keywords. Results The research on multimorbidity has been on the rise.Among the authors,Mercer SW published the most papers on this topic and Fortin M was the most cited author.Karolinska Institute topped the institutions in the number of published papers,and the paper published in Lancet by Barnett K in 2012 was the most cited.A total of 75 high-frequency keywords were extracted,on the basis of which seven research hotspots were summarized:epidemiology (including the prevalence and trend),medication (involving polypharmacy,medication compliance,etc.),medical expenditure (including cost and medical services),aging (such as elderly patients,frailty,and disability),psychology (involving mental health,social support,etc.),multimorbidity management (such as the treatment,primary health care,and integrated care),and comorbidity of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (involving obesity,stroke,diabetes,etc.). Conclusions Multimorbidity is concerned as a major health threat and public health problem worldwide.The management of multimorbidity is more complex than that of one disease,which thus faces more challenges.Therefore,researchers,health care providers,and policy-makers should underscore it.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	27	Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao.

27	Physical Fitness And Frailty Status Of Frail Older Adults In Long-Term Care Facilities After Acupunch Exercises: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.	2022	28	10.1016/j.exger.2022.111799	35390490		28	163		111799	BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome and serves as an indicator for functional degradation in older adults. Regular exercise intervention could reduce the level of frailty and improve general physical fitness. The aim of this study was to test the effects of the Vitality Acupunch (VA) exercise on the promotion of physical fitness and the improvement of frailty status among frail older adults in long-term care facilities. METHOD: This study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial adopted a pretest-posttest design. Using convenience sampling, 81 frail adults older than 65 years of age from 10 long-term care facilities participated in this study. The older adults were cluster-randomized by facility into an intervention group (5 long-term care facilities, n = 40) and a control group (5 long-term care facilities, n = 41). The intervention group engaged in the VA exercise 3 times a week, each lasting 40 min, for 24 weeks. The control group maintained regular activities of daily living. The outcome measures for physical fitness were assessed before study began (pretest), at the 12th week (posttest 1), and at the 24th week (posttest 2) in the study. RESULTS: After a 24-week intervention, the frail older adults who engaged in the VA exercise program showed significant improvements in handgrip strength, upper-limb muscle endurance, lung function, shoulder flexibility, forward flexion, shoulder joint flexion, and shoulder joint abduction (all p < 0.05) but not in lower-limb muscle endurance (p = 0.502) compared against their pretest data. The intervention group had significantly better physical fitness and positive changes in frailty status than the control group (all p < 0.001), except for the lower-limb muscle endurance (p = 0.557). CONCLUSION: Regular engagement in the VA exercise program for 24 weeks significantly improved the physical fitness and frailty status of frail older adults in long-term care facilities.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	28	Experimental Gerontology		28	chou,chia-pei	Chou	Chia-Pei
28	Nursing, Frailty, Functional Decline And Models Of Care In Relation To Older People Receiving Long-Term Care: A Scoping Review Protocol.	2022	29	10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061303	35998956		21	12	8	e061303	INTRODUCTION: Older people receiving healthcare in long-term care contexts (eg, home healthcare, sheltered housing and nursing home contexts) are especially vulnerable to developing frailty and functional decline. Considering the negative effects associated with these conditions and the possibility of preventing them from progressing, it is vital that nurses possess a broad knowledge base related to them. Particularly as prevention related to these conditions lies well within their remit. Such knowledge could guide the development of effective models of care, ensuring continuity and, hence, quality of care. Our objective will be to review published literature on existing models of care targeting frailty and/or functional decline and how these conditions are described by older people themselves, significant others and nurses in relation to long-term care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review will be conducted in accordance with Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. Recent methodological developments will be considered. PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO will be searched. Eligibility criteria will be peer-reviewed papers and written in English. All types of study designs will be eligible and included papers will be quality and ethically assessed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-Protocol checklist for protocols and the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews checklist were followed in this paper. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As the study outlined in this protocol is a scoping review, no ethics approval was needed for this protocol nor for the upcoming study. The findings will be published in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, the findings will guide a research project following the Medical Research Council's framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. Thus, supporting us in developing a model of care related to the detection and prevention of frailty and/or functional decline among older people in a long-term care context.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	21	Bmj Open		29	flyum,ida.røed	Flyum	Ida Røed
29	Clinical Decision Path For Identifying Recurrent Falls In Late Middle-Aged And Older Patients With Chronic Schizophrenia.	2021	30	10.1097/JNR.0000000000000444	34183567		30	29	5	e167	BACKGROUND: Falls are a major hazard for elderly patients with schizophrenia. As patients with schizophrenia may experience a more-accelerated rate of physical aging than the overall elderly population, the risk of falls may emerge during the late middle-age period in this population. Furthermore, the risk of falls is affected by multiple, interrelated risk factors. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to capture the complexity of the risk of falls in patients with schizophrenia. A cross-sectional approach was used to apply classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to generate a clinical decision path to identify the risk factors of recurrent falls in late middle-aged and older patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-one patients aged 55 years or older were recruited from psychiatric halfway houses for assessment. Frailty, physical functional performance, depressive severity, cognitive function, and level of fatigue were measured, respectively, using the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Frailty Index, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), and Chinese version of the Fatigue Severity Scale. The variables revealed by descriptive statistics to be statistically significant were further analyzed using CART analysis. RESULTS: The overall proportion of recurrent fallers in this study was 19.2%. CART analysis revealed eight end groups and identified four predictors: frailty, physical functional performance, cognitive function, and sex. The most prominent condition for recurrent fallers was frailty, present in 57.1% of the frail participants. In the nonfrail group (both prefrail and robust), participants with an SPPB score of less than 10 had a 29.7% chance of being a recurrent faller versus 13.6% for those with an SPPB score of 10 or more. Furthermore, an SPMSQ score of 7 was the next-best split among participants without frailty, with an SPPB score of 10 or more. Finally, among participants without frailty and with an SPPB score of 10 or more and an SPMSQ score of more than 7, the proportion of recurrent fallers was higher in women than men. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that assessing frailty status may be an effective, first-step approach to identifying schizophrenic patients at an increased risk of recurrent falls. Among patients with prefrailty or robust status, an SPPB score cutoff of 10, an SPMSQ score cutoff of 7, and being female may be used sequentially to identify individuals at a heightened risk of recurrent falls.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	30	The Journal Of Nursing Research: Jnr	1	30	wang,mei-yeh	Wang	Mei-Yeh
30	Optimal Staffing Models To Care For Frail Older Adults In Primary Care And Geriatrics Practices In The Us.	2021	31	10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00401	34495726		31	40	9	1368	Different staffing configurations in primary and geriatric care practices could have implications for how best to deliver services that are essential for a growing population of older adults. Using data from a 2018 survey of physicians (MDs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) working in primary and geriatric care, we assessed whether different configurations were associated with better or worse performance on a number of standard process measures indicative of comprehensive, high-quality primary care. Practices with a large concentration of MDs had the highest estimated labor costs. Practices high in NPs and physician assistants (PAs) were most common in states that grant full scope of practice to NPs. The high-NP/PA configuration was associated with a 17-percentage-point greater probability of facilitating patient visits and a 26-percentage-point greater probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services compared with the high-MD model. Team-based configurations had a 27.7-percentage-point greater probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services. The complex needs of older adults may be best served by team-based practices with a broad provider mix that can provide a range of services in the office and the community.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	31	Health Affairs (Project Hope)		31	auerbach,david.i	Auerbach	David I
31	Deciding About The Use Of A Personal Safety Alerting Device-The Need For A Legitimation Process: A Qualitative Study.	2021	32	10.1111/jan.14566	33048381		32	77	1	331	"AIMS: To explore reasons, thoughts, motives, and influencing factors regarding the use or non-use of Personal Safety Alerting Devices (PSADs) in the daily lives of community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was used. METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. RESULTS: The participants described the use or non-use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a ""legitimation process"". This process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at which to start using it. During this process, each person weighs her or his ""ageing self"" and ""perception of technology"" then decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use. ""Critical events"" initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance. CONCLUSION: The legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life. Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex decision-making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the device. IMPACT: Older persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their independence."		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	32	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	32	thilo,friederike.j.s	Thilo	Friederike J S
32	Exploring The Benefits Of Structured Medication Reviews For Frail Older Patients In Advanced Clinical Practice.	2021	33	10.12968/bjon.2021.30.15.894	34379467		33	30	15	894	Frailty in old age has become synonymous with medication use. As people age, the risk of disease burden increases. Older age is often linked with complex healthcare needs, with a rise in the number of comorbidities. This often results in the need to use multiple medications. Frailty is a global concern and requires early interventions to help people maintain their health as they age. Advanced clinical practitioners have an important role in supporting frail people living in the community. This article will review the literature and explore strategies that advanced practitioners can implement to optimise wellbeing and reduce medicines-related harm for this vulnerable population.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	33	British Journal Of Nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)	1	33	duffy,sharron	Duffy	Sharron
33	Implementation Fidelity Of The Systems For Person-Centered Elder Care (Spec): A Process Evaluation Study.	2021	34	10.1186/s13012-021-01113-3	33980251		34	16	1	52	BACKGROUND: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex intervention, was conducted to examine its effectiveness as a technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for frail older persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where formal long-term care has recently been introduced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation fidelity of the SPEC intervention and to identify moderating factors that influence the implementation fidelity. METHODS: This study was a process evaluation based on an evidence-based framework for implementation fidelity using a mixed-methods design. Quantitative data from consultant logbooks, NH documentations, an information and communications technology (ICT) system, and a standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to December 2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics. Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary teams from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a semi-structured questionnaire and the focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and adherence to the SPEC program was strong in all aspects, such as content, coverage, frequency, and duration. Of the participating on-site coordinators, 60% reported that the SPEC model positively impacted needs assessment and the reporting system for resident care. The important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies, assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good implementation fidelity. The key factors of good implementation fidelity were tailored delivery of evidence-based interventions over process evaluation work, facilitating strategies, and ICT support. Larger implementation studies with a more user-friendly ICT system are recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN11972147 .

34	Changes In Home Care Clients' Characteristics And Home Care In Five European Countries From 2001 To 2014: Comparison Based On Interrai - Home Care Data.	2021	35	10.1186/s12913-021-07197-3	34715850		16	21	1	1177	BACKGROUND: Policymakers advocate extended residence in private homes as people age, rather than relocation to long-term care facilities. Consequently, it is expected that older people living in their own homes will be frailer and have more complex health problems over time. Therefore, community care for aging people is becoming increasingly important to facilitate prevention of decline in physical and cognitive abilities and unnecessary hospital admission and transfer to a nursing home. The aim of this study was to examine changes in the characteristic of home care clients and home care provided in five European countries between 2001 and 2014 and to explore whether home care clients who are most in need of care receive the care required. METHODS: This descriptive study used data from two European research projects, Aged in Home Care (AdHOC; 2001-2002) and Identifying best practices for care-dependent elderly by Benchmarking Costs and outcomes of Community Care (IBenC; 2014-2016). In both projects, the InterRAI-Home Care assessment tool was used to assess a random sample of home care clients 65 years and older in five European countries. These data facilitate a comparison of physical and cognitive health and the provided home care between countries and study periods. RESULTS: In most participating countries, both cognitive (measured on the Cognitive Performance Scale) and functional ability (measured on the Activities of Daily Living Hierarchy scale) of home care clients deteriorated over a 10-year period. Home care provided increased between the studies. Home care clients who scored high on the physical and cognitive scales also received home care for a significantly higher duration than those who scored low. CONCLUSION: Older people in several European countries remain living in their own homes despite deteriorating physical and cognitive skills. Home care services to this group have increased. This indicates that the government policy of long-term residence at own home among older people, even in increased frailty, has been realised.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	16	Bmc Health Services Research		35	kristinsdottir,i.v	Kristinsdottir	I V
35	Factors Related To Complex Care Needs Of Older Adults In Community-Based Integrated Care Centers In Japan: A Cross-Sectional Study.	2021	36	10.1111/jjns.12440	34196480		36	18	4	e12440	"AIM: This study aimed to identify the factors related to complex care needs of older adults in community-based integrated care centers. METHODS: We sent 936 self-reported questionnaires to community-based integrated care center directors in the Kinki region of Japan. These questionnaires included questions not only about the directors' demographic data, but also regarding the sociodemographic, psychosocial, and family-related dimensions of the older adults in the community centers. The directors divided their cases into two categories: ""Complex cases"" and ""Straightforward cases."" We compared the intergroup differences and examined the factors related to complex care needs in older adults. RESULTS: A total of 232 directors responded. Complex cases were significantly associated with younger age, poor health conditions, and having a family member who needs care, as compared to straightforward cases where these associations were not present. Logistic regression showed that in older adults, factors of refusing support or social services, social isolation, and trouble with neighbors were associated with their complexities. Additionally, family members with a high likelihood of refusing social services, older adults without a key family member, and difficulties in forming their consensus regarding care were associated with older adults' complexities. CONCLUSION: Older adults with complex care needs could have the risk of self-neglect, and their families faced difficulties in supporting them as family members. Healthcare professions should carefully assess these factors and develop needs-oriented services for them without their family support as an upstream intervention."		2022-10-04 23:31:23	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	36	Japan Journal Of Nursing Science: Jjns	1	36	yoshioka-maeda,kyoko	Yoshioka-Maeda	Kyoko
36	Transitional Care From Skilled Nursing Facilities To Home: Study Protocol For A Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial.	2021	37	10.1186/s13063-021-05068-0	33546737		19	22	1	120	BACKGROUND: Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. METHODS: The study will test the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden and distress. DISCUSSION: Study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03810534 .

37	Development Of A Theory-Based Intervention To Increase Cognitively Able Frail Elders' Engagement With Advance Care Planning Using The Behaviour Change Wheel.	2021	38	10.1186/s12913-021-06548-4	34284759		16	21	1	712	BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) conversations support people to think about, discuss and document their beliefs, values and preferences regarding future care. This process means that should the person loose capacity in the future, care can be provided, consistent with their personal values and beliefs. The ACP process is particularly relevant for older people living with frailty (frail elders) as they are vulnerable to sudden deterioration. However, ACP is rarely undertaken by frail elders. The aim of this study was to develop an intervention to increase multidisciplinary health and social care professionals' (H&SCPs) engagement of cognitively able, domestic-dwelling frail elders with ACP. METHODS: Intervention development was guided by the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Multiple methods were used to understand ACP barriers and enablers: a systematic integrative review, a survey (n = 73 H&SCPs), and semi-structured interviews (n = 10 frail elders, n = 8 family members). A conceptual model, developed from the integrative review, underpinned data collection for the survey and interviews. Synthesis of this data, including patient and public involvement, was then used to identify H&SCPs behaviours that needed to change for ACP to be implemented and decide content and implementation for the intervention. RESULTS: Following the Behaviour Change Wheel system, and based on the findings of the review, survey and interviews, the prototype intervention, Conversations on Living and Dying (CLaD), was developed. The CLaD prototype consisted of one 3.5-hour educational skills session for H&SCPs supported by a toolkit. Content focussed on the relevance of ACP for frail elders, experience of ACP by frail elders, and strategies H&SCPs could adopt to encourage frail elders' engagement with ACP. Strategies include recognising the importance of relationships and living well now, preparing frail elders for ACP conversations and starting ACP early. Participants who took part in initial prototype refinement reported that the intervention helped them think differently about ACP and encouraged them to engage with frail elders. CONCLUSIONS: The use of behavioural theory enabled the development of CLaD, an evidence-based, theory-driven, person-centred intervention to support ACP engagement with frail elders. While feasibility testing is required, initial prototype refinement demonstrated that H&SCPs found the intervention to be acceptable, engaging, and clinically valuable in their practice with frail elders and their families.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	16	Bmc Health Services Research		38	combes,s	Combes	S
38	Sexual Harassment Or Disinhibition? Residential Care Staff Responses To Older Adults' Unwanted Behaviours.	2022	39	10.1111/opn.12433	34708549		18	17	3	e12433	BACKGROUND: The ethical complexity of residential care is especially apparent for staff responding to residents' inappropriate sexual expression, particularly when directed towards care workers as these residents are typically frail, often cognitively impaired, and require ongoing care. OBJECTIVES: To explore staff accounts of how they made meaning of and responded to residents' unwanted sexual behaviours directed towards staff. This exploration includes whether staff appeared to accept harassment as a workplace hazard to be managed, or an unacceptable workplace violation, or something else. METHODS: These qualitative data are drawn from a national two-arm mixed method study in Aotearoa New Zealand undertaken in 35 residential care facilities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 77 staff, residents and family members. Interpretive description was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Staff had numerous ways they used to respond to behaviours: (1) minimisation, deflection and de-escalation, where staff used strategies to minimise behaviours without requiring any accountability from residents; (2) holding residents accountable, where staff to some degree addressed the behaviour directly with residents; (3) blurred boundaries and complexities in intimate long-term care, where staff noted that in a context where touch is common-place, cognitive function was diminished and relationships were long-term, boundaries were easily breached; (4) dehumanising and infantilising residents' behaviours, where staff appeared to assert control through diminishing the residents' identity as an older person. It was evident that staff had developed considerable practice wisdom focused on preserving the care relationship although few referred to policy and education guiding practice. CONCLUSIONS: Staff appeared to be navigating a complex ethical terrain with thoughtfulness and skill. Care workers seemed reluctant to label resident behaviour as sexual harassment, and the term may not fit for staff where they perceive residents are frail and cognitively impaired. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Policy, education and clinical leadership are recommended to augment practice wisdom and ensure staff and resident safety and dignity and to determine how best to intervene with residents' unwanted sexual behaviours.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	18	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	39	cook,catherine.m	Cook	Catherine M
39	Evaluation Of An Interprofessional Care Coordination Model: Benefits To Health Professions Students And The Community Served.	2021	40	10.1016/j.outlook.2020.09.007	33220911		40	69	3	322	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: An innovative care coordination program was developed to enhance wellness among low-income older adults living in subsidized apartment buildings and to provide rich interprofessional education experiences for health professions students. METHODS: Program effectiveness for the residents was measured through an evaluation of participation, services used, and healthcare utilization. Educational effectiveness was measured through a change in health concepts and perceptions of interprofessional practice. FINDINGS: Health care utilization among participating residents showed an 8.6% reduction in emergency department visits and 9.8% reduction in hospital admissions. Students demonstrated improved knowledge in motivational interviewing (p = .02); diabetes (p = .02); hypertension (p≤.01); and frailty (p≤.01). Changes in students perception of interprofessional practice were significant in two areas; Teamwork and Collaboration (p≥.00); and Person Centeredness (p = .00). DISCUSSION: This care coordination model may be an effective approach to reduce care resource utilization among medically complex lower income older adults and provides a rich interprofessional learning experience for students.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	40	Nursing Outlook	1	40	parsons,pamela.l	Parsons	Pamela L
40	Variability In Healthcare Expenditure According To The Stratification Of Adjusted Morbidity Groups In The Canary Islands (Spain).	2022	41	10.3390/ijerph19074219	35409900		15	19	7	None	Morbidity is the main item in the distribution of expenditure on healthcare services. The Adjusted Morbidity Group (AMG) measures comorbidity and complexity and classifies the patient into mutually exclusive clinical categories. The aim of this study is to analyse the variability of healthcare expenditure on users with similar scores classified by the AMG. Observational analytical and retrospective study. Population: 1,691,075 subjects, from Canary Islands (Spain), aged over 15 years with data from health cards, clinical history, Basic Minimum Specialised Healthcare Data Set, AMG, hospital agreements information system and Electronic Prescriptions. A descriptive, bivariant (ANOVA coefficient η(2)) and multivariant analysis was conducted. There is a correlation between the costs and the weight of AMG (rho = 0.678) and the prescribed active ingredients (rho = 0.689), which is smaller with age and does not exist with the other variables. As for the influence of the AMG morbidity group on the total costs of the patient, the coefficient η(2) (0.09) obtains a median effect in terms of the variability of expenditure, hence there is intra- and inter-group variability in the cost. In a first model created with all the variables and the cost, an explanatory power of 36.43% (R(2) = 0.3643) was obtained; a second model that uses solely active ingredients, AMG weight, being female and a pensioner obtained an explanatory power of 36.4%. There is room for improvement in terms of predicting the expenditure.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		41	company-sancho,maria.consuelo	Company-Sancho	Maria Consuelo
41	Sex Disparities In The Prevalence Of Physical Function Disabilities: A Population-Based Study In A Low-Income Community.	2021	43	10.1186/s12877-021-02362-z	34246238		23	21	1	419	BACKGROUND: Functional disability continues to be a significant public health problem that increases older adults' vulnerability to experience a diminished quality of life, loss of independence, higher healthcare costs and health services utilization, and increased risks of mortality. Thus, we aimed to study the prevalence of functional disabilities by sex according to the types of daily living activities, controlling for specific sociodemographic variables among older Hispanics from low-income communities. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional epidemiological research design, considering a complex sampling design of households to interview adults ≥65 years living in low-income communities in Puerto Rico. Functional disability was measured by the PROMIS® Physical Function Short Form-20 T-score. The selected community was reported to have 5980 adult residents ≥65 years, according to the USA Census. The prevalence of functional disability was estimated using the logistic regression model, weighting by the effect of the sampling. Our estimated prevalence was compared between sexes using the prevalence ratio (PR), which was estimated with logistic regression models, controlling for age, income, number of chronic conditions, high and low impact of chronic conditions in functional disabilities, marital status, and sampling design. RESULTS: We recruited 211 older Hispanics from a randomly selected sample. Their mean age was 74.4 ± 7.1 years, with female predominance (57.3%). The overall estimated prevalence of physical function disability using T-score among females was 2.70 (95% CI: 1.4, 5.1) times the estimated prevalence of physical function disability among males. Women were more likely to report functional disabilities in instrumental activities of daily living, self-care activities, and functional mobility compared to males. However, sex differences were largely explained by the presence of musculoskeletal conditions of high impact in functional disability. CONCLUSIONS: The females in our study bear the greater burden of physical function disability in their adult age. Health policies, as well as future studies, should be targeted at reducing the burden of physical function disabilities in different types of daily activities through gender-sensitive disability self-management programs.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	23	Bmc Geriatrics		43	orellano-colón,elsa.m	Orellano-Colón	Elsa M
42	Interdisciplinary Staff Perceptions Of Advance Care Planning In Long-Term Care Homes: A Qualitative Study.	2022	44	10.1186/s12904-022-01014-2	35836164		44	21	1	127	BACKGROUND: Residents living in long-term care homes (LTCH) have complex care needs, multiple chronic conditions, increasing frailty and cognitive impairment. A palliative approach that incorporates advance care planning (ACP) should be integrated with chronic disease management, yet it is not a norm in most LTCHs. Despite its growing need, there remains a lack of staff engagement in the ACP process. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of interdisciplinary staff related to the practice of ACP in LTCHs. METHODS: This study is part of a larger Canadian project, iCAN ACP, that aims to increase uptake, and access to ACP for older Canadians living with frailty. An exploratory qualitative design using an interpretive descriptive approach was employed utilizing focus groups and semi-structured interviews with staff from four LTCHs in Ontario, Canada. FINDINGS: There were 98 participants, including nurses (n = 36), physicians (n = 4), personal support workers (n = 34), support staff (n = 23), and a public guardian (n = 1). Three common themes and nine subthemes were derived: a) ongoing nature of ACP; b) complexities around ACP conversations; and c) aspirations for ACP becoming a standard of care in LTCHs. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study provide important contributions to our understanding of the complexities surrounding ACP implementation as a standard of practice in LTCHs. One of the critical findings relates to a lack of ACP conversations prior to admission in the LTCHs, by which time many residents may have already lost cognitive abilities to engage in these discussions. The hierarchical nature of LTCH staffing also serves as a barrier to the interdisciplinary collaboration required for a successful implementation of ACP initiatives. Participants within our study expressed support for ACP communication and the need for open lines of formal and informal interdisciplinary communication. There is a need for revitalizing care in LTCHs through interdisciplinary care practices, clarification of role descriptions, optimized staffing, capacity building of each category of staff and commitment from the LTCH leadership for such care. CONCLUSION: The findings build on a growing body of research illustrating the need to improve staff engagement in ACP communication in LTCHs.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	44	Bmc Palliative Care		44	vellani,shirin	Vellani	Shirin
43	From Clinical Reasoning To Ehealth Interventions; A Study On How Nurses Asses Care And Ehealth In Home Care.	2021	45	10.1016/j.nepr.2020.102925	33285403		45	50		102925	The assessment of care in homecare today is complex. Nurses have to decide on care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	45	Nurse Education In Practice	1	45	der cingel,margreet.van	der Cingel	Margreet van
44	Effectiveness Of A Complex Regional Advance Care Planning Intervention To Improve Care Consistency With Care Preferences: Study Protocol For A Multi-Center, Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial Focusing On Nursing Home Residents (Bevor Trial).	2022	46	10.1186/s13063-022-06576-3	36096948		19	23	1	770	BACKGROUND: According to recent legislation, facilitated advance care planning (ACP) for nursing home (NH) residents is covered by German sickness funds. However, the effects of ACP on patient-relevant outcomes have not been studied in Germany yet. This study investigates whether implementing a complex regional ACP intervention improves care consistency with care preferences in NH residents. METHODS: This is a parallel-group cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) with 48 NHs (≈ 3840 resident beds) between 09/2019 and 02/2023. The intervention group will receive a complex, regional ACP intervention aiming at sustainable systems redesign at all levels (individual, institutional, regional). The intervention comprises comprehensive training of ACP facilitators, implementation of reliable ACP processes, organizational development in the NH and other relevant institutions of the regional healthcare system, and education of health professionals caring for the residents. Control group NHs will deliver care as usual. Primary outcome is the hospitalization rate during the 12-months observation period. Secondary outcomes include the rate of residents whose preferences were known and honored in potentially life-threatening events, hospital days, index treatments like resuscitation and artificial ventilation, advance directives, quality of life, psychological burden on bereaved families, and costs of care. The NHs will provide anonymous, aggregated data of all their residents on the primary outcome and several secondary outcomes (data collection 1). For residents who have given informed consent, we will evaluate care consistency with care preferences and further secondary outcomes, based on chart reviews and short interviews with residents, surrogates, and carers (data collection 2). Process evaluation will aim to explain barriers and facilitators, economic evaluation the cost implications. DISCUSSION: This study has the potential for high-quality evidence on the effects of a complex regional ACP intervention on NH residents, their families and surrogates, NH staff, and health care utilization in Germany. It is the first cRCT investigating a comprehensive regional ACP intervention that aims at improving patient-relevant clinical outcomes, addressing and educating multiple institutions and health care providers, besides qualification of ACP facilitators. Thereby, it can generate evidence on the potential of ACP to effectively promote patient-centered care in the vulnerable population of frail and often chronically ill elderly.

45	Key Components For The Delivery Of Palliative And End-Of-Life Care In Care Homes In Hong Kong: A Modified Delphi Study.	2022	47	10.3390/ijerph19020667	35055488		15	19	2	None	Integrating the palliative care approach into care home service to address the complex care needs of older adults with frailty or advanced diseases has been increasingly recognized. However, such a service is underdeveloped in Hong Kong owing to socio-cultural and legal concerns. We adopted a modified Delphi study design to identify the key components for the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care in care home settings for the local context. It was an iterative staged method to assimilate views of experts in aged care, palliative care, and care home management. A multidisciplinary expert panel of 18 members consented to participate in the study. They rated their level of agreement with 61 candidate statements identified through a scoping review in two rounds of anonymous surveys. The steering group revised the statements in light of the survey findings. Eventually, the finalized list included 28 key statements concerning structure and process of care in seven domains, namely policy and infrastructure, education, assessment, symptom management, communication, care for dying patients, and family support. The findings of this study underscored concerns regarding the feasibility of statements devised at different levels of palliative care development. This list would be instrumental for regions where the development of palliative and end-of-life care services in care home setting is at an initial stage.		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		47	chan,helen.yue-lai	Chan	Helen Yue-Lai
46	Balancing Standardisation And Individualisation In Transitional Care Pathways: A Meta-Ethnography Of The Perspectives Of Older Patients, Informal Caregivers And Healthcare Professionals.	2022	48	10.1186/s12913-022-07823-8	35365140		16	22	1	430	"BACKGROUND: Transitional care implies the transfer of patients within or across care settings in a seamless and safe way. For frail, older patients with complex health issues, high-quality transitions are especially important as these patients typically move more frequently within healthcare settings, requiring treatment from different providers. As transitions of care for frail people are considered risky, securing the quality and safety of these transitions is of great international interest. Nevertheless, despite efforts to improve quality in transitional care, research indicates that there is a lack of clear guidance to deal with practical challenges that may arise. The aim of this article is to synthesise older patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals' experiences of challenges to achieving high-quality transitional care. METHODS: We used the seven-step method for meta-ethnography originally developed by Noblit and Hare. In four different but connected qualitative projects, the authors investigated the challenges to transitional care for older people in the Norwegian healthcare system from the perspectives of older patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals. In this paper, we highlight and discuss the cruciality of these challenging issues by synthesising the results from twelve articles. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four themes: i) balancing person-centred versus efficient care, ii) balancing everyday patient life versus the treatment of illness, iii) balancing user choice versus ""What Matters to You"", and iv) balancing relational versus practical care. These expressed challenges represent tensions at the system, organisation and individual levels based on partial competing assumptions on person-centred-care-inspired individualisation endeavours and standardisation requirements in transitional care. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for a clearer understanding of the tension between standardisation and individualisation in transitional care pathways for older patients to ensure better healthcare quality for patients and more realistic working environments for healthcare professionals. Incorporating a certain professional flexibility within the wider boundary of standardisation may give healthcare professionals room for negotiation to meet patients' individual needs, while at the same time ensuring patient flow, equity and evidence-based practice."		2022-10-04 23:31:23	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1	16	Bmc Health Services Research		48	kvæl,linda.aimée.hartford	Kvæl	Linda Aimée Hartford
47	Adult Day Services, Health Equity For Older Adults With Complex Needs, And The Covid-19 Pandemic.	2022	49	10.2105/ajph.2022.306968			49	112	10	1421	"Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 have unduly affected older adults from racial and ethnic minority groups. In this article, we highlight the experiences and vulnerabilities of diverse older adults with complex health and social needs when their access to vital, but overlooked, community-based adult day service centers (ADSCs) was abruptly cut off during a pandemic. Pandemic-related ADSC closures left vulnerable older adults and their care partners without essential daily support and services, such as health monitoring and socialization. However, the magnitude of the impact of ADSC closures on well-being, particularly among members of racial/ethnic minority groups, has yet to be measured with any form of ""big data"" because large-scale, nationally representative data sets consisting of participant-level information and outcomes associated with ADSC participation do not yet exist. Unmet needs of older adults resulting from pandemic-related ADSC closures are underrecognized because of a lack of systematic data collection, undermining efforts to achieve health equity. We call on ADSCs to link rigorous collection of racial and ethnic data to quality measures of access to equitable ""age-friendly"" care as a means of better supporting diverse community-dwelling older adults beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

48	Actions Taken To Safeguard The Intended Health Care Chain Of Older People With Multiple Diagnoses - A Critical Incident Study.	2022	50	10.1186/s12912-022-01039-1			50	21	1	1	Background: Older people with multiple diagnoses often have problems coping with their daily lives at home because of lack of coordination between various parts of the healthcare chain during the transit from hospital care to the home. To provide good care to those persons who have the most complex needs, regions and municipalities must work together. It is of importance to develop further empirical knowledge in relation to older persons with multiple diagnoses to illuminate possible obstacles to person-centred care during the transition between healthcare institutions and the persons livelihood. The aim of the present study was to describe nurses' experienced critical incidents in different parts of the intended healthcare chain of older people with multiple diagnoses. Methods: The sample consisted of 18 RNs in different parts of the healthcare system involved in the care of older people with multiple diagnoses. Data were collected by semi structured interviews and analysed according to Critical Incident Technique (CIT). A total of 169 critical incidents were identified describing experiences in recently experienced situations. Results: The result showed that organizational restrictions in providing care and limitations in collaboration were the main areas of experienced critical incidents. Actions took place due to the lack of preventive actions for care, difficulties in upholding patients' legal rights to participation in care, deficiencies in cooperation between organizations as well as ambiguous responsibilities and roles. The RNs experienced critical incidents that required moral actions to ensure continued person-centred nursing and provide evidence-based care. Both types of critical incidents required sole responsibility from the nurse. The RNs acted due to ethics, 'walking the extra mile', searching for person-centred information, and finding out own knowledge barriers. Conclusions: In conclusion and based on this critical incident study, home-based healthcare of older people with multiple diagnoses requires a nurse that is prepared to take personal and moral responsibility to ensure person-centred home-based healthcare. Furthermore, the development of in-between adjustments of organizations to secure cooperation, and transference of person-centred knowledge is needed.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=159238809&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	50	BMC Nursing	1	50	gustafsson,lena-karin	gustafsson	lena-karin
49	Barriers To And Facilitators Of Ethical Encounters At The End Of Life In A Nursing Home: An Ethnographic Study.	2022	51	10.1186/s12904-022-01024-0			51	21	1	1	Background: Among a growing population of older persons, many affected by multiple diseases and complex needs, are cared for in nursing homes. Previous studies of nursing homes have highlighted the importance of personalised palliative care. Nevertheless, we know little about whether everyday care practice involving assistant nurses and frail older persons accomplishes ethical encounters, especially in assisted bodily care. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand and conceptualize the encounter between residents and assistant nurses in bodily care-situations at the end of life in a nursing home. Methods: Focused ethnographic design was used. Residents and assistant nurses from one nursing home in an urban Swedish area participated in this study. Data were collected for 6 months and consisted of 170 h of fieldwork, including participant observation and interviews. Observations and digitally recorded interviews were analysed thematically. Five public community stakeholders contributed to the analysis by discussing preliminary results and clinical implications in a focus group. Results: Four themes, each encompassing both barriers to and facilitators of ethical encounters in assisted bodily care, were identified: Coping with the impact of workplace demands; Interacting in dialogue and communication; Experiencing involvement in the provision of assisted bodily care; and Adapting to good care and comfort. Conclusions: The findings suggest that accomplishing ethical encounters in assisted bodily care practice in a nursing home context has many barriers that are related to communication, relationships, and quality of care. Barriers included lack of resources, ineffective communication, and work values, which hinder ethical encounters. Nevertheless, moral sensitivity, genuine interest in resident engagement, and collaborative practices facilitated ethical encounters and are thus central to person-centred care. Uniquely, assistant nurses must be aware of their responsibility for performing their tasks in response to residents' vulnerability. We therefore suggest that moral deliberation over issues of communication, compassion, decision-making, and behavior, with particular consideration for the care relationship. To further improve the quality of care, organisations must provide resources for the building of relationships, as well as time for assistant nurses to recover after long shifts. Additional research is warranted, including implementation of ethically grounded palliative care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=158137552&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	51	BMC Palliative Care		51	holmberg,bodil	holmberg	bodil
50	Assessing Multidimensional Complexity In Home Care: Congruencies And Discrepancies Between Patients And Nurses.	2022	52	10.1186/s12912-022-00942-x			50	21	1	1	Background: Person-centered care allows for the inclusion of the totality of a person's needs and preferences, beyond just the clinical or medical aspect. This approach requires the development of tools to allow for the integration of the patient in his/her healthcare. Based on a 30-item tool developed for nurses to evaluate the complexity of home care situations (COMID), this study proposed a version for the patients (i.e. COMID-P). Both instruments were used, independently by nurses and patients, to rate the complexity of individual situations, in order to compare ratings. Methods: The COMID-P and the COMID were completed during the fraXity study at the patients' homes, independently by patients (aged 65 and over) and nurses. Item-level and scale-level analyses were performed using, Kappa and McNemar tests, and intra-class correlation (ICC). Results: A total of 159 pairs of COMID and COMID-P ratings were retained for analyses. Results demonstrated a high degree of patient/nurse agreement for 12/30 items, a moderate agreement for 10/30 items, and a low degree of agreement for 7/30 items. The intra-class correlation between the COMID-P and the COMID was high (ICC=.826, 95%CI [.761-.873]). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that patients and nurses can assess complexity using tools that have comparable structural properties. They also reveal congruencies and discrepancies in scoring the components of complexity, highlighting the need of reaching consensus in designing care plans. Further work is needed to demonstrate the benefits of joint assessment in developing care plans that truly meet patients' needs. Trial registration: The fraXity study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03883425, on March 20, 2019.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=157630821&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	50	BMC Nursing	1	52	busnel,catherine	busnel	catherine
51	Effect, Economic And Process-Evaluation Of A Generic Function Focused Care Program For Long-Term Care; Study Protocol Of A Multicenter Cluster–Randomized Trial.	2022	53	10.1186/s12912-022-00902-5			50	21	1	1	Background: Nurses are in a key position to stimulate older people to maximize their functional activity and independence. However, nurses still often work in a task-oriented manner and tend to take over tasks unnecessarily. It is evident to support nurses to focus on the capabilities of older people and provide care assistance only when required. Function-Focused Care (FFC) is a holistic care-philosophy aiming to support nurses to deliver care in which functioning and independence of older people is optimized. Dutch and internationally developed FFC-based interventions often lack effectiveness in changing nurses' and client's behavior. Process-evaluations have yielded lessons and implications resulting in the development of an advanced generic FFC-program: the 'SELF-program'. The SELF-program aims to improve activity stimulation behavior of nurses in long-term care services, and with that optimize levels of self-reliance in activities of daily living (ADL) in geriatric clients. The innovative character of the SELF-program lies for example in the application of extended behavior change theory, its interactive nature, and tailoring its components to setting-specific elements and needs of its participants. This paper describes the outline, content and theoretical background of the SELF-program. Subsequently, this paper describes a protocol for the assessment of the program's effect, economic and process-evaluation in a two-arm (SELF-program vs care as usual) multicenter cluster-randomized trial (CRT). Method: The proposed CRT has three objectives, including getting insight into the program's: (1) effectiveness regarding activity stimulation behavior of nurses and self-reliance in ADL of geriatric clients, and (2) cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective including assessments of quality of life and health-care use. Measurements will take place prior to program implementation (baseline), directly after (T1), and in long-term (T2). Parallel to the CRT, a process evaluation will be conducted to provide insight into the program's: (3) feasibility regarding implementation, mechanisms of impact and contextual factors. Discussion: The SELF-program was developed following the Medical Research Council framework, which addresses the systematic development, feasibility testing, evaluation and implementation of complex interventions. The program has been subjected to a feasibility study before and results of studies described in this protocol are expected to be available from end 2022 onwards. Trial-registration: The study is registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NL9189), as of December 22 2020.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=156971141&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	50	BMC Nursing	1	53	vluggen,stan	vluggen	stan
52	Social Care Costs For Community‐Dwelling Older People Living With Frailty.	2022	54	10.1111/hsc.13450			54	30	3	e804	International evidence indicates that older people with frailty are more likely to access social care services, compared to nonfrail older people. There is, however, no robust evidence on costs of social care provided for community‐dwelling older people living with frailty in their own homes. The main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between community‐dwelling older people living with frailty, defined using the cumulative deficit model, and annual formal social care costs for the 2012–2018 period. A secondary objective was to estimate formal social care spending for every 1% reduction in the number of older people who develop frailty over 1 year. Secondary analysis of prospective cohort data from two large nationally representative community‐based cohort studies in England was performed. Respondents aged ≥75 were used in the main analysis and respondents aged 65–74 in sensitivity testing. We used regression tree modelling for formal social care cost analysis including frailty, age, gender, age at completing education and living with partner as key covariates. We employed a minimum node size stopping criteria to limit tree complexity and overfitting and applied 'bootstrap aggregating' to improve robustness. We assessed the impact of an intervention for every 1% decrease in the number of individuals who become frail over 1 year in England. Results show that frailty is the strongest predictor of formal social care costs. Mean social care costs for people who are not frail are £321, compared with £2,895 for individuals with frailty. For every 1% of nonfrail people not transitioning to frailty savings of £4.4 million in annual expenditures on formal social care in England are expected, not including expenditure on care homes. Given considerably higher costs for individuals classed as frail compared to nonfrail, a successful intervention avoiding or postponing the onset of frailty has the potential to considerably reduce social care costs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=156251798&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	2	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	54	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	54	nikolova,silviya	nikolova	silviya
53	Future Nursing Research Of Older Adults: Preserving Independence And Reducing Health Disparities.	2022	56				56	26	1	1	Nursing professionals are at the forefront of primary care and the largest segment of the health workforce, and nurse researchers can bring vital perspectives to aging research and clinical practice. Although healthcare systems are experiencing more work from the aging of populations, unfortunately there are limited nurse researchers trained in gerontological nursing. Future research in older adults needs to be based on the current needs of and for older adults. In this article, I identify potential future research of aspects for older adults by highlighting opportunities and examples to conduct culturally appropriate interventions that aim to reduce health disparities and preserve independence. Because there is a complexity of health issues in older adults, nurse researchers need to pursue the best ways to address their needs, investigate and disseminate technology-based assessments, provide culturally appropriate interventions to promote independence, prevent chronic conditions, and enhance health equality. Nurses and nurse researchers also need to monitor the changes in functional status and health of older adults, especially as the global burden and costs of diseases and disability of this population grows, and to save unnecessary health care expenditure. To create new knowledge and discover best practices in aging care, nurse researchers lead multidisciplinary teams, develop innovative ideas with the potential for significant clinical impact, and use appropriate research approaches that steer to successful grant applications to national funding agencies. It is essential to establish a program for training or mentoring nurse researchers dedicated to caring for older adults, advocating, and disseminating innovative care to maximize the independence of older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=154207049&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	1	56	Pacific Rim International Journal of Nursing Research	1	56	ladda,thiamwong	ladda	thiamwong
54	Older Adults With Complex Chronic Conditions Who Receive Care At Home: The Importance Of Primary Care Assessment.	2021	57	10.3928/00989134-20211013-02			57	47	11	31	The current study aimed to describe the characteristics of older adults with complex chronic conditions cared for at home. One hundred thirty-eight participants were recruited. Participants' average age was 85.9 years and 69.6% were female. Poly-pharmacy was present in 89.9% of participants. Participants who presented with polypharmacy had a worse self-perception of health (p = 0.002), and the worst fall rate. A total of 22.5% had experienced a fall during the past 6 months. Approximately one half of participants rated their self-perceived quality of life as bad or very bad. The percentage who used emergency services (54.3%) was greater than the percentage who needed to be admitted (43.5%). A worse self-perception of physical health was significantly associated with hospital admissions (p = 0.01). Geriatric assessment by nurses can provide information to improve care in situations in which frailty, dependency, and chronic conditions occur together. Obtaining information on the needs of individuals with frailty is important in designing successful nursing interventions.

55	An Exploration Of Hydration Practices In Maltese Residential Care Homes For Older People.	2021	58	10.12968/nrec.2021.23.11.3			58	23	11	1	Background/aims: The integral relationship between adequate hydration and good health is widely recognised. Older people with complex needs and frailty can struggle to maintain adequate hydration, with residents in care home settings being at an increased risk of dehydration. The aim of this study was to explore current hydration practices in residential care homes in Malta. Methods: An exploratory qualitative approach was adopted to explore staff's views and approaches in supporting residents' hydration. Data was collected via semi-structured, individual and small group interviews with staff from two care homes from the central and southern region of Malta. A process of open coding, followed by axial coding, was used to analyse the data. Peer debriefing was performed throughout, until agreement was reached among the research team about the final themes and sub-themes. Results: Three themes emerged from the data: culture of promoting fluid intake; challenges in supporting older people to achieve optimum hydration; hydration practices and approaches. Conclusions: A hydration promotion culture was demonstrated through various practices adopted in the care homes. The strong focus on water intake, in response to concerns about consuming sugary beverages, has implications for the promotion of a person-centred approach to hydration care. Inconsistencies in monitoring of fluids and daily recommended targets highlights the importance of policies or guidelines to guide hydration practice. Challenges related to refusal of fluids and language barriers among non-native staff were evident and justify further research is this area.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=153908163&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	58	Nursing & Residential Care	1	58	micallef,francesca	micallef	francesca
56	Next Of Kin'S Experiences Of Registered Nurses' Leadership Close To Older Adults In Municipal Home Care In Sweden: An Interview Study.	2021	59	10.1186/s12912-021-00745-6			50	20	1	1	Background: Next of kin to older adults over 65 years in municipal home care are concerned whether their older adults' needs are being met. In municipal home care, the registered nurses' leadership is important and complex, entailing multi-artist skills involving the older adults and their next of kin. Yet, little is known about next of kin's experiences of registered nurses' leadership. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore next of kin's experiences of registered nurses' leadership close to older adults in municipal home care. Methods: Individual telephone interviews were conducted with next of kin (n = 11) of older adults from April to September 2020 in two municipalities in western Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The results are presented with the theme, registered nurses do what they can, including two categories, interaction and competence, and the subcategories, relationship, communication, availability, responsibility, team leadership and cooperation. Registered nurses' leadership was experienced as a balancing act between their commitments and what they were able to achieve. Conclusions: Next of kin's experiences of registered nurses' leadership can contribute knowledge that will strengthen and prepare registered nurses for their leadership roles. This knowledge can support the development of policies for organisational preconditions that ensure quality and safe care to older adults in municipal home care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=153315107&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	50	BMC Nursing	1	59	claesson,maria	claesson	maria
57	A New Tool To Measure Acuity In The Community: A Case Study.	2021	60	10.12968/bjcn.2021.26.10.482			60	26	10	482	The provision of acute healthcare within patients own home (i.e. hospital in the home) is an important method of providing individualised patient-centred care that reduces the need for acute hospital admissions and enables early hospital discharge for appropriate patient groups. The Hospital in the Home (HitH) model of care ensures that this approach maximises patient safety and limits potential risk for patients. As HitH services have seen record numbers of patient referrals in the past 2 years, there is now a greater need to measure and understand the acuity and dependency levels of the caseload. Through an expert clinician development process at one NHS trust, aspects of procedural complexity, interdisciplinary working, risk stratification and comorbidities were used to quantify acuity and dependency. This paper uses a case study approach to present a new method of measuring this important concept.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=152928984&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	60	British Journal of Community Nursing	1	60	baker,edward	baker	edward
58	Palliative Care Aspects Of Wound Healing In Complex Patients: A Case Report.	2021	63	10.12968/jowc.2021.30.10.845			63	30	10	845	Symptom or palliative management for wound care has commonly been reported in the literature as being focused on end-of-life care with less emphasis on being an effective supportive option for any patient with a wound in whom symptom management is indicated. This case report describes a frail older patient with a hard-to-heal pressure injury and multiple comorbidities to highlight palliative symptom management as a viable option to enhance patient comfort. Wound care providers may consider a palliative approach for hard-to-heal wound management that incorporates the whole patient, family and/or caregiver when faced with management of a frail older adult with a hard-to-heal wound to enhance the relief of suffering and improve quality of life. All procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and the appropriate institutional committee has approved them.

59	Transitional 'Hospital To Home' Care Of Older Patients: Healthcare Professionals' Perspectives.	2021	64	10.1111/scs.12904			64	35	3	871	Background: Transitional care is a key area of care provision to older people with chronic and complex health conditions and is associated with the quality of care delivered in the healthcare system. Aims: This study aimed to explore the perspectives of healthcare providers, including nurses and physicians, regarding transitional care from hospital to home in an urban area of Turkey. Methods: A qualitative study using a thematic analysis method was carried out. In‐depth semi‐structured interviews were held with eight clinical nurses and five general physicians involved in the provision of healthcare services to older patients in the transitional care process from hospital to home. Findings: The thematic analysis of in‐depth semi‐structured interviews with 13 healthcare professionals led to the development of the following themes: 'uninterrupted chain of care transfer', 'commitment to meet patient's needs' and 'support and removing ambiguities'. Conclusions: Key factors impacting on the quality and safety of transitional care and continuity of healthcare are communication and collaboration between healthcare staff and settings, and older patients' as well as family caregivers' awareness and their feelings of responsibility towards the continuity of care at home.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=151957417&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	64	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	64	dolu,i̇lknur	dolu	i̇lknur
60	The Impact Of Rapid Response And Telecare Services On Elderly And Vulnerable Residents.	2021	66	10.1111/hsc.13123			54	29	4	897	An ageing population, government funding cuts and pressures on local authorities to provide services that meet the needs of elderly people, particularly those with complex needs, has resulted in challenges for service providers and service users. This study examined the impact on service users and other stakeholders of rapid response services for elderly and vulnerable residents living in social housing in north‐east England. The housing provider has a rapid response team for residents as part of its organisational infrastructure. This includes a 24/7 emergency response service combined with a telecare service, funded by the local authority for vulnerable clients with complex needs and self‐funded by others. The study utilised semi‐structured qualitative interviews to collect data. Participants included service users, commissioners, service providers, adult social care and family carers. Thematic analysis was used to identify key issues. Service users reported feeling safer and more confident knowing someone would be there at times of need. Family carers reported improvements in their own health and well‐being, as they no longer felt on call all the time. The number of requests for ambulances as a consequence of falls was reported to have reduced by the rapid response team. Vulnerable people with electronic monitoring/telecare support were able to remain in their own home for longer, reducing the need for residential funding by the local authority. The partnership between the housing association and the local authority resulted in a service able to respond to changing needs as well as identifying deterioration in residents' health status. In conclusion, the use of a combined rapid response and telecare service resulted in elderly people remaining independent in their homes for longer, which improved their reported quality of life and relieved stress on carers and pressures on other service providers.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=151003797&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	54	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	66	watson,pat	watson	pat
61	Psychosocial Adjustment To Illness Scale In Family Caregivers Of Patients With Parkinson'S Disease: Spanish Validation Study.	2021	67	10.1111/hsc.13137			54	29	4	1030	Psychosocial adjustment to a complex and disabling long‐term condition like Parkinson´s disease is a complex, dynamic, cyclical and interactive process. Family caregivers, face multiple challenges that require a significant effort in terms of psychosocial adjustment, which must be considered by healthcare professionals in order to provide a holistic care. The patients' self‐report version of the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS‐SR), which has been validated in Spain for use in Parkinson's disease, is designed to evaluate the psychosocial adjustment of patients. Our purpose was to validate the Spanish PAIS‐SR version for caregivers of patients with Parkinson's disease. An open, national cross‐sectional study with one point‐in‐time evaluation and retest was carried out in 450 family caregivers of patients with Parkinson's disease. Data were collected in Spain from April 2016 to September 2017. The psychometric analysis performed showed that the Spanish version of the PAIS‐SR for caregivers presents adequate indicators of reliability, internal and external validity, and is structured according to the seven‐domain model proposed by the author of the instrument.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=151003810&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	1	54	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	67	ambrosio,leire	ambrosio	leire
62	Association Between Communitybased Nurse Practitioner Support, Self-Care Behaviour And Quality Of Life In Patients With Chronic Heart Failure.	2021	68	10.37464/2020.383.147			68	38	3	25	Objective: To evaluate the effects of a communitybased chronic heart failure management program, delivered by nurse practitioners, on self-care behaviour, quality of life and hospital readmissions. Background: Chronic heart failure is a complex condition associated with high rates of hospital readmissions. However, many hospitalisations in patients with chronic heart failure are potentially preventable with better self-management and access to specialised healthcare support. Nurse practitioners have an advanced scope of practice, making them well credentialed to support patients with chronic heart failure. Study design and methods: This study compared self-care behaviour and quality of life in patients who had attended a nurse-practitioner led chronic heart failure management service (SmartHeart) (n=58) compared with patients receiving usual care (n=58), but no nurse practitioner support. Self-care behaviour was assessed using the Self Care Heart Failure Index and quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36 and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. Hospitalisation records were extracted from medical records using data-linkage. Results: Patients who received nurse-practitioner support had better self-care behaviour (p<0.05), mental component summary of the Short Form-36 (p<0.05) and heart failure specific quality of life (p<0.05). All-cause hospitalisations were delayed (p<0.05) and length of stay was shorter (p<0.05) in the group receiving nurse practitioner support, but there were no differences in chronic heart failure related admissions. Discussion: A chronic heart failure support program, operating in a community setting and delivered by nurse practitioners, enhanced self-care, improved psychosocial health and reduced time in hospital. Conclusion: Chronic heart failure management delivered by nurse practitioners can improve self-care behaviour and quality of life, and reduced hospital admissions, compared with usual care. What is already known about the topic? • Chronic heart failure is a complex health issue requiring disease-specific management that needs to be tailored to the individual. However, many patients with chronic heart failure don't receive adequate support to manage their condition. What does this paper add: • A chronic heart failure management service, delivered in primary care by nurse practitioners, improved self-management and quality of life and was associated with a lower rate of hospitalisations compared with usual care alone.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=152131741&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0	68	Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing	1	68	sheau,huey.chen	sheau	huey.chen
63	Delirium Pharmacotherapeutics In The Cardiac Iintensive Care Unit: An Alphabetical Mnemonic Approach.	2021	69				69	31	2	14	Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing cardiovascular diseases, resulting in admissions to the medical cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for advanced monitoring and interventions. Delirium has a complex etiology, caused by modifiable factors imposed on underlying medical or surgical conditions. The CICU environment is notorious for its delirium-inducing factors, such as receiving certain cardiac medications, lacking sleep, and undergo- ing medical procedures. More than half of patients with delirium experience agitation symptoms, posing a safety risk to the patient and the healthcare team involved and contributing to prolonged hospital stays. Nurses in the CICU are faced with the challenge of preventing and treating underlying causes of delirium and controlling delirium manifestations to protect their patients. We propose an alphabetical mnemonic, based on guideline-driven pharmacological interventions (ABCD: antipsychotics, benzo- diazepines, cholinesterase inhibitors, and dexmedetomidine), to facilitate nurses' understanding and recall of pharmacotherapy used in the complex management of delirium in the CICU.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=152172133&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	1	69	Canadian Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing	1	69	el,hussein.mohamed	el	hussein.mohamed
64	Exploring A Nursing Home-Specific, Interdisciplinary, Function-Focused, Communicative Framework Based On Situation, Background, Assessment, And Recommendation.	2021	70	10.1097/jnr.0000000000000428			62	29	3	e151	Background: Improved methods of communication are needed among professionals in related fields to address the increasing complexity of clinical situations and various levels of functioning experienced by older adults who live in nursing homes. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore function-focused clinical communication among nurses and providers based on the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) approach toward interdisciplinary collaboration to maintain function among nursing home residents and to identify the characteristics of SBAR flows in nursing homes. Methods: Detailed interviews with 28 interdisciplinary professionals working in four nursing homes were conducted. Directed qualitative content analysis was used to identify the internal attributes of SBAR-based communication. Case analysis was conducted to identify SBAR flows. Results: Four themes emerged as key factors for function-focused interdisciplinary staff communication in nursing homes. Effective nursing care to maintain function among nursing home residents requires accurate awareness of abnormal circumstances. Knowledge of assessment and resident background are needed to address situations requiring intervention and identify the problems underlying a resident's current state. The optimal therapeutic environment is created by sharing roles and tasks among practitioners through referrals. Twelve generalized situations requiring function-focused communication (i.e., dislocation of body line because of joint contracture, change in walking, difficulty of moving because of pain, difficulty in eating, fever, change in sleep pattern, change in excretion pattern, change in weight, change in condition, change in problematic behavior, decrease in cognitive function, and change in relationships) and the related nurse-centered SBAR pathways were identified. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: These results represent a first prototype for developing practical communication guidelines for nursing-home-specific function-focused care and provide new insights into the interdisciplinary approach.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=150250201&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:32:19	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	1	62	Journal of Nursing Research (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)	1	70	park,min.sun	park	min.sun
65	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In Older Adults: Clinical Considerations And Management.	2021	71	10.1038/s41574-021-00512-2	34172940		71	17	9	534	The past 50 years have seen a growing ageing population with an increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); now, nearly half of all individuals with diabetes mellitus are older adults (aged ≥65 years). Older adults with T2DM present particularly difficult challenges. For example, the accentuated heterogeneity of these patients, the potential presence of multiple comorbidities, the increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, the increased dependence on care and the effect of frailty all add to the complexity of managing diabetes mellitus in this age group. In this Review, we offer an update on the key pathophysiological mechanisms associated with T2DM in older people. We then evaluate new evidence relating particularly to the effects of frailty and sarcopenia, the clinical difficulties of age-associated comorbidities, and the implications for existing guidelines and therapeutic options. Our conclusions will focus on the effect of T2DM on an ageing society.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		71	Nature Reviews.

66	Pathophysiology And Mechanisms Of Primary Sarcopenia (Review).	2021	72	10.3892/ijmm.2021.4989	34184088		72	48	2	None	Aging causes skeletal muscle atrophy, and myofiber loss can be a critical component of this process. In 1989, Rosenberg emphasized the importance of the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with aging and coined the term 'sarcopenia'. Since then, sarcopenia has attracted considerable attention due to the aging population in developed countries. The presence of sarcopenia is closely related to staggering, falls and even frailty in the elderly, which in turn leads to the need for nursing care. Sarcopenia is often associated with a poor prognosis in the elderly. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the causes and pathogenesis of sarcopenia, and to develop and introduce interventional strategies in line with these causes and pathogenesis. Sarcopenia can be a primary component of physical frailty. The association between sarcopenia, frailty and locomotive syndrome is complex; however, sarcopenia is a muscle‑specific concept that is relatively easy to approach in research. In the elderly, a lack of exercise, malnutrition and hormonal changes lead to neuromuscular junction insufficiency, impaired capillary blood flow, reduced repair and regeneration capacity due to a decrease in the number of muscle satellite cells, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and oxidative stress, resulting in muscle protein degradation exceeding synthesis. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction causes metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, which may lead to quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in skeletal muscle, resulting in sarcopenia. The present review article focuses on age‑related primary sarcopenia and outlines its pathogenesis and mechanisms.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		72	International Journal Of Molecular Medicine		72	nishikawa,hiroki	Nishikawa	Hiroki
67	Metabolic Syndrome And Sarcopenia.	2021	72	10.3390/nu13103519	34684520		73	13	10	None	Skeletal muscle is a major organ of insulin-induced glucose metabolism. In addition, loss of muscle mass is closely linked to insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (Met-S). Skeletal muscle loss and accumulation of intramuscular fat are associated with a variety of pathologies through a combination of factors, including oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, IR, and inactivity. Sarcopenia, defined by a loss of muscle mass and a decline in muscle quality and muscle function, is common in the elderly and is also often seen in patients with acute or chronic muscle-wasting diseases. The relationship between Met-S and sarcopenia has been attracting a great deal of attention these days. Persistent inflammation, fat deposition, and IR are thought to play a complex role in the association between Met-S and sarcopenia. Met-S and sarcopenia adversely affect QOL and contribute to increased frailty, weakness, dependence, and morbidity and mortality. Patients with Met-S and sarcopenia at the same time have a higher risk of several adverse health events than those with either Met-S or sarcopenia. Met-S can also be associated with sarcopenic obesity. In this review, the relationship between Met-S and sarcopenia will be outlined from the viewpoints of molecular mechanism and clinical impact.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		73	Nutrients		72	nishikawa,hiroki	Nishikawa	Hiroki

Among the age-related diseases, sarcopenia and dysphagia are two common pathological conditions in frail older people and could coexist leading to dehydration and malnutrition in these subjects. ""Sarcopenic dysphagia"" is a complex condition characterized by deglutition impairment due to the loss of mass and strength of swallowing muscles and might be also related to poor oral health status. Moreover, the aging process is strictly related to poor oral health status due to direct impairment of the immune system and wound healing and physical and cognitive impairment might indirectly influence older people's ability to carry out adequate oral hygiene. Therefore, poor oral health might affect nutrient intake, leading to malnutrition and, consequently, to frailty. In this scenario, sarcopenia, dysphagia, and oral health are closely linked sharing common pathophysiological pathways, disabling sequelae, and frailty. Thus, the aim of the present comprehensive review is to describe the correlation among sarcopenic dysphagia, malnutrition, and oral frailty, characterizing their phenotypically overlapping features, to propose a comprehensive and effective management of elderly frail subjects."		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		73	Nutrients		74	de sire,alessandro	de Sire	Alessandro
69	Application Of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy For Aging Frailty: From Mechanisms To Therapeutics.	2021	75	10.7150/thno.46436	33897874		75	11	12	5675	Aging frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome that becomes more prevalent with advancing age. It constitutes a major health problem due to frequent adverse outcomes. Frailty is characterized by disruption of physiological homeostasis and progressive decline of health status. Multiple factors contribute to development of frailty with advancing age, including genome instability, DNA damage, epigenetic alternations, stem cell exhaustion, among others. These interrelated factors comprehensively result in loss of tissue homeostasis and diminished reserve capacity in frailty. Therefore, the aged organism gradually represents symptoms of frailty with decline in physiological functions of organs. Notably, the brain, cardiovascular system, skeletal muscle, and endocrine system are intrinsically interrelated to frailty. The patients with frailty may display the diminished reserves capacity of organ systems. Due to the complex pathophysiology, no specific treatments have been approved for prevention of this syndrome. At such, effective strategies for intervening in pathogenic process to improve health status of frail patients are highly needed. Recent progress in cell-based therapy has greatly contributed to the amelioration of degenerative diseases related to age. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can exert regenerative effects and possess anti-inflammatory properties. Transplantation of MSCs represents as a promising therapeutic strategy to address the pathophysiologic problems of frail syndrome. Currently, MSC therapy have undergone the phase I and II trials in human subjects that have endorsed the safety and efficacy of MSCs for aging frailty. However, despite these positive results, caution is still needed with regard to potential to form tumors, and further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of MSC therapy.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		75	Theranostics		75	zhu,yingqian	Zhu	Yingqian
70	Persistent Poor Health After Covid-19 Is Not Associated With Respiratory Complications Or Initial Disease Severity.	2021	76	10.1513/AnnalsATS.202009-1175OC	33413026		76	18	6	997	Rationale: Much is known about the acute infective process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The marked inflammatory response and coagulopathic state in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may promote pulmonary fibrosis. However, little is known about the incidence and seriousness of post-COVID-19 pulmonary pathology. Objectives: To describe the respiratory recovery and self-reported health after infection at the time of outpatient attendance. Methods: Infection severity was graded into three groups: 1) not requiring admission, 2) requiring hospital admission, and 3) requiring intensive care unit care. Participants underwent chest radiography and a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Fatigue and subjective return to health were assessed, and concentrations of CRP (C-reactive protein), IL-6 (interleukin-6), sCD25 (soluble CD25), and D-dimer were measured. The associations between initial illness and abnormal chest X-ray findings, 6MWT distance, and perception of maximal exertion were investigated. Results: A total of 487 patients were offered an outpatient appointment, of whom 153 (31%) attended for assessment at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. A total of 74 (48%) had required hospital admission during acute infection. Persistently abnormal chest X-ray findings were seen in 4%. The median 6MWT distance covered was 460 m. A reduced distance covered was associated with frailty and length of inpatient stay. A total of 95 (62%) patients believed that they had not returned to full health, whereas 47% met the case definition for fatigue. Ongoing ill health and fatigue were associated with an increased perception of exertion. None of the measures of persistent respiratory disease were associated with initial disease severity. Conclusions: This study highlights the rates of objective respiratory disease and subjective respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 and the complex multifactorial nature of post-COVID-19 ill health.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		76	Annals Of The American Thoracic Society		76	townsend,liam	Townsend	Liam
71	Physical Functional Assessment In Older Adults.	2021	77	10.14283/jfa.2020.61	33575703		12	10	2	141	The evaluation of the physical domain represents a critical part of the assessment of the older person, both in the clinical as well as the research setting. To measure physical function, clinicians and researchers have traditionally relied on instruments focusing on the capacity of the individual to accomplish specific functional tasks (e.g., the Activities of Daily Living [ADL] or the Instrumental ADL scales). However, a growing number of physical performance and muscle strength tests has been developed in parallel over the past three decades. These measures are specifically designed to: 1) provide objective results (not surprisingly, they are frequently timed tests) taken in standardized conditions, whereas the traditional physical function scales are generally self- or proxy-reported measures; 2) be more sensitive to changes; 3) capture the real biology of the function through the assessment of standardized tasks mirroring specific functional subdomains; and 4) mirror the quality of specific mechanisms underlying more complex and multidomain functions. Among the most commonly used instruments, the usual gait speed test, the Short Physical Performance Battery, the handgrip strength, the Timed Up-and-Go test, the 6-minute walk test, and the 400-meter walk test are widely adopted by clinicians and researchers. The clinical and research importance of all these instruments has been demonstrated by their predictive capacity for negative health-related outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, falls, institutionalization, disability, mortality). Moreover, they have shown to be associated with subclinical and clinical conditions that are also not directly related to the physical domain (e.g., inflammation, oxidative stress, overall mortality). For this reason, they have been repeatedly indicated as markers of wellbeing linked to the burden of multiple chronic conditions rather than mere parameters of mobility or strength. In this work protocols of the main tests for the objective assessment of physical function in older adults are presented.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		12	The Journal Of Frailty & Aging		77	patrizio,e	Patrizio	E
72	Social Frailty Dimensions And Frailty Models Over Time.	2021	78	10.1016/j.archger.2021.104515	34597877		14	97		104515	INTRODUCTION: Social frailty is a complex concept and there is still no consensus on the criteria that best define it, nor on the role that social dimensions play in well-established frailty models. AIM: To analyse the predictive value of social frailty dimensions on distinct frailty models. METHOD: A non-probabilistic sample of 193 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and over was recruited in 2016 and followed for three years. Frailty was assessed by the Tilburg Frailty Indicator, the Groningen Frailty Indicator, and the Fried Phenotype criteria. Questions about living alone, social network, social support, loneliness, and frequency of social activities engagement were used to assess social criteria. Bivariate correlations and sequential multiple hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: At baseline, 22.2% older adults lived alone, 47.2% reported missing people around them, 21.1% reported lack of social support, 26.1% reported having reduced their participation in social activities recently and 52.2% reported loneliness. The percent of frail individuals varied across frailty measures, and social criteria showed significant correlations and increased the prediction of frailty status. Loneliness and social activities engagement were associated with frailty as assessed by the Tilburg frailty Indicator and by the Fried Phenotype criteria; the lack of social support is associated with frailty as assessed by the Groningen Frailty Indicator. Living alone and lack of social relationships did not predict frailty. CONCLUSION: Including social dimensions in a frailty model needs a consensual theoretical basis as they have different roles in predicting frailty, varying over time and across assessment tools.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		14	Archives Of Gerontology And Geriatrics		78	bessa,bruno	Bessa	Bruno
73	Interventions To Reduce Hospital Length Of Stay In High-Risk Populations: A Systematic Review.	2021	79	10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25846	34542615		79	4	9	e2125846	IMPORTANCE: Many strategies to reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) have been implemented, but few studies have evaluated hospital-led interventions focused on high-risk populations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Learning Health System panel commissioned this study to further evaluate system-level interventions for LOS reduction. OBJECTIVE: To identify and synthesize evidence regarding potential systems-level strategies to reduce LOS for patients at high risk for prolonged LOS. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Multiple databases, including MEDLINE and Embase, were searched for English-language systematic reviews from January 1, 2010, through September 30, 2020, with updated searches through January 19, 2021. The scope of the protocol was determined with input from AHRQ Key Informants. Systematic reviews were included if they reported on hospital-led interventions intended to decrease LOS for high-risk populations, defined as those with high-risk medical conditions or socioeconomically vulnerable populations (eg, patients with high levels of socioeconomic risk, who are medically uninsured or underinsured, with limited English proficiency, or who are hospitalized at a safety-net, tertiary, or quaternary care institution). Exclusion criteria included interventions that were conducted outside of the hospital setting, including community health programs. Data extraction was conducted independently, with extraction of strength of evidence (SOE) ratings provided by systematic reviews; if unavailable, SOE was assessed using the AHRQ Evidence-Based Practice Center methods guide. FINDINGS: Our searches yielded 4432 potential studies. We included 19 systematic reviews reported in 20 articles. The reviews described 8 strategies for reducing LOS in high-risk populations: discharge planning, geriatric assessment, medication management, clinical pathways, interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary care, case management, hospitalist services, and telehealth. Interventions were most frequently designed for older patients, often those who were frail (9 studies), or patients with heart failure. There were notable evidence gaps, as there were no systematic reviews studying interventions for patients with socioeconomic risk. For patients with medically complex conditions, discharge planning, medication management, and interdisciplinary care teams were associated with inconsistent outcomes (LOS, readmissions, mortality) across populations. For patients with heart failure, clinical pathways and case management were associated with reduced length of stay (clinical pathways: mean difference reduction, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.33 to 2.44] days; case management: mean difference reduction, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.52 to 2.04] days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review found inconsistent results across all high-risk populations on the effectiveness associated with interventions, such as discharge planning, that are often widely used by health systems. This systematic review highlights important evidence gaps, such as the lack of existing systematic reviews focused on patients with socioeconomic risk factors, and the need for further research.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		79	Jama Network Open		79	siddique,shazia.mehmood	Siddique	Shazia Mehmood
74	Overtreating Alzheimer'S Disease.	2021	80	10.14283/jpad.2020.74	33569572		80	8	2	234	The management of frailty in older persons is not easy, implying interventions beyond the simple prescription of medications. Biological complexity, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and social issues often hamper the possibility to directly translate the evidence coming from research into clinical practice. Frailty indeed represents the most relevant cause of the “evidence-based medicine issue” influencing clinical decisions in geriatric care. Today, patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are much older and frailer than some decades ago. They also tend to have more drugs prescribed. In parallel, research on AD has evolved over the years, hypothesizing that anticipating the interventions to the earliest stages of the disease may provide beneficial effects (to date, still lacking). In this article, we argue that, by focusing exclusively on “the disease” and pushing to anticipate its detection (sometimes even before the appareance of its clinical manifestations) may overshadow the person’s values and priorities. Research should be developed for better integrating the concept of aging and frailty in the design of clinical trials in order to provide results that can be implemented in real life. On the other hand, clinicians should be less prone to the easy (but unsupported by evidence) pharmacological prescription.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		80	The Journal Of Prevention Of Alzheimer'S Disease		80	canevelli,m	Canevelli	M
75	Gut Microbiome, Vitamin D, Ace2 Interactions Are Critical Factors In Immune-Senescence And Inflammaging: Key For Vaccine Response And Severity Of Covid-19 Infection.	2022	81	10.1007/s00011-021-01510-w	34738147		81	71	1	13	"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread sporadically in the Unites States and worldwide. The severity and mortality excessively affected the frail elderly with co-existing medical diseases. There is growing evidence that cross-talk between the gut microbiome, Vitamin D and RAS/ACE2 system is essential for a balanced functioning of the elderly immune system and in regulating inflammation. In this review, we hypothesize that the state of gut microbiome, prior to infection determines the outcome associated with COVID-19 sepsis and may also be a critical factor in success to vaccination. METHODS: Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using a combination of terms ""SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Inflammaging, Immune-senescence, Gut microbiome, Vitamin D, RAS/ACE2, Vaccination"". CONCLUSION: Evidence indicates a complex association between gut microbiota, ACE-2 expression and Vitamin D in COVID-19 severity. Status of gut microbiome is highly predictive of the blood molecular signatures and inflammatory markers and host responses to infection. Vitamin D has immunomodulatory function in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection. Anti-inflammatory functions of Vit D include regulation of gut microbiome and maintaining microbial diversity. It promotes growth of gut-friendly commensal strains of Bifida and Fermicutus species. In addition, Vitamin D is a negative regulator for expression of renin and interacts with the RAS/ ACE/ACE-2 signaling axis. Collectively, this triad may be the critical, link in determination of outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presented data are empirical and informative. Further research using advanced systems biology techniques and artificial intelligence-assisted integration could assist with correlation of the gut microbiome with sepsis and vaccine responses. Modulating these factors may impact in guiding the success of vaccines and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infections."		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		81	Inflammation Research: Official Journal Of The European Histamine Research Society   [Et Al.]		81	shenoy,santosh	Shenoy	Santosh

77	Adverse Drug Reactions In Older Adults: A Narrative Review Of The Literature.	2021	83	10.1007/s41999-021-00481-9	33738772		83	12	3	463	PURPOSE: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a common and potentially preventable cause of unplanned hospitalization, increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. We aimed to review the classification and occurrence of ADRs in the older population, discuss the role of age as a risk factor, and identify interventions to prevent ADRs. METHODS: We performed a narrative scoping review of the literature to assess classification, occurrence, factors affecting ADRs, and possible strategies to identify and prevent ADRs. RESULTS: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are often classified as Type A and Type B reactions, based on dose and effect of the drugs and fatality of the reaction. More recently, other approaches have been proposed (i.e. Dose, Time and Susceptibility (DoTS) and EIDOS classifications). The frequency of ADRs varies depending on definitions, characteristics of the studied population, and settings. Their occurrence is often ascribed to commonly used drugs, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, digoxin, insulin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Age-related factors-changes in pharmacokinetics, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and frailty-have been related to ADRs. Different approaches (i.e. medication review, software identifying potentially inappropriate prescription and drug interactions) have been suggested to prevent ADRs and proven to improve the quality of prescribing. However, consistent evidence on their effectiveness is still lacking. Few studies suggest that a comprehensive geriatric assessment, aimed at identifying individual risk factors, patients' needs, treatment priorities, and strategies for therapy optimization, is key for reducing ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a relevant health burden. The medical complexity that characterizes older patients requires a holistic approach to reduce the burden of ADRs in this population.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		83	European Geriatric Medicine		83	zazzara,maria.beatrice	Zazzara	Maria Beatrice
78	Pre-Frailty And Frailty In Dialysis And Pre-Dialysis Patients: A Systematic Review Of Clinical And Biochemical Markers.	2021	84	10.3390/ijerph18189579	34574503		15	18	18	None	Patients under dialysis are known to be more vulnerable to frailty, a dynamic geriatric syndrome defined as a state of vulnerability to stressors, due to numerous metabolic changes. With rise of life expectancy globally, it is important to understand the complexity of the pathophysiology of frailty and identify possible markers that can help with the prognosis and diagnosis of frailty. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of the knowledge regarding clinical and biochemical markers associated with pre-frailty and frailty in dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. In November 2020, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched. Studies regarding biomarkers associated with (pre-)frailty in (pre-)dialysis patients were included. This systematic review identified clinical and biochemical markers in pre-frail and frail patients under dialysis or pre-dialysis published in the literature. This study shows that more investigation is necessary to identify markers that can differentiate these processes to be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in routine care and management of geriatric needs. Interventions that can improve health outcomes in pre-frail and frail older adults under dialysis or pre-dialysis are essential to improve not only the individual's quality of life but also to reduce the burden to the health systems.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		84	pereira,ana	Pereira	Ana

The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) and malignancy are both high, especially in elderly people and in developed countries. These two conditions frequently coexist and share the same risk factors as atherosclerotic disease.Area covered. The progression of calcified AS may be accelerated by both cardiovascular risk factors and cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy. The standard treatment for symptomatic severe AS is surgical aortic valve replacement; however, in cancer patients, transcatheter implantation may be preferred as they are often at high-risk for cardiac surgery. In patients with AS and cancer, physicians may face difficult treatment decisions.To date, there is limited information on the impact of malignancy on outcomes in patients with severe AS; hence, there is no established treatment policy.Expert Opinion. Treating clinicians must integrate complex information about the severity of valve disease and expected cardiac outcomes with information regarding the cancer prognosis and the need for specific treatment, including surgery. Other comorbidities, age and frailty also contribute to decision-making about whether, when, and how to perform aortic valve replacement.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		85	Expert Review Of Cardiovascular Therapy		85	frattini,silvia	Frattini	Silvia
80	Association Of Frailty And Pre-Frailty With Increased Risk Of Mortality Among Older Canadians.	2021	86	10.25318/82-003-x202100400002-eng	33881275		86	32	4	15	BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex syndrome that is associated with aging but not synonymous with the normal aging process. It has been associated with all-cause mortality, but less is known about frailty and mortality from specific causes. DATA AND METHODS: Data from the 2013 and 2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) linked to the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database were used to estimate the prevalence of frailty among Canadians aged 65 or older. Levels of frailty were based on validated cut-points for the 30-item frailty index. The relationship of frailty to mortality risk during the period of three to five years following the CCHS interview was assessed with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sociodemographic factors and health behaviours. Associations between frailty and mortality from neoplasms, circulatory diseases and disease of the respiratory system were examined in separate models. RESULTS: An estimated 1.1 million (22%) community-dwelling older adults were frail in 2013 and 2014, and another 1.6 million (32%) were considered pre-frail. Frailty was more common among females than males and among those in older age groups. The risk of mortality increased significantly with increasing levels of frailty, even after accounting for sociodemographic factors and health behaviours. This was the case for all-cause mortality, as well as for death from three major underlying causes-neoplasms, and diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems. DISCUSSION: Even individuals who were classified as pre-frail had an increased risk of mortality overall and from three leading causes compared with those who were robust, demonstrating the importance of screening community-dwelling older adults for frailty.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		86	Health Reports		86	gilmour,heather	Gilmour	Heather
81	Frailty: The Current Challenge For Aging People With Hiv.	2021	87	10.1097/COH.0000000000000677	33833208		87	16	3	133	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Older adults account for the majority of people with HIV (PWH) in high-income countries and have increasingly complex clinical profiles related to premature aging. Frailty is an important geriatric syndrome affecting a minority of PHW. Frailty negatively affects PHW's clinical status and quality of life. This review will update care providers on the current state of frailty that limits the healthspan of PWH. RECENT FINDINGS: Ongoing low-level HIV replication in treated PWH leads to immune activation and chronic inflammation contributing to the destabilization of normally autoregulated physiologic systems in response to environmental and biologic challenges characteristic of frailty. Understanding these underlying mechanisms will determine potential intervention options. Potentially reversible risk factors that promote progression to and reversion from the dynamic state of frailty are being studied and will help prevent frailty. Simple assessment tools and treatment strategies for frailty are being adapted for aging PWH. SUMMARY: Insight into underlying biologic mechanisms and adapting proven geriatric principles of interdisciplinary care will inform the healthy aging of PWH.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		87	Current Opinion In Hiv And Aids		87	falutz,julian	Falutz	Julian
82	Social Factors Influencing Utilization Of Home Care In Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Scoping Review.	2021	89	10.1186/s12877-021-02069-1	33639856		23	21	1	145	BACKGROUND: Older adults want to live at home as long as possible, even in the face of circumstances that limit their autonomy. Home care services reflect this emergent preference, allowing older adults to 'age in place' in familiar settings rather than receiving care for chronic health conditions or ageing needs in an institutionalized setting. Numerous social factors, generally studied in isolation, have been associated with home care utilization. Even so, social circumstances are complex and how these factors collectively influence home care use patterns remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To provide a broad and comprehensive overview of the social factors influencing home care utilization; and to evaluate the influence of discrete social factors on patterns of home care utilization in community-dwelling older adults in high-income countries. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted of six electronic databases for records published between 2010 and 2020; additional records were obtained from hand searching review articles, reference lists of included studies and documents from international organisations. A narrative synthesis was presented, complemented by vote counting per social factor, harvest plots and an evaluation of aggregated findings to determine consistency across studies. RESULTS: A total of 2,365 records were identified, of which 66 met inclusion criteria. There were 35 discrete social factors grouped into four levels of influence using a socio-ecological model (individual, relationship, community and societal levels) and grouped according to outcome of interest (home care propensity and intensity). Across all studies, social factors consistently showing any association (positive, negative, or equivocal in pattern) with home care propensity were: age, ethnicity/race, self-assessed health, insurance, housing ownership, housing problems, marital status, household income, children, informal caregiving, social networks and urban/rural area. Age, education, personal finances, living arrangements and housing ownership were associated with home care intensity, also with variable patterns in utilization. Additional community and societal level factors were identified as relevant but lacking consistency across the literature; these included rurality, availability of community services, methods of financing home care systems, and cultural determinants. CONCLUSION: This is the first literature review bringing together a wide range of reported social factors that influence home care utilization. It confirms social factors do influence home care utilization in complex interactions, distinguishes level of influences at which these factors affect patterns of use and discusses policy implications for home care reform.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		89	mah,jasmine.c	Mah	Jasmine C
83	Considering Frailty In Sars-Cov-2 Vaccine Development: How Geriatricians Can Assist.	2021	90	10.2147/CIA.S295522	33953551		90	16		731	The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted frail older adults, especially residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. This has appropriately led to prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care for them, in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood through a lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not tested in Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. We argue that geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to the development, testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We discuss roles for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development process, covering vaccine design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment and interpretation of illness definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of relevant health measures such as frailty and function, analysis methods to account for frailty and differential vulnerability, contributions in regulatory and advisory roles, post-marketing surveillance, and program implementation and public health messaging. In presenting key recommendations pertinent to each stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on how to push the field of vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty. Making vaccines that can benefit frail older adults will benefit everyone in the fight against COVID-19.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		90	Clinical Interventions In Aging		90	andrew,melissa.k	Andrew	Melissa K
84	Geriatric Assessments And Frailty Scores In Multiple Myeloma Patients: A Needed Tool For Individualized Treatment?	2021	91	10.1097/CCO.0000000000000792	34534141		91	33	6	648	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Multiple myeloma is a disease of elderly adults. Improvement in survival has occurred because of biological insights and novel agents. Therapeutic options involve choices today, thus have become more complex. Demographics have led to an increased number of elderly patients and age may be associated with a poorer outcome but is not the only prognostic predictor today. RECENT FINDINGS: To evaluate patients' health status rather than their chronological age alone, frailty scores and functional geriatric assessments are used to identify prognostic groups, avoid adverse events, compare clinical trials and tailor treatment. As most clinical trials exclude frail elderly patients, those enrolled therein are often younger and healthier than the typical multiple myeloma patient. This represents a challenge for frail cohorts because of their increased risk of adverse events, overtreatment and undertreatment and/or therapy discontinuation, which may lead to poorer survival and quality of life (QoL). Reassessing patients' status via geriatric assessments is also relevant during treatment to adjust interventions appropriately. SUMMARY: Integrating geriatric assessments may lead to individual treatment decisions, dose adjustments, better clinical outcome and QoL. Prospective clinical trials that enroll elderly multiple myeloma patients with comorbidities, incorporate frailty scores/geriatric assessments and help with prognostication, adverse event avoidance and QoL maintenance, remain warranted.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		91	Current Opinion In Oncology		91	möller,mandy-deborah	Möller	Mandy-Deborah
85	Prioritizing Movement To Address The Frailty Phenotype In Heart Failure.	2021	92	10.1016/j.pcad.2021.01.005	33556427		92	67		26	Frailty is a highly prevalent multisystem syndrome in older adults with heart failure (HF) and is associated with poor clinical prognosis and increased complexity of care. While frailty is neither disease nor age specific, it is a clinical manifestation of aging-related processes that reflects a reduced physiological ability to tolerate and recover from stress associated with aging, disease, or therapy. Within this context, physical frailty, which is distinctly oriented to physical functional domains (e.g., muscle weakness, slowness, and low activity), has been recognized as a critical vital sign in older persons with HF. Identification and routine assessment of physical frailty, using objective physical performance measures, may guide the course of patient-centered treatment plans that maximize the likelihood of improving clinical outcomes in older HF patients. Exercise-based rehabilitation is a primary therapy to improve cardiovascular health in patients with HF; however, the limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of exercise tailored to older and frail HF patients underscores the current gaps in management of their care. Interdisciplinary exercise interventions designed with consideration of physical frailty as a therapeutic target may be an important strategy to counteract functional deficits characteristic of frailty and HF, and to improve patient-centered outcomes in this population. The purpose of this current review is to provide a better understanding of physical frailty and its relation to management of care in older patients with HF. Implications of movement-based interventions, including exercise and physical rehabilitation, to prevent or reverse physical frailty and improve clinical outcomes will further be discussed.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		92	Progress In Cardiovascular Diseases		92	laddu,deepika.r	Laddu	Deepika R

The optimal management of unruptured aneurysms in elderly patients remains controversial. Variability in life expectancy, comorbidities and rupture risk coupled with heterogenous endovascular and surgical treatments contribute to a paucity of clear guidelines, and current management is highly individualized. Elderly patients present unique considerations including frailty, cognitive dysfunction, vasculopathy, reduced life expectancy and overall worse prognosis in case of rupture which shape the risks and likelihood of success of endovascular and microsurgical treatment. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in the elderly, with a particular focus on the natural history, key challenges associated with advanced age, management and future innovations to further refine treatment.Key MessagesThe management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in elderly patients remains controversial.Key challenges including frailty, cognitive dysfunction, reduced life expectancy, vasculopathy and poor prognosis with aneurysm rupture add complexity to endovascular and surgical decision making not encountered with younger demographics.A thorough understanding of available treatment options, likelihood of treatment success and associated risks weighed against the risk of aneurysm rupture informs patient discussion and management.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		93	Annals Of Medicine		93	caffes,nicholas	Caffes	Nicholas

Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, in particular, is a major source of frailty in older adults, severely impacting quality of life. Some loss of muscle mass and strength with aging is inevitable, and sarcopenia, the severe loss of muscle mass with aging, is common. Sarcopenia is determined in part by genetics but can be modified by lifestyle choices. The pathophysiologic underpinnings of sarcopenia are complex and multifactorial. In this review, the causes of sarcopenia are surveyed at the systems, cell, subcellular, and molecular levels with emphasis on the interplay between these various causes of this degenerative disease process.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		94	Anesthesia And Analgesia		94	csete,marie.e	Csete	Marie E
88	Frailty Status And Polypharmacy Predict All-Cause Mortality In Community Dwelling Older Adults In Europe.	2021	95	10.3390/ijerph18073580	33808273		15	18	7	None	European population ageing is associated with frailty, a complex geriatric syndrome, and polypharmacy, both resulting in adverse health outcomes. In this study we aimed to evaluate the impact of frailty and polypharmacy, on mortality rates, within 30 months, using a cohort of SHARE participants aged 65 years old or more. Frailty was assessed using a version of Fried's phenotype criteria operationalized to SHARE while polypharmacy was defined as taking five or more drugs per day. We found a prevalence of 40.4% non-frail, 47.3% pre-frail and 12.3% frail participants. Moreover, a prevalence of polypharmacy of 31.3% was observed, being 3 three times more prevalent in frail individuals and two times in pre-frail individuals, when compared with non-frail. Individuals with both conditions had shown higher mortality rates. Comparing with non-polymedicated non-frail individuals all the other conditions are more prone to die within 30 months. Polymedicated older and male participants exhibited also higher mortality rates. This work shows polypharmacy and frailty to be associated with a higher risk of all-cause of mortality and highlights the need to decrease 'unnecessary' polypharmacy to reduce drug-related issues and also the need to assess frailty early to prevent avoidable adverse outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		95	midão,luís	Midão	Luís
89	Frailty Index For Prediction Of Surgical Outcome In Ovarian Cancer: Results Of A Prospective Study.	2021	96	10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.02.012	33608143		96	161	2	396	BACKGROUND: Complete macroscopic tumor resection is the strongest prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer, which requires complex surgery for achievement. Based on the mostly advanced tumor stage and high symptom burden many patients are classified as frail which may limit optimal surgical outcome. Aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive ability of Frailty Index for surgical outcomes in patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled patients with ovarian cancer undergoing cytoreductive surgery. We classified frailty proposed by Mitnitski et al. regarding the cumulative deficit model of frailty. Utilizing Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression, we determined predictive clinical factors for severe postoperative complications. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for overall survival analysis. RESULTS: Out of f 144 enrolled patients, the overall prevalence of frailty based on a Frailty Index >0.26 and Frailty Index >0.15 was 33% and 74%, respectively. The logistic regression shows that frail patients with a Frailty Index >0.26 (Odds ratio (OR): 3.64, 95% CI: 1.34-9.85, p = 0.01), ECOG PS > 1 (OR 6.33, 95% CI:1.31-30.51, p = 0.02) and high surgical complexity score (OR 8.86, 95% CI:1.88-41.76, p = 0.006) had a significant higher risk for severe postoperative complications. According to multivariable cox regression Frailty Index >0.15 (hazard ratio (HR) (HR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.01-3.47, p = 0.048), residual tumor <1 cm (HR 2.75, 95%CI: 1.53-4.99, p = 0.001), residual tumor >1 cm (HR 5.00, 95% CI: 2.74-9.13, p < 0.001) and albumin<35.5 g/dl (HR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.08-3.43, p = 0.03) resulted as significant parameters for poor overall survival. Resulted as significant parameters for poor overall survival. CONCLUSION: Next to surgical complexity score, ECOG PS > 1 and recurrent surgery, Frailty Index >0.26 is associated with severe postoperative complications in patients with ovarian cancer. Besides tumor residuals and low albumin levels a Frailty Index >0.15 predicts poor survival.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		96	Gynecologic Oncology		96	inci,melisa.guelhan	Inci	Melisa Guelhan
90	Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment In Older Adults With Cancer: Recommendations By The Italian Society Of Geriatrics And Gerontology (Sigg).	2021	97	10.1111/eci.13347	32648990		97	51	1	e13347	INTRODUCTION: Optimizing the approach to older adults with cancer is now a priority given the increasing frequency of new cancer diagnoses that are made in the older population. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the gold-standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of frail older persons, and (3) designing person-tailored interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach to older patients with cancer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A widespread use of this standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		97	European Journal Of Clinical Investigation		97	fusco,domenico	Fusco	Domenico

Modern emergency care systems are fast-flowing, using protocols optimised for single-problem presentations. Systems must incorporate individualised care to best serve people with multiple problems. Healthcare quality is typically appraised with service metrics, such as department length of stay and mortality. Worldwide, patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) and patient-reported experience measures (PREM) are increasingly used in research, service development and performance evaluation, paving the ground for their use to support individual clinical decision-making. The PROMs and PREMs are person-centred metrics, which inform healthcare decisions at the individual level and which at the strategic level drive improvement through comparison of interprovider effectiveness. To date, there is no PROM or PREM specifically developed for older people with frailty and emergency care needs.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		98	Zeitschrift Fur Gerontologie Und Geriatrie		98	van oppen,james.d	van Oppen	James D
92	Induction Therapy Strategies In The Transplant-Ineligible Population.	2021	99	10.1097/PPO.0000000000000520	34549907		99	27	3	196	Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy, accounts for ~10% of hematologic malignancies and predominantly affects the older population. It exhibits a heterogeneous biology and a complex genetic phenotype that affect patient prognosis. The treatment of MM has evolved significantly over the last decade with the use of autologous stem cell transplantation and several novel agents. Consequently, outcomes have improved in this time period, with the most impact in younger patients. Management of MM in elderly frail patients requires a thoughtful approach as majority of these patients carry multiple comorbidities and are precluded from high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation-accounting for the more modest improvement in outcomes. Assessing transplant eligibility and performance status is a critical first step. Subsequently, the choice of frontline therapy in transplant-ineligible frail patients must balance efficacy with adverse effects to optimize quality of life. Here, we review the current state of induction regimens in this patient population.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		99	Cancer Journal (Sudbury, Mass.)		99	attar,narsis	Attar	Narsis
93	Epidemiology Of Hpb Malignancy In The Elderly.	2021	100	10.1016/j.ejso.2020.03.222	32360064		100	47	3 Pt A	503	The incidence of hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) cancers is increasing worldwide. Despite improvements in cancer surveillance and earlier access to therapy, these cancers still have poor survival rates, especially in elderly patients. There are several challenges in elucidating the epidemiology of these malignancies especially in view of the heterogeneous exposure to recognised risk factors and the coding systems used. Early diagnosis, crucial to improved survival, remains challenging as many patients present sporadically. Furthermore, the indolent nature of these tumours means they tend to present late, when curative treatments are no longer an option. Importantly, even when patients are diagnosed early and treated with curative intent, recurrence rates remain high. HPB cancers display a heterogenous molecular profile resulting in poorly effective systemic therapies in patients for whom curative treatments cannot be considered. Globally, people now live longer, and it is predicted that the population of individuals older than 85 will double by 2033. With increasing age comes increased cancer risk. There is a plethora of recognised challenges in elderly patients presenting with cancer and this is no different with HPB cancers. Complex co-morbidities including chronic disease, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and increasing psychosocial needs confer an extra layer of complexity in the management of this elderly sub population. The frailty that usually accompanies advancing age often means that patients take longer to recover and develop more complications after cancer therapies. In this article, we review the epidemiology of malignant HPB tumours with a focus on the elderly.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		100	European Journal Of Surgical Oncology: The Journal Of The European Society Of Surgical Oncology And The British Association Of Surgical Oncology		100	pericleous,marinos	Pericleous	Marinos
94	Antithrombotic Strategies In Elderly Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome.	2021	101	10.1016/j.acvd.2020.12.002	33632631		101	114	3	232	Elderly patients represent a growing proportion of the acute coronary syndrome population in Western countries. However, their frequent atypical symptoms at presentation often lead to delays in management and to misdiagnosis. Furthermore, their prognosis is poorer than that of younger patients because of physiological changes in platelet function, haemostasis and fibrinolysis, but also a higher proportion of comorbidities and frailty, both of which increase the risk of recurrent thrombotic and bleeding events. This complex situation, with ischaemic and haemorrhagic risk factors often being intertwined, may lead to confusion about the required treatment strategy, sometimes resulting in inadequate management or even to therapeutic nihilism. It is therefore critical to provide a comprehensive overview of our understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying acute coronary syndrome in elderly patients, and to summarise the results from the latest clinical trials to help decision making for these high-risk patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		101	Archives Of Cardiovascular Diseases		101	dillinger,jean-guillaume	Dillinger	Jean-Guillaume
95	A Narrative Review Of Frailty Assessment In Older Patients At The Emergency Department.	2021	102	10.1097/MEJ.0000000000000811	33883392		102	28	4	266	Optimizing emergency care for the aging population is an important future challenge, as the proportion of older patients at the emergency department (ED) rapidly increases. Older patients, particularly those who are frail, have a high risk of adverse outcomes after an ED visit, such as functional decline, institutionalization, and death. The ED can have a key position in identifying frail older patients who benefit most from comprehensive geriatric care [including delirium preventive measures, early evaluation of after-discharge care, and a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)]. However, performing extensive frailty assessment is not suitable at the ED. Therefore, quick and easy-to-use instruments are needed to identify older patients at risk for adverse outcomes. This narrative review outlines the importance and complexity of frailty assessment at the ED. It aligns the available screening instruments, including clinical judgment as frailty assessment, and summarizes arguments for and against frailty assessment at the ED.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		102	European Journal Of Emergency Medicine: Official Journal Of The European Society For Emergency Medicine		102	van dam,carmen.s	van Dam	Carmen S
96	Biological Aspects Of Aging That Influence Response To Anticancer Treatments.	2021	104	10.1097/SPC.0000000000000536	33399393		104	15	1	29	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer is a disease of older adults, where fitness and frailty are a continuum. This aspect poses unique challenges to the management of cancer in this population. In this article, we review the biological aspects influencing the efficacy and safety of systemic anticancer treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: The organ function decline associated with the ageing process affects multiple systems, including liver, kidney, bone marrow, heart, muscles and central nervous system. These can have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of systemic anticancer agents. Comorbidities also represent a key aspect to consider in decision-making. Renal disease, liver conditions and cardiovascular risk factors are prevalent in this age group and may impact the risk of adverse outcomes in this setting. SUMMARY: The systematic integration of geriatrics principles in the routine management of older adults with cancer is a unique opportunity to address the complexity of this population and is standard of care based on a wide range of benefits. This approach should be multidisciplinary and involve careful discussion with hospital pharmacists.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		104	Current Opinion In Supportive And Palliative Care		104	crimmin,jane	Crimmin	Jane
97	A Systematic Review And Gap Analysis Of Frailty And Oral Health Characteristics In Older Adults: A Call For Clinical Translation.	2021	105	10.1111/ger.12577	34331353		105	38	4	338	OBJECTIVE: This systematic review updates the evidence for association between oral health characteristics and frailty status, identifying gaps in translational dental research and application of frailty assessment into clinical practice. BACKGROUND: Clinicians have little guidance on stage-appropriate dental treatment for medically complex older adults. Oral health characteristics have been associated with frailty status, determined through validated assessment tools representing a concise measure of health. Translation of frailty assessment into dental practice has not been the focus of previous reviews. METHODS: Utilising the PRISMA framework for systematic reviews, a comprehensive database search identified articles describing the association of interest. Those included were cross-sectional or longitudinal, in English, included participants aged 50 years or older, used validated frailty assessments and measured clinically relevant oral health outcomes. From 835 screened articles, 26 full-text articles were eligible for quality appraisal and synthesis. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence ranged from 8.5% to 66.0%. Most studies utilised the Fried frailty criteria. Qualitative synthesis of 17 cross-sectional and nine longitudinal studies demonstrated significant covariate-adjusted association between frailty status and number of teeth, chewing ability, prosthetic characteristics, dental caries, periodontitis, dental utilisation and oral health-related quality of life factors. Variability in findings reflected study sample diversity based on country of study origin, age at recruitment, sample size, frailty assessment type, use of clinical versus self-reported outcome measures and differences in statistical analysis. CONCLUSION: Despite robust evidence of association with oral health characteristics, frailty assessment has yet to be sufficiently applied to translational dental research and clinical practice.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		105	Gerodontology		105	slashcheva,lyubov.d	Slashcheva	Lyubov D
98	Association Between Fear Of Falling And Frailty In Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Systematic Review.	2022	106	10.2147/CIA.S328423	35173427		90	17		129	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Fear of falling (FoF) and frailty are common problems in older adults. FoF can lead to self-imposed restriction of activities and then further decline in physical capacities that predispose older adults to frailty. Evaluating the association of these two geriatric syndromes may be the first step for understanding their complex relationship and might ultimately lead to establishing therapeutic goals and guiding treatments for older adults with frailty. This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence regarding the association between FoF and frailty. METHODS: All the articles that provided information on the association between FoF and frailty were selected from PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and EMBASE in search of relevant papers. Articles reporting information on the association between FoF (exposure) and frailty (outcome), with older adults (age ≥60 years) living in the community (ie, living either at home or in places of residence that do not provide nursing care or rehabilitation) were included. Only original articles with observational design (cross-sectional or longitudinal/cohort) were included. The methodological quality of included articles was evaluated independently by the two assessors through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, respectively. RESULTS: The initial searches found 4,342 articles, of which 10 articles were included in this review: 7 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies, and 1 study with cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The total sample was composed of 6,294 community-dwelling older adults (61.8% women). Among the longitudinal studies, adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.18 (95% CI = 1.02; 1.36) to 9.87 (95% CI = 5.22; 18.68), while the adjusted odds ratios of the cross-sectional studies ranged from 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02; 1.07) to 7.16 (95% CI = 2.34; 21.89). CONCLUSION: FoF increases the risk of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. The knowledge of this association is of utmost importance in clinical practice, since it can help health professionals in the development of rehabilitation, prevention, and health promotion protocols. In addition, these findings can contribute to the development of public health policies and actions aimed at reducing the FoF and consequently the frailty.

99	The Dilemma Of Falls In Older Persons: Never Forget To Investigate The Syncope.	2021	107	10.3390/medicina57060623	34203693		107	57	6	None	Background and objectives: Falls represent a major cause of morbidity, hospitalizations, and mortality in older persons. The identification of risk conditions for falling is crucial. This study investigated the presence of syncope as a possible cause of falls in older persons admitted to a Sub-Acute Care Unit (SACU) with a diagnosis of accidental fall after initial management in an emergency department and acute hospitalization. Materials and methods: A retrospective monocentric study of patients aged ≥65 years, consecutively admitted to a SACU with a diagnosis of fall-related trauma. All patients underwent a complete assessment of the index event and clinical status. Patients were categorized into three groups according to the identified cause of falls: (1) transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC), (2) unexplained fall (UF), and (3) definite accidental fall (AF). Results: A total of 100 patients were evaluated. T-LOC was present in 36 patients, UF in 37, and AF in 27. Of the 36 patients with T-LOC, a probable origin was identified in most cases (n = 33, 91%), 19 subjects (53%) had orthostatic hypotension, 9 (25%) a cardiac relevant disturbance, 2 (6%) a reproduced vaso-vagal syncope, 2 (6%) severe anemia, and 1 (3%) severe hypothyroidism. The T-LOC group was older and more clinically complex than the other groups. Conclusion: In older patients who recently experienced a fall event, the prevalence of syncope is relevant. In frail and clinically complex patients with falls, the identification of the underlying cause is pivotal and can be achieved through prolonged monitoring and a comprehensive assessment of the person.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		107	Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)		107	perego,francesca	Perego	Francesca
100	Frailty Predicts Outcome Of Partial Nephrectomy And Guides Treatment Decision Towards Active Surveillance And Tumor Ablation.	2021	108	10.1007/s00345-020-03556-7	33515329		108	39	8	2843	PURPOSE: To examine frailty and comorbidity as predictors of outcome of nephron sparing surgery (NSS) and as decision tools for identifying candidates for active surveillance (AS) or tumor ablation (TA). METHODS: Frailty and comorbidity were assessed using the modified frailty index of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (11-CSHA) and the age-adjusted Charlson-Comorbidity Index (aaCCI) as well as albumin and the radiological skeletal-muscle-index (SMI) in a cohort of n = 447 patients with localized renal masses. Renal tumor anatomy was classified according to the RENAL nephrometry system. Regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of surgical outcome of patients undergoing NSS as well as to identify possible influencing factors of patients undergoing alternative therapies (AS/TA). RESULTS: Overall 409 patient underwent NSS while 38 received AS or TA. Patients undergoing TA/AS were more likely to be frail or comorbid compared to patients undergoing NSS (aaCCI: p < 0.001, 11-CSHA: p < 0.001). Gender and tumor complexity did not vary between patients of different treatment approach. 11-CSHA and aaCCI were identified as independent predictors of major postoperative complications (11-CSHA ≥ 0.27: OR = 3.6, p = 0.001) and hospital re-admission (aaCCI ≥ 6: OR = 4.93, p = 0.003) in the NSS cohort. No impact was found for albumin levels and SMI. An aaCCI > 6 and/or 11-CSHA ≥ 0.27 (OR = 9.19, p < 0.001), a solitary kidney (OR = 5.43, p = 0.005) and hypoalbuminemia (OR = 4.6, p = 0.009), but not tumor complexity, were decisive factors to undergo AS or TA rather than NSS. CONCLUSION: In patients with localized renal masses, frailty and comorbidity indices can be useful to predict surgical outcome and support decision-making towards AS or TA.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		108	World Journal Of Urology		108	walach,m.t	Walach	M T
101	Strategies To Simplify Complex Medication Regimens.	2021	109	10.31128/AJGP-04-20-5322	33543163		109	50	1-2	43	BACKGROUND: Older people use increasingly complex medication regimens. Complex regimens are challenging to administer, particularly for those with cognitive impairment, frailty, poor eyesight or limited dexterity. Complex regimens have been linked to non-adherence, medication errors and hospital admissions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe strategies to reduce the complexity of medication regimens in community and residential aged care settings. DISCUSSION: Medication regimen simplification is the process of reducing medication burden through strategies such as consolidating dosing times, standardising routes of administration, using long-acting rather than shorter-acting formulations, and switching to combination products in place of single-ingredient products. Obtaining a best possible medication history, ensuring appropriateness of current therapy, and deprescribing are important steps prior to implementing regimen simplification. Implementing such strategies should be based on a discussion and consideration of patient preferences, and include clinical judgement to limit the risk of unintended consequences for patients or carers.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		109	Australian Journal Of General Practice		109	bell,j.simon	Bell	J Simon
102	The Effect Of Orthostatic Hypotension Detected Pre-Operatively On Post-Operative Outcome.	2021	110	10.1111/jgs.16966	33314116		110	69	3	767	BACKGROUND: Exacerbation of or new onset orthostatic hypotension in perioperative patients can occur. There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery. The implications for post-operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of post-operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: Supine and 1-minute and 3-minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post-operative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20 mmHg or more and/or 10 mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within ~3 minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Whilst all patients included had a 1-minute standing blood pressure assessment (N = 170), 3-minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). Nevertheless, one-quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65 years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to surgery within the planned study timescale (N = 143/170; 84.1%). Nevertheless, patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital post-operatively and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness and/or dizziness documented (un-prompted) in their notes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with orthostatic hypotension. These risks are not confined to those with a pre-existing dysautonomia diagnosis.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		110	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		110	hogan,alexandra.m	Hogan	Alexandra M
103	Immune Response To Covid-19 In Older Adults.	2021	111	10.1016/j.healun.2021.04.017	34140221		111	40	10	1082	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to emerge in the human population in last two decades. SARS-CoV-2 spread from Wuhan, China, across the globe, causing an unprecedented public healthcare crisis. The virus showed remarkable age dependent pathology, with symptoms resembling common cold in most adults and children while causing more severe respiratory distress and significant mortality in older and frail humans. Even before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak infectious diseases represented one of the major causes of death of older adults. Loss of immune function and reduced protection from infectious agents with age - immunosenescence - is a result of complex mechanisms affecting production and maintenance of immune cells as well as the initiation, maintenance and termination of properly directed immune responses. Here we briefly discuss the current knowledge on how this process affects age-dependent outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		111	The Journal Of Heart And Lung Transplantation: The Official Publication Of The International Society For Heart Transplantation		111	jergović,mladen	Jergović	Mladen
104	Pre-Operative Frailty Is Predictive Of Adverse Post-Operative Outcomes In Colorectal Cancer Patients.	2021	112	10.1111/ans.16319	32975018		112	91	3	379	BACKGROUND: An increasing number of elderly patients are presenting for elective surgery. Pre-operative risk assessment in this population is inexact due to the complex interplay between age, comorbidity and functional status. Frailty assessment may provide a surrogate measure of a patient's physiological reserve and aid operative decision-making. The aim of this study is to determine the association between pre-operative frailty, as assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale, and post-operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: A prospective analysis of 86 patients over the age of 65 undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery at a tertiary centre between October 2017 and October 2018 was performed. Frailty assessment was conducted pre-operatively using the Edmonton Frail Scale. Primary outcomes included length of stay and post-operative complication rates. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the influence of frailty on post-operative outcomes including mortality, prolonged hospital admission, complication rates and quality of life. RESULTS: Of 86 patients, 12 (14.0%) were identified as frail. Frailty was associated with a significantly increased median length of stay (20 days versus 6 days, incidence rate ratio 2.83, P < 0.01) and a significantly increased risk of major post-operative complications (50.0% versus 6.7%, odds ratio 13.8, P < 0.01). Frailty was not associated with a significant reduction in quality of life scores at 30 and 90 days post-operatively. CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with adverse post-operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. Frailty assessment is an important component of pre-operative risk assessment and may identify targets for pre-operative optimisation.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		112	Anz Journal Of Surgery		112	richards,simon.j.g	Richards	Simon J G
105	Polypharmacy In Chronic Neurological Diseases: Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia And Parkinson'S Disease.	2021	113	10.2174/1381612827666210728102832	34323180		113	27	38	4008	Polypharmacy is an important aspect of medication management and particularly affects elderly and chronically ill people. Patients with dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), or multiple sclerosis (MS) are at high risk of multi medication due to their complex symptomatology. Our aim was to provide an overview of different definitions of polypharmacy and to present the current state of research on polypharmacy in patients with dementia, PD, or MS. The most common definition of polypharmacy in the literature is the concomitant use of ≥5 medications (quantitative definition approach). Polypharmacy rates of up to >50% have been reported for patients with dementia, PD, or MS, although MS patients are on average significantly younger than those with dementia or PD. The main predictor of polypharmacy is the complex symptom profile of these neurological disorders. Potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), drug-drug interactions, poor treatment adherence, severe disease course, cognitive impairment, hospitalisation, poor quality of life, frailty, and mortality have been associated with polypharmacy in patients with dementia, PD, or MS. For patients with polypharmacy, either the avoidance of PIM (selective deprescribing) or the substitution of PIM with more suitable drugs (appropriate polypharmacy) is recommended to achieve a more effective therapeutic management.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		113	Current Pharmaceutical Design		113	frahm,niklas	Frahm	Niklas
106	Describing The Relationship Between Atrial Fibrillation And Frailty: Clinical Implications And Open Research Questions.	2021	114	10.1016/j.exger.2021.111455	34153440		28	152		111455	In the recent years a lot of attention has been gathered by the issue of frailty outside the boundaries of the geriatric medicine, for example in the field of cardiovascular medicine. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is known as a very common cardiological condition, often burdened by high level of clinical complexity. Aim of this narrative review is to examine the most relevant evidence about the relationship between frailty and AF, focusing also on its impact on clinical management and natural history of patients with this condition. Data reported underline how a relevant relationship exists between these two conditions, even though the burden of frailty among AF cohorts is still unclear. Frailty seems to affect the clinical management, even though no definitive data are yet available. Lastly, frailty significantly increases the risk of all-cause mortality but it's still unclear the impact on thromboembolic and bleeding events. Despite several data are already available, more research is still needed to fully elucidate the relationship between these two clinical entities.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		28	Experimental Gerontology		114	proietti,marco	Proietti	Marco
107	Cognitive Function And Amyloid Marker In Frail Older Adults: The Cogfrail Cohort Study.	2021	115	10.14283/jfa.2020.57	33575706		12	10	2	160	BACKGROUND: Frailty and cognitive impairment are common manifestations of the ageing process and are closely related. But the mechanisms linking aging, physical frailty, and cognitive disorders, are complex and remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aim to explore the role of cerebral amyloid pathology, but also a range of nutritional, physical, biological or brain-aging marker in the development of cognitive frailty. METHOD: COGFRAIL study is a monocentric prospective study of frail older patients with an objective cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale global score at 0.5 or 1). Three-hundred-and-twenty-one patients are followed up every 6 months, for 2 years. Clinical assessment at baseline and during follow-up included frailty, physical, mood, sensory, nutritional, and cognitive assessment (with a set of neuropsychological tests). Cerebral amyloid pathology is measured by amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or amyloid-β-1-42 level in cerebrospinal fluid. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, measurement of body composition using Dual X Ray Absorptiometry and blood sampling are performed. The main outcome of the study is to assess the prevalence of positive cerebral amyloid status according to amyloid PET or amyloid-β-1-42 level CSF. Secondary outcomes included biological, nutritional, MRI imaging, cognitive, clinical, physical and body composition markers to better understand the mechanisms of cognitive frailty. PERSPECTIVE: COGFRAIL study will give the opportunity to better understand the link between Gerosciences, frailty, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease, and to better characterize the physical and cognitive trajectories of frail older adults according to their amyloid status. Understanding the relationship between physical frailty and cognitive impairment is a prerequisite for the development of new interventions that could prevent and treat both conditions.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		12	The Journal Of Frailty & Aging		115	sourdet,s	Sourdet	S
108	Ongoing Research Protocols For The Pharmacological Treatment Of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms In Dementia.	2021	80	10.14283/jfa.2020.36	33331618		12	10	1	22	The implementation of effective interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) is perceived as one of the most pressing research priorities in the field of dementia and one of the main unmet needs from the perspective of affected individuals and their caregivers and relatives. Nevertheless, to date, only a relatively marginal part of dementia research has focused on NPS. This study aimed to describe and discuss the state of the art concerning the identification and development of new pharmacological treatments for NPS in dementia. A review of 320 ongoing phase 1, 2, 3, and 4 protocols registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database was performed. All the trials enrolling patients with dementia were selected. Only studies adopting clinical measures of NPS frequency and/or severity as primary outcome were retained and analyzed. Overall, only a minority of ongoing phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 protocols on dementia (i.e., 9.0%) is primarily targeting NPS. Most of these studies are adopting a placebo-controlled parallel assignment design, testing oral compounds, and targeting specific NPS (mostly agitation and/or aggression). A total of 3,445 subjects with dementia will tentatively be recruited in these trials. The methodologies adopted in these studies, the characteristics of the tested interventions, the eligibility criteria, and the operational definitions of NPS are presented and discussed. The relevance of NPS is not yet matched by an adequate research effort. The current tendency at privileging disease-modifying approaches and other symptoms of dementia and the methodological complexity of studying NPS are still substantially contributing to the gap between research activities and clinical needs.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		12	The Journal Of Frailty & Aging		80	canevelli,m	Canevelli	M
109	Aspirin And Statin Therapy For Primary Prevention Of Cardiovascular Disease In Older Adults.	2022	117	10.1136/heartjnl-2021-320154	34764212		117	108	14	1090	The value of primary preventative therapies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults (age ≥75 years) is less certain than in younger patients. There is a lack of quality evidence in older adults due to underenrolment in pivotal trials. While aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in primary prevention of CVD in older adults, statins may be efficacious. However, it is unclear which patient subgroups may benefit most, and guidelines differ between expert panels. Three relevant geriatric conditions (cognitive impairment, functional impairment and polypharmacy) may influence therapeutic decision making; for example, baseline frailty may affect statin efficacy, and some have advocated for deprescription in this scenario. Evidence regarding statins and incident functional decline are mixed, and vigilance for adverse effects is important, especially in the setting of polypharmacy. However, aspirin has not been shown to affect incident cognitive or functional decline, and its lack of efficacy extends to patients with baseline cognitive impairment or frailty. Ultimately, the utility of primary preventative therapies for CVD in older adults depends on potential lifetime benefit. Rather than basing treatment decisions on absolute risk alone, consideration of comorbidities, polypharmacy and life expectancy should play a significant role in decision making. Coronary calcium score and new tools for risk stratification validated in older adults that account for the competing risk of death may aid in evaluating potential benefits. Given the complexity of therapeutic decisions in this context, shared decision making provides an important framework.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		117	Heart (British Cardiac Society)		117	montgomery,sophie	Montgomery	Sophie
110	Identification Of Traumatic Acid As A Potential Plasma Biomarker For Sarcopenia Using A Metabolomics-Based Approach.	2022	119	10.1002/jcsm.12895	34939349		119	13	1	276	BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and has not been well explored. Identifying biomarkers is a promising strategy for exploring the mechanism of sarcopenia. This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers of sarcopenia through a metabolomic analysis of plasma metabolites in elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) vs. younger adults (<65 years of age). METHODS: Of the 168 candidates in the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and Frailty Study of Elderly Outpatients, 24 elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) with sarcopenia were age and sex matched with 24 elderly subjects without sarcopenia. In addition, 24 younger adults were recruited for comparison. Muscle strength, gait speed, and metabolic and inflammatory parameters, including plasma tumour necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, irisin, and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) levels were assessed. Metabolomic analysis was carried out using the plasma metabolites. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were enrolled, including 10 (41.6%) men and 14 (58.3%) women in both groups of elderly subjects. The median ages of elderly subjects with and without sarcopenia were 82 (range: 67-88) and 81.5 (range: 67-87) years, respectively. Among the 242 plasma metabolic peaks analysed among these three groups, traumatic acid was considered as a sarcopenia-related metabolite. The plasma traumatic acid signal intensity level was significantly higher in elderly subjects with sarcopenia than in elderly subjects without sarcopenia [591.5 (inter-quartile range, IQR: 491.5-664.5) vs. 430.0 (IQR: 261.0-599.5), P = 0.0063]. The plasma concentrations of traumatic acid were 15.8 (IQR: 11.5-21.7), 21.1 (IQR: 16.0-25.8), and 24.3 (IQR: 18.0-29.5) ppb in younger adults [age range: 23-37 years, 12 (50%) men], elderly subjects without sarcopenia, and elderly subjects with sarcopenia, respectively, thereby depicting an increasing tendency (P for trend = 0.034). This pattern was similar to that of GDF-15, a recognized sarcopenia-related factor. Plasma traumatic acid concentrations were also positively correlated with the presence of hypertension (r = 0.25, P = 0.034), glucose AC (r = 0.34, P = 0.0035), creatinine (r = 0.40, P = 0.0006), and GDF-15 levels (r = 0.25, P = 0.0376), but negatively correlated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-simplify-glomerular filtration rate (r = -0.50, P < 0.0001). Similarly, plasma GDF-15 concentrations were associated with these factors. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic acid might represent a potential plasma biomarker of sarcopenia. However, further studies are needed to validate the results and investigate the underlying mechanisms.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		119	Journal Of Cachexia, Sarcopenia And Muscle		119	tsai,jaw-shiun	Tsai	Jaw-Shiun
111	The Frail-Nh Scale: Systematic Review Of The Use, Validity And Adaptations For Frailty Screening In Nursing Homes.	2021	123	10.1007/s12603-021-1694-3	34866147		123	25	10	1205	OBJECTIVES: To investigate frailty prevalence, cross-sectional associations, predictive validity, concurrent validity, and cross-cultural adaptations of the FRAIL-NH scale. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Frail residents living in nursing homes. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2015 to June 2021 for primary studies that used the FRAIL-NH scale, irrespective of study designs and publication language. RESULTS: Overall, 40 studies conducted across 20 countries utilized the FRAIL-NH scale; majority in Australia (n=14), followed by China (n=6), United States (n=3), and Spain (n=3). The scale has been translated and back-translated into Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. Various cut-offs have been used, with ≥2 and ≥6 being the most common cut-offs for frail and most frail, respectively. When defined using these cut-offs, frailty prevalence varied from 15.1-79.5% (frail) to 28.5-75.0% (most frail). FRAIL-NH predicted falls (n=2), hospitalization or length of stay (n=4), functional or cognitive decline (n=4), and mortality (n=9) over a median follow-up of 12 months. FRAIL-NH has been compared to 16 other scales, and was correlated with Fried's phenotype (FP), Frailty Index (FI), and FI-Lab. Four studies reported fair-to-moderate agreements between FRAIL-NH and FI, FP, and the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. Ten studies assessed the sensitivity and specificity of different FRAIL-NH cut-offs, with ≥8 having the highest sensitivity (94.1%) and specificity (82.8%) for classifying residents as frail based on FI, while two studies reported an optimal cut-off of ≥2 based on FI and FP, respectively. CONCLUSION: In seven years, the FRAIL-NH scale has been applied in 20 countries and adapted into three languages. Despite being applied with a range of cut-offs, FRAIL-NH was associated with higher care needs and demonstrated good agreement with other well-established but more complex scales. FRAIL-NH was predictive of adverse outcomes across different settings, highlighting its value in guiding care for frail residents in nursing homes.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		123	The Journal Of Nutrition, Health & Aging		123	liau,s.j	Liau	S J
112	Best Care For Older People With Epilepsy: A Scoping Review.	2021	124	10.1016/j.seizure.2020.12.007	33450705		124	85		70	There are two peaks of diagnosis of epilepsy: in childhood and in people over 65. Older people may have complex needs like co-morbidity, polypharmacy, frailty, and social isolation. This scoping review focusses on the care of older people with epilepsy beyond diagnosis and medical treatment. We sought to identify areas within the UK health service needing development either in clinical practice or through further research. The search returned 4864 papers with 33 papers included in the review. The papers were grouped into psychosocial, self-management and services themes. Only one randomised controlled trial was found. Research was mainly based on cohort and case-control studies. Older people require more information to self-manage epilepsy and more psychological support to help with symptoms of anxiety and depression. People reported experiencing stigma and a reluctance to disclose their condition. This may increase the risk of isolation and difficulties in managing epilepsy. Studies reported that older people are referred less to neurologists, suggesting there may be a gap in care provision compared to younger people. Generalist health professionals may be better placed to provide holistic care, but they may need additional training to alleviate uncertainties in managing epilepsy. Care plans could help provide information, particularly for co-morbidity, but few had one. Our findings highlight psychological and self-management needs for managing epilepsy in older people. Health service staff may require upskilling to shift epilepsy management from neurologists to generalists. More research is needed regarding psychological and self-management interventions, particularly in the form of randomised controlled trials.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		124	Seizure		124	wojewodka,gabriella	Wojewodka	Gabriella
113	Frailty Index, Hospital Admission And Number Of Days Spent In Hospital In Nursing Home Residents: Results From The Incur Study.	2021	125	10.1007/s12603-020-1561-7	33491028		123	25	2	155	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive capacity of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood) for hospital admission (HA) and number of days spent in hospital (DSH) among nursing home residents. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data are from a longitudinal cohort study, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents (INCUR), of 768 elder people (75.4% women) living in 13 nursing homes in France. MEASUREMENTS: The FI was computed taking into account 30 possible deficits at the baseline visit. Hospital admissions were defined as all urgent and involuntary admissions including unplanned readmissions. The length of stay was the total number of days spent by the resident in the hospital. Cox proportional hazard models in the presence of competing risks (death) were performed to study the relationship between the FI and HA over a 12-month follow-up. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was performed to study the association between the FI and DSH. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 86.7 (standard deviation [SD] 6.9) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11). At the end of the follow-up, 238 (30.9%) HA events were recorded. Positive associations of the FI with DSH and HA were reported (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.020-1.297, p=0.02 and OR 1.209 (1.075 - 1.359, p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The FI is a strong predictor of negative health-related outcomes as HA and DSH events, even with very old and complex nursing home residents.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		123	The Journal Of Nutrition, Health & Aging		125	simo,n	Simo	N
114	Aging Of Enteric Neuromuscular Systems In Gastrointestinal Tract.	2022	126	10.1111/nmo.14352	35279912		126	34	6	e14352	BACKGROUND: Aging is a complex biological process and associated with a progressive decline in functions of most organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Age-related GI motor disorders/dysfunctions include esophageal reflux, dysphagia, constipation, fecal incontinence, reduced compliance, and accommodation. Although the incidence and severity of these diseases and conditions increase with age, they are often underestimated due in part to nonspecific and variable symptoms and lack of sufficient medical attention. They negatively affect quality of life and predispose the elderly to other diseases, sarcopenia, and frailty. The mechanisms underlying aging-associated GI dysfunctions remain unclear, and there is limited data examining the effect of aging on GI motor functions. Many studies on aging-associated changes to cells within the tunica muscularis including enteric neurons, smooth muscles, and interstitial cells have proposed that cell loss and/or molecular changes may be involved in the pathogenesis of age-related GI motor disorders/dysfunctions. There is also evidence that the aging contributes to phenotypic changes in innate immune cells, which are physically and functionally linked to other cells in the tunica muscularis and can alter GI (patho) physiology. However, various patterns of changes have been reported, some of which are contradictory, indicating a need for additional work in this area. PURPOSE: Although GI infection due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bleeding, and cancers are also important and common problems in the elderly patients, this mini-review focuses on data obtained from enteric neuromuscular aging research with the goal of better understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of enteric neuromuscular aging to enhance future therapy.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		126	Neurogastroenterology And Motility: The Official Journal Of The European Gastrointestinal Motility Society		126	nguyen,vy.truong.thuy	Nguyen	Vy Truong Thuy
115	Frailty Assessment In The Emergency Department For Risk Stratification Of Covid-19 Patients Aged ≥80 Years.	2021	128	10.1016/j.jamda.2021.07.005	34364846		128	22	9	1845	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in a cohort of adults aged ≥80 years, the overlapping effect of clinical severity, comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and frailty, for the in-hospital death risk stratification of COVID-19 older patients since emergency department (ED) admission. DESIGN: Single-center prospective observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in the ED of a teaching hospital that is a referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We enrolled all patients with aged ≥80 years old consecutively admitted to the ED between April 2020 and March 2021. METHODS: Clinical variables assessed in the ED were evaluated for the association with all-cause in-hospital death. Evaluated parameters were severity of disease, frailty, comorbidities, cognitive impairment, delirium, and dependency in daily life activities. Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for poor outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 729 patients aged ≥80 years were enrolled [median age 85 years (interquartile range 82-89); 346 were males (47.3%)]. According to the Clinical Frailty Scale, 61 (8.4%) were classified as fit, 417 (57.2%) as vulnerable, and 251 (34.4%) as frail. Severe disease [hazard ratio (HR) 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.59], ≥3 comorbidities (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.11-2.13), male sex (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.87), and frailty (HR 6.93, 95% CI 1.69-28.27) for vulnerable and an overall HR of 12.55 (95% CI 2.96-53.21) for frail were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The ED approach to older patients with COVID-19 should take into account the functional and clinical characteristics of patients being admitted. A sole evaluation based on the clinical severity and the presence of comorbidities does not reflect the complexity of this population. A comprehensive evaluation based on clinical severity, multimorbidity, and frailty could effectively predict the clinical risk of in-hospital death for patients with COVID-19 aged ≥80 years at the time of ED presentation.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		128	Journal Of The American Medical Directors Association		128	covino,marcello	Covino	Marcello
116	Functional Performance After Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.	2021	129	10.1177/15266028211028222	34190633		129	28	6	852	PURPOSE: Complex endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedures provide a treatment option for patients with aortic aneurysms involving visceral branches. Good technical results and short-term outcomes have been reported. Whether complex EVAR provides acceptable functional outcomes is not clear. The current study aims to describe postoperative functional outcomes in complex EVAR patients-an older and relatively frail patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed, using data from a computerized database of consecutive patients who underwent complex EVAR in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC, The Netherlands) between July 2013 and September 2020. As of May 2017, patients scheduled for complex EVAR were referred to a geriatric care pathway to determine (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scores at baseline and, if informed consent was given, after 12 months. For the total patient group, adverse functional performance outcomes were: discharge to a nursing home and 12-month mortality. For the patients included in geriatric follow-up, the additional outcome was the incidence of functional decline (defined by a ≥2 point increase in (I)ADL-score) at 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients underwent complex EVAR, of which 68 (82.9%) were male. Mean age was 73.3 years (SD=6.3). Within 30 days postsurgery, 6 patients (7.3%) died. Mortality within 12 months for the total patient group was 14.6% (n=12). After surgery, no patients had to be discharged to a nursing home. Fifteen patients (18.3%) were discharged to a rehabilitation center. Twenty-three patients gave informed consent and were included in geriatric follow-up. Five patients (21.7%) presented functional decline 12 months postsurgery and 4 patients had died (17.4%) by that time. This means that 39.1% of the patients in the care pathway suffered an adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the only study that examined functional performance after complex EVAR, using a prospectively maintained database. No patients were newly discharged to a nursing home and functional performance results at 12 months are promising. Future multidisciplinary research should focus on determining which patients are most prone to deterioration of function, so that efforts can be directed toward preventing postoperative functional decline.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		129	Journal Of Endovascular Therapy: An Official Journal Of The International Society Of Endovascular Specialists		129	warmerdam,britt.w.c.m	Warmerdam	Britt W C M
117	Challenges In Geriatric Oncology-A Surgeon'S Perspective.	2022	130	10.3390/curroncol29020058	35200558		130	29	2	659	As our global population ages, we will see more cancer diagnoses in older adults. Surgery is an important treatment modality for solid tumours, forming the majority of all cancers. However, the management of older adults with cancer can be more complex compared to their younger counterparts. This narrative review will outline the current challenges facing older adults with cancer and potential solutions. The challenges facing older adults with cancer are complex and include lack of high-level clinical trials targeting older adults and selection of the right patient for surgery. This may be standard surgical treatment, minimally invasive surgery or alternative therapies (no surgery) which can be local or systemic. The next challenge is to identify the individual patient's vulnerabilities to allow them to be maximally optimised for treatment. Prehabilitation has been shown to be of benefit in some cancer settings but uniform guidance across all surgical specialties is required. Greater awareness of geriatric conditions amongst surgical oncologists and integration of geriatric assessment into a surgical clinic are potential solutions. Enhanced recovery programmes tailored to older adults could reduce postoperative functional decline. Ultimately, the greatest challenge an older adult with cancer may face is the mindset of their treating clinicians-a shared care approach between surgical oncologists and geriatricians is required.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		130	Current Oncology (Toronto, Ont.)		130	parks,ruth	Parks	Ruth
118	Clinical Trials In Older People.	2022	131	10.1093/ageing/afab282	35526845		131	51	5	None	Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) usually provide the best evidence for treatments and management. Historically, older people have often been excluded from clinical medication trials due to age, multimorbidity and disabilities. The situation is improving, but still the external validity of many trials may be questioned. Individuals participating in trials are generally less complex than many patients seen in geriatric clinics. Recruitment and retention of older participants are particular challenges in clinical trials. Multiple channels are needed for successful recruitment, and especially individuals experiencing frailty, multimorbidity and disabilities require support to participate. Cognitive decline is common, and often proxies are needed to sign informed consent forms. Older people may fall ill or become tired during the trial, and therefore, special support and empathic study personnel are necessary for the successful retention of participants. Besides the risk of participants dropping out, several other pitfalls may result in underestimating or overestimating the intervention effects. In nonpharmacological trials, imperfect blinding is often unavoidable. Interventions must be designed intensively and be long enough to reveal differences between the intervention and control groups, as control participants must still receive the best normal care available. Outcome measures should be relevant to older people, sensitive to change and targeted to the specific population in the trial. Missing values in measurements are common and should be accounted for when designing the trial. Despite the obstacles, RCTs in geriatrics must be promoted. Reliable evidence is needed for the successful treatment, management and care of older people.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		131	pitkala,kaisu.h	Pitkala	Kaisu H
119	A Multi-Domain Group-Based Intervention To Promote Physical Activity, Healthy Nutrition, And Psychological Wellbeing In Older People With Losses In Intrinsic Capacity: Amicope Development Study.	2021	132	10.3390/ijerph18115979	34199566		15	18	11	None	"The World Health Organization has developed the Integrated Care of Older People (ICOPE) strategy, a program based on the measurement of intrinsic capacity (IC) as ""the composite of all physical and mental attributes on which an individual can draw"". Multicomponent interventions appear to be the most effective approach to enhance IC and to prevent frailty and disability since adapted physical activity is the preventive intervention that has shown the most evidence in the treatment of frailty and risk of falls. Our paper describes the development of a multi-domain group-based intervention addressed to older people living in the community, aimed at improving and/or maintaining intrinsic capacity by means of promoting physical activity, healthy nutrition, and psychological wellbeing in older people. The process of intervention development is described following the Guidance for reporting intervention development studies in health research (GUIDED). The result of this study is the AMICOPE intervention (Aptitude Multi-domain group-based intervention to improve and/or maintain IC in Older PEople) built upon the ICOPE framework and described following the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) guidelines. The intervention consists of 12 face-to-face sessions held weekly for 2.5 h over three months and facilitated by a pair of health and social care professionals. This study represents the first stage of the UK Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating a complex intervention. The next step should be carrying out a feasibility study for the AMICOPE intervention and, at a later stage, assessing the effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial."		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		132	blancafort alias,sergi	Blancafort Alias	Sergi

Octogenarians with symptomatic arrhythmias have unique management challenges due to their frailty, complex drug interactions, cognitive impairment, and competing comorbidities. The management decisions are further complicated by the lack of randomized evidence to guide treatment. AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive literature review was undertaken to outline various tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and their management, the role of cardiac implantable electronic devices, cardiac ablations, and specific geriatric arrhythmia considerations as recommended in international guidelines. EXPERT OPINION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is arguably the most important arrhythmia in the elderly and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis of AF, potentially with smart devices (wearables), has the potential to reduce the incidence of stroke, systemic emboli, and the risk of dementia. Bradyarrhythmias have a high incidence in the elderly as well, often requiring implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Leadless pacemakers implanted directly into the right ventricle are great options for gaining traction in elderly patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		85	Expert Review Of Cardiovascular Therapy		134	murray,kyle	Murray	Kyle
121	Incorporating Pharmacokinetic Data Into Personalised Prescribing For Older People: Challenges And Opportunities.	2021	135	10.1007/s41999-020-00437-5	33417165		83	12	3	435	"PURPOSE: We discuss the known age-associated changes in drug metabolism and elimination, the potential use of this information when selecting specific therapeutic strategies in older patients, and the steps required to fill the knowledge gap in this field. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review that encapsulates the current knowledge regarding the main age-associated changes in drug metabolism and elimination and discusses their possible inclusion in current and future personalised prescribing tools for the older patient population. RESULTS: Despite some progress in this field, the lack of specific information regarding the impact of frailty, pharmacogenomics, and drug-drug, drug-disease, and organ-organ interactions, particularly in subjects > 80 years, currently prevents the routine incorporation of pharmacokinetic data, barring measures of renal function, into personalised prescribing tools. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of pharmacokinetic data into personalised prescribing, an approach based on the consideration of a number of patient's characteristics when selecting the right drug(s) and dose regimen(s) to maximize effectiveness and limit toxicity, remains a hypothetical construct in geriatric care. Pending the inclusion of frail and complex older patients in pre- and post-marketing studies, a better understanding of the key pharmacokinetic alterations of common medications in ""real-life"" patients, together with the implementation of effective strategies tackling inappropriate prescribing, is likely to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare utilization in the older population."		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		83	European Geriatric Medicine		135	mangoni,arduino.a	Mangoni	Arduino A
122	Interventions To Reduce Polypharmacy And Optimize Medication Use In Older Adults With Cancer.	2021	136	10.1016/j.jgo.2020.12.007	33353854		136	12	6	863	The use of polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) is an increasingly common, concerning public health issue in older adults, and a concurrent cancer diagnosis only further escalates the prevalence and complexity. Polypharmacy and PIM use has been associated with negative patient outcomes, including falls, chemotherapy toxicities and other adverse events, postoperative complications, frailty, functional impairment, and shortened survival. Despite the recognition of the harms, the prevalence of polypharmacy and PIM use continues to rise due to a lack of standardized identification and intervention methods. Efforts to reduce the prevalence have included use of explicit PIM screening tools (e.g., Beers criteria), comprehensive medication reviews, and deprescribing algorithms. However, these efforts are not widespread and the research on the effectiveness of such interventions is limited. To better understand what is known, this paper summarized available studies evaluating the effect of interventions on reducing the burden of polypharmacy/PIMs and provided recommendations to guide further practice models to reduce the negative consequences associated with polypharmacy and PIM use. Furthermore, we aim to establish a framework for clinical practice and to highlight areas for future intervention-based research to improve outcomes for older adults with cancer.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		136	Journal Of Geriatric Oncology		136	barlow,ashley	Barlow	Ashley
123	The Features Of The Typical Traumatic Brain Injury Patient In The Icu Are Changing: What Will This Mean For The Intensivist?	2021	137	10.1097/MCC.0000000000000814	33534257		137	27	2	80	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the key features and epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and how they may be changing, with an emphasis on how this may affect care in the intensive care unit. RECENT FINDINGS: TBI has been traditionally perceived as occurring mainly in a younger, predominantly male population injured in high velocity motor vehicle crashes or assaults. However, there are an increasing number of patients over 65 years who have sustained a TBI secondary to low velocity falls. Considering the effects of frailty, comorbidities and extracranial injuries is important when making management decisions. Mild TBI comprises a third of those admitted and as a significant proportion may have poor outcomes secondary to their TBI they should be assessed to ensure appropriate follow-up. Multimodal monitoring may offer a way in the future to offer more personalised management to this very complex and heterogeneous patient group. SUMMARY: This review highlights the urgent need to develop more age-inclusive TBI consensus management guidelines aimed at improving short- and long-term outcomes for the large and growing TBI population. Being elderly does not necessarily portend a poor outcome, and more research is needed to better triage, guide management and prognosticate on these patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		137	Current Opinion In Critical Care		137	newcombe,virginia.f.j	Newcombe	Virginia F J
124	Factors Associated With The Detection Of Inappropriate Prescriptions In Older People: A Prospective Cohort.	2021	139	10.3390/ijerph182111310	34769827		15	18	21	None	(1) Background: Ageing is associated with complex and dynamic changes leading to multimorbidity and, therefore, polypharmacy. The main objectives were to study an older community-dwelling cohort, to detect inappropriate prescriptions (IP) applying the Patient-Centred Prescription model, and to evaluate the most associated factors. (2) Methods: This was a prospective, descriptive, and observational study conducted from June 2019 to October 2020 on patients ≥ 65 years with multimorbidity who lived in the community. Demographic, clinical and pharmacological data were assessed. Variables assessed were: degree of frailty, using the Frail-VIG index; therapeutical complexity and anticholinergic and sedative burden; and the number of chronic drugs to determine polypharmacy or excessive polypharmacy. Finally, a medication review was carried out through the application of the Patient-Centred Prescription model. We used univariate and multivariate regression to identify the factors associated with IP. (3) Results: We recruited 428 patients (66.6% women; mean age 85.5, SD 7.67). A total of 50.9% of them lived in a nursing home; the mean Barthel Index was 49.93 (SD 32.14), and 73.8% of patients suffered some degree of cognitive impairment. The prevalence of frailty was 92.5%. Up to 90% of patients had at least one IP. An increase in IP prevalence was detected when the Frail-VIG index increased (p < 0.05). With the multivariate model, the relationship of polypharmacy with IP detection stands out above all. (4) Conclusions: 90% of patients presented one IP or more, and this situation can be detected through the PCP model. Factors with higher association with IP were frailty and polypharmacy.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		139	molist-brunet,núria	Molist-Brunet	Núria
125	Social Technology: An Interdisciplinary Approach To Improving Care For Older Adults.	2021	140	10.3389/fpubh.2021.729149	35004562		140	9		729149	Population aging is a defining demographic reality of our era. It is associated with an increase in the societal burden of delivering care to older adults with chronic conditions or frailty. How to integrate global population aging and technology development to help address the growing demands for care facing many aging societies is both a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. We propose a social technology approach that promotes use of technologies to assist individuals, families, and communities to cope more effectively with the disabilities of older adults who can no longer live independently due to dementia, serious mental illness, and multiple chronic health problems. The main contributions of the social technology approach include: (1) fostering multidisciplinary collaboration among social scientists, engineers, and healthcare experts; (2) including ethical and humanistic standards in creating and evaluating innovations; (3) improving social systems through working with those who deliver, manage, and design older adult care services; (4) promoting social justice through social policy research and innovation, particularly for disadvantaged groups; (5) fostering social integration by creating age-friendly and intergenerational programs; and (6) seeking global benefit by identifying and generalizing best practices. As an emergent, experimental approach, social technology requires systematic evaluation in an iterative process to refine its relevance and uses in different local settings. By linking technological interventions to the social and cultural systems of older people, we aim to help technological advances become an organic part of the complex social world that supports and sustains care delivery to older adults in need.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		140	Frontiers In Public Health		140	kleinman,arthur	Kleinman	Arthur
126	Intra-Operative Anaesthetic Management Of Older Patients Undergoing Liver Surgery.	2021	141	10.1016/j.ejso.2020.11.004	33218699		100	47	3 Pt A	545	Older patients represent a growing proportion of the general surgical caseload. This includes those undergoing liver resection, with figures rising faster than the rate of population ageing. The physiology of ageing leads to changes in all body systems which may render the provision of safe anaesthesia more challenging than in younger patients. Anaesthesia for liver surgery has specific principles, largely aimed at reducing venous bleeding from the liver, and those related to complex major surgery. This review explores the principles of anaesthesia for liver resection and describes how they may require modification in the older patient. The traditional approach of low central venous pressure anaesthesia in order to reduce bleeding may need to be altered in the presence of a cardiovascular system less able to tolerate hypotension and hypoperfusion. These changes in physiology should also lower the threshold for invasive monitoring. The provision of effective analgesia perioperatively should be tailored to minimise the surgical stress response and opiate use. Careful consideration of general principles of intra-operative care for older patients, such as positioning, drug dosing, avoidance of excessively deep anaesthesia, and maintenance of normothermia are also important given the prolonged, complex nature of liver surgery. This individualised approach, with careful attention to changes in physiology allows liver resections to be undertaken in older patients without increases in mortality.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		100	European Journal Of Surgical Oncology: The Journal Of The European Society Of Surgical Oncology And The British Association Of Surgical Oncology		141	wallace,hilary	Wallace	Hilary
127	Modified Fragility Index And Surgical Complexity Score Are Able To Predict Postoperative Morbidity And Mortality After Cytoreductive Surgery For Advanced Ovarian Cancer.	2021	142	10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.08.022	33223220		96	161	1	4	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of surgical complexity on postoperative complications and mortality, according to patient's frailty (mFI) following surgery for ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer from 2008 to 2018 were identified from our database. A surgical complexity score from 1 to 3 was used to assess the extent of surgery (simple to complex, respectively). mFI with 11 variables, based on mapping the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index to the NSQIP comorbidities was evaluated. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, independent sample t-test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 263 patients identified, 33% reported at least one postoperative complication and 6% had severe complications. BMI ≥ 30 (p = 0.04) increased mFI (p = 0.04) and high-complexity surgery (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of severe complications (G3-G5). Patients with high frailty index score (mFI ≥ 3) who underwent intermediate or high-complexity surgery were at higher risk of severe complications ranging from 29.4% to 50. CONCLUSIONS: The combined evaluation of mFI and surgical complexity expected may identify patients at higher risk for severe morbidity allowing to stratify patients who are less likely to tolerate a surgical extensive treatment.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		96	Gynecologic Oncology		142	di donato,violante	Di Donato	Violante
128	The Correlation Between Case Total Work Relative Value Unit, Operative Stress, And Patient Frailty: Retrospective Cohort Study.	2021	143	10.1097/SLA.0000000000005068	34506319		143	274	4	637	OBJECTIVE: Assess the relationships between case total work relative value units (wRVU), patient frailty, and the physiologic stress of surgical interventions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgeon reimbursement is frequently apportioned by wRVU. These subjective, procedure-specific valuations generated by physician survey estimate the intensity and time for typical patient care services. We hypothesized wRVU would not adequately account for patient-specific factors, such as frailty, that modify the required physician work, regardless of procedural complexity. METHODS: Using National and Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Programs (2015-2018), we evaluated the correlation between case total wRVU, patient frailty (risk analysis index) and physiologic surgical stress (operative stress score). RESULTS: Of 4,111,371 (86%) cases, the correlation between total wRVU and operative stress was moderate [ρs = 0.587 (95% confidence interval, 0.586-0.587)], but negligible with frailty ρ = 0.177 (95% confidence interval, 0.176-0.178)]. Very high operative stress procedures [n = 34,047 (1%)] generated a mean total wRVU of 55.1 (standard deviation, 12.9), comprising 7%, 2%, and 1% of thoracic, vascular, and general surgical cases, respectively. Very frail patients [n = 152,535 (4%)] accounted for 9% of thoracic, 9% of vascular, 4% of general, 5% of urologic, and 4% of neurologic surgical cases, generating 21.0 (standard deviation, 12.4) mean total wRVU. Some nonfrail patients undergoing low operative stress procedures [n = 60,128 (2%)] nonetheless generated the highest quintile wRVU; these comprised >15% of plastic, gynecologic, and urologic surgical cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon reimbursement correlates with operative stress but not patient frailty. The total wRVU does not adequately reflect patient-specific factors that increase the physician workload required to render optimal care to complex patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		143	Annals Of Surgery		143	reitz,katherine.m	Reitz	Katherine M
129	The Association Of Alcohol Use With All-Cause And Cardiovascular Disease-Related Hospitalizations Or Death In Older, High-Risk Veterans.	2021	144	10.1111/acer.14610	33844300		144	45	6	1215	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of alcohol misuse among older adults has grown dramatically in the past decade, yet little is known about the association of alcohol misuse with hospitalization and death in this patient population. METHODS: We examined the association between alcohol use (measured by a screening instrument in primary care) and rates of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related 6-month hospitalization or death via electronic health records (EHRs) in a nationally representative sample of older, high-risk Veterans. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including frailty and comorbid conditions. RESULTS: The all-cause hospitalization or death rate at 6 months was 14.9%, and the CVD-related hospitalization or death rate was 1.8%. In adjusted analyses, all-cause hospitalization or death was higher in older Veterans who were nondrinkers or harmful use drinkers compared to moderate use drinkers, but CVD-related hospitalization or death was similar in all categories of drinking. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the complex association between alcohol and all-cause acute healthcare utilization found in the broader population is similar in older, high-risk Veteran patients. These findings do not support an association between alcohol consumption and CVD-specific hospitalizations.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		144	Alcoholism, Clinical And Experimental Research		144	blalock,dan.v	Blalock	Dan V
130	Predictivity Of The Comorbidity Indices For Geriatric Syndromes.	2022	145	10.1186/s12877-022-03066-8	35590276		23	22	1	440	BACKGROUND: The aging population and increasing chronic diseases make a tremendous burden on the health care system. The study evaluated the relationship between comorbidity indices and common geriatric syndromes. METHODS: A total of 366 patients who were hospitalized in a university geriatric inpatient service were included in the study. Sociodemographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and comprehensive geriatric assessment(CGA) parameters were recorded. Malnutrition, urinary incontinence, frailty, polypharmacy, falls, orthostatic hypotension, depression, and cognitive performance were evaluated. Comorbidities were ranked using the Charlson Comorbidity Index(CCI), Elixhauser Comorbidity Index(ECM), Geriatric Index of Comorbidity(GIC), and Medicine Comorbidity Index(MCI). Because, the CCI is a valid and reliable tool used in different clinical settings and diseases, patients with CCI score higher than four was accepted as multimorbid. Additionally, the relationship between geriatric syndromes and comorbidity indices was assessed with regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 76.2 ± 7.25 years(67.8% female). The age and sex of multimorbid patients according to the CCI were not different compared to others. The multimorbid group had a higher rate of dementia and polypharmacy among geriatric syndromes. All four indices were associated with frailty and polypharmacy(p < 0.05). CCI and ECM scores were related to dementia, polypharmacy, and frailty. Moreover, CCI was also associated with separately slow walking speed and low muscle strength. On the other hand, unlike CCI, ECM was associated with malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: In the study comparing the four comorbidity indices, it is revealed that none of the indices is sufficient to use alone in geriatric practice. New indices should be developed considering the complexity of the geriatric cases and the limitations of the existing indices.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		145	canaslan,kubra	Canaslan	Kubra
131	Timely Short-Term Specialized Palliative Care Service Intervention For Older People With Frailty And Their Family Carers In Primary Care: Development And Modelling Of The Frailty+ Intervention Using Theory Of Change.	2021	146	10.1177/02692163211040187	34423701		146	35	10	1961	BACKGROUND: Palliative care is advocated for older people with frailty and multimorbidity in the community. However, how to best deliver it is unclear. AIM: To develop and model an intervention of short-term specialized palliative care that is initiated timely based on complex care needs and integrated with primary care for older people with frailty and their family, detailing the intervention components, outcomes and preconditions needed for implementation, using a novel theoretical approach. DESIGN: Observational study informed by the UK MRC guidance for complex interventions integrated with a Theory of Change (i.e. hypothetical causal pathway to impact) approach. We synthesized evidence from a systematic review, semi-structured interviews, group discussions and Theory of Change workshops. SETTING: Primary care in Flanders, Belgium. RESULTS: We identified patient and family carer-related long-term outcomes and preconditions to achieve them for example, service providers are willing and able to deliver the intervention. The intervention components included implementation components, for example, training for service providers, and a core component, that is, provision of timely short-term specialized palliative care by a specialized palliative home care nurse. The latter includes: short-term service delivery; collaborative and integrative working within primary care; delivery of holistic needs- and capacity-based care; person-centred and family-focussed; and goal-oriented pro-active care. CONCLUSIONS: The Theory of Change approach allowed us to identify multiple intervention components targeting different stakeholders to achieve the desired outcomes. It also facilitated a detailed description of the intervention which aims to increase replicability and effective comparisons with other interventions.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		146	Palliative Medicine		146	de nooijer,kim	de Nooijer	Kim
132	Frailty Is Associated With Impaired Diabetic Foot Ulcer Healing And All-Cause Re-Hospitalization.	2022	147	10.1007/s12603-022-1726-7	35166310		123	26	2	169	BACKGROUND: Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are a common and feared complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. People with DFUs often present a significant clinical complexity due to multimorbidity, frailty, polypharmacy, and disabling conditions. Frailty, defined using the accumulation of health deficits model, has shown to predict worsening health status, hospitalizations, and death in older persons. There are no clinical studies, to date, that have examined the prevalence and effect of frailty on DFUs outcomes. The aim of our study was to explore the impact of frailty on DFUs healing and re-hospitalization in a cohort of patients hospitalized with DFUs. DESIGN: prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The frailty status of 76 consecutive hospitalized patients with DFUs was assessed by using the Frailty Index (FI). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the non-healing of the DFU. Secondary outcome was re-hospitalization events (for any cause) within 6 months from hospital discharge. Frailty was defined as FI>0.25. RESULTS: Out of 76 patients (median age 65 years, range 31-84), 56 (74%) were frail. At six months, 81.5% of frail patients had non-healing of the DFU compared to 55% in non-frail patients (p=0.02). The rate of of re-hospitalization was also higher in frail compared to non-frail (90.3% vs 54%, respectively; p=0.01) patients. In multivariable analyses, frailty was significantly associated with a more than fivefold increased risk of DFU non-healing [odds ratio 5.54 (95% confidence interval 1.28-23.91), p=0.02]. Similarly, re-hospitalization was also significantly higher in frail patients compared to the non-frail ones. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with DFUs, frailty was highly prevalent. Frailty emerged as an independent risk factor for DFU non-healing and re-hospitalization events. Patients with DFUs require a comprehensive assessment of their frailty status which would enable personalization of their management and interventions.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		123	The Journal Of Nutrition, Health & Aging		147	maltese,g	Maltese	G
133	Cardiovascular Complications After Common Bile Duct Stone Extractions.	2021	149	10.1007/s00464-020-07766-3	32613302		149	35	7	3296	BACKGROUND: Common bile duct stone (CBDS) is a common condition the rate of which increases with age. Decision to treat in particular elderly and frail patients with CBDS is often complex and requires careful assessment of the risk for treatment-related cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of postoperative cardiovascular events in CBDS patients treated with the following: ERCP only; cholecystectomy only; cholecystectomy followed by delayed ERCP; cholecystectomy together with ERCP; or ERCP followed by delayed cholecystectomy. METHODS: The study was based on data from procedures for gallstone disease registered in the Swedish National Quality Register for Cholecystectomy and Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (GallRiks) 2006-2014. ERCP and cholecystectomy procedures performed for confirmed or suspected CBDS were included. Postoperative events were registered by cross-matching GallRiks with the National Patient Register (NPR). A postoperative cardiovascular event was defined as an ICD-code in the discharge notes indicating myocardial infarct, pulmonary embolism or cerebrovascular disease within 30 days after surgery. In cases where a patient had undergone ERCP and cholecystectomy on separate occasions, the 30-day interval was timed from the first intervention. RESULTS: A total of 23,591 underwent ERCP or cholecystectomy for CBDS during the study period. A postoperative cardiovascular event was registered in 164 patients and death within 30 days in 225 patients. In univariable analysis, adverse cardiovascular event and death within 30 days were more frequent in patients who underwent primary ERCP (p < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, adjusting for history of cardiovascular disease or events, neither risk for cardiovascular complication nor death within 30 days remained statistically significant in the ERCP group. CONCLUSIONS: Primary ERCP as well as cholecystectomy may be performed for CBDS with acceptable safety. More studies are required to provide reliable guidelines for the management of CBDS.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		149	Surgical Endoscopy		149	syrén,eva-lena	Syrén	Eva-Lena
134	Online Multi-Domain Geriatric Health Screening In Urban Community Dwelling Older Malaysians: A Pilot Study.	2020	150	10.3389/fpubh.2020.612154	33520920		140	8		612154	Introduction: With a rapidly aging population, the Malaysian health care system needs to develop solutions to address the lack of resources that are required for the assessment of the older person. The complex nature of geriatric syndromes coupled with the occurrence of multiple comorbid illnesses with aging, make geriatric assessment a resource intensive process. Digital health solutions could play an important role in supporting existing health care systems, especially in low and middle income countries, with limited speciality services in geriatrics. Objective: This is a pilot study aimed at screening for geriatric syndromes through self-administered online surveys in urban community dwelling older Malaysians and assessing the pattern of geriatric syndromes in relation to the frailty status of the study participants. Methods: This is a cross-sectional pilot study conducted between July-September 2020. Community dwelling adults aged 60 years and over were invited to take part in an online survey. Information on sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, and the self-reported results of geriatric syndromes (frailty, sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, urinary incontinence, falls, and cognitive impairment), were collected through the survey. Results: Data was collected for 162 participants over a period of 2 months. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 66.42 (5.25) years with 64.9% females. Majority of the respondents were of Chinese ethnic origin (67.9%) and had tertiary level of education (75.9%). The average time taken by participants to complete the survey was 16.86 min. Urinary incontinence was the highest reported geriatric syndrome (55.1%) followed by falls (37.6%), anorexia of aging (32.8%), cognitive impairment (27.8%), and sarcopenia (8.3%). Frailty was detected in 4.5% of the study population. Loss of weight in the previous year was the highest reported component of the frailty assessment tool. The presence of sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, poor/fair self-rated health, urinary incontinence, and multimorbidity were significantly higher in older adults who were frail or prefrail. Conclusion: Screening for geriatric syndromes through online surveys is a feasible approach to identify older adults in the community who are likely to benefit from geriatric assessment. However, the demographic profile of the older population that are accessible through such digital platforms is limited.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		140	Frontiers In Public Health		150	alex,deepa	Alex	Deepa
135	A Methodology For Identifying High-Need, High-Cost Patient Personas For International Comparisons.	2021	151	10.1111/1475-6773.13890	34755334		151	56 Suppl 3	Suppl 3	1302	OBJECTIVE: To establish a methodological approach to compare two high-need, high-cost (HNHC) patient personas internationally. DATA SOURCES: Linked individual-level administrative data from the inpatient and outpatient sectors compiled by the International Collaborative on Costs, Outcomes, and Needs in Care (ICCONIC) across 11 countries: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. STUDY DESIGN: We outline a methodological approach to identify HNHC patient types for international comparisons that reflect complex, priority populations defined by the National Academy of Medicine. We define two patient profiles using accessible patient-level datasets linked across different domains of care-hospital care, primary care, outpatient specialty care, post-acute rehabilitative care, long-term care, home-health care, and outpatient drugs. The personas include a frail older adult with a hip fracture with subsequent hip replacement and an older person with complex multimorbidity, including heart failure and diabetes. We demonstrate their comparability by examining the characteristics and clinical diagnoses captured across countries. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data collected by ICCONIC partners. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Across 11 countries, the identification of HNHC patient personas was feasible to examine variations in healthcare utilization, spending, and patient outcomes. The ability of countries to examine linked, individual-level data varied, with the Netherlands, Canada, and Germany able to comprehensively examine care across all seven domains, whereas other countries such as England, Switzerland, and New Zealand were more limited. All countries were able to identify a hip fracture persona and a heart failure persona. Patient characteristics were reassuringly similar across countries. CONCLUSION: Although there are cross-country differences in the availability and structure of data sources, countries had the ability to effectively identify comparable HNHC personas for international study. This work serves as the methodological paper for six accompanying papers examining differences in spending, utilization, and outcomes for these personas across countries.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		151	Health Services Research		151	figueroa,jose.f	Figueroa	Jose F
136	Frailty Status As A Potential Factor In Increased Postoperative Opioid Use In Older Adults.	2021	152	10.1186/s12877-021-02101-4	33736611		23	21	1	189	BACKGROUND: Prescription opioids are commonly used for postoperative pain relief in older adults, but have the potential for misuse. Both opioid side effects and uncontrolled pain have detrimental impacts. Frailty syndrome (reduced reserve in response to stressors), pain, and chronic opioid consumption are all complex phenomena that impair function, nutrition, psychologic well-being, and increase mortality, but links among these conditions in the acute postoperative setting have not been described. This study seeks to understand the relationship between frailty and patterns of postoperative opioid consumption in older adults. METHODS: Patients ≥ 65 years undergoing elective surgery with a planned hospital stay of at least one postoperative day were recruited for this cohort study at pre-anesthesia clinic visits. Preoperatively, frailty was assessed by Edmonton Frailty and Clinical Frailty Scales, pain was assessed by Visual Analog and Pain Catastrophizing Scales, and opioid consumption was recorded. On the day of surgery and subsequent hospitalization days, average pain ratings and total opioid consumption were recorded daily. Seven days after hospital discharge, patients were interviewed using uniform questionnaires to measure opioid prescription use and pain rating. RESULTS: One hundred seventeen patients (age 73.0 (IQR 67.0, 77.0), 64 % male), were evaluated preoperatively and 90 completed one-week post discharge follow-up. Preoperatively, patients with frailty were more likely than patients without frailty to use opioids (46.2 % vs. 20.9 %, p = 0.01). Doses of opioids prescribed at hospital discharge and the prescribed morphine milligram equivalents (MME) at discharge did not differ between groups. Seven days after discharge, the cumulative MME used were similar between cohorts. However, patients with frailty used a larger fraction of opioids prescribed to them (96.7 % (31.3, 100.0) vs. 25.0 % (0.0, 83.3), p = 0.007) and were more likely (OR 3.7, 95 % CI 1.13-12.13) to use 50 % and greater of opioids prescribed to them. Patients with frailty had higher pain scores before surgery and seven days after discharge compared to patients without frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of postoperative opioid use after discharge were different between patients with and without frailty. Patients with frailty tended to use almost all the opioids prescribed while patients without frailty tended to use almost none of the opioids prescribed.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		152	auckley,elizabeth.d	Auckley	Elizabeth D
137	Associations Of Baseline Frailty Status And Age With Outcomes In Patients Undergoing Vestibular Schwannoma Resection.	2021	153	10.1001/jamaoto.2021.0670	33914061		153	147	7	608	IMPORTANCE: Although numerous studies have evaluated the influence of advanced age on surgical outcomes following vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection, few if any large-scale investigations have assessed the comparative prognostic effects of age and frailty. As the population continues to age, it is imperative to further evaluate treatment and management strategies for older patients. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based evaluation of the independent associations of chronological age and frailty (physiological age) with outcomes following VS resection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this large-scale, multicenter, cross-sectional analysis, weighted discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample were searched to identify adult patients (≥18 years old) who underwent VS resection from 2002 through 2017 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Data collection and analysis took place September to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complex samples regression models and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to evaluate the independent associations of frailty and age (along with demographic confounders) with complications and discharge disposition. Frailty was evaluated using the previously validated 11-point modified frailty index (mFI). RESULTS: Among the 27 313 patients identified for VS resection, the mean (SEM) age was 50.4 (0.2) years, 15 031 (55.0%) were women, and 4720 (21.0%) were of non-White race/ethnicity, as determined by the National Inpatient Sample data source. Of the included patients, 15 090 (55.2%) were considered robust (mFI score = 0), 8204 (30.0%) were prefrail (mFI score = 1), 3022 (11.1%) were frail (mFI score = 2), and 996 (3.6%) were severely frail (mFI score ≥3). On univariable analysis, increasing frailty was associated with development of postoperative hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR], 2.44 [95% CI, 2.07-2.87]; area under the curve, 0.73), while increasing age was not. Following multivariable analysis, increasing frailty and non-White race/ethnicity were independently associated with both mortality (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.32 [95% CI, 1.70-3.17], and aOR, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.02-9.12], respectively) and extended hospital stays (aOR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.41-1.67], and aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.42-2.05], respectively), while increasing age was not. Increasing frailty (aOR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.56-0.67]), age (aOR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97-0.99]), and non-White race/ethnicity (aOR, 0.62 [95% CI 0.51-0.75]) were all independently associated with routine discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, findings suggest that frailty may be more accurate for predicting outcomes and guiding treatment decisions than advanced patient age alone following VS resection.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		153	Jama Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery		153	dicpinigaitis,alis.j	Dicpinigaitis	Alis J
138	Ict Technologies As New Promising Tools For The Managing Of Frailty: A Systematic Review.	2021	154	10.1007/s40520-020-01626-9	32705589		154	33	6	1453	OBJECTIVES: Frailty is a major health issue as it encompasses functional decline, physical dependence, and increased mortality risk. Recent studies explored Information and Communication Technology (ICT) interventions as alternatives to manage frailty in older persons. The aim of the present systematic review was to synthesize current evidence on ICT application within the complex models of frailty care in older people. METHODS: Data sources included PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Web of Science, considering eligible those reviews on ICT application in samples of older persons formally assessed as frail. Records were screened by two independent researchers, who extracted data and appraised methodological quality of reviews and studies. RESULTS: Among the 764 retrieved papers, two systematic reviews were included. Most of the studies analyzed defined frailty considering only few components of the phenotype and used ICT to stratify different levels of frailty or to support traditional screening strategies. Assessment of frailty was the context in which ICT has been mostly tested as compared to intervention. Cost effectiveness evaluations of the ICT technologies were not reported. CONCLUSIONS: The research investigating the use of ICT in the context of frailty is still at the very beginning. Few studies strictly focused on the assessment of frailty, while intervention on frailty using ICT was rarely reported. The lack of a proper characterization of the frail condition along with the methodological limitations prevented the investigation of ICT within complex care models. Future studies are needed to effectively integrate ICT in the care of frailty in orders.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		154	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		154	gallucci,alessia	Gallucci	Alessia
139	What Do Orthopedic Trauma Surgeons Want And Expect From Anesthesiologists?	2022	156	10.1016/j.anclin.2022.06.004	36049881		156	40	3	547	From the orthopedic trauma surgeon's perspective, successful injury management hinges on fracture fixation and restoration of patient mobility in a safe and expeditious manner. Management of critically injured polytrauma patients and shared decisions regarding regional anesthetics presents a myriad of challenges for orthopedic trauma surgeons and anesthesiologists alike. As the populations age, the typical patient sustaining traumatic orthopedic injuries are increasingly frail and elderly. This trend in demographics has mandated that care for orthogeriatric patients is coordinated by multidisciplinary teams working in concert on medically complex cases to a common end. In this article, we highlight opportunities for improved communication and care integration between orthopedic trauma surgeons and anesthesiologists.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		156	Anesthesiology Clinics		156	pean,christian	Pean	Christian
140	Identification Of Biomarkers For Physical Frailty And Sarcopenia Through A New Multi-Marker Approach: Results From The Biosphere Study.	2021	157	10.1007/s11357-020-00197-x	32488674		157	43	2	727	"Physical frailty and sarcopenia (PF&S) is a prototypical geriatric condition characterized by reduced physical function and low muscle mass. The aim of the present study was to provide an initial selection of biomarkers for PF&S using a novel multivariate analytic strategy. Two-hundred community-dwellers, 100 with PF&S and 100 non-physically frail, non-sarcopenic (nonPF&S) controls aged 70 and older were enrolled as part of the BIOmarkers associated with Sarcopenia and Physical frailty in EldeRly pErsons (BIOSPHERE) study. A panel of 74 serum analytes involved in inflammation, muscle growth and remodeling, neuromuscular junction damage, and amino acid metabolism was assayed. Biomarker selection was accomplished through sequential and orthogonalized covariance selection (SO-CovSel) analysis. Separate SO-CovSel models were constructed for the whole study population and for the two genders. The model with the best prediction ability obtained with the smallest number of variables was built using seven biomolecules. This model allowed correct classification of 80.6 ± 5.3% PF&S participants and 79.9 ± 5.1% nonPF&S controls. The PF&S biomarker profile was characterized by higher serum levels of asparagine, aspartic acid, and citrulline. Higher serum concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor BB, heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72), myeloperoxidase, and α-aminobutyric acid defined the profile of nonPF&S participants. Gender-specific SO-CovSel models identified a ""core"" biomarker profile of PF&S, characterized by higher serum levels of aspartic acid and Hsp72 and lower concentrations of macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, with peculiar signatures in men and women.SO-CovSel analysis allowed identifying a set of potential biomarkers for PF&S. The adoption of such an innovative multivariate approach could help address the complex pathophysiology of PF&S, translate biomarker discovery from bench to bedside, and unveil novel targets for interventions."		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		157	Geroscience		157	calvani,riccardo	Calvani	Riccardo
141	Management Of Acute Coronary Syndromes In Older Adults.	2022	159	10.1093/eurheartj/ehab391	34347065		159	43	16	1542	Older patients are underrepresented in prospective studies and randomized clinical trials of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Over the last decade, a few specific trials have been conducted in this population, allowing more evidence-based management. Older adults are a heterogeneous, complex, and high-risk group whose management requires a multidimensional clinical approach beyond coronary anatomic variables. This review focuses on available data informing evidence-based interventional and pharmacological approaches for older adults with ACS, including guideline-directed management. Overall, an invasive approach appears to demonstrate a better benefit-risk ratio compared to a conservative one across the ACS spectrum, even considering patients' clinical complexity and multiple comorbidities. Conversely, more powerful strategies of antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention have been associated with increased bleeding events and no benefit in terms of mortality reduction. An interdisciplinary evaluation with geriatric assessment should always be considered to achieve a holistic approach and optimize any treatment on the basis of the underlying biological vulnerability.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		159	European Heart Journal		159	morici,nuccia	Morici	Nuccia
142	Heath Status, Frailty, And Multimorbidity In Patients With Emergency General Surgery Conditions.	2022	161	10.1016/j.surg.2022.02.011	35397953		161	172	1	446	BACKGROUND: Although nearly 1 million older adults are admitted for emergency general surgery conditions yearly, the extent to which baseline health influences the development and treatment of emergency general surgery conditions is unknown. We evaluated baseline health and older patients with and without emergency general surgery conditions. METHODS: We used the prospectively collected Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey with Medicare claims and 2 validated health frameworks: (1) Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score and (2) Complex Multimorbidity. Self-reported health and function items were used to derive pre-emergency general surgery conditions Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score and Complex Multimorbidity scores. Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score ranges from 0 (no frailty deficits) to 100 (all possible deficits present). Complex Multimorbidity is a 3-point categorical rank based on the presence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes. Specific survey factors were also examined to determine association with development of emergency general surgery conditions or use of operative management. RESULTS: Of 54,417 individuals, 1,960 had emergency general surgery conditions (median age 79 [interquartile range 73-84]). Patients with emergency general surgery conditions had significantly higher Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score (19 [interquartile range 11-31] vs 14 [8-24]) and were more likely to be in the most severe Complex Multimorbidity category (38% vs 29%). Emergency general surgery conditions patients had higher proportions of nearly every health category, with the most striking differences in functional limitations. Patients who were treated nonoperatively had the poorest overall baseline health. CONCLUSION: Patients who developed emergency general surgery conditions had more severe health burden than patients who did not, particularly in functional status. Clinicians must better understand the interaction between baseline health vulnerability and emergency surgical disease to improve prognostication and ensure alignment of patient goals and treatment strategies.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		161	Surgery		161	ho,vanessa.p	Ho	Vanessa P
143	Frailty-Aware Care: Giving Value To Frailty Assessment Across Different Healthcare Settings.	2022	162	10.1186/s12877-021-02722-9	34979966		23	22	1	13	Healthcare systems need to adapt to better serve an aging population with complex presentations. Frailty assessments are a potential means to address this heterogeneity in aging to identify individuals at increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Furthermore, frailty assessments offer an opportunity to optimize patient care in various healthcare settings. While the vast number of frailty assessment tools available can be a source of confusion for clinicians, each tool has features adaptable to the constraints and goals of different healthcare settings. This review discusses and compares barriers, facilitators, and the application of frailty assessments in primary care, the emergency department/intensive care unit and surgical care to cover a breadth of settings with different frailty assessment considerations. The implementation of frailty-aware care across healthcare settings potentiates better healthcare outcomes for older adults.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		162	boreskie,kevin.f	Boreskie	Kevin F
144	Acute, Major Muscular Hematoma Associated With Antithrombotic Agents: A Multicenter Real-World Cohort.	2021	163	10.1016/j.thromres.2020.12.022	33429124		163	199		54	BACKGROUND: There is little data on major muscular hematomas and the little there is has mainly focused on patients exposed to oral anticoagulants. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of patients admitted to emergency department (ED) for major muscular hematoma associated with an antithrombotic agent, and to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a three-year period, all consecutive cases of adult patients admitted to the ED of 5 tertiary care hospitals for major muscular hematoma while exposed to an antithrombotic agent were prospectively collected and medically validated. Clinical and biological data, therapeutic management of the bleeding event, and in-hospital mortality were collected from the medical records and compared across five groups of hematoma locations. Potential confounders were taken in account using a multivariate binomial regression model. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-five patients were included (mean age = 81.4 years): 271 were exposed to vitamin K antagonists, 58 to parenteral anticoagulants (heparin, LMWH, fondaparinux), 33 to antiplatelets, and 13 to direct oral anticoagulants. The muscular hematomas were located in the lower limbs (n = 198), the rectus sheath (n = 71), the iliopsoas (n = 45), the upper limbs (n = 33), or elsewhere (n = 28). Reversal therapy was prescribed for 48.5% of patients, red cell transfusions for 63.6%, surgery for 12.3% and embolization for 3.5%. For 84% of patients, hospitalization was required, with a median length of stay of 10 days. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 8.5%. Reversal therapy, the need for intensive care and mortality were significantly more frequent among patients with iliopsoas hematomas. The independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were: decrease in mean arterial pressure (RR = 1.84), decrease in hemoglobin level (RR = 1.37) and the iliopsoas location (RR = 3.06). CONCLUSION: Frail elderly patients with major muscular hematomas linked to antithrombotic agents risk substantial morbidity and in-hospital mortality. The iliopsoas location was the most life-threatening bleeding site. Close observation of this population is warranted to ensure better outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		163	Thrombosis Research		163	bouget,jacques	Bouget	Jacques
145	Uk Nutrition Research Partnership Workshop: Nutrition And Frailty-Opportunities For Prevention And Treatment.	2022	164	10.1111/nbu.12538	36045087		164	47	1	123	Frailty is a syndrome of growing importance given the global increase in the number of older people. While frailty is a complex, multifactorial process, poor nutritional status is considered to be a key contributor to its pathophysiology. However, the role of nutrition and its influence on the development and progression of frailty is poorly understood. As nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for frailty, future prevention and treatment strategies should consider the potential of diet and dietary change as a component of interventions. This article reports on a UK Nutrition Research Partnership 'Hot Topic' workshop on nutrition and frailty. The aim of the workshop was to bring together experts and early career researchers from a range of disciplines to synthesise current understanding of dietary influences on frailty, with a focus on opportunities for prevention and treatment.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		164	Nutrition Bulletin		164	ni lochlainn,mary	Ni Lochlainn	Mary
146	Polypharmacy, Comorbidity And Frailty: A Complex Interplay In Older Patients At The Emergency Department.	2022	102	10.1007/s41999-022-00664-y	35723840		83	13	4	849	PURPOSE: Older adults at the emergency department (ED) with polypharmacy, comorbidity, and frailty are at risk of adverse health outcomes. We investigated the association of polypharmacy with adverse health outcomes, in relation to comorbidity and frailty. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study in ED patients  ≥ 70 years. Non-polypharmacy was defined as 0-4 medications, polypharmacy 5-9 and excessive polypharmacy ≥ 10. Comorbidity was classified by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Frailty was defined by the Identification of Seniors At Risk-Hospitalized Patients (ISAR-HP) score. The primary outcome was 3-month mortality. Secondary outcomes were readmission to an ED/hospital ward and a self-reported fall < 3 months. The association between polypharmacy, comorbidity and frailty was analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS: 881 patients were included. 43% had polypharmacy and 18% had excessive polypharmacy. After 3 months, 9% died, 30% were readmitted, and 21% reported a fall. Compared with non-polypharmacy, the odds ratio (OR) for mortality ranged from 2.62 (95% CI 1.39-4.93) in patients with polypharmacy to 3.92 (95% CI 1.95-7.90) in excessive polypharmacy. The OR weakened after adjustment for comorbidity: 1.80 (95% CI 0.92-3.52) and 2.32 (95% CI 1.10-4.90). After adjusting for frailty, the OR weakened to 2.10 (95% CI 1.10-4.00) and OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.15-5.02). No significant association was found for readmission or self-reported fall. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy is common in older patients at the ED. Polypharmacy, and especially excessive polypharmacy, is associated with an increased risk of mortality. The observed association is complex given the confounding effect of comorbidity and frailty.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		83	European Geriatric Medicine		102	van dam,carmen.s	van Dam	Carmen S
147	Magnetic Resonance-Guided Radiotherapy Feasibility In Elderly Cancer Patients: Proposal Of The Master Scoring System.	2021	168	10.1177/0300891620920709	32410505		168	107	1	26	BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are often excluded from advanced treatments owing to clinical complexity or frailty. Magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) represents a new frontier of radiotherapy delivery that can play an important role in the management of these patients. AIM: To assess MRgRT feasibility in elderly patients, describe their compliance with this treatment, and provide a scoring system for elderly patient selection. METHODS: Patients aged >75 years were enrolled. No restrictions on tumor site, staging, or treatment intent were applied. Patients underwent joint radiation oncology-geriatrics visits to assess the feasibility of MRgRT and to identify the most significant items (i.e. clinical variables) for the setup of a scoring system. The proposed scoring system was then internally validated on a prospectively enrolled cohort of elderly patients who were candidates for MRgRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between February and March 2018. Their mean age was 81.4 ± 3.4 years (range 75-88). Radiotherapy intent was curative in 26 patients; 14 patients were considered frail at screening tests before radiotherapy. Twelve items were identified as clinically significant for the setup of the MASTER score (MRI-Guided Radiotherapy Selection Elderly Score) score. Validation of the score showed 100% reliability, with no patient discharged after selection. CONCLUSIONS: MRgRT appears to be feasible in elderly patients and the MASTER score is proposed to support clinical decision-making in recommending elderly patients for this technology.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		168	Tumori		168	boldrini,luca	Boldrini	Luca
148	Hearts, Minds And Souls-It Is Time For Geriatricians To Bring More To Continence Management.	2021	169	10.1093/ageing/afab088	34104937		131	50	5	1508	Urinary incontinence (UI), the involuntary loss of urine, is a common health condition that may decrease the quality of life and which increases in incidence and prevalence with age. Recent epidemiologic data suggest an overall prevalence of 38% in women older than 60 years, increasing to 77% in older women living in nursing homes. Despite this high prevalence, incontinence remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in this age group. In a representative population of 7,000 participants drawn from the Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing, 750 had UI of whom 285 (38%) had not sought the help of a health care professional. The reasons that older people do not seek help for incontinence are complex and multiplex. Stigma surrounding diagnosis, a sense of futility coupled to a notion that incontinence is a part of normal ageing and the fact that incontinence simply gets 'lost' in the midst of multimorbidity and frailty have all been shown to play a role. Active case finding has therefore been highlighted as a cornerstone of effective care in serial international guidelines.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		169	schlögl,mathias	Schlögl	Mathias
149	Angiotensin-(1-7), A Protective Peptide Against Vascular Aging.	2022	171	10.1016/j.peptides.2022.170775	35231551		171	152		170775	Vascular aging is a complex and multifaceted process that provokes profound molecular, structural, and functional changes in the vasculature. Eventually, these profound aging alterations make arteries more prone to vascular disease, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and other arterial complications that impact the organism beyond the cardiovascular system and accelerate frailty. For these reasons, preventing or delaying the hallmarks of vascular aging is nowadays a major health goal, especially in our aged societies. In this context, angiotensin(Ang)-(1-7), a major player of the protective branch of the renin-angiotensin system, has gained relevance over recent years as growing knowledge on its anti-aging properties is being unveiled. Here, we briefly review the main actions of Ang-(1-7) against vascular aging. These include protection against vascular cell senescence, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects together with the induction of cytoprotective systems. Ang-(1-7) further ameliorates endothelial dysfunction, a hallmark of vascular aging and disease, attenuates fibrosis and calcification and promotes protective angiogenesis and repair. Although further research is needed to better understand the anti-aging properties of Ang-(1-7) on the vasculature, this heptapeptide arises as a promising pharmacological tool for preventing vascular aging and frailty.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		171	Peptides		171	noauthor		
150	Association Between Frailty Index, Lung Function, And Major Clinical Determinants In Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.	2021	172	10.1007/s40520-021-01878-z	34009526		154	33	8	2165	BACKGROUND: Airflow limitation alone is unable to capture the complexity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), better explained by comprehensive disease-specific indexes. Frailty is a clinical condition characterized by high vulnerability to internal and external stressors and represents a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. AIMS: Primary objective was to test the association between indexes of lung function and COPD severity with frailty index (FI), and secondary to evaluate the association between FI and comorbidities, cognitive and physical function, BODE index, and mortality. METHODS: 150 stable COPD outpatients were enrolled and followed up to 4 years. At baseline, participants performed a geriatric multidimensional assessment, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, 6-min walking test, and bioimpedance analysis. BODE and FI were calculated. Spearman's ρ was used to assess correlations. Mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Participants were followed up for a median of 39 months. Mean age was 73 years and median frailty index 0.15 (IQR 0.11-0.19). FI was higher in frequent exacerbators (≥ 2/year) (mean 0.18 vs 0.15, p 0.01) and dyspnoeic patients (mMRC ≥ 2) (mean 0.21 vs 0.14, p < 0.01) and correlated with lung volumes, expiratory flows, and pressure of arterial oxygen. FI was positively correlated with the number of comorbidities, depressive symptoms, cognitive decline, and BODE index. Mortality was higher in patients with BODE higher than 3 (HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.2-10.9), and not associated with FI. DISCUSSION: FI positively correlates with all clinical drivers orienting the choice of treatment in COPD. CONCLUSIONS: FI associates with lung function and COPD severity, but does not associate with mortality.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		154	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		172	scarlata,simone	Scarlata	Simone
151	Exploring Rehabilitation Potential In Older People Living With Frailty: A Qualitative Focus Group Study.	2021	173	10.1186/s12877-021-02107-y	33676401		23	21	1	165	"BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation interventions are frequently cited as key in supporting frail older people's recovery following periods of decompensation and acute ill-health. Clinicians are required to make decisions about a patient's potential to respond to rehabilitation. 'Rehabilitation potential' decisions can determine access to services. In acute settings clinicians have limited time to assess and work with patients, families and carers. The complexities of ageing, recovery, rehabilitation and frailty may not be fully appreciated. This study aimed to explore multiple perspectives of the concept of rehabilitation potential and how it is assessed in older people living with frailty in the acute healthcare setting. METHODS: Five focus groups with a purposive sample of 28 participants which included clinicians and members of the public were conducted. Analysis comprised a thematic approach using the Framework method. RESULTS: Rehabilitation potential was found to encapsulate a complex decision-making process where clinicians judged an individual's ability to benefit from and participate in targeted rehabilitation. They asked, ""Will it work?"", ""Is it wanted?"" and ""Is it available?"" In order to predict who would benefit from rehabilitation interventions, clinicians assessed a range of holistic clinical and non-clinical factors. An iterative approach to assessment delivered by a multi-disciplinary team, centred around patient and carer needs and wants was needed to accommodate complexity. Participants believed that everyone had some form of potential but this was dependent on availability of rehabilitation resources and conceptualisations of frailty and rehabilitation. Tensions between iterative approaches to rehabilitation potential assessment and the realities of rapid decision making in the acute hospital setting were found. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation potential decisions involve a complex process of multidisciplinary decision-making and prognostication on the likely outcome and benefit from rehabilitation programmes. These findings lay the foundation for developing structured approaches to rehabilitation potential decision making tools and guidance."		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		173	cowley,a	Cowley	A
152	Va Home-Based Primary Care Interdisciplinary Team Structure Varies With Veterans' Needs, Aligns With Pace Regulation.	2021	174	10.1111/jgs.17174	33834504		110	69	7	1729	BACKGROUND: Interdisciplinary team (IDT) care is central to home-based primary care (HBPC) of frail elders. Traditionally, all HBPC disciplines managed a patient (Full IDT), a costly approach to maintain. The recent PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) regulation provides for a flexible approach of annual assessments from a core team with involvement of additional disciplines dependent upon patient needs (Core+). Current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) HBPC guidance specifies Full IDTs care for medically complex and functionally impaired Veterans similar to PACE participants. We evaluated whether VA HBPC has adopted the flexible structure of the PACE regulation, aligned to Veteran needs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: All 139 VA HBPC programs administered across 379 sites. PARTICIPANTS: About 55,173 Veterans enrolled in HBPC during fiscal year 2018. MEASUREMENTS: Patients' HBPC physician, nurse, psychologist/psychiatrist, social worker, therapist, dietitian, and pharmacist visits were grouped into interdisciplinary team types. Patient frailty was classified using VA HNHR v2 (High-Need High-Risk version 2, a measure of high, medium, and low risk of long-term institutionalization). Medical complexity was measured by clusters of impairment in the JEN frailty index (JFI). JFI clusters were validated by VA's Nosos measure to project cost and Care Assessment Need (CAN) measure of hospitalization and mortality risk. RESULTS: HBPC provided Full IDT care to 21%, Core+ care to 54%, and Home Health+ (HHA+) care (skilled home health services plus additional disciplines, without primary care) to 16% of Veterans. Team type was associated with medical complexity (X(2) 2863.5 [66 df], p < 0.0001). High-risk Veterans (72% of sample) were more likely to receive Full IDT care (X(2) 62.9, 1 df), p < 0.0001), while low-risk Veterans (28%) were more likely to receive HHA+ care (X(2) 314.8, 1 df, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is a strong association between HBPC team patterns and patient frailty, indicating tailoring of care to match Veteran needs.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		110	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		174	chan,caitlin.s	Chan	Caitlin S
153	Prognostic Importance Of The Controlling Nutritional Status (Conut) Score In Patients Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy.	2021	175	10.1136/openhrt-2021-001740	34711651		175	8	2	None	AIMS: Malnutrition is common and associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score is an integrated index for evaluating diverse aspects of the complex mechanism of malnutrition. However, the relationship between the severity of malnutrition assessed by the CONUT score and clinical outcomes of HF patients receiving cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) has not been fully clarified. METHODS: Clinical records of 263 patients who underwent pacemaker or defibrillator implantation for CRT between March 2003 and October 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. The CONUT score was calculated from laboratory data obtained before CRT device implantation. Patients were divided into three groups: normal nutrition (CONUT scores 0-1, n=58), mild malnutrition (CONUT scores 2-4, n=132) and moderate or severe malnutrition (CONUT scores 5-12, n=73). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The moderate or severe malnutrition group had a lower body mass index, more advanced New York Heart Association functional class, higher Clinical Frailty Scale score, lower levels of haemoglobin and higher levels of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (all p<0.05). In the moderate or severe malnutrition group, the CRT response rate was significantly lower than for the other two groups (p=0.001). During a median follow-up period of 31 (10-67) months, 103 (39.1%) patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the moderate or severe malnutrition group had a significantly higher mortality rate (log-rank p<0.001). A higher CONUT score and CONUT score ≥5 remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality after adjusting for previously reported clinically relevant factors and the conventional risk score (VALID-CRT risk score) (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A higher CONUT score before CRT device implantation was strongly associated with HF severity, frailty, lower CRT response rate and subsequent long-term all-cause mortality.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		175	Open Heart		175	ikeya,yukitoshi	Ikeya	Yukitoshi
154	Predictors Of Serious, Preventable, And Costly Medical Complications In A Population Of Adult Spinal Deformity Patients.	2021	176	10.1016/j.spinee.2021.04.020	33971324		176	21	9	1559	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) established a list of hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) with significant deleterious effects on both patients and providers. Adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery is complex and highly invasive, and as such may result in significant morbidity including these HACs. PURPOSE: Identify predictors for developing the most common HACs among adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients undergoing corrective surgery. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE: One thousand one hundred and seventy-one ASD patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: HACs, Health-Related Quality of Life scores(HRQLs), Reoperation, Integrated Health State (IHS) METHODS: ASD pts undergoing surgery (>18 years, scoliosis ≥20°, SVA ≥5 cm, PT ≥25° and/or TK >60°) with complete data at BL and up to 2 years post-op were included. Patients were stratified by presence of >1 HAC, defined as at least one superficial/deep SSI, UTI, DVT, or PE within a 30-day post-op window. Random forest analysis generated 5,000 Conditional Inference Trees to compute a variable importance table for top predictors of HACs. An area-under-the-curve (AUC) methodology compared normalized HRQL scores between groups to determine an IHS with 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: Total of 1,171 pts (59.8 years, 76.2%F, 28.1kg/m(2)) underwent corrective ASD surgery, with 1,053 pts in the non-HAC group and 118 in the HAC group. Of these pts, 25.4% had UTI, 15.4% DVT, 19.2% superficial SSI, 20.8% deep SSI, and 19.2% PE. HAC pts were on average older (63.5 vs 59.3, p=.004) and more often frail (51.3 vs 39.7%, p=.021) than non-HAC pts. Postop LOS and reoperation were most associated with HAC groups: [1] LOS >7 days [2] reoperation. Patient-related predictors of HACs were [3] age >50 yerr, [4] frailty, and [13] BMI >31. Procedure-related predictors of HACs were [5] operative-time >405 minutes, [6] levels fused >9, EBL >1450 mL, and [11] decompression. BL radiographic predictors were [7] PT >20°, [9] PI-LL>6°, [10] TL Cobb angle >15°, [12] SVA C7-S1 >29 mm. No differences were observed between groups with regards to IHS ODI (0.73 vs 0.74, p=.863), SRS (1.3 vs1.3, p=.374), NRS Back (0.6 vs 0.6, p=.158). HAC had higher rates of reoperation than non-HAC (0.08 vs 0.01, p=.066), and any HAC within 30-days of index was a significant predictor of reoperation (OR: 2.448 [1.94-3.09], p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a population of ASD patients, HACs were associated with length of stay, reoperation, age, and frailty. Radiographic parameters such as pelvic tilt >20°, PI-LL >6°, & SVA >29 mm also increased odds of HACs, and should raise postoperative awareness for HAC development.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		176	The Spine Journal: Official Journal Of The North American Spine Society		176	alas,haddy	Alas	Haddy
155	Resilience Is Associated With Frailty And Older Age In Hospitalised Patients.	2022	177	10.1186/s12877-022-03251-9	35818046		23	22	1	569	BACKGROUND: Little is known about resilience in an internal medicine setting. We aimed to assess the relationship between resilience and frailty and other clinical and sociodemographic characteristics in a cohort of prospectively enrolled hospitalised patients. METHODS: In 2017-2019, we consecutively enrolled patients in our internal medicine wards. We selected all patients who filled in the 25-item Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC). Mean resilience was evaluated according to baseline demographic (i.e., age, sex, marital and socioeconomic status) and clinical (i.e., Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS], Edmonton Frail Scale [EFS], Barthel index, Short Blessed test, length of stay [LOS]) data. A multivariable analysis for assessing factors affecting resilience was fitted. RESULTS: Overall, 143 patients (median age 69 years, interquartile range 52-79, 74 females) were included. Resilience was significantly lower in frail (p = 0.010), elderly (p = 0.021), dependent (p = 0.032), and more clinically (p = 0.028) and cognitively compromised patients (p = 0.028), and in those with a low educational status (p = 0.032). No relation between resilience and LOS was noticed (p = 0.597). Frail patients were significantly older (p < 0.001), had a greater disease burden as measured by CIRS comorbidity (p < 0.001) and severity indexes (p < 0.001), were more dependent (p < 0.001), more cognitively impaired (p < 0.001), and displayed a lower educational level (p = 0.011) compared to non-frail patients. At multivariable analysis, frailty (p = 0.022) and dependency (p = 0.031; according to the Barthel index) were associated with lower resilience in the age groups 18-64 and ≥ 65 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Low resilience was associated with frailty and dependency with an age-dependent fashion. Studies assessing the impact of this finding on important health outcomes are needed.

156	Evidence From Two Cohorts For The Frailty Syndrome As An Emergent State Of Parallel Dysregulation In Multiple Physiological Systems.	2021	178	10.1007/s10522-020-09903-w	33064226		178	22	1	63	Frailty is a clinical syndrome often present in older adults and characterized by a heightened vulnerability to stressors. The biological antecedents and etiology of frailty are unclear despite decades of research: frailty is associated with dysregulation in a wide range of physiological systems, but no specific cause has been identified. Here, we test predictions stemming from the hypothesis that there is no specific cause: that frailty is an emergent property arising from the complex systems dynamics of the broad loss of organismal homeostasis. Specifically, we use dysregulation of six physiological systems using the Mahalanobis distance approach in two cohorts of older adults to test the breadth, diffuseness, and nonlinearity of associations between frailty and system-specific dysregulation. We find clear support for the breadth of associations between frailty and physiological dysregulation: positive associations of all systems with frailty in at least some analyses. We find partial support for diffuseness: the number of systems or total amount of dysregulation is more important than the identity of the systems dysregulated, but results only partially replicate across cohorts. We find partial support for nonlinearity: trends are exponential but not always significantly so, and power is limited for groups with very high levels of dysregulation. Overall, results are consistent with-but not definitive proof of-frailty as an emergent property of complex systems dynamics. Substantial work remains to understand how frailty relates to underlying physiological dynamics across systems.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		178	Biogerontology		178	ghachem,ahmed	Ghachem	Ahmed
157	Computerised Cognitive Remediation To Enhance Mobility In Older Adults: A Single-Blind, Single-Centre, Randomised Trial.	2021	179	10.1016/s2666-7568(21)00173-2	34522910		179	2	9	e571	BACKGROUND: Decline in executive functions and related cognitive processes is associated with mobility decline, and these functions might be amenable to cognitive remediation. This study aimed to examine whether a computerised cognitive remediation programme would improve walking in adults aged 70 years and older. METHODS: This single-blind, randomised trial at one academic centre in the USA evaluated the efficacy of an 8-week computerised programme (also known as brain games) of progressive intensity and complexity to improve walking in older adults at high-risk for mobility disability. Inclusion criteria included being 70 years or older; ambulatory; and at high-risk for mobility disability, defined using a cutscore of nine or less (frail range) on the Short Physical Performance Battery and a walking speed of 100 cm/s or less. Individuals with dementia, acute or terminal medical illnesses, recent or planned surgery affecting mobility, mobility limitations solely due to musculoskeletal limitation or pain that prevented them from completing mobility tests, and those who were nursing home residents were excluded. Participants were block randomised (1:1; block size 12 and no stratification) to the intervention group or the control group (low complexity computer games and health education classes). Primary outcomes were change in walking speed at normal pace and walking while talking conditions assessed from baseline to 8 weeks post-intervention by investigators who were masked to group assignment. Groups were compared using the intention-to-treat principle with linear mixed models adjusted for confounders. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT02567227. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2016, and March 12, 2020, 383 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. After randomisation, 11 (3%) patients were diagnosed with dementia. 372 (97%; 271 [73%] women) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean age of participants was 77·0 years [SD 5·6]). 183 (49·2%) participants were Black and 62 (16·7%) were Hispanic. 314 (93%) of the target 338 completers had finished the intervention when the trial was terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there were significant within-group improvements in both groups after the 8-week intervention, there was no significant difference in normal walking speed (-1·03 cm/s [SD 1·30]; 95% CI -3·60 to 1·54) and walking while talking conditions (0·59 cm/s [SD 1·61]; 95% CI -2·59 to 3·76) between the intervention and control groups. Similarly, within-group, but no between-group, differences were seen on executive function tests and physical function. There were no severe adverse events related to interventions. INTERPRETATION: Computerised cognitive remediation improved walking in adults aged 70 years and older at high-risk for mobility disability, but improvements were not significantly greater compared with an active control. Although our findings corroborate the within-group improvements on cognition and mobility reported in previous pilot clinical trials, future studies are required to determine the optimal dose, frequency, intensity, and content of computerised cognitive remediation programmes.

158	Reexamining The Classification Of Older Adults With Diabetes By Comorbidities And Exploring Relationships With Frailty, Disability, And 5-Year Mortality.	2021	181	10.1093/gerona/glab141	34003280		181	76	11	2071	BACKGROUND: Limited research has been conducted to risk stratify older adults with diabetes. Our objective was to reexamine the 2005-2006 classification systems in participants who are now 5 years older. METHODS: We examined a subsample of 884 community-residing older adults with the diagnosis of diabetes from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. The primary objective was to utilize a latent class analysis (LCA) to fit a model to 11 comorbidities, comparing the 2010-2011 LCA model to that of 2005-2006. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association of the identified classes with frailty, disability, and 5-year mortality. RESULTS: Both 2005-2006 LCA and the 2010-2011 LCA model fit 3 similar comorbidity profiles: Class 1 with the lowest rates of nearly all comorbidities, Class 2 had highest rates of obesity, hypertension, arthritis, and incontinence, and Class 3 had the higher rates of myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, and stroke. When compared to the healthier Class 1 (class probability = 0.67), participants with a comorbidity profile with more prevalent cardiovascular conditions (Class 3; 0.09) were at higher risk of frailty and mortality, but not disability; whereas participants with a comorbidity profile with more prevalent geriatric syndrome conditions (Class 2; 0.24) were at higher risk of frailty and disability, but not mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We reconfirmed 3 latent classes with distinct comorbidity profiles among older adults with diabetes. However, the complex relationships between comorbidity classes with frailty, disability, and mortality will likely require revision of the current rationale for stratified goal setting and treatment selection.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		181	The Journals Of Gerontology.

159	Improving Individualized Prescription In Patients With Multimorbidity Through Medication Review.	2022	139	10.1186/s12877-022-03107-2	35549672		23	22	1	417	BACKGROUND: Older patients tend to have multimorbidity, represented by multiple chronic diseases or geriatric conditions, which leads to a growing number of prescribed medications. As a result, pharmacological prescription has become a major concern because of the increased difficulties to ensure appropriate prescription in older adults. The study's main objectives were to characterize a cohort of older adults with multimorbidity, carry out a medication review and compare the pharmacological data before and after the medication review globally and according to the frailty index. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental (uncontrolled pre-post) study with a cohort of patients ≥ 65 years old with multimorbidity. Data were collected from June 2019 to October 2020. Variables assessed included demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data, degree of frailty (Frail-VIG index), medication regimen complexity index, anticholinergic and or sedative burden index, and monthly drug expenditure. Finally, a medication review was carried out by an interdisciplinary team (primary care team and a consultant team with a geriatrician and a clinical pharmacist) by applying the Patient-Centered Prescription model to align the treatment with care goals. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-eight patients were recruited [66.6% women; mean age 85.5 (SD 7.67)]. The mean frail index was 0.39 (SD 0.13), corresponding with moderate frailty. Up to 90% of patients presented at least one inappropriate prescription, and the mean of inappropriate prescriptions per patient was 3.14 (SD 2.27). At the three-month follow-up [mortality of 17.7% (n = 76)], the mean chronic medications per patient decreased by 17.96%, varying from 8.13 (SD 3.87) to 6.67 (SD 3.72) (p < 0.001). The medication regimen complexity index decreased by 19.03%, from 31.0 (SD 16.2) to 25.1 (SD 15.1), and the drug burden index mean decreased by 8.40%, from 1.19 (SD 0.82) to 1.09 (SD 0.82) (p < 0.001). A decrease in polypharmacy, medication regimen complexity index, and drug burden index was more frequent among frail patients, especially those with severe frailty (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An individualized medication review in frail older patients, applying the Patient-Centered Prescription model, decreases pharmacological parameters related to adverse drug effects, such as polypharmacy, therapeutical complexity, and anticholinergic and, or sedative burden. The benefits are for patients with frailty.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		139	molist-brunet,núria	Molist-Brunet	Núria
160	The Carde-B Scoring System Predicts 30-Day Mortality After Revision Total Joint Arthroplasty.	2021	183	10.2106/JBJS.20.00969	33475307		183	103	5	424	BACKGROUND: There exists a substantial risk of having a perioperative complication after revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The complex shared decision-making between surgeon and patient would benefit from a high-fidelity tool to identify patients at risk for mortality after revision TJA. Therefore, we developed the CARDE-B score. CARDE-B is an acronym for congestive heart failure, albumin or malnutrition (<3.5 mg/dL), renal failure on dialysis, dependence for daily living, elderly (>65 years of age), and body mass index <25 kg/m2. We developed and validated the CARDE-B score to determine the risk of death within 30 days of a revision TJA. METHODS: A total of 13,118 revision TJAs (40% hip and 60% knee) from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database were analyzed. A simple 1-point scoring system, CARDE-B, was created for predicting 30-day mortality after revision TJA, based on a logistic regression model. The CARDE-B scoring system assigns 1 point to each criterion in the acronym: congestive heart failure, albumin (<3.5 mg/dL), renal failure on dialysis, dependence for daily living, elderly (>65 years of age), and body mass index of <25 kg/m2. The CARDE-B scoring system was compared with 2 commonly utilized scores: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification and the 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI-5). The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the accuracy of each model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess goodness of fit. Finally, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used for external validation of the CARDE-B score in 19,153 patients who underwent revision TJA in 2017. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients (0.7%) did not survive 30 days after revision TJA. The AUC for the logistic regression model was 0.88 in both the derivation and internal validation samples using NSQIP. The predicted probability of 30-day mortality after revision TJA increased stepwise from <0.01% for a CARDE-B score of 0 points to 39% for a CARDE-B score of 5 points. The AUC for the CARDE-B score predicting 30-day mortality after revision TJA was 0.85. This was more accurate (p < 0.001) than the ASA physical status classification (AUC, 0.77) and the mFI-5 (AUC, 0.67). The AUC for the CARDE-B score in the NIS external validation set was 0.75. The Hosmer-Lemeshow p value for goodness of fit was 0.34, indicating goodness of fit in the external validation sample. CONCLUSIONS: The CARDE-B score is a simple system that predicts the risk of death within 30 days of a revision TJA, offering surgeons and patients a valuable and validated risk-stratification tool.

161	Age Is Just A Number: Is Frailty Being Ignored In Vascular Access Planning For Dialysis?	2022	184	10.1177/1129729821989902	33522351		184	23	2	192	Current international guidelines advocate fistula creation as first choice for vascular access in haemodialysis patients, however, there have been suggestions that in certain groups of patients, in particular the elderly, a more tailored approach is needed. The prevalence of more senior individuals receiving renal replacement therapy has increased in recent years and therefore including patient age in decision making regarding choice of vascular access for dialysis has gained more relevance. However, it seems that age is being used as a surrogate for overall clinical condition and it can be proposed that frailty may be a better basis to considering when advising and counselling patients with regard to vascular access for dialysis. Frailty is a clinical condition in which the person is in a vulnerable state with reduced functional capacity and has a higher risk of adverse health outcomes when exposed to stress inducing events. Prevalence of frailty increases with age and has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, hospitalisation, disability and falls. Chronic kidney disease is associated with premature ageing and therefore patients with kidney disease are prone to be frailer irrespective of age and the risk increases further with declining kidney function. Limited data exists on the relationship between frailty and vascular access, but it appears that frailty may have an association with poorer outcomes from vascular access. However, further research is warranted. Due to complexity in decision making in dialysis access, frailty assessment could be a key element in providing patient-centred approach in planning and maintaining vascular access for dialysis.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		184	The Journal Of Vascular Access		184	kuningas,kulli	Kuningas	Kulli
162	Co-Occurrence Of Geriatric Syndromes And Diseases In The General Population: Assessment Of The Dimensions Of Aging.	2022	185	10.1007/s12603-021-1722-3	35067701		123	26	1	37	OBJECTIVES: The co-occurrence of multiple medical or psycho-social conditions (geriatric syndromes (GS) and age-related diseases) is a growing concern in older people. Given the diversity of these conditions and their complex interactions, our aim was to determine whether they could be structured into synthetic dimensions in order to facilitate the management of multimorbidity. DESIGN: The underlying structure of 10 GSs and 8 age-related diseases was identified using a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and confronted to subjective and objective health outcomes. SETTING: community residents from Bordeaux City (France) older than 75 years in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: 630 adults aged 75+ years who lived in Bordeaux and participated in the 10-year follow-up of the Three-City study. MEASUREMENTS: GSs included physical frailty, cognitive impairment and dementia, dependency, depressive symptoms, polymedication, thinness, falls, sensory deficit, social isolation, incontinence. Age-related diseases were cancer, cardiac diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, osteoporosis, other chronic diseases. Association of the MCA-derived independent dimensions was assessed with 10-year visit subjective health and well-being, and with incident death and entry into institution during the remaining cohort follow-up. RESULTS: Most of the participants (82%) had at least two age-related syndromes or diseases. The MCA structured the 18 conditions into three major dimensions: Degradation (D) driven by GS, Vascular (V), and Psychosocial (P) representing 68.7%, 7.4%, and 5.7% of the total variance, respectively. Dimension D was a strong predictor of future death and institutionalization. Dimensions D and P were strongly associated with current well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This work confirmed that multimorbidity is very common among older adults, and demonstrated the essential role of GS as manifestations of aging, even more than age-related diseases.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		123	The Journal Of Nutrition, Health & Aging		185	dartigues,j-f	Dartigues	J-F
163	Defining Complex Patient Populations: Implications For Population Size, Composition, Utilization, And Costs.	2022	186	10.1007/s11606-021-06815-4	34080109		186	37	2	351	BACKGROUND: Interventions to support patients with complex needs have proliferated in recent years, but the question of how to identify patients with complex needs has received relatively little attention. There are innumerable ways to structure inclusion and exclusion criteria for complex care interventions, and little is known about the implications of choices made in designing patient selection criteria. OBJECTIVE: To provide insights into the design of patient selection criteria for interventions, by implementing criteria sets within a large health plan member population and comparing the characteristics of the resulting complex patient cohorts. DESIGN: Retrospective observational descriptive study. SUBJECTS: Patients identified as having complex needs, within the membership population of Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large, population-based health plan with more than 4 million members. We characterize five commonly used archetypes of complex needs: high-cost patients, patients with multiple chronic conditions, frail elders, emergency department high-utilizers, and inpatient high-utilizers. MEASURES: We selected an initial set of criteria for identifying patients in each of the archetypical complex populations, based on available administrative data. We then tested multiple variants of each definition. We compared the resulting patient cohorts using univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 32.7% of the 3,112,797 adults in our population-based sample were selected by at least one of the 25 definitions of complexity we tested. Across definitions the total number of patients identified as complex ranged from 622,560 to 1583 and complex patient cohorts varied widely in demographic characteristics, chronic conditions, healthcare utilization, spending, and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of patient population is critical to the design of complex care programs. Exploratory analyses of population criteria can provide useful information for program planning in the setting of limited resources for interventions. Data such as these should be generated as a key step in program design.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		186	Journal Of General Internal Medicine		186	davis,anna.c	Davis	Anna C
164	Impact Of Frailty On Clinical Outcomes And Resource Use Following Emergency General Surgery In The United States.	2021	187	10.1371/journal.pone.0255122	34297772		187	16	7	e0255122	BACKGROUND: Frailty has been recognized as an independent risk factor for inferior outcomes, but its effect on emergency general surgery (EGS) is understudied. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to define the impact of frailty on risk-adjusted mortality, non-home discharge, and readmission following EGS operations. METHODS: Adults undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, small bowel resection, large bowel resection, repair of perforated ulcer, or laparotomy within two days of an urgent admission were identified in the 2016-2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was defined using diagnosis codes corresponding to the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty indicator. Multivariable regression was used to study in-hospital mortality and non-home discharge by operation, and Kaplan Meier analysis to study freedom from unplanned readmission at up to 90-days follow-up. RESULTS: Among 655,817 patients, 11.9% were considered frail. Frail patients most commonly underwent large bowel resection (37.3%) and cholecystectomy (29.2%). After adjustment, frail patients had higher mortality rates for all operations compared to nonfrail, including those most commonly performed (11.9% [95% CI 11.4-12.5%] vs 6.0% [95% CI 5.8-6.3%] for large bowel resection; 2.3% [95% CI 2.0-2.6%] vs 0.2% [95% CI 0.2-0.2%] for cholecystectomy). Adjusted non-home discharge rates were higher for frail compared to nonfrail patients following all operations, including large bowel resection (68.1% [95% CI 67.1-69.0%] vs 25.9% [95% CI 25.2-26.5%]) and cholecystectomy (33.7% [95% CI 32.7-34.7%] vs 2.9% [95% CI 2.8-3.0%]). Adjusted hospitalization costs were nearly twice as high for frail patients. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, frail patients had greater unplanned readmissions (log rank P<0.001), with 1 in 4 rehospitalized within 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Frail patients have inferior clinical outcomes and greater resource use following EGS, with the greatest absolute differences following complex operations. Simple frailty assessments may inform expectations, identify patients at risk of poor outcomes, and guide the need for more intensive postoperative care.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		187	Plos One		187	hadaya,joseph	Hadaya	Joseph
165	A National Intervention To Support Frail Older Adults In Primary Care: A Protocol For An Adapted Implementation Framework.	2021	188	10.1186/s12877-021-02395-4	34348660		23	21	1	453	"BACKGROUND: Older Canadians are high users of health care services, however the health care system is not well-designed to meet the complex needs of many older adults. Older persons often look to their primary care practitioners to assess their needs and coordinate their care. The intervention seeks to improve primary care for older persons living with frailty and will be implemented in six primary care clinics in three Canadian provinces. Presently, more than 1.6 million older Canadians are living with frailty, and this is projected to increase to 2.5 million within a decade (Canadian Frailty Network, Frailty Matters, 2020). The model will include frailty screening, an online portal to expedite referrals and improve coordination with community services, and several tools and techniques to support patient and family engagement and shared decision-making. Our project is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) (Damschroder LJ, et al. Implement Scil, 4, 50, 2009). As others have done, we adapted the CFIR for our work. Our adapted framework combines elements of the socio-ecological model, key concepts from the CFIR, and elements from other implementation science frameworks. Nested within a broader mixed-method implementation study, the focus of this paper is to outline our guiding conceptual framework and qualitative methods protocol. METHODS: We will use the adapted CFIR framework to inform the data we collect and our analytic approach. Our work is divided into three phases: (1) baseline assessment of 'usual care'; (2) tailoring and implementing a new primary care model; and (3) evaluation. In each of these phases we will engage in qualitative data collection, including clinical observations, focus groups, in-depth interviews and extensive field notes. At each site we will collect data with health care providers, key informants (e.g., executive directors), and rostered patients ≥ 70 years. We will engage in team-based analysis across multiple sites, three provinces and two languages through regular telephone conferences, a comprehensive analysis codebook, leadership from our Qualitative Working Group and a collective appreciation that ""science is a team sport"" (Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research 471, 701-702, 2013). DISCUSSION: Outcomes of this research may be used by other research teams who chose to adapt the CFIR framework to reflect the unique contexts of their work, and clinicians seeking to implement our model, or other models of care for frail older patients in primary care.

166	Identifying Frequent Health Care Users And Care Consumption Patterns: Process Mining Of Emergency Medical Services Data.	2021	189	10.2196/27499	34612834		189	23	10	e27499	"BACKGROUND: Tracing frequent users of health care services is highly relevant to policymakers and clinicians, enabling them to avoid wasting scarce resources. Data collection on frequent users from all possible health care providers may be cumbersome due to patient privacy, competition, incompatible information systems, and the efforts involved. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the use of a single key source, emergency medical services (EMS) records, to trace and reveal frequent users' health care consumption patterns. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed analyzing EMS calls from the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands between 2012 and 2017. Process mining was applied to identify the structure of patient routings (ie, their consecutive visits to hospitals, nursing homes, and EMS). Routings are used to identify and quantify frequent users, recognizing frail elderly users as a focal group. The structure of these routes was analyzed at the patient and group levels, aiming to gain insight into regional coordination issues and workload distributions among health care providers. RESULTS: Frail elderly users aged 70 years or more represented over 50% of frequent users, making 4 or more calls per year. Over the period of observation, their annual number and the number of calls increased from 395 to 628 and 2607 to 3615, respectively. Structural analysis based on process mining revealed two categories of frail elderly users: low-complexity patients who need dialysis, radiation therapy, or hyperbaric medicine, involving a few health care providers, and high-complexity patients for whom routings appear chaotic. CONCLUSIONS: This efficient approach exploits the role of EMS as the unique regional ""ferryman,"" while the combined use of EMS data and process mining allows for the effective and efficient tracing of frequent users' utilization of health care services. The approach informs regional policymakers and clinicians by quantifying and detailing frequent user consumption patterns to support subsequent policy adaptations."		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		189	Journal Of Medical Internet Research		189	maruster,laura	Maruster	Laura
167	Clinical Frailty Scale: Inter-Rater Reliability Of Retrospective Scoring In Emergency Abdominal Surgery.	2022	190	10.1111/aas.13974	34425015		190	66	1	25	BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex syndrome shown to be an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality after surgery in older patients. Frailty scoring may, therefore, be important, for example, for pre-operative risk assessment and prognosis estimation. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) has been developed to help operationalize frailty in the individual patient. However, the inter-rater reliability of retrospective CFS scoring through patient records by health care personnel is currently unknown in patients over 80 years of age undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. METHODS: Retrospective review of electronic patient journal of 112 patients over 80 years of age undergoing emergency abdominal surgery between 2015 and 2016. Three researchers individually assigned each patient a CFS score. The inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen's weighted kappa for the comparison of pairs of assessors, as well as Kendall's coefficient of concordance for the comparison of all three raters simultaneously. RESULTS: The agreement across raters was strong, with Cohen's kappa values ranging between 0.74 and 0.85 and a Kendall's coefficient of concordance of 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: The inter-rater reliability of assigned CFS from patient journals seems acceptable. This could permit retrospective research utilizing CFS measures from several raters and across centers.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		190	Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica		190	fornaess,katarina.m	Fornaess	Katarina M
168	Home-Based Extended Rehabilitation For Older People (Hero): Study Protocol For An Individually Randomised Controlled Multi-Centre Trial To Determine The Clinical And Cost-Effectiveness Of A Home-Based Exercise Intervention For Older People With Frailty As Extended Rehabilitation Following Acute Illness Or Injury, Including Embedded Process Evaluation.	2021	191	10.1186/s13063-021-05778-5	34749783		19	22	1	783	BACKGROUND: The majority of older people (> 65 years) in hospital have frailty and are at increased risk of readmission or death following discharge home. In the UK, following acute hospitalisation, around one third of older people with frailty are referred on for rehabilitation, termed 'intermediate care' services. Although this rehabilitation can reduce early readmission to hospital (< 30 days), recipients often do not feel ready to leave the service on discharge, suggesting possible incomplete recovery. Limited evidence suggests extended rehabilitation is of benefit in several conditions and there is preliminary evidence that progressive physical exercise can improve mobility and function for older people with frailty, and slow progression to disability. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Home-based Older People's Exercise (HOPE) programme as extended rehabilitation for older people with frailty discharged home from hospital or intermediate care services after acute illness or injury. METHODS: A multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial, to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the HOPE programme. This individualised, graded and progressive 24-week exercise programme is delivered by NHS physiotherapy teams to people aged 65 and older with frailty, identified using the Clinical Frailty Scale, following discharge from acute hospitalisation and linked intermediate care rehabilitation pathways. The primary outcome is physical health-related quality of life, measured using the physical component summary score of the modified Short Form 36- item health questionnaire (SF36) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported physical and mental health, functional independence, death, hospitalisations, care home admissions. Plans include health economic analyses and an embedded process evaluation. DISCUSSION: This trial seeks to determine if extended rehabilitation, via the HOPE programme, can improve physical health-related quality of life for older people with frailty following acute hospitalisation. Results will improve awareness of the rehabilitation needs of older people with frailty, and provide evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the targeted exercise intervention. There is potential for considerable benefit for health and social care services through widespread implementation of trial findings if clinical and cost-effectiveness is demonstrated.

169	Psoas Muscle Area And Attenuation Are Highly Predictive Of Complications And Mortality After Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair.	2021	192	10.1016/j.jvs.2020.08.141	33002587		192	73	4	1178	OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the psoas muscle area and attenuation (radiodensity), quantified by computed tomography, together with clinical risk assessment, as predictors of outcomes after fenestrated and branched endovascular aortic repair (FBEVAR). METHODS: The present single-center study included 504 patients who had undergone elective FBEVAR for pararenal or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. The clinical risk assessment included age, sex, comorbidities, body mass index, glomerular filtration rate, aneurysm size and extent, cardiac stress test results, ejection fraction, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. Preoperative computed tomography was used to measure the psoas muscle area and attenuation at the L3 level. The lean psoas muscle area (LPMA; area in cm(2) multiplied by attenuation in Hounsfield units [HU]) was calculated by multiplying the area by the attenuation. The risk factors for 90-day mortality, major adverse events (MAEs), and long-term mortality were determined using multivariable analysis. MAEs included 30-day or in-hospital death, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, paraplegia, stroke, and bowel ischemia. A novel risk stratification method was proposed according to the strongest predictors of mortality and MAEs on multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and MAE rates were 2.0%, 5.6%, and 20%, respectively. The independent predictors of 90-day mortality were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, ASA score, and LPMA. The independent predictors of MAEs were aneurysm diameter, glomerular filtration rate, and LPMA. For long-term mortality, the independent predictors were chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, extent I-III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, ASA score, and LPMA. The patients were stratified into three groups according to the ASA score and LPMA: low risk, ASA score II or LPMA >350 cm(2)HU (n = 290); medium risk, ASA score III and LPMA ≤350 cm(2)HU (n = 181); and high risk, ASA score IV and LPMA ≤350 cm(2)HU (n = 33). The 90-day mortality and MAE rates were 1.7% and 16% in the low-, 7.2% and 24% in the medium-, and 30% and 33% in the high-risk patients, respectively (P < .001 and P = .02, respectively). Patients with ASA score IV and LPMA <200 cm(2)HU, indicating sarcopenia (n = 14) had a 43% risk of death within 90 days. The 3-year survival estimates were 80% ± 3% for the low-, 70% ± 4% for the medium-, and 35% ± 9% for the high-risk patients (P < .001). The mean follow-up time was 3.1 ± 2.3 years. CONCLUSIONS: LPMA was a strong predictor of outcomes and the only independent predictor of both mortality and MAEs after FBEVAR. A high muscle mass was protective against complications, regardless of the ASA score. Risk stratification based on the ASA score and LPMA can be used to identify patients at excessively high operative risk.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		192	Journal Of Vascular Surgery		192	kärkkäinen,jussi.m	Kärkkäinen	Jussi M
170	Simple Carbohydrate Intake And Higher Risk For Physical Frailty Over 15 Years In Community-Dwelling Older Adults.	2022	194	10.1093/gerona/glab243	34417799		181	77	1	10	Insulin resistance is a major mechanism involved in the onset of physical frailty (PF). Although rich carbohydrate diets may promote insulin resistance, few studies have examined their association with PF risk. This study aimed to investigate the spectrum of carbohydrate exposure, including carbohydrate intake (simple, complex, and total), glycemic load (a measure of the diet-related insulin demand), and adherence to a low-carbohydrate diet with the incident risk of PF in community-dwelling older adults. Baseline carbohydrate exposure was assessed in nonfrail participants of the Three-City Bordeaux cohort using a 24-hour dietary recall. Over 15 years of follow-up, participants were screened for PF, defined by the FRAIL scale (≥3 criteria out of Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, and weight Loss). Associations were estimated using mixed-effects logistic models adjusted for sex, age, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption, depressive symptomatology, global cognitive performances, and protein and energy intakes. The sample included 1 210 participants (62% females, mean age 76 years). Over the follow-up, 295 (24%) incident cases of PF were documented (28% in females, 18% in males). Higher intake of simple carbohydrates was significantly associated with greater odds of incident PF (per 1-SD increased: OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.02-1.62), specifically among males (OR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.04-2.22). No association was observed with complex or total carbohydrate intake, glycemic load, or low-carbohydrate diet. Among the whole carbohydrate exposure, only higher consumption of simple carbohydrates in older age was associated with a higher risk of developing PF. Further studies are required to explore underlying mechanisms.		2022-10-04 23:33:09	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		181	The Journals Of Gerontology.

172	The C5-75 Program: Meeting The Need For Efficient, Pragmatic Frailty Screening And Management In Primary Care.	2021	197	10.1017/S0714980820000161	32638663		197	40	2	193	Case-Finding for Complex Chronic Conditions in Seniors 75+ (C5-75) is a systematic approach to identify frailty using gait speed and hand-grip strength and to screen for co-morbid conditions. We identified the C5-75 features offering the highest yield for identifying frailty and to streamline the screening program. Analyses included 1,948 C5-75 assessments completed from 2013 to 2018. Age 85 or older, less than regular physical activity, and more than two falls in the previous six months had the strongest associations with frailty. Exempting patients under 85 who reported regular physical activity and less than two falls excluded 39.1 per cent of the cohort while maintaining a sensitivity of 95.2 per cent and a negative predictive value of 99.4 per cent for frailty. These findings provide insight into optimizing screening for frailty, making it more feasible to implement and to identify co-existing conditions that may contribute to or be affected by frailty.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		197	Canadian Journal On Aging = La Revue Canadienne Du Vieillissement		197	lee,linda	Lee	Linda
173	Frailty Screening In Older Adults: Is Annual Screening Necessary In Primary Care?	2022	197	10.1093/fampra/cmab055	34240132		198	39	1	12	BACKGROUND: The Case-finding for Complex Chronic Conditions in Adults 75+ (C5-75) involves annual frailty screening in primary care using dual-trait screening measures of handgrip strength and gait speed, with additional screening for co-existing conditions in those deemed frail. OBJECTIVE: To identify low-risk individuals who could be screened for frailty every 2 years, rather than annually. METHODS: This study examined a prospective cohort of patients who completed at least two annual C5-75 screenings between April 2014 and December 2018. Handgrip strength and gait speed on initial assessment were categorized based on proximity to frailty thresholds and were used to predict frailty risk on the second assessment. We used Fisher's exact test to assess differences in risk. Logistic regression models tested associations between independent variables of age, patient activity level, falls history, grip strength and gait speed on first assessment and dependent variable of frailty on subsequent assessment. RESULTS: Analyses included 571 patients with two annual assessments. Frailty risk on the second assessment was significantly higher for patients who had gait speed or grip strength within 20% of the frailty threshold (5.7%), compared with the other categories (0.7%, 0.9%, 0%; P = 0.002); 60% of patients fell within these lower risk categories. Controlling for grip strength and gait speed, no other measures had significant associations with frailty risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that 60% patients are at low risk (<1%) of transitioning to frailty by the next annual assessment. Reducing screening frequency from annually to every 2 years may be appropriate for these patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		198	Family Practice		197	lee,linda	Lee	Linda
174	Social Factors Associated With Reversing Frailty Progression In Community-Dwelling Late-Stage Elderly People: An Observational Study.	2021	199	10.1371/journal.pone.0247296	33657160		187	16	3	e0247296	Frailty is considered to be a complex concept based mainly on physical vulnerability, but also vulnerabilities in mental/psychological and social aspects. Frailty can be reversible with appropriate intervention; however, factors that are important in recovering from frailty have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to identify factors that help an individual reverse frailty progression and characteristics of individuals that have recovered from frailty. Community-dwelling people aged ≥75 years who responded to the Kihon Checklist (KCL) were enrolled in the study. The KCL consists of 25 yes/no questions in 7 areas: daily-life related activities, motor functions, nutritional status, oral functions, homebound, cognitive functions, and depressed mood. The number of social activities, degree of trust in the community, degree of interaction with neighbors, and subjective age were also evaluated. Frailty was assessed based on the number of checked items: 0-3 for robust, 4-7 for pre-frailty, and ≥8 for frailty. A total of 5050 participants were included for statistical analysis. At the time of the baseline survey in 2016, 18.7% (n = 942) of respondents had frailty, and the follow-up survey showed that the recovery rate from frailty within 2 years (median 24 months) was 31.8% (n = 300). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that exercise-based social participation (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.4; P<0.01) and self-rated health (OR 1.2, CI 1.0-1.5; P = 0.02) were related to reversing frailty progression. Principal component analysis indicated that the main factors constituting the first principal component (contribution rate, 18.3%) included items related to social capital, such as interaction with neighbors, trust in the community, and number of social participation activities. Our results demonstrate that exercise-based social participation and high self-rated health have associations with reversing frailty progression. Individuals that recovered from frailty are characterized by high individual-level social capital components (i.e., trust in community, interaction with neighbors, and social participation).		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		187	Plos One		199	takatori,katsuhiko	Takatori	Katsuhiko
175	Community-Based Complex Interventions To Sustain Independence In Older People, Stratified By Frailty: A Protocol For A Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.	2021	200	10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045637	33589465		21	11	2	e045637	INTRODUCTION: Maintaining independence is a primary goal of community health and care services for older people, but there is currently insufficient guidance about which services to implement. Therefore, we aim to synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of community-based complex interventions to sustain independence for older people, including the effect of frailty, and group interventions to identify the best configurations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs of community-based complex interventions to sustain independence for older people living at home (mean age ≥65 years), compared with usual care or another complex intervention. We will search MEDLINE (1946 to September 2020), Embase (1947 to September 2020), CINAHL (1981 to September 2020), PsycINFO (1806 to September 2020), CENTRAL and clinical trial registries from inception to September 2020, without date/language restrictions, and scan included papers' reference lists. Main outcomes were: living at home, activities of daily living (basic/instrumental), home-care services usage, hospitalisation, care home admission, costs and cost effectiveness. Additional outcomes were: health status, depression, loneliness, falls and mortality. Interventions will be coded, summarised and grouped. An NMA using a multivariate random-effects model for each outcome separately will determine the relative effects of different complex interventions. For each outcome, we will produce summary effect estimates for each pair of treatments in the network, with 95% CI, ranking plots and measures, and the borrowing of strength statistic. Inconsistency will be examined using a 'design-by-treatment interaction' model. We will assess risk of bias (Cochrane tool V.2) and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation for NMA approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research will use aggregated, anonymised, published data. Findings will be reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance. They will be disseminated to policy-makers, commissioners and providers, and via conferences and scientific journals.

176	Lower 1-Year Postoperative Mortality After Acetabular Versus Proximal Femoral Fractures In Elderly Patients.	2021	201	10.2106/JBJS.20.01805	34019495		183	103	19	1807	BACKGROUND: Geriatric acetabular fractures are becoming more common due to demographic changes. Compared with proximal femoral fractures, surgical treatment is more complex and often does not allow full-weight-bearing. The aims of this study were to compare operatively treated acetabular and proximal femoral fractures with regard to (1) cumulative 1-year mortality, (2) perioperative complications, and (3) predictive factors associated with a higher 1-year mortality. METHODS: This institutional review board-approved comparative study included 486 consecutive surgically treated elderly patients (136 acetabular and 350 proximal femoral fractures). After matching, 2 comparable groups of 129 acetabular and 129 proximal femoral fractures were analyzed. Cumulative 1-year mortality was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis, and perioperative complications were documented and graded. After confirming that the proportionality assumption was met, Cox proportional hazard modeling was conducted to identify factors associated with increased 1-year mortality. RESULTS: The acetabular fracture group had a significantly lower cumulative 1-year mortality before matching (18% compared with 33% for proximal femoral fractures, log-rank p = 0.001) and after matching (18% compared with 36%, log-rank p = 0.005). Nevertheless, it had a significantly higher overall perioperative complication rate (68% compared with 48%, p < 0.001). In our multivariable Cox regression analysis, older age, perioperative blood loss of >1 L, and wheelchair mobilization were associated with lower survival rates after acetabular fracture surgery. Older age and a higher 5-item modified frailty index were associated with a higher 1-year mortality rate after proximal femoral fractures, whereas postoperative full weight-bearing was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the complexity of operative treatment and a higher complication rate after acetabular fractures in the elderly, the 1-year mortality rate is lower than that after operative treatment of proximal femoral fractures, even after adjustment for comorbidities.

177	Identifying Opportunities, And Motivation To Enhance Capabilities, Influencing The Development Of A Personalized Digital Health Hub Model Of Care For Hip Fractures: Mixed Methods Exploratory Study.	2021	202	10.2196/26886	34709183		189	23	10	e26886	BACKGROUND: Most older people after a hip fracture injury never return to their prefracture status, and some are admitted to residential aged care facilities. Advancement of digital technology has helped in optimizing health care including self-management and telerehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the perspectives of older patients with hip fracture and their family members and residential aged caregivers on the feasibility of developing a model of care using a personalized digital health hub. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods study in South Australia involving patients aged 50 years and older, their family members, and residential aged caregivers. Quantitative data analysis included basic demographic characteristics, and access to digital devices was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Spearman rank-order correlation was used to examine correlations between the perceived role of a personalized digital health hub in improving health and the likelihood of subsequent use. Findings from qualitative analysis were interpreted using constructs of capability, opportunity, and motivation to help understand the factors influencing the likelihood of potential personalized digital health hub use. RESULTS: This study recruited 100 participants-55 patients, 13 family members, and 32 residential aged caregivers. The mean age of the patients was 76.4 (SD 8.4, range 54-88) years, and 60% (33/55) of the patients were female. Approximately 50% (34/68) of the patients and their family members had access to digital devices, despite less than one-third using computers as part of their occupation. Approximately 72% (72/100) of the respondents thought that personalized digital health hub could improve health outcomes in patients. However, a moderate negative correlation existed with increasing age and likelihood of personalized digital health hub use (Spearman ρ=-0.50; P<.001), and the perceived role of the personalized digital health hub in improving health had a strong positive correlation with the likelihood of personalized digital health hub use by self (Spearman ρ=0.71; P<.001) and by society, including friends and family members (Spearman ρ=0.75; P<.001). Most patients (54/55, 98%) believed they had a family member, friend, or caregiver who would be able to help them use a personalized digital health hub. Qualitative analysis explored capability by understanding aspects of existing knowledge, including willingness to advance digital navigation skills. Access could be improved through supporting opportunities, and factors influencing intrinsic motivation were considered crucial for designing a personalized digital health hub-enabled model of care. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasized the complex relationship between capabilities, motivation, and opportunities for patients, their family members, and formal caregivers as a patient networked unit. The next stage of research will continue to involve a cocreation approach followed by iterative processes and understand the factors influencing the development and successful integration of complex digital health care interventions in real-world scenarios.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		189	Journal Of Medical Internet Research		202	yadav,lalit	Yadav	Lalit
178	Association Between 5-Item Modified Frailty Index And Short-Term Outcomes In Complex Head And Neck Surgery.	2022	203	10.1177/01945998211010443	33971756		203	166	3	482	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of preoperative frailty on short-term outcomes following complex head and neck surgeries (HNSs). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional database analysis. SETTING: American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. METHODS: The 2005 to 2017 ACS-NSQIP was queried for patients undergoing complex HNS. Five-item modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated based on functional status and history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic hypertension. RESULTS: A total of 2786 patients (73.1% male) with a mean age of 62.0 ± 11.6 years were included. Compared to nonfrail patients (41.2%), patients with mFI ≥1 (58.8%) had shorter length of operation (P = .021), longer length of stay (LOS) (P < .001), and higher rates of 30-day reoperation (P = .009), medical complications (P < .001), discharge to nonhome facility (DNHF) (P < .001), and mortality (P = .047). These parameters remained statistically significant when compared across all individual mFI scores (all P < .05). After adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score via multivariate logistic regression, patients with mFI ≥1 were significantly more likely to undergo reoperation (odds ratio [OR], 1.39), surgical complications (OR, 1.19), medical complications (OR, 1.55), prolonged LOS (OR, 1.29), and DNHF (OR, 1.56) (all P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression also demonstrated that after adjusting for confounders, compared to patients with mFI = 1, patients with mFI = 2-5 (18.7%) were more likely to undergo shorter operations (OR, 0.74), have medical (OR, 1.46) or any complications (OR, 1.27), and have DNHF (OR, 1.62) (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: The 5-point mFI can independently predict short-term surgical outcomes following complex HNS. This simple and reliable metric can potentially lead to improved preoperative counseling and postoperative planning for complex HNS patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		203	Otolaryngology--Head And Neck Surgery: Official Journal Of American Academy Of Otolaryngology-Head And Neck Surgery		203	goshtasbi,khodayar	Goshtasbi	Khodayar
179	Projecting Prevalence Of Frailty And Dementia And The Economic Cost Of Care In Japan From 2016 To 2043: A Microsimulation Modelling Study.	2022	204	10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00044-5	35487231		204	7	5	e458	BACKGROUND: Dementia and frailty often accompany one another in older age, requiring complex care and resources. Available projections provide little information on their joint impact on future health-care need from different segments of society and the associated costs. Using a newly developed microsimulation model, we forecast this situation in Japan as its population ages and decreases in size. METHODS: In this microsimulation modelling study, we built a model that simulates an individual's status transition across 11 chronic diseases (including diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke) as well as depression, functional status, and self-reported health, by age, sex, and educational strata (less than high school, high school, and college and higher), on the basis of nationally representative health surveys and existing cohort studies. Using the simulation results, we projected the prevalence of dementia and frailty, life expectancy with these conditions, and the economic cost for formal and informal care over the period 2016-43 in the population of Japan aged 60 years and older. FINDINGS: Between 2016 and 2043, life expectancy at age 65 years will increase from 23·7 years to 24·9 years in women and from 18·7 years to 19·9 years in men. Years spent with dementia will decrease from 4·7 to 3·9 years in women and 2·2 to 1·4 years in men. By contrast, years spent with frailty will increase from 3·7 to 4·0 years for women and 1·9 to 2·1 for men, and across all educational groups. By 2043, approximately 29% of women aged 75 years and older with a less than high school education are estimated to have both dementia and frailty, and so will require complex care. The expected need for health care and formal long-term care is anticipated to reach costs of US$125 billion for dementia and $97 billion for frailty per annum in 2043 for the country. INTERPRETATION: Japan's Government and policy makers should consider the potential social challenges in caring for a sizable population of older people with frailty and dementia, and a widening disparity in the burden of those conditions by sex and by educational status. The future burden of dementia and frailty should be countered not only by curative and preventive technology innovation, but also by social policies to mitigate the health gap.

180	Adherence Is More Than Just Being Present: Example Of A Lay-Led Home-Based Programme With Physical Exercise, Nutritional Improvement And Social Support, In Prefrail And Frail Community-Dwelling Older Adults.	2021	205	10.3390/ijerph18084192	33920981		15	18	8	None	"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the implementation of lifestyle interventions in frail, community-dwelling people. This study highlights different domains of adherence to explain an effectively delivered home-based intervention. METHODS: Eighty prefrail and frail persons (≥65 years) participated in a physical training, nutritional, and social support intervention over 24 weeks. A detailed log book was kept for comprehensive documentation in order to assess adherence and further organizational, exercise, and nutritional parameters. RESULTS: Participants reached an adherence rate (performed home visits/number of planned visits) of 84.0/80.5% from week 1-12/13-24. Out of those, 59% carried out ≥75% of the offered visits. Older age was associated with a higher adherence rate. A mean of 1.5 (0.6) visits/week (2 were planned) were realized lasting for a mean of 1.5 (0.9) hours (154% of the planned duration). Per visit, 1.2 (0.6) circuits of strength training were performed (60.5% of the planned value) and 0.5 (0.3) nutritional interventions (47%). After twelve months, 4.2% still carried out the home visits regularly and 25.0% occasionally. CONCLUSION: Adherence is much more than ""being there"". Adherence rate and category are limited parameters to describe the implementation of a complex lifestyle intervention, therefore a comprehensive documentation is needed."		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		205	lackinger,christian	Lackinger	Christian
181	Outcomes Of Complex Discharge Planning In Older Adults With Complex Needs: A Scoping Review.	2022	206	10.1177/03000605221110511	35903858		206	50	7	3000605221110511	In this scoping review, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated multidisciplinary team discharge planning and identify common outcomes among older adults with complex needs, focusing on a safe transition from the hospital to the community. We performed a literature search for relevant articles using seven electronic databases and agreed search terms. Only articles published in English were included. In total, 23,772 articles were identified, with 27 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. A preponderance of patients aged ≥65 years and women was inferred based on population demographics. Initiatives on complex discharge planning were noted across most Western countries. Common outcomes of complex discharge planning were functionality (n = 11) including frailty (n = 4), quality of life (n = 11), and patient-centered factors including psychosocial needs (n = 9). Various outcomes from complex discharge planning initiatives and pathways were explored in this scoping review. None of the selected studies covered all nine domains of outcome assessment. Further research is needed involving follow-up studies after complex discharge planning interventions to assess their true effectiveness or value.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		206	The Journal Of International Medical Research		206	rameli,puteri.maisarah	Rameli	Puteri Maisarah
182	Rationale And Design Of The Target-Eft Trial: Multicomponent Intervention For Frail And Pre-Frail Patients Hospitalized With Acute Cardiac Conditions.	2022	207	10.1007/s12603-022-1759-y	35297472		123	26	3	282	BACKGROUND: With the aging population and rising rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cardiologists and cardiac surgeons are encountering a growing number of frail older patients that have complex cardiac and non-cardiac issues. Measuring frailty provides valuable prognostic information to help personalize treatment decisions. However, there is minimal evidence on multicomponent frailty interventions in this setting. The TARGET-EFT (The MulTicomponent Acute Intervention in FRail GEriatric PaTients with cardiovascular disease using the Essential Frailty Toolset) trial aims to target physical and non-physical frailty deficits to improve health-related quality of life and hospital-acquired disability in frail patients hospitalized with CVD. METHODS: The TARGET-EFT trial is a single-center parallel-group randomized clinical trial in frail and pre-frail older adults ≥65 years admitted to the cardiovascular unit (CVU) at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec. The trial will compare usual inpatient care to a multicomponent intervention targeting physical weakness, cognitive impairment, malnutrition, and anemia. Outcomes of interest in both groups will be assessed at three time points: (1) study enrollment, (2) discharge from the CVU, and (3) 30 days after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The overarching goal is to treat patients' frailty in parallel with their CVD, and in doing so, optimize patient functional losses while in-hospital and shortly thereafter. The results of this trial will inform best practices for patient-centered care in this vulnerable patient group.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		123	The Journal Of Nutrition, Health & Aging		207	fountotos,r	Fountotos	R
183	Bifurcated Bypass In Severe Chronic Limb Threatening Ischaemia.	2022	208	10.1177/1708538121999856	33691547		208	30	1	63	OBJECTIVES: Revascularization according to the angiosome concept is of proven importance for limb salvage in chronic limb threatening ischaemia but it is not always practicable. Bifurcated bypasses could be considered as an option when an endovascular approach is not feasible or has already failed and a single bypass would not allow direct revascularization of the ischaemic area. Bifurcated bypasses are characterized by landing on two different arteries, the main artery (in direct continuity with the foot vessels) and the secondary one (perfusing the angiosome district). The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bifurcated bypass in chronic limb threatening ischaemia. METHODS: Thirty-five patients were consecutively treated with a bifurcated bypass for chronic limb threatening ischaemia from January 2014 to December 2019 in a single vascular surgery centre. Data from clinical records and operative registers were collected prospectively in an electronic database and retrospectively analysed. Primary and primary assisted bypass patency, amputation-free survival, morbidity and mortality rates at 12 and 24 months were analysed. RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 25.1 months (range 2-72 months). Thirty-six bifurcated bypasses were performed on 35 patients (age 75.3 ± 7.2 years; 69.4% were male). According to Wound, Ischemia, foot Infection classification 22.2% belonged to stage 3 and 77.8% to stage 4 and the mean Rutherford's class was 5.1 ± 0.7. Immediate technical success was 100%. Early mortality and morbidity rates were respectively 5.5%, and 33.3%; foot surgery was performed in 50% of cases with wound healing in all patients. Primary patency and primary assisted bypass patency were 96.7% and 100% at 6 months; 85.2% and 92% at 12 months, 59.9% and 73.4% at 24 months, respectively. Amputation-free survival at 12 and 24 months was, respectively, 95.6% and 78.8%. Overall survival rates at 12 and 24 months were respectively 94.4% and 91.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Bifurcates bypass can provide good results in patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia without endovascular option, especially in diabetic ones. Bifurcated bypass is a complex surgical solution, both to be planned and performed, and it is quite invasive for frail patients that should be accurately selected.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		208	Vascular		208	adami,daniele	Adami	Daniele
184	Clinical Considerations For Insulin Therapy In Older Adults With Type 1 Diabetes.	2022	210	10.1007/s40266-021-00900-3	34664212		210	39	1	23	Type 1 diabetes represents an autoimmune condition with a strong inherited background, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. About 25% of such cases are diagnosed in adulthood, some even as late as the ninth decade of life. The number of older adults with type 1 diabetes is increasing due to improvements in care and decreased mortality rate. However, there is a lack of clinical trials in people older than 70 years of age with type 1 diabetes complicated with comorbidities, frailty, and dependency. The management of type 1 diabetes and the goals of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's health status and life expectancy. In healthier older adults, insulin treatment regimens (multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy) that approximate the normal physiology of insulin secretion should be used to achieve lower glycemic goals, while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia with frequent glucose monitoring (preferably using continuous glucose monitoring systems). For frail individuals with poor health, simpler insulin regimens and less stringent glycemic targets would be more appropriate. Poor cognition, vision and hearing, impaired mobility, depression, and chronic pain can interfere with complex insulin regimens. In these individuals, the principal goals of therapy are to reduce the acute effects of hyperglycemia, minimize hypoglycemia risk, and optimize quality of life. The newer insulin preparations and technological advances in insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring have enhanced the management of type 1 diabetes in all age groups.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		210	Drugs & Aging		210	gandhi,gunjan.y	Gandhi	Gunjan Y
185	Community Health Worker Interventions For Older Adults With Complex Health Needs: A Systematic Review.	2021	211	10.1111/jgs.17078	33738803		110	69	6	1670	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The number of older adults with complex health needs is growing, and this population experiences disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Interventions led by community health workers (CHWs) can improve clinical outcomes in the general adult population with multimorbidity, but few studies have investigated CHW-delivered interventions in older adults. DESIGN: We systematically reviewed the impact of CHW interventions on health outcomes among older adults with complex health needs. We searched for English-language articles from database inception through April 2020 using seven databases. PROSPERO protocol registration CRD42019118761. SETTING: Any U.S. or international setting, including clinical and community-based settings. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 60 years or older with complex health needs, defined in this review as multimorbidity, frailty, disability, or high-utilization. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions led by a CHW or similar role consistent with the American Public Health Association's definition of CHWs. MEASUREMENTS: Pre-defined health outcomes (chronic disease measures, general health measures, treatment adherence, quality of life, or functional measures) as well as qualitative findings. RESULTS: Of 5671 unique records, nine studies met eligibility criteria, including four randomized controlled trials, three quasi-experimental studies, and two qualitative studies. Target population and intervention characteristics were variable, and studies were generally of low-to-moderate methodological quality. Outcomes included mood, functional status and disability, social support, well-being and quality of life, medication knowledge, and certain health conditions (e.g., falls, cognition). Results were mixed with several studies demonstrating significant effects on mood and function, including one high-quality RCT, while others noted no significant intervention effects on outcomes. CONCLUSION: CHW-led interventions may have benefit for older adults with complex health needs, but additional high-quality studies are needed to definitively determine the effectiveness of CHW interventions in this population. Integration of CHWs into geriatric clinical settings may be a strategy to deliver evidence-based interventions and improve clinical outcomes in complex older adults.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		110	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		211	kennedy,meaghan.a	Kennedy	Meaghan A
186	Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix Reconstruction Of Complex Perineal Burn Wound: A Case Report.	2021	212	10.1093/jbcr/irab073	33889942		212	42	5	1038	This case report details our experience using a two-stage Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix (NovoSorb® PolyNovo Ltd) and autograft for acute reconstruction of a complex perineal burn wound in an elderly comorbid patient. A 77-year-old man sustained 42% full-thickness burns extending circumferentially from bilateral thighs and buttocks, across the entire perineal and genital regions up to his mid-trunk, following self-immolation using an accelerant. Early total burn wound excision was carried out with acute application of Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix to all affected sites. Excellent integration and vascularization of Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix took place despite the challenge of intermittent fecal contamination affecting the perineal and buttock burn sites and matrix colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms. Delamination and serial split-thickness skin autografting were carried out 42 days after the first matrix application with complete and robust graft take. Perineal burns present a reconstructive challenge due to the proximity of specialized structures such as the genitalia, urethral, and anal orifices. Restoration of complex anatomy and function may be required after debridement with increased risks of infection, contracture formation, and mortality compared with burns affecting other anatomical sites. Two-stage Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix represents a reliable reconstruction option for complex extensive perineal wounds in frail elderly patients, despite an unfavorable local microbial environment.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		212	Journal Of Burn Care & Research: Official Publication Of The American Burn Association		212	concannon,elizabeth	Concannon	Elizabeth
187	Modern Lower Extremity Bypass Outcomes By Anesthesia Type In The Veteran Population.	2022	213	10.1016/j.avsg.2021.08.028	34673178		213	80		187	"BACKGROUND: Lower extremity bypass (LEB) revascularization can be performed under general (GA) or neuraxial anesthesia (NA). Studies show that the use of NA may decrease morbidity, 30-day mortality, and hospital length-of-stay (LOS). The goal of our analysis is to examine the differences in postsurgical outcomes following LEB between patients who undergo GA compared to NA in the Veteran Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database. METHODS: After IRB approval, the VASQIP database was assessed for patients who underwent LEB between 1998-2018. Only infrainguinal bypass procedures and anesthesia type classified as ""general,"" ""epidural,"" or ""spinal"" were included. The neuraxial cohort includes both spinal and epidural anesthesia patients. The Risk Analysis Index (RAI), a validated measure of frailty, was additionally calculated for each patient. Chi squared, paired t-test, and binary logistic regression were used to compare the cohorts. RESULTS: During this period, 22,960 veterans underwent LEB recorded in VASQIP. Compared to those who underwent surgery under GA, patients with procedures performed using NA were older (66.4 ± 9.6 years vs. 65.3 ± 9 years respectively; P <0.001) and more frail (average RAI score 25.7 ± 7.0 vs. 24.9 ± 6.7; P < 0.001). Operative time was shorter in the NA group (4.1 ± 1.7 hrs vs. 4.7 ± 3.0 hrs; P < 0.001) and fewer cases were emergent (1.55% vs. 4.13%; P <0.001). Patients in the GA group had higher rates of postoperative prolonged ileus (0.31% vs. 0.00%; P = 0.03), pneumonia (1.60% vs. 1.06%; P = 0.025), deep wound infection (2.67% vs. 2.61%; P = 0.01), sepsis (1.68% vs. 0.79%; P < 0.001), reintubation (1.80% vs. 1.30%) (P = 0.04),and number of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfused intraoperatively (0.39 ± 1.21 units vs. 0.22 ± 0.79 units; P <0.001). There was no significant difference in rate of graft failure, return to the OR, myocardial infarction, death, or LOS. In regression analysis, those undergoing NA were less likely to require pRBC transfusion intraoperatively (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.31-0.61; P < 0.001), however no other outcomes reached statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Although younger and less frail, veteran patients undergoing GA for lower extremity revascularization had higher rates of postoperative ileus, pneumonia, deep wound infection, sepsis, and need for transfusion as compared to those undergoing NA. There was no significant difference in the rate of other major complications, myocardial infarction, death or LOS. After adjustment, only intraoperative transfusion remained statistically significant, likely reflecting longer and more complex cases for those that undergo general anesthesia rather than the effect of anesthetic choice itself."		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		213	Annals Of Vascular Surgery		213	boyd,sally	Boyd	Sally

The clinical characteristics at onset are influenced by the presence of common health-related conditions in older people, such as comorbidity, disability and frailty, and not simply by chronological age. Few studies investigated the tendency of Covid-19 symptoms to aggregate in cluster and the use of cluster approach might better describe the clinical complexity of the acute disease. Concerning the prognostic significance of Covid-19 clinical presentation in older people, the available literature still provides discordant results.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		214	Clinics In Geriatric Medicine		214	remelli,francesca	Remelli	Francesca
189	Dynamical Indicators Of Resilience From Physiological Time Series In Geriatric Inpatients: Lessons Learned.	2021	216	10.1016/j.exger.2021.111341	33838217		28	149		111341	The concept of physical resilience may help geriatric medicine objectively assess patients' ability to 'bounce back' from future health challenges. Indicators putatively forecasting resilience have been developed under two paradigms with different perspectives: Critical Slowing Down and Loss of Complexity. This study explored whether these indicators validly reflect the construct of resilience in geriatric inpatients. Geriatric patients (n = 121, 60% female) had their heart rate and physical activity continuously monitored using a chest-worn sensor. Indicators from both paradigms were extracted from both physiological signals. Measures of health functioning, concomitant with low resilience, were obtained by questionnaire at admission. The relationships among indicators and their associations with health functioning were assessed by correlation and linear regression analyses, respectively. Greater complexity and higher variance in physical activity were associated with lower frailty (β = -0.28, p = .004 and β = -0.37, p < .001, respectively) and better ADL function (β = 0.23, p = .022 and β = 0.38, p < .001). The associations of physical activity variance with health functioning were not in the expected direction based on Critical Slowing Down. In retrospect, these observations stress the importance of matching the resilience paradigm's assumptions to the homeostatic role of the variable monitored. We present several lessons learned.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		28	Experimental Gerontology		216	rector,jerrald.l	Rector	Jerrald L
190	A Multivariable Prediction Model To Select Colorectal Surgical Patients For Co-Management.	2021	219	10.20344/amp.12996	33164728		219	34	2	118	INTRODUCTION: Increased life expectancy leads to older and frailer surgical patients. Co-management between medical and surgical specialities has proven favourable in complex situations. Selection of patients for co-management is full of difficulties. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical decision support tool to select surgical patients for co-management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data was collected from patient electronic health records with an ICD-9 code for colorectal surgery from January 2012 to December 2015 at a hospital in Lisbon. The outcome variable consists in co-management signalling. A dataset from 344 patients was used to develop the prediction model and a second data set from 168 patients was used for external validation. RESULTS: Using logistic regression modelling the authors built a five variable (age, burden of comorbidities, ASA-PS status, surgical risk and recovery time) predictive referral model for co-management. This model has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81 - 0.90), a predictive Brier score of 0.11, a sensitivity of 0.80, a specificity of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.3%. DISCUSSION: Early referral of high-risk patients may be valuable to guide the decision on the best level of post-operative clinical care. We developed a simple bedside decision tool with a good discriminatory and predictive performance in order to select patients for comanagement. CONCLUSION: A simple bed-side clinical decision support tool of patients for co-management is viable, leading to potential improvement in early recognition and management of postoperative complications and reducing the 'failure to rescue'. Generalizability to other clinical settings requires adequate customization and validation.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		219	Acta Medica Portuguesa		219	horta,alexandra.bayão	Horta	Alexandra Bayão
191	Goal Planning In Person-Centred Care Supports Older Adults Receiving Case Management To Attain Their Health-Related Goals.	2021	220	10.1080/09638288.2019.1672813	31589075		220	43	12	1682	PURPOSE: Care for older adults should preferably be provided in a person-centred way that includes goal planning. The aim of the present cohort study is to gain an insight into the results of goal planning, in a person-centred care setting for community-living older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within Embrace, a person-centred and integrated care service, older adults set goals with the aim to improve health-related problems. For every goal, they rated severity scores ranging from 0 (no problem) to 10 (extremely severe): a baseline score, a target score and, within one year, an end score to evaluate these goals. The differences between baseline and end scores (goal progress) and target and end scores (goal attainment), and the percentage of goals attained were calculated and compared between health-related domains (i.e., mental health, physical health, mobility, and support). RESULTS: Among 233 older adults, 836 goal plans were formulated of which 74% (95% Confidence Interval: 71-77) were attained. Goals related to physical health were the most likely to be attained and goals for mobility and pain the least likely. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are able to attain health-related goals through collaborative goal planning. We recommend future integrated care programmes for older adults to incorporate goal-planning methods to achieve person-centred care.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONOlder adults experiencing frailty or complex care needs and receiving individual support within an integrated care setting are able to formulate and attain goals using goal planning with severity scores.Goal plans of community-living older adults mostly aim at improving health-related problems concerning physical health, mobility, or support.Goals related to physical health are the most likely to be attained, while goals for mobility and pain are the least likely to be attained.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		220	Disability And Rehabilitation		220	rietkerk,wanda	Rietkerk	Wanda
192	Incidence, Characteristics, And Outcome Of Covid-19 In Adults On Kidney Replacement Therapy: A Regionwide Registry Study.	2021	221	10.1681/ASN.2020060875	33154174		221	32	2	385	BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disproportionally affects frail, elderly patients and those with multiple chronic comorbidities. Whether patients on RRT have an additional risk because of their specific exposure and complex immune dysregulation is controversial. METHODS: To describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, region-wide registry study in adult patients on RRT versus the general population from March 2 to May 25, 2020. This study comprised all patients undergoing RRT in the Flanders region of Belgium, a country that has been severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: At the end of the epidemic wave, crude and age-standardized cumulative incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 5.3% versus 2.5%, respectively, among 4297 patients on hemodialysis, and 1.4% versus 1.6%, respectively, among 3293 patients with kidney transplants (compared with 0.6% in the general population). Crude and age-standardized cumulative mortality rates were 29.6% versus 19.9%, respectively, among patients on hemodialysis, and 14.0% versus 23.0%, respectively, among patients with transplants (compared with 15.3% in the general population). We found no excess mortality in the hemodialysis population when compared with mean mortality rates during the same 12-week period in 2015-2019 because COVID-19 mortality was balanced by lower than expected mortality among uninfected patients. Only 0.18% of the kidney transplant population died of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is high in patients on RRT. Nevertheless, the epidemic's overall effect on the RRT population remained remarkably limited in Flanders. Calculation of excess mortality and age standardization provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden of COVID-19 among patients on RRT.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		221	Journal Of The American Society Of Nephrology: Jasn		221	de meester,johan	De Meester	Johan
193	Describing People With Cognitive Impairment And Their Complex Treatment Needs During Routine Care In The Hospital - Cross-Sectional Results Of The Intersec-Cm Study.	2021	222	10.1186/s12877-021-02298-4	34253180		23	21	1	425	BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is an important determinant in health care. In the acute hospital setting cognition has a strong impact on treatment and care. Cognitive impairment can negatively affect diagnostics and treatment success. However, little is known about the individual situation and specific risks of people with cognitive impairments during hospital stays. The aim of the present research is to describe and analyze the treatment needs of people with cognitive impairments in acute hospital care. METHODS: The analyses use baseline data of the ongoing multisite, longitudinal, randomized controlled intervention trial intersec-CM (Supporting elderly people with cognitive impairment during and after hospital stays with Intersectoral Care Management), which recruited 402 participants at baseline. We assessed sociodemographic aspects, cognitive status, functional status, frailty, comorbidities, level of impairment, formal diagnosis of dementia, geriatric diagnoses, delirium, depression, pharmacological treatment, utilization of health care services and health care related needs. RESULTS: The sample under examination had been on average mildly cognitively impaired (MMSE M = 22.3) and had a mild to moderate functional impairment (Barthel Index M = 50.4; HABAM M = 19.1). The Edmonton Frail Scale showed a mean of 7.4 and half of the patients (52.3%) had been assigned a care level. About 46.9% had a geriatric diagnosis, 3.0% had a diagnosis of dementia. According to DSM-V 19.2% of the patients had at least one main symptom of depression. The mean number of regularly taken drugs per patient was 8.2. Utilization of health care services prior to the hospital stay was rather low. On average, the sample showed 4.38 care related needs in general, of which 0.60 needs were unaddressed at the time of assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Descriptive analyses highlight an in-depth insight into impairments and different care needs of people with cognitive impairments. The results emphasize the need for gender-specific analyses as well as an increased attention to the heterogeneity of needs of people with cognitive impairments related to specific wards, settings and regions where they are admitted. Our results indicate also that people with cognitive impairments represent a high proportion of older patients in acute hospital care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The intersec-CM trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03359408 ).		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		222	kracht,f	Kracht	F
194	Clinicians' Perceptions Of The Appropriateness Of Neurocritical Care For Patients With Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage (Ich): A Qualitative Study.	2021	224	10.1007/s12028-020-01145-5	33263147		224	35	1	162	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinicians working in intensive care frequently report perceptions of inappropriate care (PIC) situations. Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Prognosticating after ICH is complex and may be influenced by clinicians' subjective impressions and biases, which may, in turn, influence decision making regarding the level of care provided. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore perceptions of neurocritical care in relation to the expected functional outcome for ICH patients. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with neurocritical care doctors and nurses. SETTING: Neurocritical care (NCC) department in a UK neuroscience tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS: Eleven neurocritical care nurses, five consultant neurointensivists, two stroke physicians, three neurosurgeons. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews and identified five key themes: (1) prognostic uncertainty (2) subjectivity of good versus poor outcome (3) perceived inappropriate care (PIC) situations (including for frail elderly patients) (4) challenging nature of decision-making (5) clinician distress. CONCLUSIONS: Caring for severely affected ICH patients in need of neurocritical care is challenging, particularly with frail elderly patients. Awareness of the challenges could facilitate interventions to improve decision-making for this group of stroke patients and their families, as well as measures to reduce the distress on clinicians who care for this patient group. Our findings highlight the need for effective interdisciplinary shared decision making involving the family, taking into account patients' previously expressed values and preferences and incorporating these into bespoke care planning.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		224	Neurocritical Care		224	mc lernon,siobhan	Mc Lernon	Siobhan
195	Depressive Symptoms And Malnutrition Are Associated With Other Geriatric Syndromes And Increase Risk For 30-Day Readmission In Hospitalized Older Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study.	2022	225	10.1186/s12877-022-03343-6	35918652		23	22	1	634	BACKGROUND: Readmission in older adults is typically complex with multiple contributing factors. We aim to examine how two prevalent and potentially modifiable geriatric conditions - depressive symptoms and malnutrition - relate to other geriatric syndromes and 30-day readmission in hospitalized older adults. METHODS: Consecutive admissions of patients ≥ 65 years to a general medical department were recruited over 16 months. Patients were screened for depression, malnutrition, delirium, cognitive impairment, and frailty at admission. Medical records were reviewed for poor oral intake and functional decline during hospitalization. Unplanned readmission within 30-days of discharge was tracked through the hospital's electronic health records and follow-up telephone interviews. We use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict the relationship of depressive symptoms and malnutrition with geriatric syndromes that constitute covariates of interest and 30-day readmission outcome. Multiple logistic regression was performed for the independent associations of depressive symptoms and malnutrition with 30-day readmission, adjusting for variables based on DAG-identified minimal adjustment set. RESULTS: We recruited 1619 consecutive admissions, with mean age 76.4 (7.9) years and 51.3% females. 30-day readmission occurred in 331 (22.0%) of 1,507 patients with follow-up data. Depressive symptoms, malnutrition, higher comorbidity burden, hospitalization in the one-year preceding index admission, frailty, delirium, as well as functional decline and poor oral intake during the index admission, were more commonly observed among patients who were readmitted within 30 days of discharge (P < 0.05). Patients with active depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to be frail (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.22-2.16), had poor oral intake (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.02-1.79) and functional decline during admission (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.11-2.23). Malnutrition at admission was significantly associated with frailty (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.19), delirium (OR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.60-3.39) cognitive impairment (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.39-2.54) and poor oral intake during hospitalization (OR = 2.70, 95% CI 2.01-3.64). In minimal adjustment set identified by DAG, depressive symptoms (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.86) remained significantly associated with 30-day readmission. The association of malnutrition with 30-day readmission was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age, ethnicity and depressive symptoms in the minimal adjustment set (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.99-1.98). CONCLUSION: The observed causal associations support screening and targeted interventions for depressive symptoms and malnutrition during admission and in the post-acute period.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		225	laura,tay	Laura	Tay
196	New Horizons In Cardiogeriatrics: Geriatricians And Heart Failure Care-The Custard In The Tart, Not The Icing On The Cake.	2021	227	10.1093/ageing/afab057	33837764		131	50	4	1064	Heart failure (HF) can be considered a disease of older people. It is a leading cause of hospitalisation and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in the over-65s. In 2012, an editorial in this journal detailed the latest HF research and guidelines, calling for greater integration of geriatricians in HF care. This current article reflects upon what has been achieved in this field in recent years, highlighting some future challenges and promising areas. It is written from the perspective of one such integrated team and explores the new role of cardiogeriatrician, working in a multidisciplinary team to deliver and improve care to increasingly complex, older, frail patients with multiple comorbidities who present with primary cardiology problems, especially decompensated HF. Geriatric liaison has improved the care of frail patients in orthopaedics, cancer services, stroke, acute medicine and numerous community settings. We propose that this vital role should now be extended to cardiology teams in general and to HF in particular.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		227	levy,shuli	Levy	Shuli
197	"Encouraging Older Adults With Pre-Frailty And Frailty To ""Movestrong"": An Analysis Of Secondary Outcomes For A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial."	2022	228	10.24095/hpcdp.42.6.02	35766913		228	42	6	238	BACKGROUND: This 8-week pilot stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial evaluated the MoveStrong program for teaching adults who have frailty/pre-frailty about balance and functional strength training and sufficient protein intake to prevent falls and improve mobility. METHODS: We recruited individuals aged 60 years and over, with a FRAIL scale score of 1 or higher and at least one chronic condition, who were not currently strength training. The program included 16 exercise physiologist-led hour-long group sessions and two dietitian-led hour-long nutrition sessions. We analyzed secondary outcomes-weight, gait speed, grip strength, physical capacity (fatigue levels), sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical activity levels and protein intake-using a paired t test and a generalized estimating equation (GEE). RESULTS: Of 44 participants (mean [SD] age 79 [9.82] years), 35 were pre-frail and 9 were frail. At follow-up, participants had significantly improved grip strength (1.63 kg, 95% CI: 0.62 to 2.63); sit-to-stand functioning (2 sit-to-stands, 95% CI: 1 to 3); and dynamic balance (1.68 s, 95% CI: 0.47 to 2.89). There were no significant improvements in gait speed, HRQoL index scores, self-rated health, physical activity levels (aerobic activity and strength training) or protein intake. GEE analysis revealed an interaction between exposure to MoveStrong and gait speed, sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance and HRQoL index scores. The total cost to administer the program and purchase equipment was CAD 14 700, equivalent to CAD 377 per participant. CONCLUSION: Exploratory analyses suggest MoveStrong exercises may improve gait speed, sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance and HRQoL index scores in older individuals who are frail and pre-frail.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		228	Health Promotion And Chronic Disease Prevention In Canada: Research, Policy And Practice		228	rodrigues,isabel.b	Rodrigues	Isabel B
198	The Impact Of Frailty On Mortality In Older Patients Admitted To An Intensive Care Unit.	2022	229	10.1016/j.medine.2020.05.015	34991871		229	46	1	23	OBJECTIVE: Frailty is a relatively new concept for intensivists, and is defined as a status of increased vulnerability to stressors associated with reduced reserve and function of different physiological systems. Supporting the hypothesis that frailty may be an important predictor of poor prognosis among older patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), this study seeks to evaluate the association between frailty at ICU admission and short and long-term mortality. DESIGN: An unmatched case-control study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive Care Unit. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Patients≥80 years of age admitted to the ICU for medical reasons. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, while secondary outcomes were ICU mortality and mortality at one year. RESULTS: Most of the patients were classified as frail at ICU admission (55.3%). The prevalence of frailty was higher among those who died than in those who were alive within 30 days from ICU admission (62.3% vs 48.3%, p=0.01). One-year mortality was higher in frail (84.4%) than in non-frail patients (65.2%, p<0.001). In the logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders such as chronic diseases, clinical complexity, cause of ICU admission and use of advanced procedures, frailty was seen to be significantly associated to one-year mortality, but not with ICU mortality or 30-day mortality. DISCUSSION: The admission of geriatric patients to the ICU is increasing. Frailty assessment may play an important role in the clinical evaluation of such individuals for triage, but should not be considered a priori as an exclusion criterion for admission.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		229	Medicina Intensiva		229	pasin,l	Pasin	L
199	Models Of Integrated Care For Older People With Frailty: A Horizon Scanning Review.	2022	230	10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060142	35396317		21	12	4	e060142	OBJECTIVES: Frailty, a multifaceted geriatric condition, is an emerging global health problem. Integrated care models designed to meet the complex needs of the older people with frailty are required. Early identification of innovative models may inform policymakers and other stakeholders of service delivery alternatives they can introduce and locally adapt so as to tackle system fragmentation and lack of coordination. This study used horizon scanning methodologies to systematically search for, prioritise and assess new integrated care models for older people with frailty and investigated experts' views on barriers and facilitators to the adoption of horizon scanning in health services research. METHODS: A four-step horizon scanning review was performed. Frailty-specific integrated care models and interventions were identified through a review of published literature supplemented with grey literature searches. Results were filtered and prioritised according to preset criteria. An expert panel focus group session assessed the prioritised models and interventions on innovativeness, impact and potential for implementation. The experts further evaluated horizon scanning for its perceived fruitfulness in aiding decision-making. RESULTS: Nine integrated care models and interventions at system level (n=5) and community level (n=4) were summarised and assessed by the expert panel (n=7). Test scores were highest for the Walcheren integrated care model (system-based model) and EuFrailSafe (community-based intervention). The participants stated that horizon scanning as a decision-making tool could aid in assessing knowledge gaps, criticising the status quo and developing new insights. Barriers to adoption of horizon scanning on individual, organisational and wider institutional level were also identified. CONCLUSION: Study findings demonstrated that horizon scanning is a potentially valuable tool in the search for innovative service delivery models. Further studies should evaluate how horizon scanning can be institutionalised and effectively used for serving this purpose.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		21	Bmj Open		230	a kjelsnes,ashwanee	A Kjelsnes	Ashwanee
200	Impact Of Childhood Trauma On Multidimensional Frailty In Older Patients With A Unipolar Depressive-, Anxiety- Or Somatic Symptom Disorder.	2021	231	10.1016/j.archger.2021.104452	34111719		14	96		104452	OBJECTIVES: Frailty marks an increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Since childhood trauma is associated with the onset of physical and mental health diseases during the lifespan, we examined the link between childhood trauma and multidimensional frailty. METHOD: A cross-sectional study embedded in a clinical cohort study (ROM-GPS) of older (≥60 years) patients (n=182) with a unipolar depressive-, anxiety- and/or somatic symptom disorder according to DSM-criteria referred to specialized geriatric mental health care. Frailty was assessed with the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), comprising a physical, psychological, and social dimension. Physical, sexual and psychological abuse and emotional neglect before the age of 16 years was measured with a structured interview. RESULTS: Of 182 patients, 103 (56.6%) had experienced any childhood trauma and 154 (84.6%) were frail (TFI sum score ≥5). Linear regression analyses, adjusted for lifestyle, psychological and physical-health factors, showed that the presence of any type of childhood trauma was not associated with the TFI sum score, however when considered separately, physical abuse was (ß=0.16, p=.037). Regarding the specific frailty dimensions, any childhood trauma was associated with social frailty (ß=0.18, p=.019), with emotional neglect as main contributor. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate a complex link between different types of childhood trauma and multidimensional frailty among older psychiatric patients. Regarding the three dimensions of frailty, social frailty seems most affected by childhood trauma. This may have been underestimated until now and should receive more attention in clinical care and future research.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		14	Archives Of Gerontology And Geriatrics		231	schmahl,o.c	Schmahl	O C
201	Tissue Remodelling And Increased Dna Damage In Patients With Incompetent Valves In Chronic Venous Insufficiency.	2021	234	10.1111/jcmm.16711	34148301		234	25	16	7878	Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), in which blood return to the heart is impaired, is a prevalent condition worldwide. Valve incompetence is a complication of CVI that results in blood reflux, thereby aggravating venous hypertension. While CVI has a complex course and is known to produce alterations in the vein wall, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unclear. This study examined the presence of DNA damage, pro-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix remodelling in CVI-related valve incompetence. One hundred and ten patients with CVI were reviewed and divided into four groups according to age (<50 and ≥50 years) and a clinical diagnosis of venous reflux indicating venous system valve incompetence (R) (n = 81) or no reflux (NR) (n = 29). In vein specimens (greater saphenous vein) from each group, PARP, IL-17, COL-I, COL-III, MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The younger patients with valve incompetence showed significantly higher PARP, IL-17, COL-I, COL-III, MMP-2 and reduced TIMP-2 expression levels and a higher COL-I/III ratio. Young CVI patients with venous reflux suffer chronic DNA damage, with consequences at both the local tissue and systemic levels, possibly associated with ageing.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		234	Journal Of Cellular And Molecular Medicine		234	ortega,miguel.a	Ortega	Miguel A
202	Kidney Transplantation Or Dialysis In Older Adults-An Interview Study On The Decision-Making Process.	2022	235	10.1093/ageing/afac111	35511744		131	51	6	None	BACKGROUND: In older patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the choice between kidney transplantation (KT) and dialysis may be more complex than in younger patients because of a higher prevalence of comorbidities and frailty. This study aims to provide greater insight into the current decision-making process by exploring the expectations, experiences and health outcome priorities of all stakeholders. METHODS: We performed semi-structured interviews with patients ≥65 years with ESKD (eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73m2, KT recipient or treated with dialysis), patients' relatives and healthcare professionals (nephrologists, nurses and medical social workers). Interviews were conducted until data saturation and thematically analysed. RESULTS: We performed 36 interviews (patients n = 18, relatives n = 5, healthcare professionals n = 13). Thematic analysis revealed five themes. Older patients' health outcome priorities were mostly related to quality of life (QOL). Individual older patients showed marked differences in the preferred level of engagement during the decision-making process (varying from 'wants to be in the lead' to 'follows the nephrologist') and in informational needs (varying from evidence-based to experience-based). On the contrary, healthcare professionals were quite unanimous on all aspects. They focused on determining eligibility for KT as start of the decision-making process, on clear and extensive information provision and on classical, medical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The decision-making process could benefit from early identification of older patients' values, needs and health outcome priorities, in parallel with assessment of KT eligibility and before discussing the treatment options, and the explicit use of this information in further steps of the decision-making process.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		235	schoot,tessa.s	Schoot	Tessa S
203	Age, Not Sex, Modifies The Effect Of Frailty On Long-Term Outcomes After Cardiac Surgery.	2022	236	10.1097/SLA.0000000000004060	32541219		143	275	4	800	OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of frailty in surgical patients and determine whether age and sex modify the relationship between frailty and long-term mortality. BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex and prevalent clinical syndrome. The cardiac surgery literature consists mostly of small, single-center studies, and the epidemiology of frailty remains to be fully elucidated in a real-world surgical population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and/or aortic, mitral or tricuspid valve surgery in Ontario, Canada, between 2008 and 2016. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Survival probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the association of covariates with the hazard of death was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Frailty was assessed using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator. RESULTS: Of 72,824 patients, 11,685 (16%) were frail. At median 5 ± 2 years of follow-up, 2921 (25.0%) frail patients and 8637 (14.1%) non-frail patients had died [adjusted hazard ratio 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.53-1.68]. The adjusted hazard ratio was highest in patients who underwent isolated mitral (2.18; 95% CI, 1.71-2.77) and mitral + aortic valve surgery (1.85; 95% CI, 1.33-2.58) and lowest after coronary artery bypass grafting + mitral valve surgery (1.38; 95% CI, 1.11-1.70). Age, but not sex, modified the effect of frailty on mortality; such that the rate of death decreased linearly with increasing patient age. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high prevalence of frailty in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and a statistically significant association between frailty and long-term mortality after cardiac procedures. Importantly, the rate of death was inversely proportional to age, such that frailty had a stronger adverse impact on younger patients. Our findings highlight the need to incorporate frailty into the preoperative risk stratification and investigate strategies to support younger patients who are frail.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		143	Annals Of Surgery		236	sun,louise.y	Sun	Louise Y
204	Kinematic Analysis Of Activities Of Daily Living Performance In Frail Elderly.	2022	237	10.1186/s12877-022-02902-1	35321645		23	22	1	244	BACKGROUND: Frailty is accompanied by limitations of activities of daily living (ADL) and frequently associated with reduced quality of life, institutionalization, and higher health care costs. Despite the importance of ADL performance for the consequence of frailty, movement analyses based on kinematic markers during the performance of complex upper extremity-based manual ADL tasks in frail elderly is still pending. The main objective of this study was to evaluate if ADL task performance of two different tasks in frail elderlies can be assessed by an activity measurement based on an acceleration sensor integrated into a smartwatch, and further to what degree kinematic parameters would be task independent. METHODS: ADL data was obtained from twenty-seven elderly participants (mean age 81.6 ± 7.0 years) who performed two ADL tasks. Acceleration data of the dominant hand was collected using a smartwatch. Participants were split up in three groups, F (frail, n = 6), P (pre-frail, n = 13) and R (robust, n = 8) according to a frailty screening. A variety of kinematic measures were calculated from the vector product reflecting activity, agility, smoothness, energy, and intensity. RESULTS: Measures of agility, smoothness, and intensity revealed significant differences between the groups (effect sizes combined over tasks η(2)(p) = 0.18 - 0.26). Smoothness was particularly affected by frailty in the tea making task, while activity, agility, a different smoothness parameter and two intensity measures were related to frailty in the gardening task. Four of nine parameters revealed good reliability over both tasks (r = 0.44 - 0.69). Multiple linear regression for the data combined across tasks showed that only the variability of the magnitude of acceleration peaks (agility) contributed to the prediction of the frailty score (R(2) = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that ADL task performance can be assessed by smartwatch-based measures and further shows task-independent differences between the three levels of frailty. From the pattern of impaired and preserved performance parameters across the tested tasks, we concluded that in persons with frailty ADL performance was more impaired by physiological deficiencies, i.e., physical power and endurance, than by cognitive functioning or sensorimotor control.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		237	schmidle,stephanie	Schmidle	Stephanie
205	External Prospective Validation Of The Modified Cristal Score For 30- And 90-Day Mortality In Geriatric Urgent Surgical Patients.	2021	238	10.1007/s11605-020-04822-0	33111261		238	25	8	2083	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the predictive accuracy of the modified clinical prognostic tool Criteria for Screening and Triaging to Appropriate aLternative care (CriSTAL) to predict 30-day and 90-day mortality in older patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery. BACKGROUND: Anticipating the mid-term mortality of older patients undergoing urgent surgery is complex and flawed with uncertainty. METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive ≥ 65 years old presenting at the emergency department who subsequently underwent urgent abdominal surgery. The modified CriSTAL score was calculated in the sample using the FRAIL scale instead of the Clinical Frailty Scale. Discrimination (area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC)) and model calibration were used to test the predictive accuracy of the modified CriSTAL score for death within 30-day mortality as the primary outcome. RESULTS: A total of 500 patients (median age 78 years) were enrolled. The observed 30-day and 90-day mortality rate were 11.6% and 13.6%. The modified CriSTAL tool AUROC curve to predict 30-day and 90-day mortality was 0.78 and 0.77. The model was well calibrated according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p: 0.302) and the calibration plots to predict 30-day and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The modified CriSTAL tool (with FRAIL scale as frailty instrument) had good discriminant power and was well calibrated to predict 30-day and 90-day mortality in elderly patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery. The modified CriSTAL tool is an easy preoperative tool that could assist in the prognosis of postoperative outcomes and decision-making discussions with patients before for urgent abdominal surgery.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		238	Journal Of Gastrointestinal Surgery: Official Journal Of The Society For Surgery Of The Alimentary Tract		238	eguaras córdoba,inés	Eguaras Córdoba	Inés
206	Determinants Of Improved Quality Of Life Among Older Adults With Multimorbidity Receiving Integrated Outpatient Services: A Hospital-Based Retrospective Cohort Study.	2021	240	10.1016/j.archger.2021.104475	34304112		14	97		104475	BACKGROUND: Older adults with multiple complex care needs tend to receive fragmented care that may jeopardize their quality of life (QoL) and health outcomes. This study evaluated the determinants of improved QoL among integrated outpatient service recipients with multimorbidity. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of integrated geriatric outpatient services (IGOS) at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. Data from 2018 to 2019 were retrieved. All patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment, which included demographic information, serial functional assessments, and assessment for QoL. QoL was reassessed through a telephone survey 6 months after the patients' first visit to IGOS. Factors associated with the interval changes in QoL were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Data from 995 patients receiving IGOS (mean age: 82.21 ± 7.96 years, 54.5% males) were analyzed. An overall mean improvement in QoL was noted (EQ-5D index: +0.055±0.26, p <0.001) while 747 recipients reported maintained or improved QoL. The results of the multivariate logistic regression showed that poorer nutritional status (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.07-2.28), depressive symptoms (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.38-2.86), and frailty (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.10-2.52) were independent risk factors for poorer QoL after adjustment for baseline QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated outpatient services improved the quality of life of older adults with multimorbidity. Those with poorer nutritional status, depressive symptoms and frailty were less likely to show improvement in their QoL.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		14	Archives Of Gerontology And Geriatrics		240	yen,ko-han	Yen	Ko-Han
207	Can Dedicated Emergency Team And Area For Older People Reduce The Hospital Admission Rate? - An Observational Pre- And Post-Intervention Study.	2021	241	10.1186/s12877-021-02044-w	33568087		23	21	1	115	BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) care of older patients is often complex. Geriatric ED guidelines can help to meet this challenge. However, training requirements, the use of time-consuming tools for comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), a lack of golden standard to identify the frail patients, and the weak evidence of positive outcomes of using CGA in EDs pose barriers to introduce the guidelines. Dedicating an interprofessional team of regular ED medical and nursing staff and an older-friendly ED area can be another approach. Previous studies of geriatrician-led CGA in EDs have reported a reduced hospital admission rate. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a dedicated interprofessional emergency team also can reduce the hospital admission rate without the resources required by the formal use of CGA. METHODS: An observational pre-post study at a large adult ED, where all patients 80 years or older arriving on weekdays in the intervention period from 2016.09.26 to 2016.11.28 and the corresponding weekdays in the previous year from 2015.09.28 to 2015.11.30 were included. In the intervention period, older patients either received care in the geriatric module by the dedicated team or in the regular team modules for patients of mixed ages. In 2015, all patients received care in regular team modules. The primary outcome measure was the total hospital admission rate and the ED length of stay was the secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: We included 2377 arrivals in the intervention period, when 26.7% (N = 634) received care in the geriatric module, and 2207 arrivals in the 2015 period. The total hospital admission rate was 61.7% (N = 1466/2377) in the intervention period compared to 64.8% (N = 1431/2207) in 2015 (p = 0.03). The difference was larger for patients treated in the geriatric module, 51.1% compared to 62.1% (95% CI: 56.3 to 68.0%) for patients who would have been eligible in 2015. The ED length of stay was longer in the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: An interprofessional team and area dedicated to older patients was associated to a lower hospital admission rate. Further studies are needed to confirm the results.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		241	liu,jenny	Liu	Jenny
208	An Evaluation Of The Geriatric Dental Curricula Within Advanced Education In General Dentistry And General Practice Residency Programs In The United States.	2021	242	10.1111/scd.12553	33382104		242	41	2	210	AIM: To compare the geriatric dentistry curricula between Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) and General Practice Residency (GPR) programs. METHODS: A 108-item survey was developed to assess residents' didactic and clinical experiences pertaining to geriatric patients. Surveys were mailed in 2018 to all AEGD (N = 89) and GPR (N = 180) program directors. Statistical analysis consisted of descriptive and bivariate analyses with the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test (alpha = .05). RESULTS: Twenty-four AEGD and fifty-eight GPR directors completed surveys (response rate = 30%). Seventy-one percent of responding programs reported mandatory didactic training pertaining to frail and functionally dependent geriatric adults. Ninety-nine percent of respondents reported that residents provided treatment to geriatric patients; however, they were less likely to perform procedures on frail and functionally dependent patients. Only 15% of respondents provided nursing home care. Considering all patient encounters, responding GPR programs were more likely than AEGD programs to treat patients using IV bisphosphonates (63% vs 25%; P < .01), undergoing chemotherapy (48% vs 16%; P = .02), and undergoing head and neck radiation therapy (55% vs 25%; P = .02). CONCLUSION: A majority of responding AEGD and GPR programs reported providing educational experiences pertaining to geriatric patients; however, GPR programs reported treating more medically complex patients than AEGD programs.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		242	Special Care In Dentistry: Official Publication Of The American Association Of Hospital Dentists, The Academy Of Dentistry For The Handicapped, And The American Society For Geriatric Dentistry		242	mueldener,emma.j	Mueldener	Emma J
209	Percutaneous Coronary Intervention For Chronic Total Occlusion In Octogenarians: A Propensity Score Study.	2022	243	10.1038/s41598-022-06994-y	35197506		243	12	1	3073	Feasibility and efficacy of complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the elderly, a more frail population due to more comorbidities is incompletely understood. We therefore set out to compare success and complication rate of PCI for chronic total occlusion (CTO) in octogenarians, in comparison to non-octogenarians. Data from 267 patients (58 patients over 80 years of age and 209 under 80 years of age) who had undergone CTO PCI were analyzed. To compare the results we calculated the propensity score and used inverse probability of treatment weighting. We evaluated demographic, clinical, angiographic, and periprocedural information. The median age of the total collective was 68 (31-90) years (octogenarian collective 82 (80-90) years vs non-octogenarians 65 (31-79) years). We observed a high success rate in both collectives (82.8% vs 90.4%, p = 0.10) and no difference in periprocedural complications or complications in the follow-up period. In our collective restenosis rate at follow-up was comparable to the propensity sore weighted population (11.3% vs 16.3%, p = 0.9). Our results show that CTO PCI in older patients is safe and feasible with comparable in-hospital and follow-up complication rates compared to a younger patient population.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		243	Scientific Reports		243	blessing,recha.r.l	Blessing	Recha R L
210	Urinary Titin N-Fragment Evaluation In A Randomized Controlled Trial Of Beta-Hydroxy-Beta-Methylbutyrate For Acute Mild Trauma In Older Adults.	2021	244	10.3390/nu13030899	33802012		73	13	3	None	The effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) complex administration and the significance of titin, a biomarker of muscle injury, in elderly minor trauma patients in acute phase has not been established. In this single-center, randomized controlled study, trauma patients aged ≥ 70 years with an injury severity score < 16 were included. Titin values on days 1 and 3 were measured and the intervention group received HMB complex (2.4 g of HMB + 14 g of glutamine + 14 g of arginine) and the control group received glutamine complex (7.2 g of protein including 6 g of glutamine). The cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris (RFCSA) on ultrasound, grip strength, and the Barthel Index were assessed on the first day of rehabilitation and after 2 weeks. We analyzed 24 HMB and 25 control participants. Titin values on day 3 correlated with grip strength (r = -0.34, p = 0.03) and the Barthel Index (r = -0.39, p = 0.01) at follow-up. HMB complex supplementation had no effect on the RFCSA (2.41 vs. 2.45 cm(2), p = 0.887), grip strength (13.3 vs. 13.1 kg, p = 0.946), or the Barthel Index (20.0 vs. 50.0, p = 0.404) at follow-up. Titin values might associate with subsequent physical function. Short-term HMB complex supplementation from acute phase did not ameliorate muscle injury.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		73	Nutrients		244	nakano,hidehiko	Nakano	Hidehiko
211	Managing The Risk Of Toxicity In The Treatment Of Elderly Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas.	2021	245	10.1080/14740338.2021.1915985	33956569		245	20	8	903	INTRODUCTION: Nearly half of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) occur after the age of 65 years. Treating these patients is a complex issue in the absence of specific guidelines. AREAS COVERED: This is a narrative review that summarizes current data on the efficacy and the safety of different treatment strategies in this subpopulation. EXPERT OPINION: Age per se should not be a limiting factor to treatment. Surgery remains the treatment of choice offering the only chance of cure. The potential for benefit from adjuvant therapies must be discussed in the context of expected treatment-related toxicities and impairment of quality of life. Efficacy of systemic treatment in advanced disease did not differ from that in younger patients. However, safety must be considered when selecting treatments. Managing the risk of toxicity requires an assessment of vulnerabilities with validated tools. The Comprehensive geriatric assessment has become increasingly accepted but need to be validated in STS patients. Frailty should not exclude patients from potentially life-saving therapy. The correction of reversible conditions and active supportive care may make the treatment safer. Future studies are warranted to define better the patterns, benefits, risks of existing treatments. New options remain to be identified to reduce toxicity.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		245	Expert Opinion On Drug Safety		245	arifi,samia	Arifi	Samia
212	Problems In Care And Avoidability Of Death After Discharge From Intensive Care: A Multi-Centre Retrospective Case Record Review Study.	2021	246	10.1186/s13054-020-03420-5	33407702		246	25	1	10	BACKGROUND: Over 138,000 patients are discharged to hospital wards from intensive care units (ICUs) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland annually. More than 8000 die before leaving hospital. In hospital-wide populations, 6.7-18% of deaths have some degree of avoidability. For patients discharged from ICU, neither the proportion of avoidable deaths nor the reasons underlying avoidability have been determined. We undertook a retrospective case record review within the REFLECT study, examining how post-ICU ward care might be improved. METHODS: A multi-centre retrospective case record review of 300 consecutive post-ICU in-hospital deaths, between January 2015 and March 2018, in 3 English hospitals. Trained multi-professional researchers assessed the degree to which each death was avoidable and determined care problems using the established Structured Judgement Review method. RESULTS: Agreement between reviewers was good (weighted Kappa 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.88). Discharge from an ICU for end-of-life care occurred in 50/300 patients. Of the remaining 250 patients, death was probably avoidable in 20 (8%, 95% CI 5.0-12.1) and had some degree of avoidability in 65 (26%, 95% CI 20.7-31.9). Common problems included out-of-hours discharge from ICU (168/250, 67.2%), suboptimal rehabilitation (167/241, 69.3%), absent nutritional planning (76/185, 41.1%) and incomplete sepsis management (50/150, 33.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of deaths in hospital with some degree of avoidability is higher in patients discharged from an ICU than reported in hospital-wide populations. Extrapolating our findings suggests around 550 probably avoidable deaths occur annually in hospital following ICU discharge in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This avoidability occurs in an elderly frail population with complex needs that current strategies struggle to meet. Problems in post-ICU care are rectifiable but multi-disciplinary.

213	Design Considerations For The Development And Implementation Of A Medical Respite For Older Adults Experiencing Homelessness In Metro Vancouver.	2021	247	10.1097/MLR.0000000000001335	33710087		247	59	Suppl 2	S146	BACKGROUND: Older persons with lived or living experience of homelessness (PWLEs) often live with complex physical and/or mental health conditions which are challenged by poor access to health services, especially primary care. To fill the gap in the continuum of care following hospital discharge for PWLEs, medical respite provides health and shelter support for PWLEs who do not have acute care needs that qualify for a stay in a hospital bed, yet are too sick or frail to recover on the streets or in a traditional shelter. OBJECTIVE: This study examines how a medical respite could be designed for older PWLEs in Metro Vancouver, BC. RESEARCH DESIGN: Using a community-based participatory research approach, in-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with PWLE (n=15) and service provider (n=11) participants. RESULTS: Participants offered rich suggestions about (a) the culture of the medical respite, (b) the physical design of a medical respite, (c) individuals who should be involved in medical respite delivery, (d) services a medical respite should provide, and (e) who the medical respite should serve. CONCLUSIONS: When designing a medical respite for older PWLEs, considerations include providing an environment where patients can rest, but also feel safe and be surrounded by persons who they trust and who care for them. Developing a medical respite that adheres to the tenets of trauma-informed and patient-centered care acknowledges the mistrust and traumatization that often accompanies homeless patients presenting to health care.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		247	Medical Care		247	canham,sarah.l	Canham	Sarah L
214	Should Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Be The Standard Treatment Strategy For Significant Coronary Artery Disease In All Octogenarians?	2021	248	10.2174/1573403X16666200903153823	32885757		248	17	3	244	Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of cardiovascular death in octogenarians. This group of patients represents nearly a fifth of all patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in real-world practice. Octogenarians have multiple risk factors for CAD and often greater myocardial ischemia than younger counterparts, with a potential of an increased benefit from myocardial revascularization. Despite this, octogenarians are routinely under- -treated and belittled in clinical trials. Age does make a difference to PCI outcomes in older people, but it is never the sole arbiter of any clinical decision, whether in relation to the heart or any other aspect of health. The decision when to perform revascularization in elderly patients and especially in octogenarians is complex and should consider the patient on an individual basis, with clarification of the goals of the therapy and the relative risks and benefits of performing the procedure. In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI), there is no upper age limit regarding urgent reperfusion and primary PCI must be the standard of care. In non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes, a strict conservative strategy must be avoided; whereas the use of a routine invasive strategy may reduce the occurrence of MI and the need for revascularization at follow-up, with no established benefit in terms of mortality. In stable CAD patients, invasive therapy on top of optimal medical therapy seems better in symptom relief and quality of life. This review summarizes the available data on percutaneous revascularization in the elderly patients and particularly in octogenarians, including practical considerations on PCI risk secondary to ageing physiology. We also analyse technical difficulties met when considering PCI in this cohort and the ongoing need for further studies to ameliorate risk stratification and eventually outcomes in these challenging patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		248	Current Cardiology Reviews		248	kassimis,george	Kassimis	George
215	Multifaceted Antibiotic Stewardship Intervention Using A Participatory-Action-Research Approach To Improve Antibiotic Prescribing For Urinary Tract Infections In Frail Elderly (Impresu): Study Protocol For A European Qualitative Study Followed By A Pragmatic Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial.	2021	249	10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052552	34620666		21	11	10	e052552	INTRODUCTION: Almost 60% of antibiotics in frail elderly are prescribed for alleged urinary tract infections (UTIs). A substantial part of this comprises prescriptions in case of non-specific symptoms or asymptomatic bacteriuria, for which the latest guidelines promote restrictiveness with antibiotics. We aim to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through an antibiotic stewardship intervention (ASI) that encourages to prescribe according to these guidelines. To develop an effective ASI, we first need a better understanding of the complex decision-making process concerning suspected UTIs in frail elderly. Moreover, the implementation approach requires tailoring to the heterogeneous elderly care setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: First, we conduct a qualitative study to explore factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for UTIs in frail elderly, using semi-structured interviews with general practitioners, nursing staff, patients and informal caregivers. Next, we perform a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in elderly care organisations. A multifaceted ASI is implemented in the intervention group; the control group receives care as usual. The ASI is centred around a decision tool that promotes restrictive antibiotic use, supported by a toolbox with educational materials. For the implementation, we use a modified participatory-action-research approach, guided by the results of the qualitative study. The primary outcome is the number of antibiotic prescriptions for suspected UTIs. We aim to recruit 34 clusters with in total 680 frail elderly residents ≥70 years. Data collection takes place during a 5-month baseline period and a 7-month follow-up period. Finally, we perform a process evaluation. The study has been delayed for 6 months due to COVID-19 and is expected to end in July 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approvals and/or waivers were obtained from the ethical committees in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The results will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

216	Various Aspects Of Caring For Elderly People In The Interest Of Their Self-Reliance And Independence, According To The Authors' Own Propositions.	2021	250	10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01570	33300504		250	34	3	339	Predictions for the upcoming decades suggest an increase in the number of elderly people in Europe; due to low fertility and the rise in average life expectancy, societies age considerably faster. The nature of these changes signifies that a complex demographic process is taking place. In consequence, one can notice an increase in the demand for personal and nursing care activities provided in the natural human environment, or in various institutions, by adequately prepared, specialized medical staff. Creating the best possible procedures for assisting elderly people is a multifaceted and dynamic problem. The constantly changing expectations regarding healthcare providers, and the higher social and health awareness are challenging medical sciences and social services to provide the oldest generation with the best quality of life. The life satisfaction measure for elderly people is their activity which determines an independent, self-reliant, satisfactory, and long life.

217	The Prevalence And Prognostic Value Of Frailty Screening Measures In Patients Undergoing Surgery For Colorectal Cancer: Observations From A Systematic Review.	2022	252	10.1186/s12877-022-02928-5	35351011		23	22	1	260	INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a complex multifactorial syndrome characterised by a significant increase in vulnerability and worsened health outcomes. Despite a range of proposed frailty screening measures, the prevalence and prognostic value of frailty in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer is not clear. AIM: The aim of this present review was to examine the use of commonly employed frailty screening measures in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Medline was carried out to identify studies reporting the use of frailty screening tools or measures in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. The screening measure used and prevalence of frailty within the population were recorded. Outcomes of interest were the incidence of post-operative complications, 30-day mortality and overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 15 studies included (n = 97, 898 patients), 9 studies were retrospective and included patients aged 70 years or older (n = 96, 120 patients). 5 of 12 studies reported that frailty was independently associated with the incidence of post-operative complications. There was also evidence that frailty was independently associated with 30-day mortality (1 of 4 studies, n = 9, 252 patients) and long-term survival (2 of 3 studies, n = 1, 420 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was common in patients with colorectal cancer and the assessment of frailty may have prognostic value in patients undergoing surgery. However, the basis of the relationship between frailty and post-operative outcomes is not clear and merits further study.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		252	mcgovern,josh	McGovern	Josh

METHODS: This study is a two-arm, stratified-randomized controlled feasibility trail. Twenty-four nursing home residents (aged 83.7 ± 6.4, 21 women) were divided into an intervention and a waiting-list control group. The intervention group completed a multi-component training (including dual-task, dynamic balance, endurance and strength exercises) for 16 weeks (twice per week for 45-60 min). Primary outcomes were lower extremity functionality (SPPB), gait performance (GAITRite), health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as life satisfaction (SWLS). RESULTS: Life satisfaction (SWLS) and physical functioning (SPPB) increased in the intervention group after training whereas the control group showed a decrease. Gait parameters could only be analyzed for n = 5 participants of the intervention group and n = 2 of the control group and showed no time differences for the intervention group. The mean number of participants was 12.5 ± 1.9 per session (attendance ranged between 66% and 90%). CONCLUSION: A multi-component training seems (1) to lead to clinically relevant improvements in physical functioning as well as in psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to be feasible and well accepted in nursing home residents. Nevertheless, the complexity and progression of the program as well as the testing protocol have to be adapted. Further research should test the effectiveness of this adapted program in a larger sample size.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		154	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		253	bischoff,laura.l	Bischoff	Laura L
219	Effect Of An Osteoporotic Fracture Prevention Program On Fracture Incidence In Routine Care: A Cluster-Randomized Trial.	2022	254	10.1186/s12916-021-02226-8	35114993		254	20	1	49	"BACKGROUND: Fractures are a major health problem in aging societies. Preventive approaches combining bone health and fall prevention are rare. The osteoporotic fracture prevention program in rural areas (OFRA) is a health care fund-driven program for older people in randomly selected districts in Germany. The components of the program were falls prevention exercise classes, examination of bone health by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and a consultation about ""safety in the living environment."" The aim of this study was to evaluate this complex preventive intervention in a routine health care setting. METHODS: This cluster-randomized trial was performed from October 2015 to October 2018 and took place in 186 administrative districts in five federal states, 47 districts served as intervention districts, and 139, as controls. Within these districts, we included (a) all community-living women and men aged 70-85 years with prior fragility fractures and (b) all community-living women aged 75-80 years. The analysis used routine data collected by a health insurance company. The primary endpoint was all fragility fractures combined. Fracture types, mortality, and nursing home admission were explorative endpoints. Cox frailty models were used for comparative analyses with a median follow-up time of 365 days (interquartile range: 0 days). RESULTS: Nine thousand four hundred eight individuals were approached to participate in one of the program components, 27,318 individuals served as controls. The mean age was 78.7 years. Of those approached to participate, nearly 30% joined the exercise classes. DXA measurement was reimbursed for 13.6%, and 51.8% received advice about measures to increase ""safety in the living environment."" The incidence of fragility fractures did not differ between the intervention and the control group (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80-1.11). However, femoral fractures, the most frequent fracture type, were reduced in the intervention group (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.99). Mortality and nursing home admission did not differ between the intervention and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive fracture prevention program for older people living in rural areas was implemented. The program did not affect the primary endpoint of all fragility fractures combined. It has to be considered that we used a modified intention to treat approach based on geographic randomization and information about endpoints relied exclusively on routine data of the health care insurance.

220	'Fitting In The Pharmacist' - A Qualitative Analysis Of The Perceived Relationship Between Community Pharmacists And Older Adults With Complex Care Needs.	2021	255	10.1093/ijpp/riab034	34244751		255	29	5	428	OBJECTIVES: To explore the current perceived relationship between older adults with varying levels of frailty and healthcare needs and community pharmacists. METHODS: This qualitative study conducted a thematic analysis of focus groups with older adults and older adult caregivers and community pharmacist participants. Participants were recruited following a maximum variation sampling technique. Verbatim transcripts were inductively coded using NVivo to develop key findings. KEY FINDINGS: Four major themes emerged: (i) Pharmacy Landscape, (ii) Prescription and Non-Prescription Drug Safety, (iii) Patient-Pharmacist Relationship and (iv) Recommendations for Pharmacy Practice. Themes demonstrate three key findings: (1) older adults approach drug information with a key focus on safety and cost of both prescription and non-prescription drugs, (2) there is a demonstrated opportunity, recognized by older adults and practitioners, for community pharmacists to expand their role in the care of older adults, (3) community pharmacists are able, interested and/or have already incorporated frailty assessments into their practice to better support their care of the older adult population with varying levels of frailty. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a reason for the community pharmacist role to shift. The unique knowledge and skills of community pharmacists, coupled with their accessibility and strong patient-clinician relationship, have the potential to better support older adults with varying levels of frailty.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		255	The International Journal Of Pharmacy Practice		255	davenport huyer,larkin	Davenport Huyer	Larkin

222	Transitions Between Degrees Of Multidimensional Frailty Among Older People Admitted To Intermediate Care: A Multicentre Prospective Study.	2022	257	10.1186/s12877-022-03378-9	36050635		23	22	1	722	BACKGROUND: Frailty is a dynamic condition that is clinically expected to change in older individuals during and around admission to an intermediate care (IC) facility. We aimed to characterize transitions between degrees of frailty before, during, and after admission to IC and assess the impact of these transitions on health outcomes. METHODS: Multicentre observational prospective study in IC facilities in Catalonia (North-east Spain). The analysis included all individuals aged ≥ 75 years (or younger with chronic complex or advanced diseases) admitted to an IC facility. The primary outcome was frailty, measured by the Frail-VIG index and categorized into four degrees: no frailty, and mild, moderate, and advanced frailty. The Frail-VIG index was measured at baseline (i.e., 30 days before IC admission) (Frail-VIG(0)), on IC admission (Frail-VIG(1)), at discharge (Frail-VIG(2)), and 30 days post-discharge (Frail-VIG(3)). RESULTS: The study included 483 patients with a mean (SD) age of 81.3 (10.2) years. At the time of admission, 27 (5.6%) had no frailty, and 116 (24%), 161 (33.3%), and 179 (37.1%) mild, moderate, and severe frailty, respectively. Most frailty transitions occurred within the 30 days following admission to IC, particularly among patients with moderate frailty on admission. Most patients maintained their frailty status after discharge. Overall, 135 (28%) patients died during IC stay. Frailty, measured either at baseline or admission, was significantly associated with mortality, although it showed a stronger contribution when measured on admission (HR 1.16; 95%CI 1.10-1.22; p < 0.001) compared to baseline (HR 1.10; 1.05-1.15; p < 0.001). When including frailty measurements at the two time points (i.e., baseline and IC admission) in a multivariate model, frailty measured on IC admission but not at baseline significantly contributed to explaining mortality during IC stay. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty status varied before and during admission to IC. Of the serial frailty measures we collected, frailty on IC admission was the strongest predictor of mortality. Results from this observational study suggest that routine frailty measurement on IC admission could aid clinical management decisions.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		257	amblàs-novellas,jordi	Amblàs-Novellas	Jordi
223	The Cardiac Care Bridge Randomized Trial In High-Risk Older Cardiac Patients: A Mixed-Methods Process Evaluation.	2021	258	10.1111/jan.14786	33594695		32	77	5	2498	AIM: To evaluate healthcare professionals' performance and treatment fidelity in the Cardiac Care Bridge (CCB) nurse-coordinated transitional care intervention in older cardiac patients to understand and interpret the study results. DESIGN: A mixed-methods process evaluation based on the Medical Research Council Process Evaluation framework. METHODS: Quantitative data on intervention key elements were collected from 153 logbooks of all intervention patients. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 CCB professionals (cardiac nurses, community nurses and primary care physical therapists), from June 2017 until October 2018. Qualitative data-analysis is based on thematic analysis and integrated with quantitative key element outcomes. The analysis was blinded to trial outcomes. Fidelity was defined as the level of intervention adherence. RESULTS: The overall intervention fidelity was 67%, ranging from severely low fidelity in the consultation of in-hospital geriatric teams (17%) to maximum fidelity in the comprehensive geriatric assessment (100%). Main themes of influence in the intervention performance that emerged from the interviews are interdisciplinary collaboration, organizational preconditions, confidence in the programme, time management and patient characteristics. In addition to practical issues, the patient's frailty status and limited motivation were barriers to the intervention. CONCLUSION: Although involved healthcare professionals expressed their confidence in the intervention, the fidelity rate was suboptimal. This could have influenced the non-significant effect of the CCB intervention on the primary composite outcome of readmission and mortality 6 months after randomization. Feasibility of intervention key elements should be reconsidered in relation to experienced barriers and the population. IMPACT: In addition to insight in effectiveness, insight in intervention fidelity and performance is necessary to understand the mechanism of impact. This study demonstrates that the suboptimal fidelity was subject to a complex interplay of organizational, professionals' and patients' issues. The results support intervention redesign and inform future development of transitional care interventions in older cardiac patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		32	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	258	verweij,lotte	Verweij	Lotte
224	Care Of Seniors With Breast Cancer - Treatment Received And Refining Decision Making.	2022	259	10.1016/j.clon.2022.01.006	35123852		259	34	7	472	AIMS: Treatment decisions for older patients with breast cancer are complex and evidence is largely extrapolated from younger populations. Frailty and comorbidity need to be considered. We studied the baseline characteristics and treatment decisions in older patients in Christchurch with breast cancer and assessed survival outcomes and prognostic/discriminatory performance of several tools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the Canterbury Breast Cancer Registry and identified patients aged 70 years or older at diagnosis with invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer between 1 June 2009 and 30 June 2015. We retrieved demographics, treatment and outcome information. Overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival were estimated. Tools analysing performance status and comorbidity were assessed for their prognostic and discriminatory power. RESULTS: In total, 440 patients were identified. Primary surgery was carried out for 362 patients (82.3%): breast-conserving surgery in 114 (of whom 88.6% received radiation therapy); mastectomy in 248 (of whom 24.6% received radiation). Hormone therapy was given for 265 (71.1%) patients with oestrogen receptor-positive cancers. Two hundred and seventy-four (62.3%) patients received full standard treatment, which was associated with significantly improved 5-year survival and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival. The median estimated overall survival was 8.2 years (95% confidence interval 7.3-9.1 years). Of those who died, 71.3% of deaths were due to causes other than breast cancer or unknown causes. The comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy (CALE) showed partial prognostic accuracy. CALE, Charlson and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group tools all showed discriminatory value. CONCLUSION: In this population-based series of older patients with breast cancer, showing high levels of primary and adjuvant treatment, patients were more likely to die of causes other than breast cancer. Performance status and comorbidity tools showed prognostic and discriminatory potential in this population supporting their use in treatment decision making. CALE showed the most potential to improve treatment decisions but requires validation in this population to improve prognostic accuracy.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		259	Clinical Oncology (Royal College Of Radiologists (Great Britain))		259	allen,t	Allen	T
225	Antithrombotic Therapy In Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The Complexity Of The Elderly.	2021	260	10.1093/eurjpc/zwaa053	33624104		260	28	1	87	Along with epidemiologic transitions of the global population, the burden of aortic stenosis (AS) is rapidly increasing and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has quickly spread; indeed, it is nowadays also employed in treating patients with AS at intermediate operative risk. Nonetheless, the less invasive interventional strategy still carries relevant issues concerning post-procedural optimal antithrombotic strategy, given the current indications provided by guidelines are not completely supported by evidence-based data. Geriatric patients suffer from high bleeding and thromboembolic risks, whose balance is particularly subtle due to the presence of concomitant conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease, that make the post-TAVR antithrombotic management particularly insidious. This scenario is further complicated by the lack of specific evidence regarding the 'real-life' complex conditions typical of the geriatric syndromes, thus, the management of such a heterogeneous population, ranging from healthy ageing to frailty, is far from being defined. The aim of the present review is to summarize the critical points and the most updated evidence regarding the post-TAVR antithrombotic approach in the geriatric population, with a specific focus on the most frequent clinical settings.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		260	European Journal Of Preventive Cardiology		260	bencivenga,leonardo	Bencivenga	Leonardo
226	Modified Frailty Index Predicts Postoperative Complications In Women With Gynecologic Cancer Undergoing Cytoreductive Surgery And Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.	2021	262	10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.05.013	34083027		96	162	2	368	OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the impact of frailty on postoperative complications following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in women with advanced or recurrent gynecologic cancer. METHODS: An IRB-approved single-institution prospective registry was queried for women who underwent CRS with HIPEC for advanced or recurrent gynecologic cancer from 1/1/2014-12/31/2020. Frailty was defined as a modified Frailty Index (mFI) score of ≥2. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of mFI upon the rate of moderate or higher (≥ grade 2) Accordion postoperative complications. RESULTS: Of 141 women, 81.6% (n = 115) were non-frail with mFI of 0-1 and 18.4% (n = 26) were frail with mFI ≥2. The incidence of ≥ grade 2 complications was 21.2% (n = 14) for mFI = 0, 26.5% (n = 13) for mFI = 1, 64.7% (n = 11) for mFI = 2 and 100.0% (n = 9) for patients with mFI ≥3. The incidence of re-operation (1.7% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.044), ICU admission (13.2% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.018), acute kidney injury (6.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.001), and respiratory failure (0.9% vs. 19.2%, p < 0.001) were significantly lower amongst non-frail vs. frail women. On multivariable analysis, mFI ≥2 was associated with significantly increased ≥ grade 2 complications versus mFI of 0-1 (OR 9.4, 95% CI 3.3, 26.4, p < 0.001). Age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 1.09, p = 0.07), surgical indication (recurrent vs. primary) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.30, 1.7, p = 0.44) and Surgical Complexity Score of Intermediate or High vs. Low (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.67, 3.5, p = 0.31) were not associated with ≥grade 2 complications. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, defined by the modified frailty index, is predictive of ≥grade 2 postoperative complications following CRS with HIPEC in women with gynecologic cancer. Frailty screening before CRS with HIPEC may assist patient selection and improve postoperative outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		96	Gynecologic Oncology		262	chambers,laura.m	Chambers	Laura M
227	Determinants Of Discharge Disposition From Acute Care For Survivors Of Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury: Results From A Large Population-Based Cohort Data Set.	2021	264	10.1016/j.apmr.2021.01.083	33609499		264	102	8	1514	OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of discharge disposition from acute care among survivors of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI), stratified by sex. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study using provincial data in Ontario, Canada. The determinants were grouped into predisposing, need, and enabling factors using the Anderson Behavioral Model. SETTING: Acute care. PARTICIPANTS: Survivors of HIBI aged ≥20 years at the time of hospitalization and discharged alive from acute care between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2017. There were 7492 patients with HIBI, of whom 28% (N=2077) survived their acute care episode. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discharge disposition from acute care, categorized as complex continuing care (CCC), long-term care (LTC), inpatient rehabilitation (IR), home with support, home without support, and transferred to another acute care. RESULTS: The discharge dispositions for the 2077 survivors were IR 23.4% (n=487), CCC 19.5% (n=404), LTC 6.2% (n=128), home without support 31.2% (n=647), home with support 15.1% (n=314), and other 4.6%. Multinomial multivariable logistic regression analysis using home without support as the reference category revealed that female patients were significantly more likely than male patients to be discharged to LTC/CCC. Those who were older, were frail, and had longer stay in acute care or special care unit (SCU) were more likely to be discharged to LTC/CCC. The only significant determinant for IR was longer stay in acute care. Survivors with cardiac-related injury were less likely to be discharged to LTC/CCC. Income was a significant factor for male patients but not for female patients in the sex-stratified analysis. The following variables were investigated but were not significant determinants in this study: need factors (comorbidity score, prior psychiatric disorders, health care utilization) and enabling factors (income quintile, rural area of residence). CONCLUSIONS: Predisposing (age, sex) and need factors (frailty, acute care days, SCU days, type of injury) were significant determinants of discharge disposition from acute care after HIBI. In spite of a system with universal coverage, sex differences were found, with more female patients being discharged to CCC/LTC rather than IR, controlling for age and other confounders. These findings should be considered in appropriate discharge planning from acute care for survivors of HIBI.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		264	Archives Of Physical Medicine And Rehabilitation		264	jacob,binu	Jacob	Binu
228	Hdr Brachytherapy With Individual Epithetic Molds For Facial Skin Cancer: Techniques And First Clinical Experience.	2021	265	10.1111/ijd.15492	33638418		265	60	6	717	BACKGROUND: Facial skin cancer lesions in close proximity to critical organs require further development of radiotherapeutic techniques for highly conformal treatment, especially when treating elderly frail patients. We report on our treatment technique and first clinical experience for patients with perinasal/periorbital skin cancer treated with individualized epithetic mold high-dose-rate brachytherapy (BRT). METHODS: From January 2019, patients with complex shaped or unfavorably located skin cancer not eligible for surgery or external beam radiotherapy (RT) were screened for mold-based BRT. Six patients were identified. Toxicity and clinical response were documented during therapy and posttreatment follow-up. RESULTS: Median patient age was 80 years (74-92 years). Median prescription dose was 42 Gy (range, 33-44 Gy) delivered in once-daily fractions of 3 or 4 Gy. Two patients had treatment interruptions caused by acute conjunctivitis grade 2 and a nontreatment-related cardiac event, respectively. At a median follow-up of 335 days (96-628 days), no ≥ grade 2 late toxicity was documented with all patients showing complete clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose-rate BRT with individualized epithetic molds for perinasal/periorbital skin cancer is a well-tolerated and safe treatment option for patients not eligible for primary surgery or definitive external beam RT because of comorbidities or tumor location.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		265	International Journal Of Dermatology		265	diefenhardt,markus	Diefenhardt	Markus
229	The Grief And Bereavement Experiences Of Informal Caregivers: A Scoping Review Of The North American Literature.	2022	266	10.1177/08258597211052269	34860618		266	37	2	242	Background: Informal caregivers are a significant part of the hospice and palliative care landscape as members of the interdisciplinary care team. Despite this, little is known about the impact this responsibility has on informal caregivers' experiences of grief and bereavement. Objective: To address this, a scoping review of the literature was conducted to explore the current state of knowledge toward grief and bereavement of informal caregivers of adult/geriatric patients in the hospice and palliative/end-of-life care realm within North America. Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-step framework, key electronic health care and social sciences databases (eg, CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO) alongside gray literature sources were searched and screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thematic content analysis was used to identify key themes. Results: 29 articles met the final inclusion criteria with 3 central themes emerging: (1) mediators of grief, (2) grief experiences, and (3) types of grief. Discussion: Informal caregivers encounter unique grief and bereavement experiences: The range of psychosocial outcomes, both negative and positive, can be affected by various mediators such as caregiver burden, demographics, disease type of the patient being cared for, etc. Bereavement interventions must be designed with the mediators of grief in mind. Conclusions: Understanding the nuances of informal caregivers' experiences with grief and bereavement will inform and advance practice, policy, and research. Practitioners/clinicians should be further educated on how to properly acknowledge the complexity of grief and bereavement for informal caregivers, specifically paying attention to mediators. Further research needs to consider the role of culture.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		266	Journal Of Palliative Care		266	skantharajah,neerjah	Skantharajah	Neerjah
230	Outcome Analysis Using The Modified Frailty Index-5 In Patients With Complex Aortoiliac Disease.	2022	267	10.1016/j.avsg.2021.06.049	34644633		213	79		153	OBJECTIVES: Vascular surgery patients commonly have several comorbidities that cumulatively lead to a frailty status. The cumulative comorbidities disproportionately increase the risk of adverse events and are also associated with worsened long-term prognosis. In recent years, several tools have been elaborated with the objective of quantifying a patient's frailty. One of them is the modified frailty index-5 (mFI-5), a simplified and easy to use index. There is scarce data regarding its value as a prognostic factor in aortoiliac occlusive disease. The aim of this work is to validate mFI-5 as a potential postoperative prognostic indicator in this population. METHODS: From January 2013 to January 2020, 109 patients who underwent elective revascularizations, either endovascular or open surgery, having Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II type D aortoiliac lesions in a tertiary and a regional hospital were selected from a prospective vascular registry. Demographic data was collected including diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension requiring medication and functional status. The 30-d and subsequent long-term surveillance outcomes were also collected including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE) and all-cause mortality were assessed in the 30-d post-procedure and in the subsequent long-term surveillance period. The mFI-5 was applied to this population to evaluate the prognostic impact of this frailty marker on mortality and morbidity. RESULTS: In the long-term follow-up, mFI-5 was significantly associated with MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 2.469; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.267-4.811; P = .008) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.585; 95% CI: 1.270-5.260; P = .009). However, there was no significant association with 30-day outcomes. Along with the presence of chronic kidney disease, mFI-5 was the prognostic factor better able of predicting MACE. No prognostic value was found regarding short-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: The mFI-5 index may have a role in predicting long term outcomes, namely MACE and all-cause mortality, in the subset of patients with extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease. Its ease of use can foster its application in risk stratification and contribute for the decision-making process.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		213	Annals Of Vascular Surgery		267	nóbrega,leandro	Nóbrega	Leandro
231	Older Patients' Perspectives On Factors Contributing To Frequent Visits To The Emergency Department: A Qualitative Interview Study.	2021	268	10.1186/s12889-021-11755-z	34544405		268	21	1	1709	BACKGROUND: Older patients are at high risk of unplanned revisits to the emergency department (ED) because of their medical complexity. To reduce the number of ED visits, we need more knowledge about the patient-level, environmental, and healthcare factors involved. The aim of this study was to describe older patients' perspectives and experiences before and after an ED visit, and to identify factors that possibly contribute to frequent ED revisits. METHODS: This was a qualitative description study. We performed semi-structured individual interviews with older patients who frequently visited the ED and were discharged home after an acute visit. Patients were enrolled in the ED of a university medical centre using purposive sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded independently by two researchers. Theoretical analysis was used to identify recurring patterns and themes in the data. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS: In-depth interviews were completed with 13 older patients. Three main themes emerged: 1) medical events leading to feelings of crisis, 2) patients' untreated health problems, and 3) persistent problems in health and daily functioning post discharge. Participants identified problems before and after their ED visit that possibly contributed to further ED visits. These problems included increasing symptoms leading to feelings of crisis, the relationship with the general practitioner, incomplete discharge information at the ED, and inadequate follow-up and lack of recovery after an ED visit. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study identified multiple factors that may contribute to frequent ED visits among older patients. Older patients in need of acute care might benefit from hospital-at-home interventions, or acute care provided by geriatric emergency teams in the primary care setting. Identifying frailty in the ED is needed to improve discharge communication and adequate follow-up is needed to improve recovery after an acute ED visit.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		268	Bmc Public Health		268	kolk,daisy	Kolk	Daisy
232	Effectiveness Of A Complex Intervention Of Group-Based Nutrition And Physical Activity To Prevent Frailty In Pre-Frail Older Adults (Super): A Randomised Controlled Trial.	2022	269	10.1016/S2666-7568(22)00124-6	36102762		179	3	8	e519	BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of frailty with age is becoming a public health priority in countries with ageing populations. Pre-frailty presents a window of opportunity to prevent the development of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a complex intervention that combined a nutrition-based intervention and a physical activity intervention, along with the effectiveness of each intervention individually, to reduce physical frailty in pre-frail older adults over 2 years. METHODS: In this single-blind, 2 x 2 factorial, randomised, controlled trial, we recruited pre-frail community-dwelling older adults in Aotearoa New Zealand via mail through general medical practices. To be eligible, participants had to be pre-frail according to self-reported FRAIL scores of 1 or 2, aged 75 years or older (or 60 years or older for Māori and Pacific Peoples), not terminally ill or with advanced dementia as judged by a general practitioner, able to stand, medically safe to participate in low-intensity exercise, and able to use kitchen utensils safely. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an 8-week Senior Chef programme (SC group), a 10-week Steady As You Go programme (SAYGO group), a 10-week combined SC and SAYGO intervention (combined group), or a 10-week social programme (control group), using computer-generated block randomisation administered through an electronic data capture system by local study coordinators. Assessors were masked to group allocation for all assessments. SC is a group-based nutrition education and cooking class programme (3 h weekly), SAYGO is a group-based strength and balance exercise programme (1 h weekly), and the social control programme was a seated, group socialising activity (once a week). Masked assessors ascertained Fried frailty scores at baseline, end of intervention, and at 6, 12, and 24 months after the programme. The primary outcome was change in Fried frailty score at 2 years. Intention-to-treat analyses were completed for all randomised participants, and all participants who had a high (≥75%) adherence were analysed per protocol. This study is registered at ANZCTR, ACTRN12614000827639. FINDINGS: Between May 12, 2016 and April 9, 2018, we assessed 2678 older adults for eligibility, of whom 468 (17%) consented and completed baseline assessment, with a mean age of 80·3 years (SD 5·1) and a mean Fried score of 1·9 (1·2); 59% were women. We randomly allocated these participants into the four groups: 117 in the SC group, 118 in the SAYGO group, 118 in the combined group, and 115 in the control group; 318 participants attended the 24-month follow-up: 89 in the SC group, 78 in the SAYGO group, 73 in the combined group, and 78 in the control group. At the 24-month follow-up, there were no differences in mean Fried scores between the intervention groups and the control group. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: The study did not find that the combined SC and SAYGO programme was effective in reducing frailty in pre-frail older adults. Although some short-term benefits were observed in each individual programme, there was no clear evidence of long-term impact. Further research is needed to evaluate combinations of group-based programmes for community-dwelling older adults to optimise their physical function.

233	Development Of A Palliative Telehealth Pilot To Meet The Needs Of The Nursing Home Population.	2021	270	10.1097/NJH.0000000000000784	34225341		270	23	5	478	Many older adults will spend their final days in a skilled nursing facility because of multiple complex conditions. Patients with unclear goals of care are at higher risk of rehospitalization and burdensome care at end of life. Palliative care has been shown to improve outcomes for this patient population; however, access is limited because of the small number of boarded specialists nationwide. Telehealth offers the ability to expand the reach of palliative care to both underserved geographies and community settings. This quality improvement pilot project details the development and implementation of a telehealth palliative care program available to nursing home residents. Eight nursing homes, in the New England region of the United States, participated in the 4-month pilot. The palliative telehealth program offered real-time access to a palliative care specialist able to provide symptom management, goals-of-care discussions, and Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment completion. The pilot shows promising outcomes including code status change, Medical Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment form completion, and reduced hospitalizations supporting the benefit of comprehensive goals-of-care discussions for frail older adults living in a nursing home. As health care moves into the digital age, telemedicine plays a large role in the delivery of essential patient care. Provision of palliative specialists by telehealth allows the opportunity to address the unmet needs of this frail population.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		270	Journal Of Hospice And Palliative Nursing: Jhpn: The Official Journal Of The Hospice And Palliative Nurses Association	1	270	baxter,kelly.e	Baxter	Kelly E
234	Association Between 9P21-23 Locus And Frailty In A Community-Dwelling Greek Population: Results From The Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation Of Ageing And Diet.	2022	271	10.14283/jpad.2022.2	35098976		80	9	1	77	BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome arising from a combination of genetic and environmental factors and is associated with adverse health outcomes and mortality. A recent study reported an association between variants of the 9p21-23 locus, associated with a number of age-related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frailty. Frailty has been associated with increased risk of developing AD and it has been proposed that frailty burden may modify AD clinical presentation. In view of the overlapping genetic architecture between the two disorders, it is noteworthy to conduct studies to uncover risk variants that contribute to both AD and frailty. The purpose of this study is to test the reproducibility of the association of 9p21-23 locus with frailty in a population that is ethnically different from previous work and in the context of multidimensional definitions of frailty that will allow us to examine the potential impact to domains pertaining to AD pathology. METHODS: We operationalized frailty according two definitions and the corresponding instruments, the Frailty Index (FI) and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) and we determined genotypes of eight alleles previously identified as risk increasing for frailty in 1172 community-dwelling older participants (57% females) from the HELIAD study with a mean age of 74 years old. We cross-sectionally investigated the association between risk alleles and frailty, as well as with specific components of each definition using linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and years of education. RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, carriers of rs7038172 C risk allele, were associated with a higher FI Score (β=0.089, p=0.002). Similarly, we found a positive association between the presence of at least one rs7038172 C variant and TFI score (β=0.053, p=0.04). Moreover, the rs7038172 variant was associated, irrespectively of dementia status, with the memory and psychological domain of FI and TFI, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the association of the rs7038172 C allele with the frailty syndrome in a Greek population and in the context of multidimensional definitions of frailty. Furthermore, we report novel associations between this allele and the memory domain of FI and the psychological domain of TFI, that includes memory problems on its components. Given that frailty burden has been shown to modify the AD clinical presentation, it is likely that rs7038172 C allele may accelerate the transition of AD or frailty to dementia Overall, our study corroborates the role of the 9p21-23 region in frailty development and draw potential links with AD pathology.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		80	The Journal Of Prevention Of Alzheimer'S Disease		271	mourtzi,n	Mourtzi	N
235	Metabolomic Profile Of Different Dietary Patterns And Their Association With Frailty Index In Community-Dwelling Older Men And Women.	2022	272	10.3390/nu14112237	35684039		73	14	11	None	Diet quality has been associated with slower rates of aging; however, the mechanisms underlying the role of a healthy diet in aging are not fully understood. To address this question, we aimed to identify plasma metabolomic biomarkers of dietary patterns and explored whether these metabolites mediate the relationship between diet and healthy aging, as assessed by the frailty index (FI) in 806 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Adherence to different dietary patterns was evaluated using the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) score, and Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI). Associations between diet, FI, and metabolites were assessed using linear regression models. Higher adherence to these dietary patterns was associated with lower FI. We found 236, 218, and 278 metabolites associated with the MDS, MIND, and AHEI, respectively, with 127 common metabolites, which included lipids, tri/di-glycerides, lyso/phosphatidylcholine, amino acids, bile acids, ceramides, cholesterol esters, fatty acids and acylcarnitines, indoles, and sphingomyelins. Metabolomic signatures of diet explained 28%, 37%, and 38% of the variance of the MDS, MIND, and AHEI, respectively. Signatures of MIND and AHEI mediated 55% and 61% of the association between each dietary pattern with FI, while the mediating effect of MDS signature was not statistically significant. The high number of metabolites associated with the different dietary patterns supports the notion of common mechanisms that underly the relationship between diet and frailty. The identification of multiple metabolite classes suggests that the effect of diet is complex and not mediated by any specific biomarkers. Furthermore, these metabolites may serve as biomarkers for poor diet quality to identify individuals for targeted dietary interventions.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		73	Nutrients		272	tanaka,toshiko	Tanaka	Toshiko
236	Frailty As A Predictor Of Mortality In Covid-19 Patients Receiving Cpap For Respiratory Insufficiency.	2022	274	10.1007/s40520-021-02070-z	35298829		154	34	4	945	OBJECTIVE: Exploring the association between frailty and mortality in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 respiratory insufficiency treated with continuous positive airway pressure. METHODS: Frailty was measured using a Frailty Index (FI) created by using the baseline assessment data on comorbidities and body mass index and baseline blood test results (including pH, lactate dehydrogenase, renal and liver function, inflammatory indexes and anemia). FI > 0.25 identified frail individuals. RESULTS: Among the 159 included individuals (81% men, median age of 68) frailty was detected in 69% of the patients (median FI score 0.3 ± 0.08). Frailty was associated to an increased mortality (adjusted HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.02-3.88, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is highly prevalent among patients with COVID-19, predicts poorer outcomes independently of age. A personalization of care balancing the risk and benefit of treatments (especially the invasive ones) in such complex patients is pivotal.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		154	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		274	damanti,sarah	Damanti	Sarah
237	Perspectives Of Older Adults With A Chronic Condition On Functioning, Social Participation And Health: A Qualitative Study.	2021	275	10.1186/s12877-021-02365-w	34243713		23	21	1	418	BACKGROUND: Problems with mobility, functioning and social participation make living independently difficult for frail older adults. To continue living independently, therapy adherence is a prerequisite. The causes for non-adherence among older adults are multiple and complex, which is why insight into older adults' perspectives regarding their functioning is an essential factor to increase therapy adherence. This study investigates the perspectives of older adults on their functioning, social participation and health, and the factors influencing these elements. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study on the older adult's perceived functioning, social participation and health. Fourteen home-dwelling older adults suffering from chronic health issues were purposively selected. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with open-ended questions. Data were analysed following the Basic Logical Model of Abduction and Creswell's coding method. RESULTS: Assistive devices, the older adult's dwelling and living environment, professional and informal support, and medication are perceived as important determinants for retaining functioning and social participation. Attitude, social influence and personal effectiveness were found to influence whether a person performs or participates in an activity. A person's attitude is related to the significance the activity has to that person, the activity's importance, personal wellbeing, the person's values, and their desire for autonomy. Peers and children have a social influence on the level of activity of the older person. Traditions, in particular religious activities, along with personal effectiveness are motivating factors determining whether a person performs or participates in an activity. Personal effectiveness is linked to the person's belief in their personal competencies and to the relationship between effort and result. Finally, it appears that the type of coping strategy the older adult adopts, has an influence on their behavior. The participating older adults often used remarkable problem-focused strategies, which had a positive effect on their level of autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults have identified barriers and facilitators that influence their level of functioning and social participation. These findings help to create a framework for maintaining and increasing therapy adherence, which may be helpful in facilitating occupational therapists and other healthcare professionals to detect determinants of therapy adherence.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		275	de coninck,leen	De Coninck	Leen
238	Factors Associated With Improved Walking In Older People During Hospital Rehabilitation: Secondary Analysis Of A Randomized Controlled Trial.	2021	276	10.1186/s12877-021-02016-0	33517882		23	21	1	90	BACKGROUND: Older people are often admitted for rehabilitation to improve walking, yet not everyone improves. The aim of this study was to determine key factors associated with a positive response to hospital-based rehabilitation in older people. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis from a multisite randomized controlled trial. Older people (n= 198, median age 80.9 years, IQR 76.6- 87.2) who were admitted to geriatric rehabilitation wards with a goal to improve walking were recruited. Participants were randomized to receive additional daily physical therapy focused on mobility (n = 99), or additional social activities (n = 99). Self-selected gait speed was measured on admission and discharge. Four participants withdrew. People who changed gait speed ≥0.1 m/s were classified as 'responders' (n = 130); those that changed <0.1m/s were classified as 'non-responders' (n = 64). Multivariable logistic regression explored the association of six pre-selected participant factors (age, baseline ambulation status, frailty, co-morbidities, cognition, depression) and two therapy factors (daily supervised upright activity time, rehabilitation days) and response. RESULTS: Responding to rehabilitation was associated with the number of days in rehabilitation (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08; p = .039) and higher Mini Mental State Examination scores (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.14; p = .048). No other factors were found to have association with responding to rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: In older people with complex health problems or multi-morbidities, better cognition and a longer stay in rehabilitation were associated with a positive improvement in walking speed. Further research to explore who best responds to hospital-based rehabilitation and what interventions improve rehabilitation outcomes is warranted.

239	Impact Of Age, Comorbidity, And Treatment Characteristics On Survival In Older Women With Advanced High Grade Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.	2021	277	10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.03.008	33812698		96	161	3	693	OBJECTIVES: Older women have a worse prognosis with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and comorbidities likely contribute to poor outcomes. We sought to identify comorbid conditions and treatment-related factors in older women. METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified 351 patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS). 100/351 (28.5%) were ≥ 70 years old. Demographic and clinicopathologic information was collected. Crude progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios and adjustments for confounders. RESULTS: Study subjects ≥70 years old had significantly: higher Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) score (5.9 vs 4.3; p = 0.0001), less completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (24% vs 15.1%; p = 0.049), less intraperitoneal (IP) therapy (18.2% vs 35.5%; p = 0.002), less clinical trial participation (16% vs 26.3%; p = 0.040), decreased platinum sensitivity (60% vs 73.7%; p = 0.012) and lacked BRCA mutations (0% vs 12%; p = 0.0006). They were less likely to have optimal CRS (75% vs 86.9%; p = 0.007) with same surgical complexity (p = 0.89). Patients ≥70 had significantly worse PFS and OS. In a multivariate analysis, better OS was associated with younger age (<70 years old), any IP therapy, completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and platinum sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The older cohort had worse CIRS-G scores (5.9 vs 4.3; p = 0.0001), but no strong associations between comorbidities and treatment characteristics, but less optimal CRS rates (75% vs 86.9%; p = 0.007) with similar surgical complexity and less platinum sensitivity. Our results show comorbid conditions in older patients with advanced EOC may have less impact than tumor biology.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		96	Gynecologic Oncology		277	mallen,adrianne	Mallen	Adrianne
240	Cardiovascular Disease In The Elderly: Proceedings Of The European Society Of Cardiology-Cardiovascular Round Table.	2022	278	10.1093/eurjpc/zwac033	35167666		260	29	10	1412	The growing elderly population worldwide represents a major challenge for caregivers, healthcare providers, and society. Older patients have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease, high rates of CV risk factors, and multiple age-related comorbidities. Although prevention and management strategies have been shown to be effective in older people, they continue to be under-used, and under-studied. In addition to hard endpoints, frailty, cognitive impairments, and patients' re-assessment of important outcomes (e.g. quality of life vs. longevity) are important aspects for older patients and emphasize the need to include a substantial proportion of older patients in CV clinical trials. To complement the often skewed age distribution in clinical trials, greater emphasis should be placed on real-world studies to assess longer-term outcomes, especially safety and quality of life outcomes. In the complex environment of the older patient, a multidisciplinary care team approach with the involvement of the individual patient in the decision-making process can help optimize prevention and management strategies. This article aims to demonstrate the growing burden of ageing in real life and illustrates the need to continue primary prevention to address CV risk factors. It summarizes factors to consider when choosing pharmacological and interventional treatments for the elderly and the need to consider quality of life and patient priorities when making decisions.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		260	European Journal Of Preventive Cardiology		278	lettino,maddalena	Lettino	Maddalena
241	Short Communication: Opportunities And Challenges For Early Person-Centered Care For Older Patients In Emergency Settings.	2021	279	10.3390/ijerph182312526	34886252		15	18	23	None	The provision of person-centered care (PCC) for older adults in emergency settings is important. This short communication explores the complexity of providing comprehensive PCC for older adults in emergency settings, based on a synthesis of existing literature and empirical data from a small-scale case study on the potential of improving patient engagement in a Danish emergency department (ED). Our findings highlight overall positive attitudes towards PCC, as patient engagement is perceived as important and feasible during the waiting hours that older patients experience. However, the key challenges include barriers in organizational structures and cross-sectoral care coordination. We conclude that staff education, optimized care coordination across sectors, and increased involvement of geriatric nurses may enhance the provision of PCC for older, complex adults in EDs. We further conclude that future research into the feasibility and effects of structured approaches for providing PCC in EDs is needed, including exploration of organizational models for PCC.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		279	jensen,andrea.n	Jensen	Andrea N
242	Total Hip Replacement For Displaced Intracapsular Neck Of Femur Fracture. Are Current Guidelines Appropriate For All Patients? Five-Year Retrospective Analysis Of 315 Cases.	2021	280	10.1016/j.injury.2021.01.041	33612253		280	52	10	3011	BACKGROUND: According to the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD), in 2018 31.4% of patients with displaced intracapsular neck of femur (NOF) fracture who, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) viewed eligible for total hip replacement (THR), received this operation. We aimed to identify the compliance of performing THR for those patients in our unit and identify the reasons for proceeding with the alternative type of surgery. METHODS: A five-year retrospective review of eligible patients was conducted between January 2014 and Dec 2018. Statistical analysis was performed between groups who did or didn't receive THR. Reasons for not performing THR were identified from pre-operative ward rounds notes. RESULTS: In 2018 our unit performed THR for 44% of eligible cases. This was the highest result over five-years and higher than the national average. Out of the 348 eligible cases, pathological or undisplaced intracapsular fractures were excluded. Reminder received THR (138), hip hemiarthroplasty (166) or internal fixation (11). The average age was 77. Younger patients were more likely to receive THR than 80 years or older (p<0.05). THR group scored 0.4 points higher on AMTS and 0.2 lower on ASA scale then non-THR group (9.8 vs. 9.4 and 2.7 vs. 2.5 respectively). Mean time to surgery was 1.24 days with no significant difference between THR and non-THR group (1.6 vs. 1.1) but a slight delay to surgery during the weekends was noted (1.3 vs 1.8 days). Reasons for not performing THR were well documented as a combination of mobility restrictions and serious medical comorbidities. Retrospectively we judged the surgical decision making to be correct in 95% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Annual NHFD report comments on poor national and individual hospital's compliance with NICE guidelines without allowing surgeons to justify their choice of the procedure undertaken. Surgical decisions are made in a highly specialised multi-disciplinary environment taking into consideration individual patient's frailty and potential morbidity. Details of those discussions should be collected in NHFD to allow further analysis of reasons why surgeons decide not to offer THR to a patient NHFD views as eligible for this procedure. This could help in understanding the complex factors impacting on decision making in those cases.

243	Leveraging Survey And Claims Data To Identify High-Need Medicare Beneficiaries In The National Health And Aging Trends Study.	2022	281	10.1111/jgs.17517	34687550		110	70	2	522	BACKGROUND: Multiple algorithms have been developed to identify and characterize the high-need (HN) Medicare population. However, they vary in components and yield different populations, and were developed for varying purposes. We compared the performance of existing survey and claims-based definitions in identifying HN beneficiaries and predicting poor outcomes among a community-dwelling population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using Round 5 (2015) of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked with Medicare claims. We applied HN definitions from previous studies to our cohort of community-dwelling, fee-for-service beneficiaries (n = 4201) using sampling weights to obtain nationally representative estimates. The Bélanger et al. (2019) definition defines HN as individuals with complex conditions, multi-morbidity, acute and post-acute healthcare utilization, dependency in activities of daily living, and frailty. The Hayes et al. (2016) definition defines HN as individuals with 3+ chronic conditions and a functional limitation. We applied each definition to survey and claims data. Outcomes were hospitalization or mortality in the subsequent year. RESULTS: The proportion of NHATS respondents classified as HN varied greatly across definitions, ranging from 3.1% using the claims-based Hayes definition to 32.9% using the survey-based Bélanger definition. HN respondents had significantly higher mortality and hospitalization rates in 2016. Although all definitions had good specificity, none were able to predict outcomes in the following year with good accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: While mortality and hospitalization rates were significantly higher among respondents classified as HN, existing claims and survey-based HN definitions were not able to accurately predict future outcomes in a community-dwelling, nationally representative sample measured by the area under the curve.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		110	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		281	tucher,emma	Tucher	Emma
244	Mid-Term Outcome Of The Edge-To-Edge Mitral Valve Repair Via Aortic Outflow Tract In High-Risk Patients.	2022	282	10.1053/j.semtcvs.2021.05.001	34089830		282	34	2	512	The edge-to-edge mitral valve repair technique, invented by Alfieri and colleagues, introduced valve repair as a treatment option for patients with complex diseases where standard annuloplasty and related repair techniques are insufficient, due to annular calcification and patient frailty. We retrospectively evaluated the results of a transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (Alfieri stitch) in high-risk patients who were undergoing aortic valve replacement. From February, 2012 to December, 2017, 43 patients underwent transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with concomitant aortic valve replacement at a single institution. Preoperative and postoperative echocardiograms were compared. Home telephone follow up was conducted and postoperative morbidity was examined, including the need for reoperation, stroke and cardiac arrhythmia. 30-day and long-term survival rates were also determined. Mitral regurgitation (MR) was graded semi-quantitatively as 0 (trace and/or none), mild (1), moderate (2) or moderate to severe (3-4). The patients were 74 ± 7.8 years old. 65% of the patients were male. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 115 ± 37 minutes and mean cross-clamp time was 71 ± 23 minutes. There was a significant improvement in preoperative vs postoperative median MR grade (2 (IQR 2-3) vs 0 (IQR 0-1); P = 0.05). Follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms in 29 patients obtained at a median of 9 months' (range 3 - 19 months') and in 16 patients at a median of 34 months' postoperatively (range 21 - 53 months') showed mild (1 (IQR 1-2)) grade of mitral regurgitation. 30-day survival was 98%. Long term survival at 12 and 24 months' were 88% and 81% respectively. Mitral valve reoperation was conducted in 1 patient (2%), who was suffering of endocarditis. Stroke occurred in 2 patients (7%). Cardiac arrhythmia was observed in 15 patients (35%). 8 patients (19%) suffered from atrial fibrillation and 7 patients (16%) displayed atrioventricular blockage. 10 patients (23%) could be treated conservatively and 5 patients (12%) needed implantation of a pacemaker. Transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair can be safely performed during aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients and improves even long-term MR grade. Postoperative cardiac arrhythmia occurs frequently. 66% of them could be treated successfully by conservative procedures.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		282	Seminars In Thoracic And Cardiovascular Surgery		282	ismail,issam	Ismail	Issam
245	Animal Naming Test Is Associated With Poor Patient-Reported Outcomes And Frailty In People With And Without Cirrhosis: A Prospective Cohort Study.	2022	283	10.14309/ctg.0000000000000447	35080516		283	13	1	e00447	INTRODUCTION: Cognitive dysfunction is a major driver of care complexity, poor patient-reported outcomes, and frailty for people with cirrhosis. The performance and clinical associations of the animal naming test (ANT) in the general population are unknown. We evaluated ANT performance in a representative sample of older Americans with and without chronic liver disease (CLD). METHODS: We analyzed 6,661 subjects enrolled in the 2010-2016 Health and Retirement Survey, a representative cohort of >30,000 US adults. Average age of participants was 75 years. We evaluated 3 subject subgroups: (i) without CLD, (ii) noncirrhosis CLD, and (iii) cirrhosis. We determined the association between the ANT (overall) and S-ANT1 <10 (adjusted for age and education) and health status, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, healthcare utilization (care hours received and hospitalizations), and frailty measures (hand grip and walk speed). RESULTS: Overall, 8.2% of the sample had noncirrhotic CLD and 1.3% had cirrhosis. CLD or cirrhosis was not independently associated with ANT. Poor ANT performance was associated with poor health status and frailty overall. An S-ANT <10 was associated with fair-poor self-reported health (odds ratio [OR] 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.56), care hours received (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.39; 95% CI: 1.79-3.19), and hospitalizations (IRR 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03-1.26). S-ANT <10 was also associated with activities of daily living disability (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51), instrumental activities of daily living disability (OR 1.85; 95% CI: 1.59-2.14), weaker hand grip (IRR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92-0.96), and time to walk 2.5 m (IRR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.17-1.29). DISCUSSION: ANT performance is not specific to CLD/cirrhosis but is associated with patient-reported outcomes and frailty in a nationally representative sample of elderly subjects with and without CLD.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		283	Clinical And Translational Gastroenterology		283	tapper,elliot.b	Tapper	Elliot B
246	Conditions Associated With The Initiation Of Domiciliary Care Following A Hospital Admission: A Cohort Study In East London, England.	2022	285	10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061875	36109027		21	12	9	e061875	OBJECTIVE: Older people and people with complex needs often require both health and social care services, but there is limited insight into individual journeys across these services. To help inform joint health and social care planning, we aimed to assess the relationship between hospital admissions and domiciliary care receipt. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study, using linked data on primary care activity, hospital admissions and social care records. SETTING: London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 19 and over who lived in the area on 1 April 2018 and who were registered at a general practice in East London between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2020 (n=140 987). OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome was initiation of domiciliary care. We estimated the rate of hospital-associated care package initiation, and of care packages unrelated to hospital admission. We also described the characteristics of hospital admissions that preceded domiciliary care, including primary diagnosis codes. RESULTS: 2041/140 987 (1.4%) participants had a domiciliary care package during a median follow-up of 1.87 years. 32.6% of packages were initiated during a hospital stay or within 7 days of discharge. The rate of new domiciliary care packages was 120 times greater (95% CI 110 to 130) during or after a hospital stay than at other times, and this association was present for all age groups. Primary admission reasons accounting for the largest number of domiciliary care packages were hip fracture, pneumonia, stroke, urinary tract infection, septicaemia and exacerbations of long-term conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure). Admission reasons with the greatest likelihood of a subsequent domiciliary care package were fractures and strokes. CONCLUSION: Hospitals are a major referral route into domiciliary care. While patients admitted due to new and acute illnesses account for many domiciliary care packages, exacerbations of long-term conditions and age-related and frailty-related conditions are also important drivers.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		21	Bmj Open		285	grimm,fiona	Grimm	Fiona
247	Awareness Of Caregivers Of Geriatric Deficits Among Older People-The Results Of A Cross-Sectional Study In Krakow, Poland.	2022	287	10.1186/s12875-022-01801-z	35883017		287	23	1	181	BACKGROUND: It seems that caregivers (CGs) may be a reliable source of information for determining health condition of seniors. This might be important for general practitioners (GPs) and facilitate them conducting comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). The objectives of our study were to: compare populations of older patients with and without CGs, characterise the group of CGs, establish whether CGs are aware of patients' deficiencies in areas of CGA. METHODS: Patients aged at least 65 years underwent CGA using eight tools in GPs' practices in and around Krakow, Poland. Seniors were divided into two groups: with and without CGs. CGs filled in an authors' questionnaire on their data and assessed seniors in eight domains corresponding to the tests used in CGA. Patients with and without CGs were also compared in terms of CGA results and basic demographic and medical data. Subjective CGs' responses were compared with objective CGA results. RESULTS: We conducted CGA on 438 senior patients. Two hundred fifty eight (59%) of them were classified as patients with CGs. Patients with CGs were older, less educated, more often lived in rural areas and were more frequently in a relationship (as all p < 0.05). In seniors with CGs, the results of frailty (p < 0.008) and insomnia scales (p = 0.049) were significantly worse. Mostly, CGs could properly assess seniors in basic and complex living activities and nutritional status. They were less precise in determining deficits like depressive tendency and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: CGs' assessment of older patients can be a valuable source of information about seniors and can be helpful in diagnosing important health issues. CGs have difficulties when asked to properly assess depression and insomnia in the older adults they care for and their answers do not always correspond with the results of CGA. GPs should pay more attention to the needs of CGs themselves and provide them with the necessary knowledge about caring for older people.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		287	Bmc Primary Care		287	pachołek,anna	Pachołek	Anna

249	Frailty Index Is Useful For Predicting Postoperative Morbidity In Older Patients Undergoing Gastrointestinal Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study.	2022	289	10.1186/s12893-022-01471-9	35172806		289	22	1	57	BACKGROUND: Many assessment tools have been used to identify frail surgical patients. This study was designed to explore the prediction value of the frailty index (FI) for postoperative morbidity in older patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Between January 2019 and September 2020, we conducted a prospective study in our hospital, and patients aged over 65 years were enrolled. The FI assessment was conducted by two specialist nurses based on the 38-item scale, and patients were considered frail if the FI score was ≥ 0.25. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative morbidity. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to find the risk factors related to postoperative morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 246 consecutive patients were enrolled, for whom the median age was 72.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 67.0-77.0] years old, and 175 (71.1%) were male. Of these, 47 (19.1%) were frail. Patients with frailty were associated with older age (p < 0.001), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (p = 0.006), lower body mass index (p = 0.001), lower albumin (p = 0.003) and haemoglobin (p < 0.001) levels, increased blood loss (p = 0.034), increased risk of postoperative morbidity (p < 0.001), increased median length of stay (p = 0.017), and increased median postoperative hospital stay (p = 0.003). Multivariable analysis revealed that ASA grade [odds ratio (OR): 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-5.64, p = 0.016], FI score (OR 7.68, 95% CI 3.19-18.48, p < 0.001) and surgical complexity (OR 22.83, 95% CI 5.46-95.51, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of 30-day postoperative morbidity. However, for patients with major surgery, FI score was the only independent predictor (OR 8.67, 95% CI 3.23-23.25, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, and the 38-item FI scale was a useful frailty screening tool for older patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. For patients with major surgery, frailty was a more reliable predictor of postoperative 30-day morbidity than age and ASA grade.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		289	Bmc Surgery		289	gu,chaoyang	Gu	Chaoyang
250	Frailty As A Predictor Of Mortality For Fenestrated Evar And Open Surgical Repair Of Aortic Aneurysms Involving Visceral Vessels.	2022	290	10.1016/j.avsg.2021.10.035	34780958		213	80		29	OBJECTIVES: Frailty has been correlated with poor outcomes after major surgery across multiple specialties, but has not been studied in patients undergoing open or endovascular repair of suprarenal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) has emerged as a lower risk alternative to open surgical repair (OSR) for patients with complex aortic aneurysms involving the visceral artery branches. The objective of the current study was to examine the relationship between frailty and peri-operative outcomes for FEVAR and OSR in patients with suprarenal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was used to identify patients who underwent FEVAR or OSR for the years 2011 through 2017. Frailty was quantified using a modified 5-factor frailty index (mFI-5) that was previously validated for surgical patients. Frailty was correlated with the primary endpoint of 30-day mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 675 FEVAR and 1,779 OSR operations were included in the analysis. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.0% for FEVAR and 7.1% for OSR (P = 0.002). Increasing frailty was significantly associated with higher 30-day mortality for both FEVAR (P = 0.018) and OSR (P = 0.0003). Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were frailty score (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.22 [per 0.1-unit increase]; P = 0.0005), type of repair (OSR versus FEVAR, OR 2.46; P = 0.0001), age (OR 1.03; P = 0.0025), female sex (OR 1.61; P = 0.007), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.68; P = 0.021), American Society of Anesthesiology [ASA] class (OR 1.57; P = 0.035), preoperative dialysis (OR 3.45; P = 0.032), and history of bleeding disorder (OR 2.60; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, as measured using a mFI-5 score, is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality, overall complications, and length of stay after FEVAR or OSR. Frailty should be used to identify patients at high risk of adverse postoperative outcomes to determine if this risk is modifiable or whether nonoperative is the most appropriate option. FEVAR may offer improved 30-day outcomes, compared to OSR, for the frailest patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		213	Annals Of Vascular Surgery		290	modrall,john.gregory	Modrall	John Gregory

However, extended lifespan is not necessarily accompanied by prolongation of health span, such that there is increasing prevalence of frailty and dependency, which translates into increase in complex health and social needs as well as increase in absolute numbers of older adults that require such needs. Consideration of social determinants of healthy ageing would be important in the design of equitable health and social care systems. There is a trend towards development of integrated medical social care in the community in Asian countries. Long-term care insurance and also philanthropic support play a role in the financing of such care models.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		291	woo,jean	Woo	Jean
252	Generalist-Specialist Collaboration In Primary Care For Frail Older Persons: A Promising Model For The Future.	2022	292	10.1016/j.jamda.2021.12.016	34973166		128	23	2	288	"OBJECTIVES: The complex care needs of frail older persons living at home is a major challenge for health care systems worldwide. One possible solution is to employ a primary care physician (PCP) with additional geriatric expertise. In the Netherlands, elderly care physicians (ECPs), who traditionally work in nursing homes, are increasingly encouraged to utilize their expertise within primary care. However, little is known about how PCPs and ECPs collaborate. Therefore, we aimed to unravel the nature of the current PCP-ECP collaboration in primary care for frail older persons, and to identify key concepts for success. DESIGN: A qualitative multiple case study with semistructured interviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A selection of 22 participants from 7 ""established collaboration practices"" within the primary care setting in the Netherlands, including at least 1 ECP, 1 PCP, and 1 other health care professional for every included established collaboration practice. METHODS: Transcripts of individual interviews were analyzed using largely double and independent open and axial coding, and formulation of themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed 4 key concepts for success: (1) clarification of roles and expectations (ie, patient-centered care and embedding in existing care networks), (2) trust, respect, and familiarity as drivers for collaboration (ie, mutual trust through knowing each other and having shared goals); (3) framework for regular communication (ie, structural meetings and a shared vision); and (4) government, payer, and organization support (ie, financial support and emphasis on the collaboration's urgency by organizations and national policy makers). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: For a successful generalist-specialist collaboration, health care professionals need to invest in building relationships and mutual trust, and incorporating their efforts in the existing care networks to guarantee patient-centeredness. When provided with reimbursement and appreciation, this collaboration is a promising change in general practice to improve the care and outcomes of frail older persons."		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		128	Journal Of The American Medical Directors Association		292	vrijmoeth,talitha	Vrijmoeth	Talitha
253	Translation Of The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention Into Other Emergency Departments: A Post Implementation Evaluation Of Outcomes For Older Adults.	2022	293	10.1186/s12877-022-02999-4	35392828		23	22	1	290	BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of older adults with complex health deficits presenting to emergency departments has prompted the development of innovative models of care. One such model designed to reduce poor outcomes associated with acute healthcare, is the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention. This intervention is a nurse-led, physician-championed, Emergency Department intervention that improves the health outcomes for frail older adults in the emergency department. METHODS: This quantitative cohort study aimed to evaluate the healthcare outcomes and costs associated with the implementation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention (GEDI) for adults aged 70 years and over at two hospital sites that implemented the model using the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARHIS) framework. Hospital A was large teaching hospital located in the tropical north of Australia. Hospital B was a medium sized teaching hospital near Brisbane, Queensland Australia. The effect of the intervention was examined in two ways. Outcomes were compared between: 1) all patients in the pre- and post- implementation periods, and 2) patients seen or not seen by the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention team in the post-implementation period. The outcomes measured were disposition (discharged home, admitted); emergency department length of stay; hospital length of stay; all cause in-hospital mortality within 28 days; time to re-presentation up to 28 days post-discharge; emergency department and in-hospital costs. Survival analyses were used for the primary and secondary outcome variables and a Cox survival model was used to estimate the associations between variables and outcomes. Multiple regression models were used to examine other secondary outcomes whilst controlling for a range of confounders. RESULTS: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention was successfully translated into two different emergency departments. Both demonstrated an increased likelihood of discharge, decreased emergency department length of stay, decreased hospital costs for those who were admitted, with an associated reduction in risk of mortality, for adults aged 70 years and over. CONCLUSIONS: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention was successfully translated into new sites that adapted the model design. Improvement in healthcare outcomes for older adults presenting to the emergency department was demonstrated, although this was more subtle than in the original model setting.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		293	marsden,elizabeth	Marsden	Elizabeth
254	Temporal Patterns Of High-Spend Subgroups Can Inform Service Strategy For Medicare Advantage Enrollees.	2022	294	10.1007/s11606-021-06912-4	34100239		186	37	8	1853	BACKGROUND: Most healthcare costs are concentrated in a small proportion of individuals with complex social, medical, behavioral, and clinical needs that are poorly met by a fee-for-service healthcare system. Efforts to reduce cost in the top decile have shown limited effectiveness. Understanding patient subgroups within the top decile is a first step toward designing more effective and targeted interventions. OBJECTIVE: Segment the top decile based on spending and clinical characteristics and examine the temporal movement of individuals in and out of the top decile. DESIGN: Retrospective claims data analysis. PARTICIPANTS: UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollees (N = 1,504,091) continuously enrolled from 2016 to 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Medical (physician, inpatient, outpatient) and pharmacy claims for services submitted for third-party reimbursement under Medicare Advantage, available as International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and National Drug Codes (NDC) claims. KEY RESULTS: The top decile was segmented into three distinct subgroups characterized by different drivers of cost: (1) Catastrophic: acute events (acute myocardial infarction and hip/pelvic fracture), (2) persistent: medications, and (3) semi-persistent chronic conditions and frailty indicators. These groups show different patterns of spending across time. Each year, 79% of the catastrophic group dropped out of the top decile. In contrast, 68-70% of the persistent group and 36-37% of the semi-persistent group remained in the top decile year over year. These groups also show different 1-year mortality rates, which are highest among semi-persistent members at 17.5-18.5%, compared to 12% and 13-14% for catastrophic and persistent members, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The top decile consists of subgroups with different needs and spending patterns. Interventions to reduce utilization and expenditures may show more effectiveness if they account for the different characteristics and care needs of these subgroups.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		186	Journal Of General Internal Medicine		294	amodeo,samuel.j	Amodeo	Samuel J
255	Cognitive Motor Dual Task Costs In Older Adults With Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome.	2021	295	10.14283/jfa.2021.27	34549248		12	10	4	337	The purpose of this study was to characterize Cognitive Motor Dual Task (CMDT) costs for a community-based sample of older adults with Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR), as well as investigate associations between CMDT costs and cognitive performance. Twenty-five community-dwelling older adults (ages 60-89 years) with MCR performed single and dual task complex walking scenarios, as well as a computerized cognitive testing battery. Participants with lower CMDT costs had higher scores on composite measures of Working Memory, Processing Speed, and Shifting, as well as an overall cognitive composite measure. In addition, participants with faster single task gait velocity had higher scores on composite measures of Working Memory, Processing Speed, and overall cognition. Taken together, these results suggest that CMDT paradigms can help to elucidate the interplay between cognitive and motor abilities for older adults with MCR.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		12	The Journal Of Frailty & Aging		295	ward,n	Ward	N
256	Management Of Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction: Challenges In Patients With Atrial Fibrillation, Renal Disease And In The Elderly.	2022	296	10.31083/j.rcm2301016	35092208		296	23	1	16	Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is an increasing global pandemic affecting more than 30 million individuals worldwide. Importantly, HFrEF is frequently accompanied by the presence of cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities that may greatly influence the management and prognosis of the disease. In this review article, we will focus on three important comorbidities in HFrEF; atrial fibrillation (AF), advanced renal disease, and elderly, which all have a paramount impact on progression of the disease, management strategies, and response to therapy. AF is very common in HFrEF and shares many risk factors. AF aggravates heart failure and contributes to HF-related adverse clinical outcomes; hence it requires special consideration in HFrEF management. The kidney function is largely affected by the reduced cardiac output developed in the setting of HFrEF, and the neurohormonal feedback effects create a complex interplay that pose challenges in the management of HFrEF when renal function is significantly impaired. Cardiorenal syndrome is a challenging sequela with increased morbidity and mortality thereby reflecting the delicate and complex balance between the heart and the kidney in HFrEF and renal failure conditions. Furthermore, patients with advanced renal failure have poor prognosis in the presence of HFrEF with limited treatment options. Finally, aging and frailty are important factors that influence treatment strategies in HFrEF with greater emphasis on tolerability and safety of the various HFrEF therapies in elderly individuals.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		296	Reviews In Cardiovascular Medicine		296	kolben,yotam	Kolben	Yotam
257	Unbiased Proteomics, Histochemistry, And Mitochondrial Dna Copy Number Reveal Better Mitochondrial Health In Muscle Of High-Functioning Octogenarians.	2022	297	10.7554/eLife.74335	35404238		297	11		None	BACKGROUND: Master athletes (MAs) prove that preserving a high level of physical function up to very late in life is possible, but the mechanisms responsible for their high function remain unclear. METHODS: We performed muscle biopsies in 15 octogenarian world-class track and field MAs and 14 non-athlete age/sex-matched controls (NA) to provide insights into mechanisms for preserving function in advanced age. Muscle samples were assessed for respiratory compromised fibers, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, and proteomics by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. RESULTS: MA exhibited markedly better performance on clinical function tests and greater cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis muscle. Proteomics analysis revealed marked differences, where most of the ~800 differentially represented proteins in MA versus NA pertained to mitochondria structure/function such as electron transport capacity (ETC), cristae formation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mtDNA-encoded proteins. In contrast, proteins from the spliceosome complex and nuclear pore were downregulated in MA. Consistent with proteomics data, MA had fewer respiratory compromised fibers, higher mtDNA copy number, and an increased protein ratio of the cristae-bound ETC subunits relative to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel. There was a substantial overlap of proteins overrepresented in MA versus NA with proteins that decline with aging and that are higher in physically active than sedentary individuals. However, we also found 176 proteins related to mitochondria that are uniquely differentially expressed in MA. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that high function in advanced age is associated with preserving mitochondrial structure/function proteins, with underrepresentation of proteins involved in the spliceosome and nuclear pore complex. Whereas many of these differences in MA appear related to their physical activity habits, others may reflect unique biological (e.g., gene, environment) mechanisms that preserve muscle integrity and function with aging.

258	Acute Myocardial Infarction And Cardiogenic Shock Interventional Approach To Management In The Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories.	2022	298	10.2174/1573403X17666211125090929	34823461		248	18	2	e251121198293	Despite advances in early reperfusion and a technologic renaissance in the space of Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS), Cardiogenic Shock (CS) remains the leading cause of in-hospital mortality following Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Given the challenges inherent to conducting adequately powered randomized controlled trials in this time-sensitive, hemodynamically complex, and highly lethal syndrome, treatment recommendations have been derived from AMI patients without shock. In this review, we aimed to (1) examine the pathophysiology and the new classification system for CS; (2) provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review for best practices for interventional management of AMI-CS in the cardiac catheterization laboratory; and (3) highlight the concept of how frailty and geriatric syndromes can be integrated into the decision process and where medical futility lies in the spectrum of AMI-CS care. Management strategies in the cardiac catheterization laboratory for CS include optimal vascular access, periprocedural antithrombotic therapy, culprit lesion versus multi-vessel revascularization, selective utilization of hemodynamic MCS tailored to individual shock hemometabolic profiles, and management of cardiac arrest. Efforts to advance clinical evidence for patients with CS should be concentrated on (1) the coordination of multi-center registries; (2) development of pragmatic clinical trials designed to evaluate innovative therapies; (3) establishment of multidisciplinary care models that will inform quality care and improve clinical outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		248	Current Cardiology Reviews		298	tehrani,behnam.n	Tehrani	Behnam N
259	Transforming Primary Care For Older Canadians Living With Frailty: Mixed Methods Study Protocol For A Complex Primary Care Intervention.	2021	299	10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042911	33986044		21	11	5	e042911	INTRODUCTION: Older Canadians living with frailty are high users of healthcare services; however, the healthcare system is not well designed to meet the complex needs of many older adults. Older persons look to their primary care practitioners to assess their needs and coordinate their care. They may need care from a variety of providers and services, but often this care is not well coordinated. Older adults and their family caregivers are the experts in their own needs and preferences, but often do not have a chance to participate fully in treatment decisions or care planning. As a result, older adults may have health problems that are not properly assessed, managed or treated, resulting in poorer health outcomes and higher economic and social costs. We will be implementing enhanced primary healthcare approaches for older patients, including risk screening, patient engagement and shared decision making and care coordination. These interventions will be tailored to the needs and circumstances of the primary care study sites. In this article, we describe our study protocol for implementing and testing these approaches. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Nine primary care sites in three Canadian provinces will participate in a multi-phase mixed methods study. In phase 1, baseline information will be collected through questionnaires and interviews with patients and healthcare providers (HCPs). In phase 2, HCPs and patients will be consulted to tailor the evidence-based interventions to site-specific needs and circumstances. In phase 3, sites will implement the tailored care model. Evaluation of the care model will include measures of patient and provider experience, a quality of life measure, qualitative interviews and economic evaluation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received ethics clearance from the host academic institutions: University of Calgary (REB17-0617), University of Waterloo (ORE#22446) and Université Laval (#MP-13-2019-1500 and 2017-2018-12-MP). Results will be disseminated through traditional means, including peer-reviewed publications and conferences and through an extensive network of knowledge user partners.

260	Age-Related Changes In Clinical Characteristics And Outcomes Of Chronic Heart Failure Outpatients In A Cardiology Setting. A Report From The Italian Network On Heart Failure.	2022	300	10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.11.014	34793855		300	346		36	AIMS: Ageing and comorbidities are increasing frailty/complexity of heart failure (HF) patients globally. We assessed evolving trends over two decades according to patients' age and time of recruitment in a nationwide cardiology setting in Italy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chronic HF outpatients recruited between 1999 and 2018 (N = 14,823) were divided into 3 cohorts: 1999-2005 (N = 5404); 2006-2011 (N = 3971); 2012-2018 (N = 5448). We analyzed temporal changes in clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcome (1-year all-cause mortality/cardiovascular hospitalization), overall and by age group: <65 (n = 5465); 65-79 (n = 6838); ≥80 (n = 2520) years old. Across enrolment epochs, comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, obesity) increased by both epoch/age groups (p < 0.001), whereas the prevalence of ischemic etiology declined among patients ≥65 years (p = 0.05). Accordingly, the preserved LVEF phenotype (HFpEF) increased in all age categories (p < 0.001) over time. Moreover, the use of betablockers, mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists and loop-diuretics rose by enrolment epoch in all age groups (p < 0.05). In parallel with these epidemiologic/treatment changes, age-adjusted survival free from cardiovascular hospitalization improved over time (p < 0.0001). However, divergent trends in the end-point components were apparent according to age groups: mortality decreased in patients<80 years, although hospitalizations remained stable in the youngest group, while subjects ≥65 years were less likely to be admitted for cardiovascular causes (all p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Over two decades in a cardiology outpatient setting, the prevalence of comorbid HFpEF increased in all age categories. Mortality improved among patients<80 years and cardiovascular hospitalizations decreased in patients≥65 years. These findings point to the value of cardiologist' input in the management of adult chronic HF patients at all ages.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		300	International Journal Of Cardiology		300	gori,mauro	Gori	Mauro
261	Comparison Of Preoperative Assessment Tools In Older Patients Undergoing Cancer Surgery: A Prospective Study.	2022	301	10.1016/j.jgo.2021.12.013	34998721		136	13	4	420	INTRODUCTION: Surgery in older adults with cancer is complex due to multiple age related confounding factors. There are many scoring systems available for preoperative risk stratifications of older patients. Currently very few prospective studies comparing the various commonly used scales are available. This is the first study which compares the established preoperative risk assessment tools of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale (ECOG) and American Society of Anaesthesiologists Physical Status Scale (ASA) with frailty scores of Modified Frailty Index (MFI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of older patients with cancer who underwent oncosurgery in a tertiary cancer centre during the one-year study period. Patients were scored on the CFS, MFI, ASA and ECOG scales. All patients were followed up for 30 days immediately following surgery and their post operative complications were documented. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done and a p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 820 patients studied, 15.6% had prolonged hospital stay, 9.1% had 30-day morbidity, 0.7% had readmission, and mortality was 1.1%. High-risk scores on the ASA and CFS were significantly associated with prolonged postoperative stay, readmission, morbidity, and mortality (p < 0.05). High-risk scores on the ECOG was significantly associated with prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.027), 30-day morbidity (p = 0.003), and mortality (p = 0.001), but not with readmission. There was no significant association between MFI score and the postoperative variables studied (p > 0.05). On multivariate analysis, morbidity was significantly associated only with male gender (p = 0.015), higher cancer stage (p = 0.005), higher ASA score (p = 0.029), and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.001). Mortality was significantly associated only with emergency surgery (p = 0.012) and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.004), and prolonged hospital stay was significantly associated with advanced cancer stage (p = 0.001) and emergency surgery (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In older patients undergoing cancer surgery, ASA and CFS are predictors of prolonged postoperative stay, morbidity, mortality, and readmission. A high-risk ECOG score is predictive of prolonged post operative stay, 30-day morbidity, and mortality, but not of readmission. Score on MFI is not a predictor of postoperative outcomes. Newer predictive tools which include cancer- specific factors are required for better management of these patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		136	Journal Of Geriatric Oncology		301	philip,frenny.ann	Philip	Frenny Ann
262	From Research To Bedside: Incorporation Of A Cga-Based Frailty Index Among Multiple Comanagement Services.	2022	302	10.1111/jgs.17446	34519037		110	70	1	90	The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the core tool used by geriatricians across diverse clinical settings to identify vulnerabilities and estimate physiologic reserve in older adults. In this paper, we demonstrate the iterative process at our institution to identify and develop a feasible, acceptable, and sustainable bedside CGA-based frailty index tool (FI-CGA) that not only quantifies and grades frailty but also provides a uniform way to efficiently communicate complex geriatric concepts such as reserve and vulnerability with other teams. We describe our incorporation of the FI-CGA into the electronic health record (EHR) and dissemination among clinical services. We demonstrate that an increasing number of patients have documented FI-CGA in their initial assessment from 2018 to 2020, while additional comanagement services were established (Figure 2). The acceptability and sustainability of the FI-CGA, and its routine use by geriatricians in our division, were demonstrated by a survey where the majority of clinicians report using the FI-CGA when assessing a new patient and that the FI-CGA informs their clinical management. Finally, we demonstrate how we refined and updated the FI-CGA, we provide examples of applications of the FI-CGA across the institution and describe areas of ongoing process improvement and challenges for the use of this tailored yet standardized tool across diverse inpatient and outpatient services. The process outlined can be used by other geriatric departments to introduce and incorporate an FI-CGA.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		110	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		302	cooper,lisa	Cooper	Lisa
263	Implementation Of The Frailty Assessment To Improve Liver Transplant Outcomes.	2022	303	10.1007/s40520-022-02111-1	35380349		154	34	8	1919	The majority of patients undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) have increased in age, therefore chronological age may have become an unreliable parameter for supporting clinical decisions. The age-related deficit accumulation model measuring frailty proposed by Rockwood et al., may propose an alternative in providing an estimate of an individual's biological age. No Frailty Index (FI) tailored specifically for OLT patients exists to date. Forty-three consecutive OLT patients with ≥ 20 years of survival with a functioning graft were included in our study. The FI was computed taking to account 39 items (FI-39), meeting the standard criteria for internal validation. Endpoints were polypharmacy, and recent Emergency Room admission. The mean age of our population was 69 (sd 9) years. The mean FI-39 was 0.23 (sd 0.1). The FI-39 was associated with polypharmacy [odds ratio (OR) 1.13; Confidence interval (95%CI) 1.03-1.24; p = 0.01], and recent Emergency Room admission [beta coefficient + 1.98; 95%CI + 0.26, + 3.70; p = 0.03], independent for age and sex. This study demonstrates that an FI can be derived from data collected during routine clinical follow-up and allows for improved differentiation related to the OLT clinical complexity in OLT patients, independent of chronological age. This may lead to the adoption of FI-39 to improve personalized OLT patient care.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		154	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		303	corradi,mattia	Corradi	Mattia
264	Closing The Gap Between Inpatient And Outpatient Settings: Integrating Pulmonary Rehabilitation And Technological Advances In The Comprehensive Management Of Frail Patients.	2022	304	10.3390/ijerph19159150	35954506		15	19	15	None	Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a well-established intervention supported by strong evidence that is used to treat patients affected by chronic respiratory diseases. However, several barriers still affect its spreading in rehabilitation clinical practices. Although chronic respiratory diseases are common age-related disorders, there is still a gap of knowledge regarding the implementation of sustainable strategies integrating PR in the rehabilitation management of frail patients at high risk of respiratory complications. Therefore, in the present study, we characterized the effects of PR in frail patients, highlighting the evidence supporting its role in improving the complex rehabilitative management of these patients. Moreover, we propose a novel organizational model promoting PR programs for frail patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Our model emphasizes the role of interdisciplinary care, specifically tailored to patients and environmental characteristics. In this scenario, cutting-edge technology and telemedicine solutions might be implemented as safe and sustainable strategies filling the gap between inpatient and outpatient settings. Future research should focus on large-scale sustainable interventions to improve the quality of life and global health of frail patients. Moreover, evidence-based therapeutic paths should be promoted and taught in training courses promoting multiprofessional PR knowledge to increase awareness and better address its delivery in frail patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		304	lippi,lorenzo	Lippi	Lorenzo
265	Provision Of Oral Health Care By Dentists To Community-Dwelling Older Patients.	2022	305	10.1016/j.identj.2021.05.012	34281699		305	72	2	169	BACKGROUND: Research into oral health care for older people has shown that dental care in general decreases with increasing age and frailty and, therefore, oral health care provision may be complex. The aim of this study is to identify the oral health care dentists provide to community-dwelling older people and which barriers they experience in doing this. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a representative sample of dentists in the Netherlands was asked to prospectively select one older patient and describe this patient using a specially developed registration form; the patient was requested to fill out a questionnaire. The relationship between experienced barriers in providing oral health care to older patients and characteristics of the dentists and the patients was studied by means univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 923 dentists were asked to participate in the study. Data were available for 39.4% dentist-patient pairs. In most cases (87.4%), oral health care was focussed on conservation of the dentition. In all, 14.0% of the dentists experienced barriers in providing oral health care for older people. Some patient factors increase the risk of experiencing barriers, eg, the more difficult behaviour of older patients and the greater disease burden. CONCLUSIONS: Oral health care was mostly focussed on conservation of the dentition, and dentists especially experience barriers in oral health provision to older patients if they are already frail.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		305	International Dental Journal		305	bots-vantspijker,pieternella.c	Bots-VantSpijker	Pieternella C
266	Impact Of Functional Capacity On Change In Self-Rated Health Among Older Adults In A Nine-Year Longitudinal Study.	2021	306	10.1186/s12877-021-02571-6	34736401		23	21	1	627	The aims of the present study were to estimate the frequency of change in self-rated health (SRH) among community-dwelling older adults, between two measures taken at a 9-year interval; and determine factors associated with a decline and an improvement in SRH, in relation to aspects of physical/emotional health and subjective wellbeing. Data were derived from a community-based study on frailty among Brazilian elderly. Associations were investigated using Pearson's chi-square test and relative risk ratios were estimated using multinomial logistic regression analysis. 39.3% of participants did not change their SRH at both assessment times, 21.7% rated it as worse and 39.0% rated it as better. The relative risk ratio of an improvement in SRH for individuals with disability in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) was lower than for individuals with independence in basic ADLs (IRR=0.22; IC95%: 0.08-0.63). Understanding the complex interactions between self-rated health and the dimensions that influence the improvement of health perception may shed light on key determinants of the wellbeing among older adults.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		306	borim,flávia.silva.arbex	Borim	Flávia Silva Arbex
267	Is Dental Education Meeting The Oral Health Needs Of Older Adults?	2022	307	10.1002/jdd.13026	36165248		307	86	9	1233	The aim of this article is to highlight the importance of promoting oral health for the geriatric population and implementing change to address their complex oral and systemic health needs. Oral healthcare providers are unequipped to meet the demanding oral health needs of the aging population, resulting in a geriatric oral health crisis that needs immediate attention and action. Despite the advancements in geriatric education over the last two decades, the geriatric curriculum in 2022 is still inadequate, and varies greatly among different US dental schools for both pre- and postdoctoral programs. Predoctoral students are graduating without being sufficiently trained to identify and treat the dental issues of older adults due to lack of a purposely planned curriculum with balanced didactic and clinical exposure. It is critical to have a trained and competent workforce that meets the oral health needs of current and future older adults. To change the present environment, there is a need for curriculum redesign, faculty development, and training. In addition, more research to evaluate pre- and postdoctoral geriatric dentistry curricula, their impact on increasing access to care, and the likelihood of graduating dentists competent to treat functionally dependent and frail older adults is needed. Furthermore, decision-makers in dental education, national dental organizations, and government institutions must support policies that integrate oral health into overall health through robust reimbursement mechanisms, including a dental benefit in Medicare, and recognition of geriatric dentistry as a specialty.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		307	Journal Of Dental Education		307	thompson,lisa.a	Thompson	Lisa A
268	New Horizons In Evidence-Based Care For Older People: Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis.	2022	308	10.1093/ageing/afac090	35460409		131	51	4	None	Evidence-based decisions on clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions are ideally informed by meta-analyses of intervention trial data. However, when undertaken, such meta-analyses in ageing research have typically been conducted using standard methods whereby summary (aggregate) data are extracted from published trial reports. Although meta-analysis of aggregate data can provide useful insights into the average effect of interventions within a selected trial population, it has limitations regarding robust conclusions on which subgroups of people stand to gain the greatest benefit from an intervention or are at risk of experiencing harm. Future evidence synthesis using individual participant data from ageing research trials for meta-analysis could transform understanding of the effectiveness of interventions for older people, supporting evidence-based and sustainable commissioning. A major advantage of individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) is that it enables examination of characteristics that predict treatment effects, such as frailty, disability, cognitive impairment, ethnicity, gender and other wider determinants of health. Key challenges of IPDMA relate to the complexity and resources needed for obtaining, managing and preparing datasets, requiring a meticulous approach involving experienced researchers, frequently with expertise in designing and analysing clinical trials. In anticipation of future IPDMA work in ageing research, we are establishing an international Ageing Research Trialists collective, to bring together trialists with a common focus on transforming care for older people as a shared ambition across nations.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		308	clegg,andrew	Clegg	Andrew
269	Do Interventions Reducing Social Vulnerability Improve Health In Community Dwelling Older Adults? A Systematic Review.	2022	309	10.2147/CIA.S349836	35431543		90	17		447	BACKGROUND: Social vulnerability occurs when individuals have been relatively disadvantaged by the social determinants of health. Complex interventions that reduce social vulnerability have the potential to improve health in older adults but robust evidence is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify, appraise and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of complex interventions targeting reduction in social vulnerability for improving health related outcomes (mortality, function, cognition, subjective health and healthcare use) in older adults living in the community. METHODS: A mixed methods systematic review was conducted. Five databases and targeted grey literature were searched for primary studies of all study types according to predetermined criteria. Data were extracted from each distinct intervention and quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Effectiveness data were synthesized using vote counting by direction of effect, combining p values and Albatross plots. RESULTS: Across 38 included studies, there were 34 distinct interventions categorized as strengthening social supports and communities, helping older adults and their caregivers navigate health and social services, enhancing neighbourhood and built environments, promoting education and providing economic stability. There was evidence to support positive influences on function, cognition, subjective health, and reduced hospital utilization. The evidence was mixed for non-hospital healthcare utilization and insufficient to determine effect on mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite high heterogeneity and varying quality of studies, attention to reducing an older adult's social vulnerability assists in improving older adults' health.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		90	Clinical Interventions In Aging		309	mah,jasmine	Mah	Jasmine
270	Metabolomic Profiles To Explore Biomarkers Of Severe Sarcopenia In Older Men: A Pilot Study.	2022	310	10.1016/j.exger.2022.111924	35963453		28	167		111924	BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of sarcopenia is complex and multifactorial; however, it has not yet been fully elucidated. Identifying metabolomic profiles may help clarify the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study explored potential noninvasive biomarkers of severe sarcopenia through metabolomic analysis in community-dwelling older men. METHODS: Twenty older men (mean age: 81.9 ± 2.8 years) were selected from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study. Participants with severe sarcopenia (n = 10) were compared with non-sarcopenic, age- and body mass index-matched controls (n = 10). Severe sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass, low muscle strength, and low physical performance using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. Non-targeted metabolomic profiling of plasma metabolites was performed using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry and absolute quantification was performed in target metabolites. RESULTS: Among 191 plasma metabolic peaks, the concentrations of 10 metabolites significantly differed between severe sarcopenia group and non-sarcopenic controls. The plasma concentrations of L-alanine, homocitrulline, N-acetylserine, gluconic acid, N-acetylalanine, proline, and sulfotyrosine were higher, while those of 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and tryptophan were lower in participants with severe sarcopenia than in non-sarcopenic controls (all, p < 0.05). Among the 53 metabolites quantified as target metabolites, L-alanine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.760; p = 0.049), gluconic acid (AUC = 0.800; p = 0.023), proline (AUC = 0.785; p = 0.031), and tryptophan (AUC = 0.800; p = 0.023) determined the presence of severe sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma metabolomic analysis demonstrated that L-alanine, gluconic acid, proline, and tryptophan may be potential biomarkers of severe sarcopenia. The identified metabolites can provide new insights into the underlying pathophysiology of severe sarcopenia and serve as the basis for preventive interventions.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		28	Experimental Gerontology		310	shin,hyung.eun	Shin	Hyung Eun
271	Safety And Efficacy Of Luminor™ Balloon And Angiolite™ Stent On Tasc C/D Tibial Occlusive Lesions In Cli Patients: 12-Month Results. The Merlion Trial.	2021	311	10.23736/S0392-9590.21.04690-3	34056892		311	40	4	335	BACKGROUND: The aim of MERLION (NCT04073121) was to evaluate the outcomes of the mono or combination therapy of the iVascular Luminor™ drug-coated balloon (DCB) and Angiolite™ drug-eluting stent for treatment of TASC II C/D tibial occlusive lesions in Asian patients presenting with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) from Singapore. METHODS: MERLION was a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, observational, multicenter clinical study. Complication-free survival at one month was the safety endpoint. Immediate technical success, 12-month primary vessel patency, limb salvage, freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) and amputation free survival (AFS) were the efficacy endpoints of interest. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. There were 32 males (64% males; mean age 66.4±8.9 years). Majority were Rutherford 5 severity (41/50; 82%). Co-morbidities included diabetes mellitus (47/50; 94.0%), end-stage renal failure (25/50; 50.0%), and hypertension (44/50; 88%). 66 atherosclerotic lesions were treated (47 de novo and 19 restenotic; 60.6% TASC C and 39.4% TASC D). Mean lesion length treated was 13.7±9.5 cm. There was 100% technical success. There were 3/66 (4.5%) bailout stenting for severe flow limiting dissections. Twelve-month primary tibial patency was 34/49 (69.4%) and freedom from TLR was 40/49 (81.5%). AFS was 74.0% (37/50). At 12 months, mean Rutherford scores improved from 100% (Rutherford score >3) at baseline to 31% at 12 months (P<0.05) and wound healing rate was 65.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The iVascular Luminor™ DCB is safe and efficacious in treating highly complex infra-popliteal atherosclerotic lesions in an otherwise challenging frail population of CLTI patients from Singapore.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		311	International Angiology: A Journal Of The International Union Of Angiology		311	tang,tjun.y	Tang	Tjun Y
272	World'S First Experience Treating Tasc Ii C And D Tibial Occlusive Disease Using The Selution Slr Sirolimus-Eluting Balloon: Six-Month Results From The Prestige Study.	2021	313	10.1177/15266028211007457	33843364		129	28	4	555	PURPOSE: The performance of sirolimus-coated devices has not been studied in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia patients. PRESTIGE aims to investigate the 6-month efficacy and safety profile of the Selution Sustained Limus Release (SLR) sirolimus-eluting balloon for treatment of TASC II C and D tibial occlusive lesions in patients with CLTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRESTIGE is a pilot prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm, multi-investigator, single-center clinical study. Endpoints were adverse event-free survival at 1 month, technical success rate, primary tibial patency at 6 months, limb salvage success, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and amputation free survival (AFS). RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were included. There were 17 (68.0%) males; mean age, 63.7±9.73 years. CLTI severity was based on the Rutherford scale (R5=25/25; 100.0%). Significant comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (n=22; 88.0%) and end-stage renal failure (n=11; 44.0%). A total of 33 atherosclerotic lesions were treated (TASC II D=15 (45.5%)). Mean lesion length treated was 191±111 mm. Technical success was 100%. Primary tibial patency at 6 months was 22/27 (81.5%) and freedom from clinically driven TLR was 25/30 (83.3%). AFS was 21/25 (84.0%; 3 deaths and 1 major lower extremity amputation). Mean Rutherford score improved from 5.00 at baseline to 1.14±2.10 (p<0.05) at 6 months. There was a wound healing rate of 13/22 (59.1%) and 17/21 (81.0%) at 3 and 6 months respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Selution SLR drug-eluting balloon is a safe and efficacious modality in treating complex tibial arterial occlusive lesions in what is an otherwise frail cohort of CLTI patients, with a high prevalence of diabetes and end-stage renal failure. Technical and clinical success rates are high and 6-month target lesion patency and AFS are more than satisfactory.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		129	Journal Of Endovascular Therapy: An Official Journal Of The International Society Of Endovascular Specialists		313	tang,tjun.yip	Tang	Tjun Yip
273	The Hospital Frailty Risk Score Is Not An Accurate Predictor Of Treatment Costs For Total Joint Replacement Patients In A Medicare Bundled Payment Population.	2021	314	10.1016/j.arth.2021.03.049	33893001		314	36	8	2658	BACKGROUND: Medically complex patients require more resources and experience higher costs within total joint arthroplasty (TJA) bundled payment models. While risk adjustment would be beneficial for such patients, no tool currently exists which can reliably identify these patients preoperatively. The purpose of this study is to determine if the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a valid predictor of high-TJA treatment costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on patients who underwent primary TJA between 2015 and 2020 from a single large orthopedic practice. ICD-10 codes from an institutional database were used to calculate HFRS. Cost data including inpatient, postacute, and episode of care (EOC) costs were collected. Charlson comorbidity index, demographics, readmissions, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: 4936 patients had a calculable HFRS and those with intermediate and high scores experienced more frequent readmissions/complications after TJA, as well as higher EOC costs. However, HFRS did not reliably predict EOC costs, yielding a sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 66%. Multivariate analysis revealed that both patient age and sex are superior individual cost predictors when compared with HFRS. Secondary analyses indicated that HFRS more effectively predicts TJA complications and readmissions but is still nonideal for clinical applications. CONCLUSION: HFRS has poor sensitivity as a predictor of high-EOC costs for TJA patients but has adequate specificity for predicting postoperative readmissions and complications. Further research is needed to develop a scale that can appropriately predict orthopedic cost outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		314	The Journal Of Arthroplasty		314	ong,christian.b	Ong	Christian B
274	Refocusing Dental Care: A Risk-Based Preventative Oral Health Programme For Dentate Older People In Uk Care Homes.	2022	315	10.1111/ger.12543	33586205		105	39	2	131	BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence for managing the risk of dental caries, notably dose-dependent use of fluoride based on risk. Specific guidance is lacking on higher fluoride use in older people in care homes and prevention is often omitted from dental care plans. OBJECTIVES: To introduce a risk-based preventative approach to existing routine dental care for older people in care homes. METHODS: Three mixed residential and nursing care homes for the frail and elder (>65 years) were selected to participate. All residents were risk assessed based on dependency, dentition status and self-care abilities and consequently placed on the appropriate evidence-based intervention (2800 ppm high dose fluoride toothpaste and/or quarterly fluoride varnish placement). Full mouth ICDAS dental examinations were completed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. RESULTS: At baseline, 127 risk assessments were completed in which most dentate residents (58.2%, n = 74) were assessed as Risk Level 2/3 (mod/high) whilst edentulous residents were all Risk Level 1 (low) (41.7%, n = 53). Only 13 (26.5%) of the 49 eligible residents completed the 12-month preventative programme. There was a significant difference in root caries (P < .0001), with 17 (51.5%) root lesions changing from active at baseline to arrested at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide early indication of fluoride efficacy, especially on root caries in this vulnerable group, and highlight the challenges of delivering programme's in these complex, changing environments.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		105	Gerodontology		315	patel,rakhee	Patel	Rakhee
275	Gap In Willingness And Access To Video Visit Use Among Older High-Risk Veterans: Cross-Sectional Study.	2022	316	10.2196/32570	35394440		189	24	4	e32570	BACKGROUND: The recent shift to video care has exacerbated disparities in health care access, especially among high-need, high-risk (HNHR) adults. Developing data-driven approaches to improve access to care necessitates a deeper understanding of HNHR adults' attitudes toward telemedicine and technology access. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the willingness, access, and ability of HNHR veterans to use telemedicine for health care. METHODS: WWe designed a questionnaire conducted via mail or telephone or in person. Among HNHR veterans who were identified using predictive modeling with national Veterans Affairs data, we assessed willingness to use video visits for health care, access to necessary equipment, and comfort with using technology. We evaluated physical health, including frailty, physical function, performance of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL); mental health; and social needs, including Area Deprivation Index, transportation, social support, and social isolation. RESULTS: The average age of the 602 HNHR veteran respondents was 70.6 (SD 9.2; range 39-100) years; 99.7% (600/602) of the respondents were male, 61% (367/602) were White, 36% (217/602) were African American, 17.3% (104/602) were Hispanic, 31.2% (188/602) held at least an associate degree, and 48.2% (290/602) were confident filling medical forms. Of the 602 respondents, 327 (54.3%) reported willingness for video visits, whereas 275 (45.7%) were unwilling. Willing veterans were younger (P<.001) and more likely to have an associate degree (P=.002), be health literate (P<.001), live in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods (P=.048), be independent in IADLs (P=.02), and be in better physical health (P=.04). A higher number of those willing were able to use the internet and email (P<.001). Of the willing veterans, 75.8% (248/327) had a video-capable device. Those with video-capable technology were younger (P=.004), had higher health literacy (P=.01), were less likely to be African American (P=.007), were more independent in ADLs (P=.005) and IADLs (P=.04), and were more adept at using the internet and email than those without the needed technology (P<.001). Age, confidence in filling forms, general health, and internet use were significantly associated with willingness to use video visits. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the HNHR respondents were unwilling for video visits and a quarter of those willing lacked requisite technology. The gap between those willing and without requisite technology is greater among older, less health literate, African American veterans; those with worse physical health; and those living in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our study highlights that HNHR veterans have complex needs, which risk being exacerbated by the video care shift. Although technology holds vast potential to improve health care access, certain vulnerable populations are less likely to engage, or have access to, technology. Therefore, targeted interventions are needed to address this inequity, especially among HNHR older adults.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		189	Journal Of Medical Internet Research		316	dang,stuti	Dang	Stuti
276	Patients' Perceptions Of Integrated Care Among Medicare Beneficiaries By Level Of Need For Health Services.	2022	317	10.1177/10775587211067897	35012390		317	79	5	640	Requirements for integrating care across providers, settings, and over time increase with patients' needs. Health care providers' ability to offer care that patients experience as integrated may vary among patients with different levels of need. We explore the variation in patients' perceptions of integrated care among Medicare beneficiaries based on the beneficiary's level of need using ordinary least square regression for each of four high-need groups: beneficiaries (a) with complex chronic conditions, (b) with frailties, (c) below 65 with disability, and (d) with any (of the first three) high needs. We control for beneficiary demographics and other factors affecting integrated care, and we conduct sensitivity analyses controlling for multiple individual chronic conditions. We find significant positive associations with level of need for provider support for self-directed care and medication and home health management. Controlling for multiple individual chronic conditions reduces effect sizes and number of significant relationships.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		317	Medical Care Research And Review: Mcrr		317	song,nancy	Song	Nancy
277	Individualized Medication Review In Older People With Multimorbidity: A Comparative Analysis Between Patients Living At Home And In A Nursing Home.	2022	139	10.3390/ijerph19063423	35329110		15	19	6	None	(1) Background: aging is associated with complex and dynamic changes leading to multimorbidity and, therefore, polypharmacy. A periodic medication review (MR) in frail older people leads to optimizing medication use. The aims of the study were to perform a comparative analysis of the impact of place of residence (own home versus nursing home) in a cohort of older patients on the characteristics of the baseline therapeutic plan and characteristics of the therapeutic plan after an MR; (2) Methods: Study with paired pre- and post-MR data based on person-centred prescription, with a follow-up assessment at three months. Patients who lived either in their own home or in a nursing home were recruited. We selected patients of 65 years or more with multimorbidity whose General Practitioner identified difficulties with the prescription management and the need for an MR. Each patient's treatment was analysed by applying the Patient-Centred Prescription (PCP) model; (3) Results: 428 patients. 90% presented at least one inappropriate prescription (IP) in both settings. In nursing homes, a higher number of implemented optimization proposals was detected (81.6% versus 65.7% (p &lt; 0.001)). After the MR, nursing-home patients had a greater decrease in their mean number of medications, polypharmacy prevalence, therapeutic complexity, and monthly drug expenditure (p &lt; 0.001); (4) Conclusions: PCP model detected a high number of IP in both settings. However, after an individualized MR, nursing-home patients presented a greater decrease in some pharmacological parameters related to adverse events, such as polypharmacy and therapeutic complexity, compared to those living at home. Nursing homes may be regarded as a highly suitable scenario to carry out a periodic MR, due to its high prevalence of frail people and its feasibility to apply the recommendations of an MR. Prospective studies with a robust design should be performed to demonstrate this quasi-experimental study along with a longitudinal follow-up on clinical outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		139	molist-brunet,núria	Molist-Brunet	Núria
278	The Role Of The Sunfrail Tool In The Screening Of Frailty And In Integrated Community-Hospital Care Pathways: A Retrospective Observational Study.	2022	319	10.1007/s40520-021-01931-x	34302641		154	34	2	419	BACKGROUND: One of the most problematic expression of ageing is frailty, and an approach based on its early identification is mandatory. The Sunfrail-tool (ST), a 9-item questionnaire, is a promising instrument for screening frailty. AIMS: To assess the diagnostic accuracy and the construct validity between the ST and a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), composed by six tests representative of the bio-psycho-social model of frailty; To verify the discriminating power of five key-questions of the ST; To investigate the role of the ST in a clinical-pathway of falls' prevention. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 235 patients from the Frailty-Multimorbidity Lab of the University-Hospital of Parma. The STs' answers were obtained from the patient's clinical information. A patient was considered frail if at least one of the CGAs' tests resulted positive. RESULTS: The ST was associated with the CGA's judgement with an Area Under the Curve of 0.691 (CI 95%: 0.591-0.791). Each CGA's test was associated with the ST total score. The five key-question showed a potential discriminating power in the CGA's tests of the corresponding domains. The fall-related question of the ST was significantly associated with the Short Physical Performance Battery total score (OR: 0.839, CI 95%: 0.766-0.918), a proxy of the risk of falling. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the ST can capture the complexity of frailty. The ST showed a good discriminating power, and it can guide a second-level assessment to key frailty domains and/or clinical pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The ST is a valid and easy-to-use instrument for the screening of frailty.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		154	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		319	longobucco,yari	Longobucco	Yari

280	A Novel Approach For Predicting Acute Hospitalizations Among Elderly Recipients Of Home Care? A Model Development Study.	2022	321	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104715	35168090		321	160		104715	BACKGROUND: Frail elderly are at high risk of hospitalizations and have a complex pattern of risk factors that makes it hard to foresee potential needs for additional treatment and care. Machine learning algorithms are potentially well-suited to discover hidden patterns in registrations that are routinely made across sectors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors and performance of machine learning algorithms designed to predict acute hospitalizations in elderly recipients of home care services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A development study based on a retrospective social sector cohort with 1,282 participants was designed. Included subjects were aged 65 or older and received home care services in Aalborg Municipality at least once a week from 1/1-2016 to 31/12-2017. Data were collected from a newly developed triage tool in combination with administrative and clinical data routinely collected in the Danish healthcare and social care sector. 857 predictors were tested and evaluated based on the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC). The data was divided into a 70/30 training and test split with 5-fold cross-validation. A sliding window approach combining random under-sampling with a boosting algorithm (RUSBoost) was applied with a standard logistic regression included for comparison. RESULTS: The logistic regression achieved a PR-AUC of 0.01 (CI 0.00; 0.01) while the PR-AUC was 0.71 (CI 0.56; 0.76) for the RUSBoost algorithm. Four of the five most important citizen-level features used to accurately predict an acute hospitalization was the total number of services provided by the municipality to the citizen, the number of personal care registrations as well as number of medication handlings and nutritional registrations. A final important predictor was the number of physical complaints derived from the triage tool. CONCLUSIONS: Municipalities routinely collect valuable administrative and clinical data that can be used for early prediction of acute hospitalizations. However, future studies are needed to validate the results.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		321	International Journal Of Medical Informatics		321	witt,udsen.flemming	Witt	Udsen Flemming
281	Dignity In Bodily Care At The End Of Life In A Nursing Home: An Ethnographic Study.	2022	51	10.1186/s12877-022-03244-8	35871666		23	22	1	593	BACKGROUND: Nursing homes (NHs) are populated by the frailest older people who have multiple physical or mental conditions and palliative care needs that may convey the violation of dignity. Although dignity is a commonly used concept and a core value of end-of-life care, it is assumed to be complex, ambiguous, and multivalent. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore aspects of dignity in older persons' everyday lives in a NH. DESIGN: A focused ethnographic study design. METHODS: Data consisted of 170 h of fieldwork, including observations (n = 39) with residents (n = 19) and assistant nurses (n = 22) in a Swedish NH. Interviews were undertaken with residents several times (in total, n = 35, mean 70 min/resident). To study dignity and dignity-related concerns, we used the Chochinov model of dignity to direct the deductive analysis. RESULTS: The study showed that residents suffered from illness-related concerns that inhibited their possibilities to live a dignified life at the NH. Their failing bodies were the most significant threat to their dignity, as loss of abilities was constantly progressing. Together with a fear of becoming more dependent, this caused feelings of agony, loneliness, and meaninglessness. The most dignity-conserving repertoire came from within themselves. Their self-knowledge had provided them with tools to distinguish what was still possible from what they just had to accept. Socially, the residents' dignity depended on assistant nurses' routines and behaviour. Their dignity was violated by long waiting times, lack of integrity in care, deteriorating routines, and also by distanced and sometimes harsh encounters with assistant nurses. Because the residents cherished autonomy and self-determination, while still needing much help, these circumstances placed them in a vulnerable situation. CONCLUSIONS: According to residents' narratives, important dignity-conserving abilities came from within themselves. Dignity-conserving interventions did occur, such as emphatic listening and bodily care, performed in respect for residents' preferences. However, no strategies for future crises or preparing for death were observed. To protect residents' dignity, NHs must apply a palliative care approach to provide holistic care that comprises attention to personal, bodily, social, spiritual, and psychological needs to increase well-being and prevent suffering.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		23	Bmc Geriatrics		51	holmberg,bodil	holmberg	bodil
282	Combating Coronavirus Disease-2019 Outbreak In Long-Term Care Facilities For Frail Older Adults: Preventive Measures And Palliative Care Go Hand-In-Hand.	2022	323	10.1177/08258597211039364	34459691		266	37	1	8	While the whole population is at risk from infection with the coronavirus, older people-often frail and subject to multimorbidity-are at the highest risk for the severe and fatal disease. Despite strict infection control and social distancing measures, frail adults in long-term care facilities may be at particular risk of transmission of respiratory illness. Treatment decisions are often complex attributed to the heterogeneity of this population with regards to different geriatric domains such as functional status, comorbidity, and poly-pharmacy. While measures must be taken to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading through these facilities, it is also essential that residents with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have access to the symptom management and support they want and deserve. What most nursing home residents want during the course of their illness is to be able to stay in their facilities, to be surrounded by the people they love most, and to feel relief from their physical and emotional pain. By addressing the limited access to hospice and palliative care delivery in nursing homes, we can prevent unnecessary suffering and pain from COVID-19 as well as lay the groundwork for improving care for all residents moving forward.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		266	Journal Of Palliative Care		323	cheng,hon.wai.benjamin	Cheng	Hon Wai Benjamin
283	The Syncope-Falls Index: A Tool For Predicting Risk Of Syncope And Complex Falls In The Older Adult Based On Cumulative Health Deficits.	2022	324	10.1093/qjmed/hcab141	34014303		324	115	6	367	BACKGROUND: Syncope is aetiologically diverse and associated with adverse outcomes; in older people, there is clinical overlap with complex falls presentations (i.e. recurrent, unexplained and/or injurious). AIM: To formulate an index to predict future risk of syncope and falls in the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA). DESIGN/METHODS: Using the frailty index methodology, we selected, from TILDA Wave 1 (2010), 40 deficits that might increase risk of syncope and falls. This syncope-falls index (SYFI) was applied to TILDA Wave 1 participants aged 65 and over, who were divided into three risk groups (low, intermediate and high) based on SYFI tertiles. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate, controlling for age and sex, how SYFI groups predicted incident syncope, complex falls and simple falls occurring up to Wave 4 of the study (2016). RESULTS: At Wave 1, there were 3499 participants (mean age 73, 53% women). By Wave 4, of the remaining 2907 participants, 185 (6.4%) had reported new syncope, 1077 (37.0%) complex falls and 218 (7.5%) simple falls. The risk of both syncope and complex falls increased along the SYFI groups (high risk group: odds ratio 1.88 [1.26-2.80], P = 0.002 for syncope; 2.22 [1.82-2.72], P < 0.001 for complex falls). No significant relationship was identified between SYFI and simple falls. CONCLUSION: The 6-year incidences of falls and syncope were high in this cohort. SYFI could help identify older adults at risk of syncope and complex falls, and thus facilitate early referral to specialist clinics to improve outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		324	Qjm: Monthly Journal Of The Association Of Physicians		324	fitzpatrick,n	Fitzpatrick	N
284	Revision Rate Is Higher In Patients With Periprosthetic Femur Fractures Following Revision Arthroplasty In Comparison With Orif Following Our Algorithm: A Two-Center 1 Analysis Of 129 Patients.	2022	325	10.1007/s00068-021-01832-8	34767064		325	48	3	1913	PURPOSE: Effective therapy of periprosthetic femur fractures of the hip (PPF) are challenging due to patients' frailty and complexity of fracture patterns. The aim of this cohort study was to analyze the radiological and functional outcome following PPF. METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter study in the period 2009-2019 of patients with PPF at two level I trauma centers in Germany was performed. PPF were classified according to the Vancouver classification system. Demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, type of surgery, complications, and reoperation rate were obtained from patient records. The functional outcome was assessed by the modified Harris-Hip Score (mHHS), general health using the EQ-5D, and radiological outcome by Beals & Tower (B&T) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients with a mean age of 79 years (range 43-102) were included. 70% of all patients were female and 68% of the patients had an ASA score ≥ 3. 20 patients suffered from a Vancouver A, 90 from a Vancouver B and 19 from a Vancouver C fracture. 14% of the patients died within the first 2 years after surgery. The reoperation rate after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) (n = 60) was 8% and after revision arthroplasty (RA) (n = 47) 30% (OR 3.4, 95% CI [1.21-10.2]). Mean mHHS (n = 32) was 53 ± 19.4 and EQ-VAS was 50 ± 24.6. According to B&T criteria, 82% of patients treated with ORIF (n = 17) and 62% after RA (n = 13) showed an excellent outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients with a PPF of the hip are elderly and at increased operative risk. In cases with a stable prosthesis, ORIF provides good radiological outcome with low reoperation rates. In case of RA, the risk for revision surgery is higher.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		325	European Journal Of Trauma And Emergency Surgery: Official Publication Of The European Trauma Society		325	pflüger,patrick	Pflüger	Patrick
285	Effect Of Physical Frailty On Elder Mistreatment In A National Survey: Examining Psychological Vulnerability, Housework Involvement, And Financial Independence As Mediators.	2022	326	10.1017/S1041610221000739	34127165		326	34	8	743	OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence of EM in an older Chinese population and examine the mediating role of three psychosocial variables - psychological vulnerability, housework involvement, and financial independence - in the relationship between physical frailty and EM. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: The data source was the Third Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status (SCSSW), which is a nationwide decennial survey conducted in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older who participated in SCSSW (N = 3516). MEASUREMENTS: The past-year prevalence of EM and its seven subtypes, physical frailty, psychological vulnerability, housework involvement, financial independence, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The past-year prevalence of EM was 4% among Chinese older adults, with psychological abuse being the most common subtype (3.9%). A higher level of physical frailty had a direct influence on EM. Older adults with higher levels of physical frailty were more likely to have higher levels of psychological vulnerability (anxiety, loneliness, and uselessness) and lower levels of housework involvement, which further correlated with increased risk of EM. Frail Chinese older adults were less likely to have financial independence, which in turn, surprisingly predicted a lower probability of EM. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative sample, we provided the first evidence of the prevalence of EM among Chinese older adults and expanded the global understanding of EM by examining the mediating role of three psychosocial variables. Future studies are warranted to corroborate our findings and identify factors contributing to the complex mechanism of EM.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		326	International Psychogeriatrics		326	li,yunjun	Li	Yunjun
286	Health Information Systems For Older Persons In Select Government Tertiary Hospitals And Health Centers In The Philippines: Cross-Sectional Study.	2022	327	10.2196/29541	35156927		189	24	2	e29541	BACKGROUND: The rapid aging of the world's population requires systems that support health facilities' provision of integrated care at multiple levels of the health care system. The use of health information systems (HISs) at the point of care has shown positive effects on clinical processes and patient health in several settings of care. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe HISs for older persons (OPs) in select government tertiary hospitals and health centers in the Philippines. Specifically, we aimed to review the existing policies and guidelines related to HISs for OPs in the country, determine the proportion of select government hospitals and health centers with existing health information specific for OPs, and describe the challenges related to HISs in select health facilities. METHODS: We utilized the data derived from the findings of the Focused Interventions for Frail Older Adults Research and Development Project (FITforFrail), a cross-sectional and ethics committee-approved study. A facility-based listing of services and human resources specific to geriatric patients was conducted in purposively sampled 27 tertiary government hospitals identified as geriatric centers and 16 health centers across all regions in the Philippines. We also reviewed the existing policies and guidelines related to HISs for OPs in the country. RESULTS: Based on the existing guidelines, multiple agencies were involved in the provision of services for OPs, with several records containing health information of OPs. However, there is no existing HIS specific for OPs in the country. Only 14 (52%) of the 27 hospitals and 4 (25%) of the 16 health centers conduct comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). All tertiary hospitals and health centers are able to maintain medical records of their patients, and almost all (26/27, 96%) hospitals and all (16/16, 100%) health centers have data on top causes of morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, the presence of specific disease registries varied per hospitals and health centers. Challenges to HISs include the inability to update databases due to inadequately trained personnel, use of an offline facility-based HIS, an unstable internet connection, and technical issues and nonuniform reporting of categories for age group classification. CONCLUSIONS: Current HISs for OPs are characterized by fragmentation, multiple sources, and inaccessibility. Barriers to achieving appropriate HISs for OPs include the inability to update HISs in hospitals and health centers and a lack of standardization by age group and disease classification. Thus, we recommend a 1-person, 1-record electronic medical record system for OPs and the disaggregation and analysis across demographic and socioeconomic parameters to inform policies and programs that address the complex needs of OPs. CGA as a required routine procedure for all OPs and its integration with the existing HISs in the country are also recommended.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		189	Journal Of Medical Internet Research		327	garcia,angely.p	Garcia	Angely P
287	Decisions On Antibiotic Prescribing For Suspected Urinary Tract Infections In Frail Older Adults: A Qualitative Study In Four European Countries.	2022	249	10.1093/ageing/afac134	35697352		131	51	6	None	BACKGROUND: a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common reason to prescribe antibiotics in a frail older patient. Frequently, antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily. To increase appropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through antibiotic stewardship interventions, we need to thoroughly understand the factors that contribute to these prescribing decisions. OBJECTIVES: (1) to obtain insight into factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for suspected UTIs in frail older adults. (2) To develop an overarching model integrating these factors to guide the development of antibiotic stewardship interventions for UTIs in frail older adults. METHODS: we conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 61 semi-structured interviews in older adult care settings in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. We interviewed physicians, nursing staff, patients and informal caregivers. RESULTS: participants described a chain of decisions by patients, caregivers and/or nursing staff preceding the ultimate decision to prescribe antibiotics by the physician. We identified five themes of influence: (1) the clinical situation and its complexity within the frail older patient, (2) diagnostic factors, such as asymptomatic bacteriuria, (3) knowledge (gaps) and attitude, (4) communication: interprofessional, and with patients and relatives and (5) context and organisation of care, including factors such as availability of antibiotics (over the counter), antibiotic stewardship efforts and factors concerning out-of-hours care. CONCLUSIONS: decision-making on suspected UTIs in frail older adults is a complex, multifactorial process. Due to the diverse international setting and stakeholder variety, we were able to provide a comprehensive overview of factors to guide the development of antibiotic stewardship interventions.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		249	hartman,esther.a.r	Hartman	Esther A R
288	Positive Effects On Activities Of Daily Living One Year After Receiving Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment - Results From The Randomised Controlled Study Cga-Swed.	2022	329	10.1186/s12877-022-02862-6	35240988		23	22	1	180	BACKGROUND: Today's acute hospital care is poorly adapted to the complex needs of frail older people. This exposes them to avoidable risks, such as loss of functional capacities, leading to unnecessary health and social care needs. Being frail and in need of acute hospital care often leads to higher dependence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), especially if one's needs are not acknowledged. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is one way to meet frail older people's complex needs. The study's aim was to investigate the effects on frail older people's ADL 12 months after receiving CGA. METHODS: This is a two-armed randomised controlled intervention study. Participants were frail older people (75+) who sought the emergency department and needed admission to a medical ward. The intervention was CGA performed at a geriatric management unit during the hospital stay. The CGA included comprehensive assessment of medical, functional, psychological, social, and environmental status as well as treatment, rehabilitation, discharge planning, and follow-up. Multidisciplinary teamwork and a person-centred approach were used. The control was care at an ordinary medical hospital ward. The primary outcome was change in dependence in ADL from 2 weeks before admission to the 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: At admission, 155 people participated (77 in the control, 78 in the intervention). At the 12-month follow-up, 78 participated (40 in the control, 38 in the intervention). Attrition was mainly due to mortality. Four participants in the control (5.2%) and twelve in the intervention group (15.4%) had improved in their ADL 1 year after discharge (OR = 3.32; 95% CI = 1.02-10.79). CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital CGA performed at a geriatric management unit improves frail older people's ADL. Being less dependent in ADL increases frail older people's ability to remain in their own housing, which is important for both the individual and society.

289	Clinical Decision-Making In Older Adults Following Emergency Admission To Hospital. Derivation And Validation Of A Risk Stratification Score: Opera.	2021	330	10.1371/journal.pone.0248477	33735316		187	16	3	e0248477	OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: Demographic changes alongside medical advances have resulted in older adults accounting for an increasing proportion of emergency hospital admissions. Current measures of illness severity, limited to physiological parameters, have shortcomings in this cohort, partly due to patient complexity. This study aimed to derive and validate a risk score for acutely unwell older adults which may enhance risk stratification and support clinical decision-making. METHODS: Data was collected from emergency admissions in patients ≥65 years from two UK general hospitals (April 2017- April 2018). Variables underwent regression analysis for in-hospital mortality and independent predictors were used to create a risk score. Performance was assessed on external validation. Secondary outcomes included seven-day mortality and extended hospital stay. RESULTS: Derivation (n = 8,974) and validation (n = 8,391) cohorts were analysed. The model included the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), clinical frailty scale (CFS), acute kidney injury, age, sex, and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool. For mortality, area under the curve for the model was 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.80), superior to NEWS2 0.65 (0.62-0.67) and CFS 0.76 (0.74-0.77) (P<0.0001). Risk groups predicted prolonged hospital stay: the highest risk group had an odds ratio of 9.7 (5.8-16.1) to stay >30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple validated model (Older Persons' Emergency Risk Assessment [OPERA] score) predicts in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay and could be easily integrated into electronic hospital systems, enabling automatic digital generation of risk stratification within hours of admission. Future studies may validate the OPERA score in external populations and consider an impact analysis.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		187	Plos One		330	arjan,khushal	Arjan	Khushal
290	Patient- And Provider-Level Predictors Of Survival Among Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Initiating Oral Anticancer Agents.	2022	331	10.1016/j.clgc.2022.04.010	35595633		331	20	5	e396	PURPOSE: In an era of rapid expansion of FDA approvals for oral anticancer agents (OAAs), it is important to understand the factors associated with survival among real-world populations, which include groups not well-represented in pivotal clinical trials of OAAs, such as the elderly, racial minorities, and medically complex patients. Our objective was to evaluate patient- and provider-level characteristics' associations with mortality among a multi-payer cohort of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients who initiated OAAs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the North Carolina state cancer registry linked to multi-payer claims data for the years 2004 to 2015. Provider data were obtained from North Carolina Health Professions Data System and the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System. Included patients were individuals with mRCC who initiated an OAA and survived ≥90 days after beginning treatment. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence limits (CL) using Cox hazard models for associations between patient demographics, patient clinical characteristics, provider-level factors, and 2-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The cohort included 207 patients with mRCC who received OAAs. In multivariable models, clinical variables such as frailty (HR: 1.36, 95% CL: 1.11-1.67) and de novo metastatic diagnosis (HR: 2.63, 95%CL: 1.67-4.16) were associated with higher all-cause mortality. Additionally, patients solely on Medicare had higher adjusted all-cause mortality compared with patients with any private insurance (HR: 2.35, 95% CL: 1.32-4.18). No provider-level covariates investigated were associated with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Within a real-world population of mRCC patients taking OAAs, survival differed based on patient characteristics. In an era of rapid expansion of FDA approvals for OAAs, these real-world data underscore the continued importance of access to high-quality care, particularly for medically complex patients with limited resources.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		331	Clinical Genitourinary Cancer		331	spees,lisa.p	Spees	Lisa P
291	Prevention Of Pulmonary Complications In Sedated Patients Undergoing Interventional Procedures In The Nonoperating Room Anesthesia Setting.	2022	332	10.1097/ACO.0000000000001158	35787534		332	35	4	493	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) procedures have expanded in number, variety, and complexity. NORA involves all age groups, including frail older adults and patients often considered too sick to tolerate traditional surgical interventions. Postoperative pulmonary complications are a significant source of adverse events in the perioperative setting. We present a review focused on preventing pulmonary complications in the interventional NORA setting. RECENT FINDINGS: NORA locations should function as independent, autonomous ambulatory units. We discuss a strategic plan involving a thorough preoperative evaluation of patients, including recognizing high-risk patients and their anesthetic management. Finally, we offer guidance on the challenges of conducting sedation and anesthesia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or a history of COVID-19. SUMMARY: The demands on the interventional NORA anesthesia team are increasing. Strategic planning, checklists, consistent staffing assignments, and scheduled safety drills are valuable tools to improve patient safety. In addition, through quality improvement initiatives and reporting, NORA anesthetists can achieve reductions in periprocedural pulmonary complications.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		332	Current Opinion In Anaesthesiology		332	urdaneta,felipe	Urdaneta	Felipe
292	Identifying Research Priorities In Adult Day Centers To Support Evidence-Based Care Of Vulnerable Older Adults.	2021	333	10.1353/cpr.2021.0012	33775968		333	15	1	127	Adult day centers (ADCs) are essential community resources that allow frail older adults to remain in their communities. Research demonstrates that ADC staff have the capacity to leverage their culturally and socially congruent relationships with clients and caregivers, to deliver evidence-based interventions that improve health outcomes. Yet, they remain a largely overlooked neighborhood resource for older adults with complex health care needs. The National Adult Day Services Association (NADSA) created a multistakeholder work group to identify priority areas for research to enhance the quality of services offered in ADCs and the delivery of evidence-based practices to clients. This perspective piece, which presents the workgroup's findings in the form of key research priorities, is intended as practical guide for researchers seeking to align their research questions with the needs of ADCs and those they serve. In addition to identifying areas of further exploration, we discuss current studies being undertaken within the ADC setting.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		333	Progress In Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, And Action		333	sadarangani,tina	Sadarangani	Tina
293	Diagnostic Complexity In The Older Patient: An Unusual Presentation Of Advanced Biliary Disease.	2021	335	10.1093/ageing/afab123	34146392		131	50	5	1859	Biliary disease is common in the older population, and gallbladder dysfunction and increased bile lithogenicity predispose to calculi formation. This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of gallbladder empyema. A 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer presented with hypoactive delirium. With no localising features, normal liver function tests but persistently raised inflammatory markers, he was initially managed as a urinary tract infection. Chest wall discomfort and swelling over the right costal margin later developed. Abdominal imaging demonstrated a massive gallbladder empyema invaginating through the lower right rib cage, causing the superficial swelling. Pre-morbid status prevented cholecystectomy and he was managed conservatively with percutaneous cholecystostomy and antibiotics. He was discharged to 24-h care 2 weeks after diagnosis with a long-term drain.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		335	hosty,jennifer	Hosty	Jennifer
294	The Feasibility Of Conducting Acute Sarcopenia Research In Hospitalised Older Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.	2022	336	10.1007/s41999-021-00565-6	34608617		83	13	2	463	PURPOSE: To assess feasibility of conducting acute sarcopenia research in complex populations of hospitalised older adults. METHODS: Patients ≥ 70 years old were recruited to three cohorts: elective colorectal surgery, emergency (abdominal) surgery, medical patients with infections. Participants were recruited to the elective cohort in preoperative assessment clinic, and acutely admitted participants from surgical and medical wards at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. Serial measures of muscle quantity (ultrasound quadriceps, bioelectrical impedance analysis), muscle function (hand grip strength, physical performance), and questionnaires (mini-nutritional assessment, physical function) were performed at baseline, within 7 (± 2) days of admission/surgery, and 13 (± 1) weeks post-admission/surgery. Feasibility outcomes were assessed across timepoints including recruitment and drop-out rates, and procedure completion rates. RESULTS: Eighty-one participants were recruited (mean age 79, 38.3% females). Recruitment rates were higher in elective (75%, 24/32) compared to emergency surgery (37.2%, 16/43), and medical participants (45.1%, 41/91; p = 0.003). Drop-out rates varied from 8.3 to 19.5% at 7 days, and 12.5-43.9% at 13 weeks. Age and gender did not differ between patients assessed for eligibility, approached, or recruited. Completion rates were highest for ultrasound quadriceps (98.8%, 80/81 across all groups at baseline). Gait speed completion rates were lower in medical (70.7%, 29/41) compared to elective participants (100%, 24/24) at baseline. CONCLUSION: Higher participation refusal and drop-out rates should be expected for research involving recruitment of participants from the acute setting. Assessment of muscle quantity/quality through ultrasound is recommended in early-stage trials in the acute setting, where completion rates of physical performance testing are expected to be lower.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		83	European Geriatric Medicine		336	welch,carly	Welch	Carly
295	Role Of New Drug Therapies And Innovative Procedures In Older Patients With Heart Failure: From Trials To Clinical Practice.	2022	337	10.23736/S0026-4806.22.08082-X	35332760		337	113	4	647	During earliest years, new drug-therapies and novel interventional therapies have been tested to modify the detrimental effect of secondary valve diseases, adverse ventricular remodelling and persistent fluid overload in HF patients. However, the increased prevalence of older or very old patients with HF has made their widespread implementation more problematic due to complex comorbidity, frailty, or overt disability. This growing older population, often excluded by randomized trials, but with elevated risk of hospitalization, required a different clinical and management approach that allows clinicians to take full advantage in reducing mortality and morbidity from these new pharmacological and instrumental therapies. In this perspective, the role of multidisciplinary Heart Team is mandatory for better define a correct decision-making process and tailoring the best pharmacological therapy in each patient and to program a continuum care in a post-acute phase of treatment. In addition, the possibility to plan multicentre registries of several complex cases evaluated by Heart Team could become a very important source of real world data to further refine indications and contraindications of different highly technological therapeutic approach, today based often on randomized clinical trials that do not represent faithfully the current clinical practice population.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		337	Minerva Medica		337	baldasseroni,samuele	Baldasseroni	Samuele
296	Development And Validation Of Risk Stratification Tool For Prediction Of Increased Dependence Using Preoperative Frailty After Hepatopancreatic Surgery.	2022	339	10.1016/j.surg.2022.03.021	35483992		161	172	2	683	BACKGROUND: Despite the known association between frailty and postoperative morbidity, the use of preoperative frailty in surgical practice remains limited. We sought to develop a risk tool to predict postoperative increase in functional dependence. METHODS: Patients of ≥65 years in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database who had a primary hepatopancreatic surgery between 2015 and 2019 were used to identify predictors of increased dependence and development of a simplified tool to calculate the risk stratification score for increased discharge care level (https://ktsahara.shinyapps.io/care_discharge/). RESULTS: Among 31,338 patients who underwent primary hepatopancreatic surgery, 4,259 (13.6%) had an increased level of care at discharge compared to their preadmission care. Patients with increased discharge care had a higher proportion of patients with a modified frailty index of at least 2 (n = 1496; 35.1%) compared with individuals with unchanged care (n = 6,760; 25.0%). In addition, 12.3% (n = 3,858) were discharged to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility. Of note, the odds of increased care at discharge were increased by 1.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.32-1.50), 1.11 (95% confidence interval :1.11-1.12), and 1.95 (95% confidence interval:1.86-2.04) times with every unit increase in modified frailty index, age beyond 65 years, and the number of in-hospital complications, respectively. Area under receiver operative curve for the parsimonious model used to develop the risk calculator was 0.7486 (95% confidence interval: 0.7405-0.7566) (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Approximately, 1 in 7 patients required an increased level of care at the time of discharge compared with their preadmission status. A simplified web-based risk tool can be used in clinical practice as a surgical decision aid in post-discharge planning after complex elective surgery.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		161	Surgery		339	pathak,priya	Pathak	Priya
297	Oral Bisphosphonates Are Associated With Increased Risk Of Severe Acute Kidney Injury In Elderly Patients With Complex Health Needs: A Self-Controlled Case Series In The United Kingdom.	2022	341	10.1002/jbmr.4573	35579494		341	37	7	1270	Although oral bisphosphonates (BP) are commonly used, there is conflicting evidence for their safety in the elderly. Safety concerns might trump BP use in older patients with complex health needs. Our study evaluated the safety of BP, focusing on severe acute kidney injury (AKI), gastrointestinal ulcer (GI ulcer), osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and femur fractures. We used UK primary care data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD GOLD]), linked to hospital (Hospital Episode Statistics [HES] inpatient) and ONS mortality data. We included all patients aged >65 with complex health needs and no BP use in the year before study start (January 1, 2010). Complex health needs were defined in three cohorts: an electronic frailty index score ≥3 (frailty cohort), one or more unplanned hospitalization/s (hospitalization cohort); and prescription of ≥10 different medicines in 2009 (polypharmacy cohort). Incidence rates were calculated for all outcomes. Subsequently, all individuals who experienced AKI or GI ulcer anytime during follow-up were included for Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) analyses. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated separately for AKI and GI ulcer, comparing event rates between BP-exposed and unexposed time windows. No SCCS were conducted for ONJ and femur fractures. We identified 94,364 individuals in the frailty cohort, as well as 78,184 and 95,621 persons in the hospitalization and polypharmacy cohorts. Of those, 3023, 1950, and 2992 individuals experienced AKI and 1403, 1019, and 1453 had GI ulcer/s during follow-up, respectively. Age-adjusted SCCS models found evidence of increased risk of AKI associated with BP use (frailty cohort: IRR 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.19), but no association with GI ulcers (frailty cohort: IRR 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86-1.78). Similar results were obtained for the hospitalization and polypharmacy cohorts. Our study found a 50% to 65% increased risk of AKI associated with BP use in elderly patients with complex health needs. Future studies should further investigate the risk-benefit of BP use in these patients. © 2022 The Authors.

298	Is A Tailored Strategy Using Proton Beam Radiotherapy For Reirradiation Advantageous For Elderly Women? A Case Report.	2021	343	10.1177/03008916211007930	33896256		168	107	6	NP67	BACKGROUND: The management of primary or recurrent vaginal tumours in an aging population is challenging for gynecologic and radiation oncologists. In patients unsuited for surgery and already irradiated on the pelvis, proton beam radiotherapy may be worthwhile due to its ballistic advantages. CASE REPORT: We report the case of an 80-year-old woman with a squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina after a history of pelvic radiation and vaginal brachytherapy delivered for a previous endometrial adenocarcinoma. She received proton beam radiotherapy with a complete response after 12 months and mild toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of reirradiation management in the frail and elderly population requires attention. Efforts should be focused on maintaining autonomy and quality of life in order to improve adherence and clinical compliance to the treatment. In the era of the tailored approach, hadrontherapy can play an important role to minimize toxicity, obtain good local control, and reduce the overall treatment time.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		168	Tumori		343	barcellini,amelia	Barcellini	Amelia

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Under our supervision there were 60 elderly patients with COPD gr D, who underwent Covid 19 in the last 3-6 months, were under observation. The average age was 66.3±2.1 years. Рatients of the main and control groups were prescribed complex basic therapy. However, mucolytic therapy was administered to patients in the main group using combined drug - N-acetylcysteine and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution through a 5.0 №10 nebulizer. For the treatment of astheno-neurotic disorders of postcovidal syndrome was prescribed glycine 100 mg 2 times a day for 10 days. Subsequently, Flu-Acyl broncho through a nebulizer at 5.0 No.10, and glycised was used in courses once a day for 10 days per month. Patients in the control group were prescribed acetylcysteine 200 mg 3 times a day N10. RESULTS: Results: The results of observation for 6 months showed that in patients of the main group, recurrence of the disease was not observed. whereas in patients of the control group in 6 patients (20%). CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Comprehensive treatment of elderly patients with comorbid pathology - COPD group D and postcovidal syndrome, with the additional use of nebulizer delivery of the combined drug - N-acetylcysteine and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution in combination with the sedative drug glycine, promotes improving the quality of life in patients, reducing the duration of treatment, prevents recurrence and progression of COPD.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		346	Wiadomosci Lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland: 1960)		346	potyazhenko,mаksym.m	Potyazhenko	Mаksym M
301	Percutaneous Treatment Of Concomitant Severe Aortic Stenosis And Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm.	2022	347	10.1177/15266028211038592	34384290		129	29	1	156	PURPOSE: Although rare in occurrence, symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and large thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) found in combination pose a real therapeutic challenge, especially in elderly frail patients. Surgical approaches for combined treatment are complex and at high risk of complications while staged procedures carry the risk of an unfavorable evolution of the condition temporarily left untreated. Minimally invasive approaches may therefore prove a more suitable strategy for these patients. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 78-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) and a TAAA of 7.8 cm in diameter. Transcatheter treatment of both conditions was successfully performed in a staged manner. The first intervention consisted of combined transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) immediately followed by a zone 3 thoracic endovascular aortic endoprosthesis deployment. In order to reduce the extent of intercostal arteries coverage and mitigate the risk of medullar ischemia, a second-stage percutaneous endovascular treatment of the TAAA was performed with a customized 4-fenestration prosthesis. Early and 12-month clinical and radiologic follow-up were favorable. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates how a strong multidisciplinary collaboration allows for successful resolution of complex clinical scenarios.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		129	Journal Of Endovascular Therapy: An Official Journal Of The International Society Of Endovascular Specialists		347	painchaud-bouchard,ariane-sophie	Painchaud-Bouchard	Ariane-Sophie
302	Improving Medication Adherence And Effective Prescribing Through A Patient-Centered Prescription Model In Patients With Multimorbidity.	2022	348	10.1007/s00228-021-03207-9	34448906		348	78	1	127	PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the impact of the patient-centered prescription (PCP) model in medication adherence and effective prescribing in patients with multimorbidity. METHODS: Uncontrolled before-after study in an intermediate care facility in a mixed urban-rural district. Inpatients aged ≥ 65 years with multimorbidity exposed to polypharmacy before hospital admission were consecutively enrolled. Every patient's treatment plan was analyzed through the PCP model, which includes interventions aimed at improving medication adherence. The primary endpoint was the change in the proportion of adherent patients between pre-admission and after discharge for all regularly scheduled long-term medications, using the proportion of days covered (PDC). Secondary endpoints included the change on mean PDC for all long-term medications, number of long-term medications, proportion of patients with hyperpolypharmacy, medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) score, drug burden index (DBI) score, number of potential inappropriate prescribing (PIP), and proportion of patients with ≥ 2 PIPs. RESULTS: Ninety-three non-institutionalized patients were included (mean age 83.0 ± SD 6.1 years). The proportion of adherent patients increased from 22.1 to 51.9% (P < 0.001). Intervention also improved mean PDC [mean difference (95% CI) 10.6 (7.7, 13.5)] and effective prescribing through a reduction on the number of long-term medications [- 1.3 (- 1.7, - 0.9)], proportion of patients exposed to hyperpolypharmacy (- 16.1%, P < 0.001), MRCI score [- 2.2 (- 3.4, - 1.0)], DBI score [- 0.16 (- 1.8, - 1.3)], number of PIPs [- 1.6 (- 1.8, - 1.3)], and proportion of patients with ≥ 2 PIPs (- 53.7%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Studied intervention provides significant effective prescribing and medication adherence enhancements in non-institutionalized older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		348	European Journal Of Clinical Pharmacology		348	gonzález-bueno,j	González-Bueno	J
303	A Comprehensive Urban Programme To Reduce Energy Poverty And Its Effects On Health And Wellbeing Of Citizens In Six European Countries: Study Protocol Of A Controlled Trial.	2022	349	10.1186/s12889-022-13968-2	35986259		268	22	1	1578	BACKGROUND: Nearly 11% of the European population is affected by energy poverty. Energy poverty is defined by the European Commission (2016) as the inability to afford basic energy services to guarantee a decent standard of living. Energy poverty is considered a complex, multidimensional problem that affects environment, housing, urban development, and health. Living in energy poverty conditions is associated with poorer human health and wellbeing. Hence, the WELLBASED intervention programme aims to design, implement and evaluate a comprehensive urban programme, based on the social-ecological model, to reduce energy poverty and its effects on the citizens' health and wellbeing in six European urban study sites: Valencia, Spain; Heerlen, The Netherlands; Leeds, United Kingdom; Edirne, Turkey; Obuda, Hungary, and; Jelgava, Latvia. METHODS: A controlled trial is performed. A total of 875 participants are recruited (125-177 per study site) to receive the WELLBASED intervention programme for 12 months (intervention condition) and 875 participants act as controls (control condition). Data will be collected with a baseline measurement at inclusion (T0), and follow-up measurements after 6 months (T1), 12 months (T2), and 18 months (T3). In both study arms, effects of the WELLBASED intervention programme are measured: health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), mental health, frailty in older adults, self-perceived health, chronic conditions, and care utilization. At the same time points, household expenditure on energy and energy consumption are obtained. In the intervention arm, health-monitoring data (i.e. peak flow, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate) are obtained monthly and sleep quality with a three-month interval. Household data with regard to temperature, humidity and air quality are collected near real-time by home sensors. Qualitative interviews are conducted in each study site to evaluate the impacts of the WELLBASED intervention programme and to help explain findings. DISCUSSION: The WELLBASED intervention programme will provide new insights into the effectiveness of a comprehensive urban programme to tackle energy poverty and its effects on health and wellbeing across Europe. Hence, this study can contribute to European-wide replicable solutions for policy-makers and city practitioners to alleviate energy poverty.

304	Shared Decision-Making For The Treatment Of Proximal Femoral Fractures In Frail Institutionalised Older Patients: Healthcare Providers' Perceived Barriers And Facilitators.	2022	352	10.1093/ageing/afac174	35930725		131	51	8	None	INTRODUCTION: Proximal femoral fractures are common in frail institutionalised older patients. No convincing evidence exists regarding the optimal treatment strategy for those with a limited pre-fracture life expectancy, underpinning the importance of shared decision-making (SDM). This study investigated healthcare providers' barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of SDM. METHODS: Dutch healthcare providers completed an adapted version of the Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations questionnaire to identify barriers and facilitators. If ≥20% of participants responded with 'totally disagree/disagree', items were considered barriers and, if ≥80% responded with 'agree/totally agree', items were considered facilitators. RESULTS: A total of 271 healthcare providers participated. Five barriers and 23 facilitators were identified. Barriers included the time required to both prepare for and hold SDM conversations, in addition to the reflective period required to allow patients/relatives to make their final decision, and the number of parties required to ensure optimal SDM. Facilitators were related to patients' values, wishes and satisfaction, the importance of SDM for patients/relatives and the fact that SDM is not considered complex by healthcare providers, is considered to be part of routine care and is believed to be associated with positive patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: Awareness of identified facilitators and barriers is an important step in expanding the use of SDM. Implementation strategies should be aimed at managing time constraints. High-quality evidence on outcomes of non-operative and operative management can enhance implementation of SDM to address current concerns around the outcomes.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		352	spronk,inge	Spronk	Inge
305	Hybrid Revascularization Of Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia Using Popliteal Below-Knee And Tibial Trifurcation Open Endarterectomy Distally Plus Inter-Woven Nitinol Stenting Proximally.	2022	353	10.1016/j.avsg.2021.10.056	34826576		213	80		386	OBJECTIVES: Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is frequently due to multilevel, heavily calcified lesions, and it is often associated with desert foot. Effective revascularization currently presents an additional challenge due to the increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty related to these patients. Pure endovascular treatment often fails to achieve effective and durable revascularization and it is associated with still high amputation rates. We present a novel hybrid approach and discuss its usefulness for limb salvage in complex infrainguinal lesions. METHODS: Two no-option patients for both anatomical and medical-comorbidity reasons, were treated consecutively for CLTI. Both of them had prior failed percutaneous endovascular treatment, and bypass revascularization had been ruled out. We describe the technical details of an aggressive, but still less invasive hybrid approach, consisting of open distal popliteal artery (PA) and tibial trifurcation endarterectomy plus patch angioplasty, associated with proximal endovascular treatment with inter-woven nitinol stent from the superficial femoral artery (SFA) to the endarterectomized area. RESULTS: Technical success and salvage of the affected limb were achieved in both cases, presenting significant postoperative clinical and hemodynamic improvement and allowing early discharge hospital at home. There was no surgical wound infection or other complications. CONCLUSION: This hybrid approach through a single incision is safe and effective in the short term and can be used with excellent results for CLTI in high-risk and /or no-option patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		213	Annals Of Vascular Surgery		353	domínguez,luis.j.garcía	Domínguez	Luis J García
306	Person-Centred Care Provided By A Multidisciplinary Primary Care Team To Improve Therapeutic Adequacy In Polymedicated Elderly Patients (Pcmr): Randomised Controlled Trial Protocol.	2022	354	10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051238	35140146		21	12	2	e051238	INTRODUCTION: The increase in elderly population has led to an associated increase in multiple pathologies, frailty, polypharmacy, healthcare costs, decreased quality of life and mortality. We designed an intervention based on person-centred care model. This article outlines a study protocol, which aims to explore the effects of the intervention to improve therapeutic adequacy in polymedicated elderly patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open, randomised, multicentre, controlled clinical trial. The study population includes polymedicated (≥8 prescription medications) patients ≥75 years old. In the intervention group, the multidisciplinary team (primary care pharmacist, family doctor and nurse) will meet to carry out multidimensional reviews (frailty, clinical complexity, morbidity and therapeutic adequacy) of the study subjects. If changes are proposed to the treatment plan, a clinical interview will be conducted with the patient to agree on changes in accordance with their preferences. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 6 and 12 months. In the control group, where the usual clinical practice will be followed, the necessary data will be collected to compare the results.The key variables are the variation in the mean number of incidents (potentially inappropriate prescription) per patient, the number of medications, the number of changes implemented to the treatment plan and the variation in the number of hospital admissions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the IDIAPJGol and by the University of Barcelona's Bioethics Commission. The results are expected to be published in peer reviewed open-access journals, and as part of a doctoral thesis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04188470.

307	Old Age Is Associated With Worse Treatment Outcome And Frequent Adverse Drug Reaction In Mycobacterium Avium Complex Pulmonary Disease.	2022	355	10.1186/s12890-022-02063-2	35836160		355	22	1	269	BACKGROUND: The number of patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is rapidly increasing globally, especially in the older population. However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the impact of aging on the treatment outcomes of NTM-PD. METHODS: We analyzed consecutive patients who satisfied the diagnostic criteria for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-PD and received antibiotic treatment between January 2009 and December 2020 at a tertiary referral hospital in Korea. The main outcomes were (1) long-term treatment success, defined by negative culture conversion for more than 12 months; and (2) adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between age and main outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 614 patients (median age, 65 years, interquartile range [IQR] 57-73 years; men, 35.3%) were included. Median treatment duration (530 days, IQR 290-678 days; P for trend < 0.001) and long-term treatment success (P for trend = 0.026) decreased, whereas ADRs (P for trend < 0.001) increased significantly with age. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that age ≥ 80 years was an independent factor associated with ADRs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-10.28) and worse treatment outcome (aOR 0.42; 95% CI 0.19-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Aging is associated with worse treatment outcome and frequent ADRs of patients with MAC-PD. Individualized treatment with reduced-intensity may be a reasonable alternative for older adults.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		355	Bmc Pulmonary Medicine		355	kim,joong-yub	Kim	Joong-Yub
308	Fracture Of Pubic Rami During Hip Fracture Fixation: A Rare Case Of Traction Table-Related Injury.	2022	356	10.1136/bcr-2021-246581	34980641		356	15	1	None	We present a case of an elderly and comorbid patient who was scheduled to undergo a hip fracture fixation using an intramedullary nail. Unfortunately, this was delayed by 3 weeks as the patient was unfit to undergo this procedure. She was placed onto the traction table and intraoperatively sustained a superior and inferior pubic rami fracture while attempting reduction on the traction table. Closed-reduction techniques using traction tables and perineal posts are not without morbidity. Risk factors such as osteoporosis and delayed-fixation should be accounted for when managing this complex and often frail group of patients.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		356	Bmj Case Reports		356	gomindes,austin	Gomindes	Austin

310	Total Uncertainty: A Systematic Review And Thematic Synthesis Of Experiences Of Uncertainty In Older People With Advanced Multimorbidity, Their Informal Carers And Health Professionals.	2022	358	10.1093/ageing/afac188	35977149		131	51	8	None	OBJECTIVES: uncertainty pervades the complex illness trajectories experienced by older adults with multimorbidity. Uncertainty is experienced by older people, their informal carers and professionals providing care, yet is incompletely understood. We aimed to identify and synthesise systematically the experience of uncertainty in advanced multimorbidity from patient, carer and professional perspectives. DESIGN: systematic literature review of published and grey qualitative literature from 9 databases (Prospero CRD 42021227480). PARTICIPANTS: older people with advanced multimorbidity, and informal carers/professionals providing care to this group. Exclusion criteria: early multimorbidity, insufficient focus on uncertainty. ANALYSIS: weight-of-evidence assessment was used to appraise included articles. We undertook thematic synthesis of multi-perspective experiences and response to uncertainty. RESULTS: from 4,738 unique search results, we included 44 articles relating to 40 studies. 22 focused on patient experiences of uncertainty (n = 460), 15 on carer experiences (n = 197), and 19 on health professional experiences (n = 490), with 10 exploring multiple perspectives. We identified a shared experience of 'Total Uncertainty' across five domains: 'appraising and managing multiple illnesses'; 'fragmented care and communication'; 'feeling overwhelmed'; 'uncertainty of others' and 'continual change'. Participants responded to uncertainty by either active (addressing, avoiding) or passive (accepting) means. CONCLUSIONS: the novel concept of 'Total Uncertainty' represents a step change in our understanding of illness experience in advanced multimorbidity. Patients, carers and health professionals experienced uncertainty in similar domains, suggesting a shared understanding is feasible. The domains of total uncertainty form a useful organising framework for health professionals caring for older adults with multimorbidity.		2022-10-04 23:33:10	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		131	Age And Ageing		358	etkind,simon.noah	Etkind	Simon Noah
311	986 Immunosenescence Profiles And Multiple Long-Term Conditions In Very Old Adults: The Newcastle 85+ Study.	2022	428	10.1093/ageing/afac126.039			427	51		1	Introduction Immunosenescence, a decline in immune system function, has been linked to several age-related diseases and geriatric syndromes, including cardiovascular diseases and frailty. Very old adults (aged ≥85 years) live with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) or multimorbidity—a complex phenomenon of poor health defined by either counts (≥2 diseases), indices, or patterns. However, little is known about the relationship between immunosenescence and MLTC in this age group. We utilised baseline data from the Newcastle 85+ Study to investigate the association between previously defined immunosenescence profilesa and MLTC. Method We used data from 703 participants who had multimorbidity and complete data for 16 chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes (i.e. analytic sample). MLTC counts were derived from the number of conditions and categorised into <median and ≥ median MLTC groups. We used the SPSS Two Step clustering with all 16 conditions to define MLTC patterns. Two immunosenescence profiles ('Senescent-like phenotype' and 'Less senescent-like phenotype') were defined previously from 13 lymphocyte compartments. We used multivariable regression analyses to investigate the association between immunosenescence profiles and MLTC counts, groups, and patterns. Results In the analytic sample only 6.8% participants had 2 conditions, whilst 79.1% had 3–7, and 14.1% had ≥8 conditions, a median of 5, and 62.2% were in ≥median MLTC group. Three distinct MLTC patterns emerged by clustering: 'Low cardio-cerebro-metabolic diseases' (n = 209), 'High geriatric syndromes-arthritis' (n = 240), and 'Hypertensive-renal impairment' pattern, (n = 254). Having 'Senescent-like phenotype' characterised by higher frequency of CD4 and CD8 senescence-like effector memory cells and lower CD4/CD8 ratio was not significantly associated with either MLTC counts, ≥median MLTC group, or patterns compared with 'Less senescent phenotype'. Conclusion No cross-sectional associations between immunosenescence and MLTC were found in the very old. Further studies are needed to determine whether immunosenescence drives change in MLTC counts and patterns and influences MLTC burden in late adulthood.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=158409144&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	427	Age & Ageing		428	granic,a	granic	a
312	1052 Clinical Medication Reviews And Optimisation For Inpatients Identified As Frail On The Elderly Care Wards At East Lancashire Health Trust.	2022	429	10.1093/ageing/afac126.068			427	51		1	Introduction Inpatient medication review occurs daily on our elderly wards and NICE (clinical guideline NG5) advocates using a Stopp/Start tool. Polypharmacy and tablet burden are common issues in frail patients and medications should be under regular review. Evidence of these reviews can be laborious to identify in written notes, particularly for frail patients with complex discharges. We aimed to determine whether clinical medication reviews are documented clearly at ELHT and to improve this. Method Patients with a Rockwood frailty score of ≥6 were identified and inpatient notes and charts audited for written detail of medication reviews and drug changes, then compared to the trust Stopp/Start toolkit. Cycle 1 was prior to intervention. We then delivered clinical education on medication optimisation and prompted use of 'medications review' proforma on existing trust documents. Cycle 2 occurred after this, then following changeover of junior doctors educational sessions were repeated and cycle 3 data collected. Results 82% of all patients audited had altered medications with a mean hospital stay of 8 days. On cycle 1 65% of patients with altered medications had documentation to explain medication changes, on cycle 2 this improved to 88% and 72% on cycle 3. 92% of patients had a documented medication review (even if this involved no drug changes) at cycle 1 which improved to 100% on cycle 2 and remained at 92% on cycle 3. Both before and after intervention medications were appropriately rationalised or introduced. Conclusion We were already conducting regular reviews and optimising medications for frail patients. Prior to intervention there were inconsistencies on how this was documented. Through education and proforma for documentation this greatly improved, in turn improving communication and continuation of care on discharge. We are introducing electronic records to the trust and aim to include medication reviews into this system.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=158409173&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	427	Age & Ageing		429	harborne,e	harborne	e
313	The Role Of The District Nurse In Screening And Assessment For Frailty.	2022	434	10.12968/bjcn.2022.27.5.226			60	27	5	226	An ageing population is leading to greater demands on healthcare services; investments are being made to allow complex care to be given in patient's homes by community care staff, as highlighted in the NHS Long Term Plan (2019). Frailty is often identified in secondary care when acute crisis is hit; frailty does not suddenly occur and will happen over time. This article aims to explore community screening, the assessment processes of frailty and the role the district nurse has. It also addresses how working collaboratively with the wider multidisciplinary team to earlier identify service users with frailty can assist in improving patient outcomes by empowering and supporting service users to remain at home. Recognising continual improvement to service users' care and changes in practice should be considered and disseminated. based upon best available evidence.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=156704353&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	60	British Journal of Community Nursing	1	434	horner,ruth.louise	horner	ruth.louise
314	699 Embedding A Frailty Team And Unit Into Wythenshawe Hospital'S Emergency Department.	2022	437	10.1093/ageing/afac034.699			427	51		1	Introduction Evaluation of Wythenshawe Hospital's Acute Frailty Service in January–June 2019 demonstrated slow referrals times and poor identification of frail patients due to inaccurate Clinical Frailty Scoring (CFS) at emergency department triage. This project presents the results of ongoing quality assessment of our service between June 2019–January 2021, following two quality improvement (QI) interventions. Aims: To evaluate our service's ability to deliver early identification and intervention for complex frail patients via Complex Geriatric Assessment (CGA), as set out in National and Regional Frailty standards.(1,2). -To improve and maintain better outcomes for patients accessing our frailty service. Method Intervention1 (July'19): Specialist frailty nurses relocated to ED. Dedicated frailty clinical fellows and Consultant geriatrician input 0900–1700 weekdays. Intervention2 (Sep'20): Short-stay frailty unit opened. Junior clinical fellow cover increased (0900–1900 weekdays and 0900–1700 weekends). 299 patients seen at intervals between Jun'19-Jan'21 analysed using electronic records and completed CGA proformas.

315	664 Exploring The Feasibility Of The Interrai Check-Up Form (Self-Reported) In Older People Living With Frailty In The Community.	2022	438	10.1093/ageing/afac037.664			427	51		1	Introduction Identifying the holistic needs of community dwelling older people is an essential component of clinical care. Current assessment instruments are limited by a narrow medical view and varied language use, referring to identical clinical concepts in different ways. The interRAI family of assessments have been designed to integrate health information across multiple settings. The interRAI Check-Up (Self-Reported) was designed to support the management of older adults with multi-morbidities in the community setting but has not yet been widely tested in clinical practice in the United Kingdom. Objectives To investigate the extent to which the self-reported interRAI Check-Up tool could be used to assess older patients within the NHS. Methods Patients attending two outpatient clinics were recruited to complete the interRAI Check-Up which comprised of 109 items. Time taken for tool completion and prompts needed were recorded. Patient and individual item completion rates were calculated and assessed for floor or ceiling effects. Patient views on completing the tool were collected as field notes. Clinic staff completed a questionnaire exploring their views of the tool. Thematic analysis was carried out on patient and staff data. Results From 43 patient participants, the median time for tool completion was 25 minutes. The median patient completion rate was 96.6% and item completion rate was 97.1%. Of 105 analysed items, 55 items showed a ceiling or floor effect. The tool was found to comprehensively cover holistic needs but its length and complexity of structure was found to be a barrier during busy clinical practice. Conclusion The Self-reported interRAI Check-Up tool was found to be feasible for use in the outpatient setting. Further research into which patient groups and locations would benefit most is recommended as well as how to practically implement the assessment into clinical practice within the NHS.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=156110052&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	427	Age & Ageing		438	rajpara,m.k	rajpara	m.k
316	Retirement? Other Ways Out Of The Labour Market Are Far More Worrying For Health: Results From A Matching Approach Study.	2022	439	10.1177/08982643211039637			439	34	2	221	Objective: Despite a growing body of research, the effects of retirement on health are not clear. The study explores the role played by the path out of the labour market (formal retirement vs. unemployment or family reasons), accounting for individual heterogeneity. Methods: Propensity score matching approach is employed on longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004–2015). Results: While health does not change significantly for those who formally retire, it worsens considerably for those who leave the labour market for other reasons. Moreover, health outcomes turn out to be highly heterogeneous, depending on individual socio-economic and job-related characteristics. Discussion: Leaving the labour market in one's mature years is a complex transition. Future research should focus on understanding and combating the causes of premature exit from the labour market, a relevant concern both in economic terms and on health grounds, in the light of our results.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=155957976&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	439	Journal of Aging & Health		439	pirani,elena	pirani	elena

318	Understanding Diversity In Later Life Through Images Of Old Age.	2021	447	10.1017/S0144686X20000379			447	41	10	2396	This article aims to enhance the conceptual debate on diversity in old age by exploring the interplay of diversity in later life and images of old age. We argue that the analysis of images of old age on the micro-level is a fruitful methodology in order to unravel the meaning of diversity in later life. Drawing on findings from qualitative research in Berlin, we explore how new and diverse imaginations, experiences and lifestyles of old age emerge. The conceptual focus on images of old age enables us to investigate further what diversity in later life comprises and how it simultaneously fosters the genesis of new images of old age. The manifold new images we found in our research suggest that prevalent societal discourses about old age on the macro-level are rather deceptive and represent mostly stereotypes such as 'active agers' or 'frail and dependent elders'. We offer three explanations why alternative images of old age are currently barely present in public discourse: (a) the actors transmitting images of age; (b) the institutionalisation of the images; and (c) the challenge to communicate complexity. We conclude by suggesting that images of old age are a promising starting point to explore and make visible both the diversity of social groups within the older generation as well as the heterogeneity of older individuals.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=152364571&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	447	Ageing & Society		447	enßle,friederike	enßle	friederike
319	Multiple Social Roles And Role Transference: Lessons Learned From A Chinese American Family Caregiver.	2021	450	10.1093/hsw/hlab014			450	46	3	227	The article presents a case of a caregiving life story which provides insights for social workers to better understand the complexity of caregiving in a Chinese American family. Topics discussed include an immigrant Chinese woman's social role as a her husband's and family's caregiver, local club volunteer, and in broader civil engagement, the adjustment of her mind-set and schedule, and the natural acceptance of her role. Also noted is the need for resilience in social role transitions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=151803393&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	450	Health & Social Work		450	lun,man.wai.alice	lun	man.wai.alice
320	Widowhood And Loneliness Among Chinese Older Adults: The Role Of Education And Gender.	2021	452	10.1080/13607863.2020.1732293			452	25	7	1214	Widowhood is a significant predictor of loneliness in older adults and research on the underlying mechanisms of this link using longitudinal data is limited. This study examined whether education would moderate the effect of widowhood on loneliness, and whether such a relationship would differ by gender among Chinese older adults. A total of 2,704 older adults from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey were included. They were aged 65 years and above, were not lonely, and were married. Logistic regression models were applied to examine the interaction between widowhood, education, and gender on loneliness in the 2011 wave. Widowhood was a significant predictor of loneliness and could increase the odds of becoming lonely by 193%. The interaction between widowhood and education was significant only in older women, not in older men. Literate older women reported lower loneliness than did their illiterate counterparts when they remained married during the follow-up. However, when their spouse passed away, literate women did not differ from their illiterate counterparts in loneliness. This study revealed a gendered pattern in the interaction between widowhood and education on loneliness and demonstrated the complexity of the mechanisms. Furthermore, it highlighted the importance of considering the role of education and gender simultaneously in a Chinese context.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=151062479&site=ehost-live	2022-10-04 23:34:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0	452	Aging & Mental Health		452	yang,fang	yang	fang
321	Frailty Syndrome In The Elderly: Conceptual Analysis According To Walker And Avant	2020	456	10.1590/0034-7167-2019-0601	32756800	WOS:000687195000028	456	73		nan	Objective: To analyze the concept of frailty syndrome in the literature, according to the method proposed by Walker and Avant. Methods: It is a concept analysis, guided by the method proposed by Walker and Avant, made operational through an integrative literature review. The search in a scientific database was carried out using the descriptors: Frail elderly, syndrome, phenotype, geriatric assessment, and aging. The literary corpus comprised 66 studies. Results: The study found the antecedents and attributes (categorized as physical, sociodemographic, and behavioral/environmental) that integrate the signs and symptoms evidenced in the frailty syndrome, as well as the consequences of this concept. The variables were analyzed with emphasis on the conceptions that influence the frailty process of the elderly. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the complexity arising from the multifactorial genesis of the referred syndrome, emphasizing the specificities of the elderly's frailty. However, we recommend conducting further research involving the phenomenon in question to understand the construct better.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		456	Revista Brasileira De Enfermagem	1	456	rodrigues lopes de oliveira,fabiana maria	rodrigues lopes de oliveira	fabiana maria
322	Evaluating An Undergraduate Nursing Student Telehealth Placement For Community-Dwelling Frail Older People During The Covid-19 Pandemic		461	10.1111/jocn.16208	35018676	WOS:000741287700001	461			nan	Aims and Objectives To evaluate a rapid response student telehealth placement experience implementing interRAI assessments of community-dwelling frail older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. To identify lessons to inform future telehealth clinical placements. Background New Zealand undertakes assessment of older people with disabilities using the interRAI contact assessment tool for less complex conditions and home care assessment tool for complex needs. New Zealand entered lockdown in March 2020 in response to COVID-19. New Zealand's most vulnerable community members required urgent needs assessment. Design A clinical placement whereby 3rd year undergraduate nursing students trained by interRAI-NZ educators worked remotely from home delivering telehealth assessment for 'at risk' older people across the Waikato District, New Zealand. This represented the first telehealth experience within an undergraduate nursing program approved by the New Zealand Nursing Council. Methods A case study evaluation utilising mixed method questionnaire and qualitative techniques within an interpretive paradigm. 19 third year students in the fifth semester of a Bachelor of Nursing program and 5 nursing staff members engaged in delivery of the initiative completed pre- and post-placement short answer questionnaires. Reflective diaries were maintained by students on placement. Post-placement interviews and focus group discussions provided in-depth data. COREQ guidelines informed analysis and reporting. Results Student and tutor responses showed consistent themes: tackling COVID-19; implementation requirements; nursing competencies; provider relationships; and community insights. These provide insight and highlight lessons learnt from this initiative. Conclusions Student confidence in therapeutic engagement and clinical assessment and interest in aged care was increased, confirming the viability and importance of this inaugural telehealth student placement initiative. Relevance to Clinical Practice Graduate work readiness is enhanced through telehealth placement experience and interRAI assessor training. These are recommended as core components of future nursing education programs.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		461	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	461	brownie,sharon m	brownie	sharon m
323	Accidental Fall Death In Mclean County: Examining Variables In Community-Dwelling Older Adults	2022	462	10.3928/00989134-20220506-01	35648581	WOS:000809603900001	273	48	6	26.0	Fall risk assessment is a complex phenomenon involving several risk factors, including an individual???s balance and mobility status, chronic health conditions, visual impairment, hearing deficits, environmental hazards (e.g., loose rugs, clutter), and being homebound or semi-homebound. Comprehensive fall risk assessment is the cornerstone of fall prevention in older adults throughout the community. The current study was based on secondary data and sought to examine variables associated with death due to accidental fall in a rural, midwestern county in Illinois, and to heighten awareness for consistent screening and risk assessment in older adults residing in the community. Results illustrated that among community-dwelling older adults with accidental falls, blunt injury or subdural hematoma had significantly fewer days until death than a fracture.

324	Improving Detection Of Client Complexity In The Community (Impact): A Study Protocol Of A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial	2021	464	10.3390/mps4040070	34698219	WOS:000735508100001	464	4	4	nan	Background: Community-dwelling older clients are becoming increasingly complex. Detecting this complexity in clinical practice is limited, with greater reliance on community nurses' clinical judgment and skills. The lack of a consistent approach to complexity impacts the level of care and support for older clients to remain in their homes for longer. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of the Patient Complexity Instrument (PCI) in addition to nurses' clinical judgment to enhance detection of complexity, and subsequent older clients' resource allocation compared to usual nursing assessment. Design: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial will be conducted within a community nursing service in regional Victoria, Australia. Clients 65 years and over referred to the service who are eligible for Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP) funding will be randomized into Control group: usual nursing assessment or Intervention group: usual nursing assessment plus the PCI. Nurse participants are Registered Nurses currently employed in the community nursing service. Results: This study will explore whether introducing the PCI in a community nursing service enhances detection of complexity and client care resource allocation compared to nurses' clinical judgment based on usual nursing assessment. Conclusion: This protocol outlines the study to enhance the detection of complexity by nurses delivering care for community-dwelling older people in the regional Australian context. The findings will inform the use of a standardized tool to detect complexity among community-dwelling older Australians.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		464	Methods And Protocols		464	boak,jennifer	boak	jennifer
325	Multi-Dimensional Frailty And Its Risk Factors Among Older Residents In Long-Term Care Facilities In Shanghai, China	2021	465	10.1016/j.ijnss.2021.06.003	34307778	WOS:000672297300006	465	8	3	298.0	Objectives: The integrated model of frailty shifted the physiologically-dominated view to an integrated and multidisciplinary view of frailty and adopted an integrated and holistic approach to the complex challenges facing frail older adults and their caregivers. There is an urgent need for researchers to identify multi-faceted frailty among older adults and to explore contributors to it. We assessed the level of frailty among older residents in long-term care (LTC) facilities in Shanghai, China and explored risk factors of multiple dimensions of frailty among older residents. Methods: It is a cross-sectional descriptive study. We interviewed 218 older residents from nine LTC facilities. We used Tilburg Frailty Indicator to assess older residents' physiological, psychological, and social frailty. The Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini-Mental state examination, Athens Insomnia Scale, and Activity of Daily Living (ADL) Scale were used to assess their depressive symptoms, cognitive function, sleep quality and ADL abilities, respectively. Results: Older residents have a moderate level of frailty in physiological, psychological and social domains. There is a high correlation among dimensions of frailty. Older residents' depressive symptoms have remained positively associated with their overall and each domain of frailty. Older residents' actual activity participation and exercise in LTC facilities are negatively associated with older residents' overall, physiological and social frailty. Conclusions: Frailty is a multi-dimensional concept and is prevalent among older residents in LTC facilities. It is important to take an integrated view on frailty and carry out appropriate and comprehensive interventions to prevent adverse outcomes and provide holistic care for frail older residents in LTC facilities. There is an urgent need to improve the quality and expand the number of activities offered within LTC facilities that would engage older residents in a person-centered way, despite their age, ADL abilities, frailty and functional limitations.

326	Understanding The Role And Value Of Process Quality Indicators In Older Vascular Surgery Inpatients	2021	466	10.1016/j.jss.2021.05.003	34174695	WOS:000702685500012	466	267		91.0	Background: Despite the development of geriatrics surgery process quality indicators (QIs), few studies have reported on these QIs in routine surgical practice. Even less is known about the links between these QIs and clinical outcomes, and patient characteristics. We aimed to measure geriatrics surgery process QIs, and investigate the association between process QIs and outcomes, and QIs and patient characteristics, in hospitalized older vascular surgery patients. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of 150 consecutive patients aged >= 65 years admitted to a tertiary vascular surgery unit. Occurrence of geriatrics surgery process QIs as part of routine vascular surgery care was measured. Associations between QIs and high-risk patient characteristics, and QIs and clinical outcomes were assessed using clustered heatmaps. Results: QI occurrence rate varied substantially from 2% to 93%. Some QIs, such as cognition and delirium screening, documented treatment preferences, and geriatrician consultation were infrequent and clustered with high-risk patient characteristcs. There were two major process-outcome clusters: (a) multidisciplinary consultations, communication and screening-based process QIs with multiple adverse outcomes, and (b) documentation and prescribing-related QIs with fewer adverse outcomes. Conclusions: Clustering patterns of process QIs with clinical outcomes are complex, and there is a differential occurrence of QIs by patient characteristics. Prospective intervention studies that report on implemented QIs, outcomes and patient characteristics are needed to better understand the causal pathways between process QIs and outcomes, and to help prioritize targets for quality improvement in the care of older surgical patients.

327	Body Care Of Older People In Different Institutionalized Settings: A Systematic Mapping Review Of International Nursing Research From A Scandinavian Perspective		469	10.1111/nin.12503	35666581	WOS:000806383500001	469			nan	Body care is considered a key aspect of nursing and imperative for the health, wellbeing, and dignity of older people. In Scandinavian countries, body care as a professional practice has undergone considerable changes, bringing new understandings, values, and dilemmas into nursing. A systematic mapping review was conducted with the aims of identifying and mapping international nursing research on body care of older people in different institutionalized settings in the healthcare system and to critically discuss the dominant assumptions within the research by adapting a problematization approach. Most identified papers reported on empirical research with a biomedical approach focusing on outcome and effectiveness. Conceptual papers, papers with a focus on the perspectives of the older people, or contextual and material aspects were lacking. The research field is dominated by four dominant assumptions: Body care as an evidence-based practice, body care as a relational ethical practice, the body as a body-object and a body-subject, the objects in the body care practices as nonrelational materialities. Given the complexities of professional body care practices, there is a need for other research designs and theoretical perspectives within nursing that expand our understanding of body care taking into consideration the multiple social and material realities.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		469	Nursing Inquiry	1	469	rosendal,kirstine a	rosendal	kirstine a
328	Clinical Practice Guideline For Postoperative Rehabilitation In Older Patients With Hip Fractures	2021	470	10.5535/arm.21110	34233406	WOS:000669736700009	470	45	3	225.0	Objective The incidence of hip fractures is increasing worldwide with the aging population, causing a challenge to healthcare systems due to the associated morbidities and high risk of mortality. After hip fractures in frail geriatric patients, existing comorbidities worsen and new complications are prone to occur. Comprehensive rehabilitation is essential for promoting physical function recovery and minimizing complications, which can be achieved through a multidisciplinary approach. Recommendations are required to assist healthcare providers in making decisions on rehabilitation post-surgery. Clinical practice guidelines regarding rehabilitation (physical and occupational therapies) and management of comorbidities/complications in the postoperative phase of hip fractures have not been developed. This guideline aimed to provide evidence-based recommendations for various treatment items required for proper recovery after hip fracture surgeries. Methods Reflecting the complex perspectives associated with rehabilitation post-hip surgeries, 15 key questions (KQs) reflecting the complex perspectives associated with post-hip surgery rehabilitation were categorized into four areas: multidisciplinary, rehabilitation, community-care, and comorbidities/complications. Relevant literature from four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and KoreaMed) was searched for articles published up to February 2020. The evidence level and recommended grade were determined according to the grade of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation method. Results A multidisciplinary approach, progressive resistance exercises, and balance training are strongly recommended. Early ambulation, weigh-bearing exercises, activities of daily living training, community-level rehabilitation, management of comorbidities/complication prevention, and nutritional support were also suggested. This multidisciplinary approach reduced the total healthcare cost. Conclusion This guideline presents comprehensive recommendations for the rehabilitation of adult patients after hip fracture surgery.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		470	Annals Of Rehabilitation Medicine-Arm		470	min,kyunghoon	min	kyunghoon
329	A Study To Introduce National Early Warning Scores (News) In Care Homes: Influence On Decision-Making And Referral Processes	2022	475	10.1002/nop2.1091	34780677	WOS:000718463100001	475	9	1	519.0	Aim: Early warning scores are commonly used in hospital settings, but little is known about their use in care homes. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of National Early Warning Scores alongside other measures in this setting. Design: Convergent parallel design. Methods: Quantitative data from 276 care home residents from four care homes were used to analyse the relationship between National Early Warning Scores score, resident outcome and functional daily living (Barthel ADL (Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living)) and Rockwood (frailty). Interviews with care home staff (N = 13) and care practitioners (N = 4) were used to provide qualitative data. Results: A statistically significant link between National Early Warning Scores (p = .000) and Barthel ADL (p = .013) score and hospital admissions was found, while links with Rockwood were insignificant (p = .551). Care home staff reported many benefits of National Early Warning Scores, including improved communication, improved decision-making and role empowerment. Although useful, due to the complexity of the resident population's existing health conditions, National Early Warning Scores alone could not act as a diagnostic tool.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		475	Nursing Open	1	475	hodgson,philip	hodgson	philip
330	Frailty, Quality Of Life, And Loneliness Of Aging In Native And Diasporic Chinese Adults		483	10.14283/jfa.2022.27		WOS:000779024000001	483			nan	BACKGROUND: Global migration has increased in the past century, and aging in a foreign country is relevant to the Chinese diaspora. OBJECTIVE: With regard to migration, this study focuses on the places of aging as the context of older Chinese adults. This study aimed to describe the general health and wellbeing of this population with respect to their location. DESIGN: This study has a cross sectional design. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited who were aging in place from Tianjin, China (199 participants), and aging out of place from the Netherlands (134 participants). Data from April to May 2019 in China and November 2018 to March 2019 in the Netherlands were aggregated. MEASUREMENTS: frailty, QoL and loneliness were used in both samples. RESULTS: T-tests and regression analyses demonstrated that social domains of frailty and QoL, as well as loneliness and frailty prevalence characterized the major differences between both places of aging. A correlation analysis and visual correlation network revealed that frailty, quality of life (QoL), and loneliness were more closely related in the aging out of place sample. Social domains of frailty and QoL, as well as the prevalence of loneliness and frailty, characterized the major differences between both places of aging. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that frailty, QoL, and loneliness have a complex relationship, confirming that loneliness is a major detriment to the general wellbeing of older Chinese adults aging out of place. This study examined the places of aging of the larger Chinese population and allows a comprehensive understanding of health and wellbeing. The social components, especially loneliness, among the aging out of place Chinese community should receive more attention practice and clinical wise. On the other hand, frailty as well as its prevention is of more importance for the Chinese community aging in place.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		483	Journal Of Frailty & Aging		483	cheung,s l	cheung	s l
331	Nutritional Status According To The Short-Form Mini Nutritional Assessment (Mna-Sf) And Clinical Characteristics As Predictors Of Length Of Stay, Mortality, And Readmissions Among Older Inpatients In China: A National Study	2022	484	10.3389/fnut.2022.815578	35145987	WOS:000752621800001	484	9		nan	BackgroundStudies are scarce in China that explore the association of nutritional status, measured using the Short-Form Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF) and biochemical data, on adverse clinical outcomes among older inpatients. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in tertiary hospitals of China and the associations between malnutrition and adverse clinical outcomes. MethodsThis prospective study involved 5,516 older inpatients (mean age 72.47 +/- 5.77 years) hospitalized in tertiary hospitals between October 2018 and February 2019. The tertiary hospitals refer to the hospital with more than 500 beds and can provide complex medical care services. The MNA-SF was used to assess nutritional status. Multiple logistic regression and negative binomial regression were used to analyze the relationship between nutritional parameters and risk of hospital length of stay (LoS), mortality, and rehospitalization. ResultsWe found that 46.19% of hospitalized patients had malnutrition or malnutrition risk, according to the MNA-SF. Death occurred in 3.45% of patients. MNA-SF scores 0-7 (odds ratio [OR] 5.738, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.473 to 9.48) were associated with a six-fold higher likelihood of death, and scores 8-11 (OR 3.283, 95% CI 2.126-5.069) with a three-fold higher likelihood of death, compared with MNA-SF scores 12-14 in the logistic regression model, after adjusting for potential confounders. A low MNA-SF score of 0-7 (regression coefficient 0.2807, 95% CI 0.0294-0.5320; P < 0.05) and a score of 8-11 (0.2574, 95% CI 0.0863-0.4285; P < 0.01) was associated with a significantly higher (28.07 and 25.74%, respectively) likelihood of increased LoS, compared with MNA-SF score 12-14. MNA-SF scores 0-7 (OR 1.393, 95% CI 1.052-1.843) and 8-11 (OR 1.356, 95% CI 1.124-1.636) were associated with a nearly 1.5-fold higher likelihood of 90-day readmission compared with MNA-SF scores 12-14 in the logistic regression model. Moreover, hemoglobin level, female sex, education level, former smoking, BMI 24-27.9 kg/m(2), age 75 years and above, and current alcohol consumption were the main factors influencing clinical outcomes in this population. ConclusionsMalnutrition increases the risk of hospital LoS, mortality, and 90-day readmission. The use of nutritional assessment tools in all hospitalized patients in China is needed. The MNA-SF combined with hemoglobin level may be used to identify older inpatients with a high risk of adverse clinical outcomes. These findings may have important implications for the planning of hospital services.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		484	Frontiers In Nutrition		484	liu,hongpeng	liu	hongpeng
332	Learning In Nursing Home Placement: A Phenomenological Study Of Student Nurses' Lived Experience		486	10.1111/jocn.16262	35187755	WOS:000758913400001	461			nan	Aim: To explore first-year student nurses' lived experience of learning in clinical placement in nursing homes. Background: Nursing homes traditionally represent students' first clinical placement sites during nurse education, and nursing home residents' care needs can provide opportunities for student nurses to acquire both fundamental and specialised nursing skills. In clinical placements, students have opportunities to apply and integrate theoretical knowledge, practical skills and ethical competence in a clinical setting. Design: A qualitative design with a hermeneutic phenomenological approach was employed and reported in accordance with the COREQ guidelines. Methods: The study was undertaken at three nursing homes affiliated with one Norwegian university. Close observation (173 h) and in-depth individual interviews (n = 7) with first-year student nurses were conducted to explore their lived experience of learning. Data analysis was guided by van Manen's hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Results: The essential meaning of the phenomenon of learning in clinical placements in a nursing home setting is characterised by four themes: (1) navigating a new and complex learning context, (2) being emotionally affected when facing sickness and frailty, (3) having a vital need for support and guidance and (4) being engaged in learning. Conclusions: The findings are discussed against the backdrop of educational learning theory. Learning in clinical placements in nursing homes is a multi-faceted and complex phenomenon related to the students' lived experience on the contextual, relational and individual levels. Overall, our findings demonstrate that learning in clinical placements is part of the process of professional identity development. Relevance to clinical practice: The clinical practice arena should emphasise emotional support for student nurses, enhance their self-directed reflection and explicitly focus on the essence of nursing in nursing homes.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		461	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	486	dalsmo,ingrid espegren	dalsmo	ingrid espegren
333	The Association Of Service Use And Other Client Factors With The Time To Transition From Home Care To Facility-Based Care	2022	488	10.1016/j.jamda.2021.06.027	34293327	WOS:000744181200023	128	23	1	133.0	Objectives: People are living longer with complex health needs and wish to remain in their homes as their care needs change. We examined which client factors (sociodemographic, health service use, health, and function) influenced older persons' (>= 65 years) time to transition from home living to assisted living (AL) or long-term care (LTC) facilities. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants: Long-term services and supports in Alberta, Canada. Long-stay home care clients (>= 65 years) who received a Resident Assessment InstrumenteHome Care (RAI-HC) assessment between 2014 and 2018. Measures: We assessed time from initial receipt of long-term home care to AL and LTC facility transitions, using Cox proportional hazard regressions, and a provincial continuing care data repository (Alberta Continuing Care Information System). We adjusted for client sociodemographic, health, function, and health service use variables. The outcome was time from initial long-term home care receipt to transition to facility living. Results: We included 33,432 home care clients. Clients who were visited by care aides once in the last 7 days transitioned to AL later than those with no care aide visits [hazard ratio (HR) 0.976, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.852, 0.964]. Clients receiving physical therapy services once or more a week transitioned to LTC later than those who did not receive these services (HR 0.767, CI 0.672, 0.875). Institutionalizations happened sooner if the client's caregiver was unable to continue (AL: HR 1.335, CI 1.306, 1.365; LTC: HR 1.339, CI 1.245, 1.441) and if clients socialized less (AL: HR 1.149, CI 1.079, 1.223; LTC: HR 1.087, CI 1.018, 1.61). Conclusions and Implications: The diverse role of care aides needs to be explored to determine which specific services help to delay AL transitions. Physical therapy exercises that require minimal supervision should be integrated early into care plans to delay LTC transitions. Social/recreational programs to improve older adults' socialization and informal caregiver support could delay transitions.

However, there is limited research exploring the causal relationships between depression and its associated factors in the geriatric population, particularly in Thailand. We aimed to evaluate the direction of these complex relationships in the Thai population. A cross-sectional design was conducted on 312 Thai community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or above who registered for primary care services. The participants were recruited from July 2019 to January 2020, and they responded to standard assessments. The relationships between pain, the number of medications, frailty, locomotive syndrome, and depressive symptoms were investigated using path analysis. The results showed that most participants were women and had multiple diseases, mild pain, frailty, and grade I-II locomotive syndrome. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 16%. The model showed significant positive direct and indirect paths from locomotive syndrome to depressive symptoms (beta = 0.296, p < 0.01; beta = 0.099, p < 0.01, respectively). There was a significant positive direct path from frailty to depressive symptoms (beta = 0.219, p < 0.01) and a significant positive indirect path from pain to depressive symptoms (beta = 0.096, p < 0.01).		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		489	Geriatrics		489	roopsawang,inthira	roopsawang	inthira
335	Intravox: A Personalized Human Voice To Support Users With Complex Needs In Smart Homes	2021	490	10.1007/978-3-030-85623-6_15		WOS:000697567500015	490	12932		223.0	We present IntraVox, a novel voice-based interaction system that supports users with complex needs by introducing a highly personalized, human voice command between smart home devices and sensors. Voice-enabled personal assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) can be used to control smart home devices and increase the quality of life. However, people suffering from conditions such as dementia or learning disabilities and autism (LDA) can encounter verbal and memory problems in communicating with the assistants. IntraVox supports these users by verbally sending smart home control commands, based on the sensor data collected, to a voice-enabled personal assistant using a human voice. Over 12 months, we conducted 7 workshops and 9 interviews with 79 participants from multiple stakeholder categories - people with LDA, older and frail people, social and health care organisations. Results show that our solution has the potential to support people with complex needs and increase independence. Moreover, IntraVox could have the added value of reinforcing the learning of specific commands and making visible the inner workings of a home automation system, by giving users a clear cause-and-effect explanation of why certain events occur.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		490	Human-Computer Interaction, Interact 2021, Pt I		490	salai,ana-maria	salai	ana-maria
336	The Multiscale Dynamics Of Beat-To-Beat Blood Pressure Fluctuation Mediated The Relationship Between Frailty And Arterial Stiffness In Older Adults		491	10.1093/gerona/glac035	35143675	WOS:000784541900001	491			nan	Background Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) is an important cardiovascular output and regulated by neurophysiological elements over multiple temporal scales. The multiscale dynamics of beat-to-beat BP fluctuation can be characterized by BP complexity and has been linked to age-related adverse health outcomes. We here aimed to examine whether BP complexity mediates the association between arterial stiffness and frailty. Method This cross-sectional study was completed between January and October 2021. A total of 350 older adults completed assessments for frailty, arterial stiffness (ie, average brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity), and beat-to-beat finger BP. The complexity of beat-to-beat systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) BP series was measured using multiscale entropy. The relationships between frailty, BP complexity, and arterial stiffness were examined using analysis of variance and linear regression models. The effects of BP complexity on the association between arterial stiffness and frailty were examined using mediation analyses. Results Compared with non-frail, prefrail, and frail groups had significantly elevated lower SBP and DBP complexity (F > 11, p < .001) and greater arterial stiffness (F = 16, p < .001). Greater arterial stiffness was associated with lower BP complexity (beta < -0.42, p < .001). Beat-to-beat SBP and DBP complexity mediated the association between arterial stiffness and frailty (indirect effects >0.28), accounting for at least 47% of its total effects on frailty (mediated proportion: SBP: 50%, DBP: 47%). Conclusion This study demonstrates the association between BP complexity and frailty in older adults, and BP complexity mediates the association between arterial stiffness and frailty, suggesting that this metric would serve as a marker to help characterize important functions in the older adults.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		491	Journals Of Gerontology Series A-Biological Sciences And Medical Sciences		491	jiang,xin	jiang	xin
337	Predictors Of Improvement In Urinary Incontinence In The Postacute Setting: A Canadian Cohort Study		493	10.1002/nau.25018	36040456	WOS:000847417100001	493			nan	Purpose To determine factors associated with improvement in urinary incontinence (UI) for long-stay postacute, complex continuing care (CCC) patients. Design A retrospective cohort investigation of patients in a CCC setting using data obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's Continuing Care Reporting System collected with interRAI Minimum Data Set 2.0. Setting and participants Individuals aged 18 years and older, were admitted to CCC hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between 2010 and 2018. Methods Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the independent effects of predictors on UI improvement, for patients who were somewhat or completely incontinent on admission and therefore had the potential for improvement. Results The study cohort consisted of 18 584 patients, 74% (13 779) of which were somewhat or completely incontinent upon admission. Among those patients with potential for improvement, receiving bladder training, starting a new medication 90 days prior (odds ratio, OR: 1.54 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.36-1.75]), and triggering the interRAI Urinary Incontinence Clinical Assessment Protocol to facilitate improvement (OR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.08-1.71]) or to prevent decline (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.13-1.53]) were the strongest predictors of improvement. Conversely, being totally dependent on others for transfer (OR: 0.62 [95% CI: 0.42-0.92]), is rarely or never understood (OR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.50-0.85]), having a major comorbidity count of >= 3 (OR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.59-0.88]), Parkinson's disease, OR: 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62-0.95), Alzheimer/other dementia, OR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74-0.93), and respiratory infections, OR: 0.57 (95% CI: 0.39-0.85) independently predicted less likelihood of improvement in UI. Conclusions and Implications Findings of this study suggest that improving physical function, including bed mobility, and providing bladder retraining have strong positive impacts on improvement in UI for postacute care patients. Evidence generated from this study provides useful care planning information for care providers in identifying patients and targeting the care that may lead to better success with the management of UI.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		493	Neurourology And Urodynamics		493	egbujie,bonaventure a	egbujie	bonaventure a
338	The Development And Effectiveness Of A Web-Based Emergency Management Educational Program For Long-Term Care Facility Interprofessional Practitioners	2021	494	10.3390/ijerph182312671	34886397	WOS:000734817700001	15	18	23	nan	Long-term care facility (LTCF) interprofessional practitioners who care for residents at high risk of emergencies due to old age, frailty, and complex diseases must be able to manage such emergencies collaboratively. A shared mental model (SMM) enhances performance toward a common goal by allowing effective collaboration through promoting the sharing of knowledge and skills among interprofessional team members. Therefore, this study developed a web-based educational program for LTCF interprofessional practitioners based on an SMM. We followed a network-based instructional system design that consists of analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation for developing the program. A total of 54 participants completed the educational program in four LTCFs in South Korea. A significant improvement was identified in communication knowledge, communication confidence, role recognition, transactive memory system, and team effectiveness in the experimental group. The results show that the program improved the emergency management process and reliability among interprofessional practitioners, positively impacting interprofessional collaboration and ensuring the safety of patients during emergencies in LTCFs.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		15	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		494	choi,young-rim	choi	young-rim
339	The Covid-19 Pandemic: Challenges In Providing Supportive Care To Those With Cardiovascular Disease In A Time Of Plague	2021	499	10.1097/SPC.0000000000000552	33843761	WOS:000662243900012	104	15	2	147.0	Purpose of review COVID-19 has permeated the very essence of human existence and society and disrupted healthcare systems. The attrition stemming from this highly contagious disease particularly affects those rendered vulnerable by age and infirmity, including those with underlying cardiovascular disease. This article critically reviews how best to integrate supportive care into the management of those affected. Recent findings Numerous studies have described the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including that specifically arising in those with cardiovascular disease. Potential treatment strategies have emerged but there is limited guidance on the provision of palliative care. A framework for implementation of this service needs to be developed, perhaps involving the training of non-specialists to deliver primary palliative care in the community, bolstered by the use of telemedicine. The appropriate use of limited clinical resources has engendered many challenging discussions and complex ethical decisions. Prospective implementation of future policies requires the incorporation of measures to assuage moral distress, burnout and compassion fatigue in healthcare staff who are psychologically and physically exhausted. Further research based on patient-centred decision making and advance care planning is required to ensure the supportive needs of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease are adequately met. This research should focus on interventions applicable to daily healthcare practice and include strategies to safeguard staff well-being.		2022-10-04 23:35:26	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls		104	Current Opinion In Supportive And Palliative Care		499	hill,loreena	hill	loreena
