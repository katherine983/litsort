        <ab>Introduction Proximal femoral fractures are common in frail institutionalised older patients. No convincing evidence exists regarding the optimal treatment strategy for those with a limited pre-fracture life expectancy, underpinning the importance of shared decision-making (SDM). This study investigated healthcare providers' barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of SDM. Methods Dutch healthcare providers completed an adapted version of the Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations questionnaire to identify barriers and facilitators. If ≥20% of participants responded with 'totally disagree/disagree', items were considered barriers and, if ≥80% responded with 'agree/totally agree', items were considered facilitators. Results A total of 271 healthcare providers participated. Five barriers and 23 facilitators were identified. Barriers included the time required to both prepare for and hold SDM conversations, in addition to the reflective period required to allow patients/relatives to make their final decision, and the number of parties required to ensure optimal SDM. Facilitators were related to patients' values, wishes and satisfaction, the importance of SDM for patients/relatives and the fact that SDM is not considered complex by healthcare providers, is considered to be part of routine care and is believed to be associated with positive patient outcomes. Conclusion Awareness of identified facilitators and barriers is an important step in expanding the use of SDM. Implementation strategies should be aimed at managing time constraints. High-quality evidence on outcomes of non-operative and operative management can enhance implementation of SDM to address current concerns around the outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction Immunosenescence, a decline in immune system function, has been linked to several age-related diseases and geriatric syndromes, including cardiovascular diseases and frailty. Very old adults (aged ≥85 years) live with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) or multimorbidity—a complex phenomenon of poor health defined by either counts (≥2 diseases), indices, or patterns. However, little is known about the relationship between immunosenescence and MLTC in this age group. We utilised baseline data from the Newcastle 85+ Study to investigate the association between previously defined immunosenescence profilesa and MLTC. Method We used data from 703 participants who had multimorbidity and complete data for 16 chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes (i.e. analytic sample). MLTC counts were derived from the number of conditions and categorised into &lt;median and ≥ median MLTC groups. We used the SPSS Two Step clustering with all 16 conditions to define MLTC patterns. Two immunosenescence profiles ('Senescent-like phenotype' and 'Less senescent-like phenotype') were defined previously from 13 lymphocyte compartments. We used multivariable regression analyses to investigate the association between immunosenescence profiles and MLTC counts, groups, and patterns. Results In the analytic sample only 6.8% participants had 2 conditions, whilst 79.1% had 3–7, and 14.1% had ≥8 conditions, a median of 5, and 62.2% were in ≥median MLTC group. Three distinct MLTC patterns emerged by clustering: 'Low cardio-cerebro-metabolic diseases' (n = 209), 'High geriatric syndromes-arthritis' (n = 240), and 'Hypertensive-renal impairment' pattern, (n = 254). Having 'Senescent-like phenotype' characterised by higher frequency of CD4 and CD8 senescence-like effector memory cells and lower CD4/CD8 ratio was not significantly associated with either MLTC counts, ≥median MLTC group, or patterns compared with 'Less senescent phenotype'. Conclusion No cross-sectional associations between immunosenescence and MLTC were found in the very old. Further studies are needed to determine whether immunosenescence drives change in MLTC counts and patterns and influences MLTC burden in late adulthood.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction Inpatient medication review occurs daily on our elderly wards and NICE (clinical guideline NG5) advocates using a Stopp/Start tool. Polypharmacy and tablet burden are common issues in frail patients and medications should be under regular review. Evidence of these reviews can be laborious to identify in written notes, particularly for frail patients with complex discharges. We aimed to determine whether clinical medication reviews are documented clearly at ELHT and to improve this. Method Patients with a Rockwood frailty score of ≥6 were identified and inpatient notes and charts audited for written detail of medication reviews and drug changes, then compared to the trust Stopp/Start toolkit. Cycle 1 was prior to intervention. We then delivered clinical education on medication optimisation and prompted use of 'medications review' proforma on existing trust documents. Cycle 2 occurred after this, then following changeover of junior doctors educational sessions were repeated and cycle 3 data collected. Results 82% of all patients audited had altered medications with a mean hospital stay of 8 days. On cycle 1 65% of patients with altered medications had documentation to explain medication changes, on cycle 2 this improved to 88% and 72% on cycle 3. 92% of patients had a documented medication review (even if this involved no drug changes) at cycle 1 which improved to 100% on cycle 2 and remained at 92% on cycle 3. Both before and after intervention medications were appropriately rationalised or introduced. Conclusion We were already conducting regular reviews and optimising medications for frail patients. Prior to intervention there were inconsistencies on how this was documented. Through education and proforma for documentation this greatly improved, in turn improving communication and continuation of care on discharge. We are introducing electronic records to the trust and aim to include medication reviews into this system.</ab>

        <ab>Background a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common reason to prescribe antibiotics in a frail older patient. Frequently, antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily. To increase appropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through antibiotic stewardship interventions, we need to thoroughly understand the factors that contribute to these prescribing decisions. Objectives (1) to obtain insight into factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for suspected UTIs in frail older adults. (2) To develop an overarching model integrating these factors to guide the development of antibiotic stewardship interventions for UTIs in frail older adults. Methods we conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 61 semi-structured interviews in older adult care settings in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. We interviewed physicians, nursing staff, patients and informal caregivers. Results participants described a chain of decisions by patients, caregivers and/or nursing staff preceding the ultimate decision to prescribe antibiotics by the physician. We identified five themes of influence: (1) the clinical situation and its complexity within the frail older patient, (2) diagnostic factors, such as asymptomatic bacteriuria, (3) knowledge (gaps) and attitude, (4) communication: interprofessional, and with patients and relatives and (5) context and organisation of care, including factors such as availability of antibiotics (over the counter), antibiotic stewardship efforts and factors concerning out-of-hours care. Conclusions decision-making on suspected UTIs in frail older adults is a complex, multifactorial process. Due to the diverse international setting and stakeholder variety, we were able to provide a comprehensive overview of factors to guide the development of antibiotic stewardship interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background In older patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the choice between kidney transplantation (KT) and dialysis may be more complex than in younger patients because of a higher prevalence of comorbidities and frailty. This study aims to provide greater insight into the current decision-making process by exploring the expectations, experiences and health outcome priorities of all stakeholders. Methods We performed semi-structured interviews with patients ≥65 years with ESKD (eGFR &lt;15 ml/min/1.73m2, KT recipient or treated with dialysis), patients' relatives and healthcare professionals (nephrologists, nurses and medical social workers). Interviews were conducted until data saturation and thematically analysed. Results We performed 36 interviews (patients n  = 18, relatives n  = 5, healthcare professionals n  = 13). Thematic analysis revealed five themes. Older patients' health outcome priorities were mostly related to quality of life (QOL). Individual older patients showed marked differences in the preferred level of engagement during the decision-making process (varying from 'wants to be in the lead' to 'follows the nephrologist') and in informational needs (varying from evidence-based to experience-based). On the contrary, healthcare professionals were quite unanimous on all aspects. They focused on determining eligibility for KT as start of the decision-making process, on clear and extensive information provision and on classical, medical outcomes. Conclusions The decision-making process could benefit from early identification of older patients' values, needs and health outcome priorities, in parallel with assessment of KT eligibility and before discussing the treatment options, and the explicit use of this information in further steps of the decision-making process.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Aging is a complex biological process and associated with a progressive decline in functions of most organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Age‐related GI motor disorders/dysfunctions include esophageal reflux, dysphagia, constipation, fecal incontinence, reduced compliance, and accommodation. Although the incidence and severity of these diseases and conditions increase with age, they are often underestimated due in part to nonspecific and variable symptoms and lack of sufficient medical attention. They negatively affect quality of life and predispose the elderly to other diseases, sarcopenia, and frailty. The mechanisms underlying aging‐associated GI dysfunctions remain unclear, and there is limited data examining the effect of aging on GI motor functions. Many studies on aging‐associated changes to cells within the tunica muscularis including enteric neurons, smooth muscles, and interstitial cells have proposed that cell loss and/or molecular changes may be involved in the pathogenesis of age‐related GI motor disorders/dysfunctions. There is also evidence that the aging contributes to phenotypic changes in innate immune cells, which are physically and functionally linked to other cells in the tunica muscularis and can alter GI (patho) physiology. However, various patterns of changes have been reported, some of which are contradictory, indicating a need for additional work in this area. Purpose: Although GI infection due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bleeding, and cancers are also important and common problems in the elderly patients, this mini‐review focuses on data obtained from enteric neuromuscular aging research with the goal of better understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of enteric neuromuscular aging to enhance future therapy.</ab>

        <ab>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) usually provide the best evidence for treatments and management. Historically, older people have often been excluded from clinical medication trials due to age, multimorbidity and disabilities. The situation is improving, but still the external validity of many trials may be questioned. Individuals participating in trials are generally less complex than many patients seen in geriatric clinics. Recruitment and retention of older participants are particular challenges in clinical trials. Multiple channels are needed for successful recruitment, and especially individuals experiencing frailty, multimorbidity and disabilities require support to participate. Cognitive decline is common, and often proxies are needed to sign informed consent forms. Older people may fall ill or become tired during the trial, and therefore, special support and empathic study personnel are necessary for the successful retention of participants. Besides the risk of participants dropping out, several other pitfalls may result in underestimating or overestimating the intervention effects. In nonpharmacological trials, imperfect blinding is often unavoidable. Interventions must be designed intensively and be long enough to reveal differences between the intervention and control groups, as control participants must still receive the best normal care available. Outcome measures should be relevant to older people, sensitive to change and targeted to the specific population in the trial. Missing values in measurements are common and should be accounted for when designing the trial. Despite the obstacles, RCTs in geriatrics must be promoted. Reliable evidence is needed for the successful treatment, management and care of older people.</ab>

        <ab>An ageing population is leading to greater demands on healthcare services; investments are being made to allow complex care to be given in patient's homes by community care staff, as highlighted in the NHS Long Term Plan (2019). Frailty is often identified in secondary care when acute crisis is hit; frailty does not suddenly occur and will happen over time. This article aims to explore community screening, the assessment processes of frailty and the role the district nurse has. It also addresses how working collaboratively with the wider multidisciplinary team to earlier identify service users with frailty can assist in improving patient outcomes by empowering and supporting service users to remain at home. Recognising continual improvement to service users' care and changes in practice should be considered and disseminated. based upon best available evidence.</ab>

        <ab>International evidence indicates that older people with frailty are more likely to access social care services, compared to nonfrail older people. There is, however, no robust evidence on costs of social care provided for community‐dwelling older people living with frailty in their own homes. The main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between community‐dwelling older people living with frailty, defined using the cumulative deficit model, and annual formal social care costs for the 2012–2018 period. A secondary objective was to estimate formal social care spending for every 1% reduction in the number of older people who develop frailty over 1 year. Secondary analysis of prospective cohort data from two large nationally representative community‐based cohort studies in England was performed. Respondents aged ≥75 were used in the main analysis and respondents aged 65–74 in sensitivity testing. We used regression tree modelling for formal social care cost analysis including frailty, age, gender, age at completing education and living with partner as key covariates. We employed a minimum node size stopping criteria to limit tree complexity and overfitting and applied 'bootstrap aggregating' to improve robustness. We assessed the impact of an intervention for every 1% decrease in the number of individuals who become frail over 1 year in England. Results show that frailty is the strongest predictor of formal social care costs. Mean social care costs for people who are not frail are £321, compared with £2,895 for individuals with frailty. For every 1% of nonfrail people not transitioning to frailty savings of £4.4 million in annual expenditures on formal social care in England are expected, not including expenditure on care homes. Given considerably higher costs for individuals classed as frail compared to nonfrail, a successful intervention avoiding or postponing the onset of frailty has the potential to considerably reduce social care costs.</ab>

        <ab>Evidence-based decisions on clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions are ideally informed by meta-analyses of intervention trial data. However, when undertaken, such meta-analyses in ageing research have typically been conducted using standard methods whereby summary (aggregate) data are extracted from published trial reports. Although meta-analysis of aggregate data can provide useful insights into the average effect of interventions within a selected trial population, it has limitations regarding robust conclusions on which subgroups of people stand to gain the greatest benefit from an intervention or are at risk of experiencing harm. Future evidence synthesis using individual participant data from ageing research trials for meta-analysis could transform understanding of the effectiveness of interventions for older people, supporting evidence-based and sustainable commissioning. A major advantage of individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) is that it enables examination of characteristics that predict treatment effects, such as frailty, disability, cognitive impairment, ethnicity, gender and other wider determinants of health. Key challenges of IPDMA relate to the complexity and resources needed for obtaining, managing and preparing datasets, requiring a meticulous approach involving experienced researchers, frequently with expertise in designing and analysing clinical trials. In anticipation of future IPDMA work in ageing research, we are establishing an international Ageing Research Trialists collective, to bring together trialists with a common focus on transforming care for older people as a shared ambition across nations.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction Evaluation of Wythenshawe Hospital's Acute Frailty Service in January–June 2019 demonstrated slow referrals times and poor identification of frail patients due to inaccurate Clinical Frailty Scoring (CFS) at emergency department triage. This project presents the results of ongoing quality assessment of our service between June 2019–January 2021, following two quality improvement (QI) interventions. Aims: To evaluate our service's ability to deliver early identification and intervention for complex frail patients via Complex Geriatric Assessment (CGA), as set out in National and Regional Frailty standards.(1,2). -To improve and maintain better outcomes for patients accessing our frailty service. Method Intervention1 (July'19): Specialist frailty nurses relocated to ED. Dedicated frailty clinical fellows and Consultant geriatrician input 0900–1700 weekdays. Intervention2 (Sep'20): Short-stay frailty unit opened. Junior clinical fellow cover increased (0900–1900 weekdays and 0900–1700 weekends). 299 patients seen at intervals between Jun'19-Jan'21 analysed using electronic records and completed CGA proformas. Results Pre-intervention Intervention1 Intervention2 June'19(n = 22) July'19(n = 198) Nov'19(n = 25) Sep'20(n = 26) Jan'21(n = 28) Time from triage-to-CGA (mins) (CI 95%)* 372.0 ± 178.2 56.0 83.4 ± 31.0 72.9 ± 35.7 48.4 ± 20.0 Discharge(%): Same day 22.7 39.4 21.7 36.0 25.0 &lt; 72 hr(cumulative) 72.7 63.6 47.8 68.0 57.1 Ave. length of stay(days)(CI95%) 10.4 ± 5.9 20.6 20.0 ± 8.7 7.1 ± 3.4 5.4 ± 2.1 Readmission &lt;30 days(%) 30.0 9.0 17.4 12.5 25.0 CGA Quality(%) CFS completion 100 96.0100 89.3 ReSPECT discussion 29.3 64.0 61.5 67.9 Full medication review 46.5 96.0 80.8 89.3 Therapy assessment 85.5 92.0 92.3 89.3 *patients triaged between 0800–1700. Conclusion Since Intervention1, Wythenshawe frailty service has sustained a reduction in triage-to-CGA time, maintained high percentages of same-day and &lt; 72 hr discharges, and sustained high rates of CFS completion and therapy assessments. Following intervention2, average length of stay reduced. Increased readmission rates in Jan'21 were impacted by COVID-19. Additional interventions targeted at reducing readmission rates and increasing ReSPECT discussions should be implemented. 1. Greater Manchester Frailty Collaborative and Network, 2019. 2.

        <ab>Introduction Identifying the holistic needs of community dwelling older people is an essential component of clinical care. Current assessment instruments are limited by a narrow medical view and varied language use, referring to identical clinical concepts in different ways. The interRAI family of assessments have been designed to integrate health information across multiple settings. The interRAI Check-Up (Self-Reported) was designed to support the management of older adults with multi-morbidities in the community setting but has not yet been widely tested in clinical practice in the United Kingdom. Objectives To investigate the extent to which the self-reported interRAI Check-Up tool could be used to assess older patients within the NHS. Methods Patients attending two outpatient clinics were recruited to complete the interRAI Check-Up which comprised of 109 items. Time taken for tool completion and prompts needed were recorded. Patient and individual item completion rates were calculated and assessed for floor or ceiling effects. Patient views on completing the tool were collected as field notes. Clinic staff completed a questionnaire exploring their views of the tool. Thematic analysis was carried out on patient and staff data. Results From 43 patient participants, the median time for tool completion was 25 minutes. The median patient completion rate was 96.6% and item completion rate was 97.1%. Of 105 analysed items, 55 items showed a ceiling or floor effect. The tool was found to comprehensively cover holistic needs but its length and complexity of structure was found to be a barrier during busy clinical practice. Conclusion The Self-reported interRAI Check-Up tool was found to be feasible for use in the outpatient setting. Further research into which patient groups and locations would benefit most is recommended as well as how to practically implement the assessment into clinical practice within the NHS.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Despite a growing body of research, the effects of retirement on health are not clear. The study explores the role played by the path out of the labour market (formal retirement vs. unemployment or family reasons), accounting for individual heterogeneity. Methods: Propensity score matching approach is employed on longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004–2015). Results: While health does not change significantly for those who formally retire, it worsens considerably for those who leave the labour market for other reasons. Moreover, health outcomes turn out to be highly heterogeneous, depending on individual socio-economic and job-related characteristics. Discussion: Leaving the labour market in one's mature years is a complex transition. Future research should focus on understanding and combating the causes of premature exit from the labour market, a relevant concern both in economic terms and on health grounds, in the light of our results.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Multiple algorithms have been developed to identify and characterize the high‐need (HN) Medicare population. However, they vary in components and yield different populations, and were developed for varying purposes. We compared the performance of existing survey and claims‐based definitions in identifying HN beneficiaries and predicting poor outcomes among a community‐dwelling population. Methods: A retrospective cohort study using Round 5 (2015) of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked with Medicare claims. We applied HN definitions from previous studies to our cohort of community‐dwelling, fee‐for‐service beneficiaries (n = 4201) using sampling weights to obtain nationally representative estimates. The Bélanger et al. (2019) definition defines HN as individuals with complex conditions, multi‐morbidity, acute and post‐acute healthcare utilization, dependency in activities of daily living, and frailty. The Hayes et al. (2016) definition defines HN as individuals with 3+ chronic conditions and a functional limitation. We applied each definition to survey and claims data. Outcomes were hospitalization or mortality in the subsequent year. Results: The proportion of NHATS respondents classified as HN varied greatly across definitions, ranging from 3.1% using the claims‐based Hayes definition to 32.9% using the survey‐based Bélanger definition. HN respondents had significantly higher mortality and hospitalization rates in 2016. Although all definitions had good specificity, none were able to predict outcomes in the following year with good accuracy. Conclusions: While mortality and hospitalization rates were significantly higher among respondents classified as HN, existing claims and survey‐based HN definitions were not able to accurately predict future outcomes in a community‐dwelling, nationally representative sample measured by the area under the curve.</ab>

        <ab>Populations in Asian developed economies are rapidly ageing, such that, currently, Hong Kong and Japan have the longest life expectancy at birth for both men and women. However, extended lifespan is not necessarily accompanied by prolongation of health span, such that there is increasing prevalence of frailty and dependency, which translates into increase in complex health and social needs as well as increase in absolute numbers of older adults that require such needs. Consideration of social determinants of healthy ageing would be important in the design of equitable health and social care systems. There is a trend towards development of integrated medical social care in the community in Asian countries. Long-term care insurance and also philanthropic support play a role in the financing of such care models.</ab>

        <ab>The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the core tool used by geriatricians across diverse clinical settings to identify vulnerabilities and estimate physiologic reserve in older adults. In this paper, we demonstrate the iterative process at our institution to identify and develop a feasible, acceptable, and sustainable bedside CGA‐based frailty index tool (FI‐CGA) that not only quantifies and grades frailty but also provides a uniform way to efficiently communicate complex geriatric concepts such as reserve and vulnerability with other teams. We describe our incorporation of the FI‐CGA into the electronic health record (EHR) and dissemination among clinical services. We demonstrate that an increasing number of patients have documented FI‐CGA in their initial assessment from 2018 to 2020, while additional comanagement services were established (Figure 2). The acceptability and sustainability of the FI‐CGA, and its routine use by geriatricians in our division, were demonstrated by a survey where the majority of clinicians report using the FI‐CGA when assessing a new patient and that the FI‐CGA informs their clinical management. Finally, we demonstrate how we refined and updated the FI‐CGA, we provide examples of applications of the FI‐CGA across the institution and describe areas of ongoing process improvement and challenges for the use of this tailored yet standardized tool across diverse inpatient and outpatient services. The process outlined can be used by other geriatric departments to introduce and incorporate an FI‐CGA. See related editorial by Callahan in this issue.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Palliative care is advocated for older people with frailty and multimorbidity in the community. However, how to best deliver it is unclear. Aim: To develop and model an intervention of short-term specialized palliative care that is initiated timely based on complex care needs and integrated with primary care for older people with frailty and their family, detailing the intervention components, outcomes and preconditions needed for implementation, using a novel theoretical approach. Design: Observational study informed by the UK MRC guidance for complex interventions integrated with a Theory of Change (i.e. hypothetical causal pathway to impact) approach. We synthesized evidence from a systematic review, semi-structured interviews, group discussions and Theory of Change workshops. Setting: Primary care in Flanders, Belgium. Results: We identified patient and family carer-related long-term outcomes and preconditions to achieve them for example, service providers are willing and able to deliver the intervention. The intervention components included implementation components, for example, training for service providers, and a core component, that is, provision of timely short-term specialized palliative care by a specialized palliative home care nurse. The latter includes: short-term service delivery; collaborative and integrative working within primary care; delivery of holistic needs- and capacity-based care; person-centred and family-focussed; and goal-oriented pro-active care. Conclusions: The Theory of Change approach allowed us to identify multiple intervention components targeting different stakeholders to achieve the desired outcomes. It also facilitated a detailed description of the intervention which aims to increase replicability and effective comparisons with other interventions.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Limited research has been conducted to risk stratify older adults with diabetes. Our objective was to reexamine the 2005-2006 classification systems in participants who are now 5 years older.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;We examined a subsample of 884 community-residing older adults with the diagnosis of diabetes from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. The primary objective was to utilize a latent class analysis (LCA) to fit a model to 11 comorbidities, comparing the 2010-2011 LCA model to that of 2005-2006. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association of the identified classes with frailty, disability, and 5-year mortality.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Both 2005-2006 LCA and the 2010-2011 LCA model fit 3 similar comorbidity profiles: Class 1 with the lowest rates of nearly all comorbidities, Class 2 had highest rates of obesity, hypertension, arthritis, and incontinence, and Class 3 had the higher rates of myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, and stroke. When compared to the healthier Class 1 (class probability = 0.67), participants with a comorbidity profile with more prevalent cardiovascular conditions (Class 3; 0.09) were at higher risk of frailty and mortality, but not disability; whereas participants with a comorbidity profile with more prevalent geriatric syndrome conditions (Class 2; 0.24) were at higher risk of frailty and disability, but not mortality.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;We reconfirmed 3 latent classes with distinct comorbidity profiles among older adults with diabetes. However, the complex relationships between comorbidity classes with frailty, disability, and mortality will likely require revision of the current rationale for stratified goal setting and treatment selection.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Geriatric acetabular fractures are becoming more common due to demographic changes. Compared with proximal femoral fractures, surgical treatment is more complex and often does not allow full-weight-bearing. The aims of this study were to compare operatively treated acetabular and proximal femoral fractures with regard to (1) cumulative 1-year mortality, (2) perioperative complications, and (3) predictive factors associated with a higher 1-year mortality.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;This institutional review board-approved comparative study included 486 consecutive surgically treated elderly patients (136 acetabular and 350 proximal femoral fractures). After matching, 2 comparable groups of 129 acetabular and 129 proximal femoral fractures were analyzed. Cumulative 1-year mortality was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis, and perioperative complications were documented and graded. After confirming that the proportionality assumption was met, Cox proportional hazard modeling was conducted to identify factors associated with increased 1-year mortality.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;The acetabular fracture group had a significantly lower cumulative 1-year mortality before matching (18% compared with 33% for proximal femoral fractures, log-rank p = 0.001) and after matching (18% compared with 36%, log-rank p = 0.005). Nevertheless, it had a significantly higher overall perioperative complication rate (68% compared with 48%, p &lt; 0.001). In our multivariable Cox regression analysis, older age, perioperative blood loss of &gt;1 L, and wheelchair mobilization were associated with lower survival rates after acetabular fracture surgery. Older age and a higher 5-item modified frailty index were associated with a higher 1-year mortality rate after proximal femoral fractures, whereas postoperative full weight-bearing was protective.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Despite the complexity of operative treatment and a higher complication rate after acetabular fractures in the elderly, the 1-year mortality rate is lower than that after operative treatment of proximal femoral fractures, even after adjustment for comorbidities.&lt;bold&gt;Level Of Evidence: &lt;/bold&gt;Therapeutic Level III.

        <ab>This article aims to enhance the conceptual debate on diversity in old age by exploring the interplay of diversity in later life and images of old age. We argue that the analysis of images of old age on the micro-level is a fruitful methodology in order to unravel the meaning of diversity in later life. Drawing on findings from qualitative research in Berlin, we explore how new and diverse imaginations, experiences and lifestyles of old age emerge. The conceptual focus on images of old age enables us to investigate further what diversity in later life comprises and how it simultaneously fosters the genesis of new images of old age. The manifold new images we found in our research suggest that prevalent societal discourses about old age on the macro-level are rather deceptive and represent mostly stereotypes such as 'active agers' or 'frail and dependent elders'. We offer three explanations why alternative images of old age are currently barely present in public discourse: (a) the actors transmitting images of age; (b) the institutionalisation of the images; and (c) the challenge to communicate complexity. We conclude by suggesting that images of old age are a promising starting point to explore and make visible both the diversity of social groups within the older generation as well as the heterogeneity of older individuals.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence (UI), the involuntary loss of urine, is a common health condition that may decrease the quality of life and which increases in incidence and prevalence with age. Recent epidemiologic data suggest an overall prevalence of 38% in women older than 60 years, increasing to 77% in older women living in nursing homes. Despite this high prevalence, incontinence remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in this age group. In a representative population of 7,000 participants drawn from the Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing, 750 had UI of whom 285 (38%) had not sought the help of a health care professional. The reasons that older people do not seek help for incontinence are complex and multiplex. Stigma surrounding diagnosis, a sense of futility coupled to a notion that incontinence is a part of normal ageing and the fact that incontinence simply gets 'lost' in the midst of multimorbidity and frailty have all been shown to play a role. Active case finding has therefore been highlighted as a cornerstone of effective care in serial international guidelines.</ab>

        <ab>Biliary disease is common in the older population, and gallbladder dysfunction and increased bile lithogenicity predispose to calculi formation. This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of gallbladder empyema. A 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer presented with hypoactive delirium. With no localising features, normal liver function tests but persistently raised inflammatory markers, he was initially managed as a urinary tract infection. Chest wall discomfort and swelling over the right costal margin later developed. Abdominal imaging demonstrated a massive gallbladder empyema invaginating through the lower right rib cage, causing the superficial swelling. Pre-morbid status prevented cholecystectomy and he was managed conservatively with percutaneous cholecystostomy and antibiotics. He was discharged to 24-h care 2 weeks after diagnosis with a long-term drain.</ab>

        <ab>Heart failure (HF) can be considered a disease of older people. It is a leading cause of hospitalisation and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in the over-65s. In 2012, an editorial in this journal detailed the latest HF research and guidelines, calling for greater integration of geriatricians in HF care. This current article reflects upon what has been achieved in this field in recent years, highlighting some future challenges and promising areas. It is written from the perspective of one such integrated team and explores the new role of cardiogeriatrician, working in a multidisciplinary team to deliver and improve care to increasingly complex, older, frail patients with multiple comorbidities who present with primary cardiology problems, especially decompensated HF. Geriatric liaison has improved the care of frail patients in orthopaedics, cancer services, stroke, acute medicine and numerous community settings. We propose that this vital role should now be extended to cardiology teams in general and to HF in particular.</ab>

        <ab>Widowhood is a significant predictor of loneliness in older adults and research on the underlying mechanisms of this link using longitudinal data is limited. This study examined whether education would moderate the effect of widowhood on loneliness, and whether such a relationship would differ by gender among Chinese older adults. A total of 2,704 older adults from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey were included. They were aged 65 years and above, were not lonely, and were married. Logistic regression models were applied to examine the interaction between widowhood, education, and gender on loneliness in the 2011 wave. Widowhood was a significant predictor of loneliness and could increase the odds of becoming lonely by 193%. The interaction between widowhood and education was significant only in older women, not in older men. Literate older women reported lower loneliness than did their illiterate counterparts when they remained married during the follow-up. However, when their spouse passed away, literate women did not differ from their illiterate counterparts in loneliness. This study revealed a gendered pattern in the interaction between widowhood and education on loneliness and demonstrated the complexity of the mechanisms. Furthermore, it highlighted the importance of considering the role of education and gender simultaneously in a Chinese context.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Interdisciplinary team (IDT) care is central to home‐based primary care (HBPC) of frail elders. Traditionally, all HBPC disciplines managed a patient (Full IDT), a costly approach to maintain. The recent PACE (Program of All‐inclusive Care for the Elderly) regulation provides for a flexible approach of annual assessments from a core team with involvement of additional disciplines dependent upon patient needs (Core+). Current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) HBPC guidance specifies Full IDTs care for medically complex and functionally impaired Veterans similar to PACE participants. We evaluated whether VA HBPC has adopted the flexible structure of the PACE regulation, aligned to Veteran needs. Design: Cross‐sectional analysis. Setting: All 139 VA HBPC programs administered across 379 sites. Participants: About 55,173 Veterans enrolled in HBPC during fiscal year 2018. Measurements: Patients' HBPC physician, nurse, psychologist/psychiatrist, social worker, therapist, dietitian, and pharmacist visits were grouped into interdisciplinary team types. Patient frailty was classified using VA HNHR v2 (High‐Need High‐Risk version 2, a measure of high, medium, and low risk of long‐term institutionalization). Medical complexity was measured by clusters of impairment in the JEN frailty index (JFI). JFI clusters were validated by VA's Nosos measure to project cost and Care Assessment Need (CAN) measure of hospitalization and mortality risk. Results: HBPC provided Full IDT care to 21%, Core+ care to 54%, and Home Health+ (HHA+) care (skilled home health services plus additional disciplines, without primary care) to 16% of Veterans. Team type was associated with medical complexity (X2 2863.5 [66 df], p &lt; 0.0001). High‐risk Veterans (72% of sample) were more likely to receive Full IDT care (X2 62.9, 1 df), p &lt; 0.0001), while low‐risk Veterans (28%) were more likely to receive HHA+ care (X2 314.8, 1 df, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: There is a strong association between HBPC team patterns and patient frailty, indicating tailoring of care to match Veteran needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Facial skin cancer lesions in close proximity to critical organs require further development of radiotherapeutic techniques for highly conformal treatment, especially when treating elderly frail patients. We report on our treatment technique and first clinical experience for patients with perinasal/periorbital skin cancer treated with individualized epithetic mold high‐dose‐rate brachytherapy (BRT). Methods: From January 2019, patients with complex shaped or unfavorably located skin cancer not eligible for surgery or external beam radiotherapy (RT) were screened for mold‐based BRT. Six patients were identified. Toxicity and clinical response were documented during therapy and posttreatment follow‐up. Results: Median patient age was 80 years (74–92 years). Median prescription dose was 42 Gy (range, 33–44 Gy) delivered in once‐daily fractions of 3 or 4 Gy. Two patients had treatment interruptions caused by acute conjunctivitis grade 2 and a nontreatment‐related cardiac event, respectively. At a median follow‐up of 335 days (96–628 days), no ≥ grade 2 late toxicity was documented with all patients showing complete clinical response. Conclusions: High‐dose‐rate BRT with individualized epithetic molds for perinasal/periorbital skin cancer is a well‐tolerated and safe treatment option for patients not eligible for primary surgery or definitive external beam RT because of comorbidities or tumor location.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Objectives: The number of older adults with complex health needs is growing, and this population experiences disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Interventions led by community health workers (CHWs) can improve clinical outcomes in the general adult population with multimorbidity, but few studies have investigated CHW‐delivered interventions in older adults. Design: We systematically reviewed the impact of CHW interventions on health outcomes among older adults with complex health needs. We searched for English‐language articles from database inception through April 2020 using seven databases. PROSPERO protocol registration CRD42019118761. Setting: Any U.S. or international setting, including clinical and community‐based settings. Participants: Adults aged 60 years or older with complex health needs, defined in this review as multimorbidity, frailty, disability, or high‐utilization. Interventions: Interventions led by a CHW or similar role consistent with the American Public Health Association's definition of CHWs. Measurements: Pre‐defined health outcomes (chronic disease measures, general health measures, treatment adherence, quality of life, or functional measures) as well as qualitative findings. Results: Of 5671 unique records, nine studies met eligibility criteria, including four randomized controlled trials, three quasi‐experimental studies, and two qualitative studies. Target population and intervention characteristics were variable, and studies were generally of low‐to‐moderate methodological quality. Outcomes included mood, functional status and disability, social support, well‐being and quality of life, medication knowledge, and certain health conditions (e.g., falls, cognition). Results were mixed with several studies demonstrating significant effects on mood and function, including one high‐quality RCT, while others noted no significant intervention effects on outcomes. Conclusion: CHW‐led interventions may have benefit for older adults with complex health needs, but additional high‐quality studies are needed to definitively determine the effectiveness of CHW interventions in this population. Integration of CHWs into geriatric clinical settings may be a strategy to deliver evidence‐based interventions and improve clinical outcomes in complex older adults.
