TI  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults: clinical considerations and management.
PG  - 534-548
LID - 10.1038/s41574-021-00512-2 [doi]
AB  - The past 50 years have seen a growing ageing population with an increasing 
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); now, nearly half of all 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus are older adults (aged ≥65 years). Older 
      adults with T2DM present particularly difficult challenges. For example, the 
      accentuated heterogeneity of these patients, the potential presence of multiple 
      comorbidities, the increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, the increased 
      dependence on care and the effect of frailty all add to the complexity of 
      managing diabetes mellitus in this age group. In this Review, we offer an update 
      on the key pathophysiological mechanisms associated with T2DM in older people. We 
      then evaluate new evidence relating particularly to the effects of frailty and 
      sarcopenia, the clinical difficulties of age-associated comorbidities, and the 
      implications for existing guidelines and therapeutic options. Our conclusions 
      will focus on the effect of T2DM on an ageing society.

AB  - Aging causes skeletal muscle atrophy, and myofiber loss can be a critical 
      component of this process. In 1989, Rosenberg emphasized the importance of the 
      loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with aging and coined the term 
      'sarcopenia'. Since then, sarcopenia has attracted considerable attention due to 
      the aging population in developed countries. The presence of sarcopenia is 
      closely related to staggering, falls and even frailty in the elderly, which in 
      turn leads to the need for nursing care. Sarcopenia is often associated with a 
      poor prognosis in the elderly. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the causes 
      and pathogenesis of sarcopenia, and to develop and introduce interventional 
      strategies in line with these causes and pathogenesis. Sarcopenia can be a 
      primary component of physical frailty. The association between sarcopenia, 
      frailty and locomotive syndrome is complex; however, sarcopenia is a 
      muscle‑specific concept that is relatively easy to approach in research. In the 
      elderly, a lack of exercise, malnutrition and hormonal changes lead to 
      neuromuscular junction insufficiency, impaired capillary blood flow, reduced 
      repair and regeneration capacity due to a decrease in the number of muscle 
      satellite cells, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and oxidative stress, 
      resulting in muscle protein degradation exceeding synthesis. In addition, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction causes metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin 
      resistance, which may lead to quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in 
      skeletal muscle, resulting in sarcopenia. The present review article focuses on 
      age‑related primary sarcopenia and outlines its pathogenesis and mechanisms.

TI  - Metabolic Syndrome and Sarcopenia.
LID - 10.3390/nu13103519 [doi]
LID - 3519
AB  - Skeletal muscle is a major organ of insulin-induced glucose metabolism. In 
      addition, loss of muscle mass is closely linked to insulin resistance (IR) and 
      metabolic syndrome (Met-S). Skeletal muscle loss and accumulation of 
      intramuscular fat are associated with a variety of pathologies through a 
      combination of factors, including oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction, IR, and inactivity. Sarcopenia, defined by a loss of 
      muscle mass and a decline in muscle quality and muscle function, is common in the 
      elderly and is also often seen in patients with acute or chronic muscle-wasting 
      diseases. The relationship between Met-S and sarcopenia has been attracting a 
      great deal of attention these days. Persistent inflammation, fat deposition, and 
      IR are thought to play a complex role in the association between Met-S and 
      sarcopenia. Met-S and sarcopenia adversely affect QOL and contribute to increased 
      frailty, weakness, dependence, and morbidity and mortality. Patients with Met-S 
      and sarcopenia at the same time have a higher risk of several adverse health 
      events than those with either Met-S or sarcopenia. Met-S can also be associated 
      with sarcopenic obesity. In this review, the relationship between Met-S and 
      sarcopenia will be outlined from the viewpoints of molecular mechanism and 
      clinical impact.

TI  - Sarcopenic Dysphagia, Malnutrition, and Oral Frailty in Elderly: A Comprehensive 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu14050982 [doi]
LID - 982
AB  - Frailty is a highly prevalent condition in the elderly that has been increasingly 
      considered as a crucial public health issue, due to the strict correlation with a 
      higher risk of fragility fractures, hospitalization, and mortality. Among the 
      age-related diseases, sarcopenia and dysphagia are two common pathological 
      conditions in frail older people and could coexist leading to dehydration and 
      malnutrition in these subjects. "Sarcopenic dysphagia" is a complex condition 
      characterized by deglutition impairment due to the loss of mass and strength of 
      swallowing muscles and might be also related to poor oral health status. 
      Moreover, the aging process is strictly related to poor oral health status due to 
      direct impairment of the immune system and wound healing and physical and 
      cognitive impairment might indirectly influence older people's ability to carry 
      out adequate oral hygiene. Therefore, poor oral health might affect nutrient 
      intake, leading to malnutrition and, consequently, to frailty. In this scenario, 
      sarcopenia, dysphagia, and oral health are closely linked sharing common 
      pathophysiological pathways, disabling sequelae, and frailty. Thus, the aim of 
      the present comprehensive review is to describe the correlation among sarcopenic 
      dysphagia, malnutrition, and oral frailty, characterizing their phenotypically 
      overlapping features, to propose a comprehensive and effective management of 
      elderly frail subjects.

      to therapeutics.
PG  - 5675-5685
LID - 10.7150/thno.46436 [doi]
AB  - Aging frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome that becomes more prevalent with 
      advancing age. It constitutes a major health problem due to frequent adverse 
      outcomes. Frailty is characterized by disruption of physiological homeostasis and 
      progressive decline of health status. Multiple factors contribute to development 
      of frailty with advancing age, including genome instability, DNA damage, 
      epigenetic alternations, stem cell exhaustion, among others. These interrelated 
      factors comprehensively result in loss of tissue homeostasis and diminished 
      reserve capacity in frailty. Therefore, the aged organism gradually represents 
      symptoms of frailty with decline in physiological functions of organs. Notably, 
      the brain, cardiovascular system, skeletal muscle, and endocrine system are 
      intrinsically interrelated to frailty. The patients with frailty may display the 
      diminished reserves capacity of organ systems. Due to the complex 
      pathophysiology, no specific treatments have been approved for prevention of this 
      syndrome. At such, effective strategies for intervening in pathogenic process to 
      improve health status of frail patients are highly needed. Recent progress in 
      cell-based therapy has greatly contributed to the amelioration of degenerative 
      diseases related to age. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can exert regenerative 
      effects and possess anti-inflammatory properties. Transplantation of MSCs 
      represents as a promising therapeutic strategy to address the pathophysiologic 
      problems of frail syndrome. Currently, MSC therapy have undergone the phase I and 
      II trials in human subjects that have endorsed the safety and efficacy of MSCs 
      for aging frailty. However, despite these positive results, caution is still 
      needed with regard to potential to form tumors, and further large-scale studies 
      are warranted to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of MSC therapy.

AB  - Rationale: Much is known about the acute infective process of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of the 
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The marked inflammatory response and 
      coagulopathic state in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may promote pulmonary fibrosis. 
      However, little is known about the incidence and seriousness of post-COVID-19 
      pulmonary pathology. Objectives: To describe the respiratory recovery and 
      self-reported health after infection at the time of outpatient attendance. 
      Methods: Infection severity was graded into three groups: 1) not requiring 
      admission, 2) requiring hospital admission, and 3) requiring intensive care unit 
      care. Participants underwent chest radiography and a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). 
      Fatigue and subjective return to health were assessed, and concentrations of CRP 
      (C-reactive protein), IL-6 (interleukin-6), sCD25 (soluble CD25), and D-dimer 
      were measured. The associations between initial illness and abnormal chest X-ray 
      findings, 6MWT distance, and perception of maximal exertion were investigated. 
      Results: A total of 487 patients were offered an outpatient appointment, of whom 
      153 (31%) attended for assessment at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. A total 
      of 74 (48%) had required hospital admission during acute infection. Persistently 
      abnormal chest X-ray findings were seen in 4%. The median 6MWT distance covered 
      was 460 m. A reduced distance covered was associated with frailty and length of 
      inpatient stay. A total of 95 (62%) patients believed that they had not returned 
      to full health, whereas 47% met the case definition for fatigue. Ongoing ill 
      health and fatigue were associated with an increased perception of exertion. None 
      of the measures of persistent respiratory disease were associated with initial 
      disease severity. Conclusions: This study highlights the rates of objective 
      respiratory disease and subjective respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 and the 
      complex multifactorial nature of post-COVID-19 ill health.

TI  - Physical Functional Assessment in Older Adults.

AB  - The evaluation of the physical domain represents a critical part of the 
      assessment of the older person, both in the clinical as well as the research 
      setting. To measure physical function, clinicians and researchers have 
      traditionally relied on instruments focusing on the capacity of the individual to 
      accomplish specific functional tasks (e.g., the Activities of Daily Living [ADL] 
      or the Instrumental ADL scales). However, a growing number of physical 
      performance and muscle strength tests has been developed in parallel over the 
      past three decades. These measures are specifically designed to: 1) provide 
      objective results (not surprisingly, they are frequently timed tests) taken in 
      standardized conditions, whereas the traditional physical function scales are 
      generally self- or proxy-reported measures; 2) be more sensitive to changes; 3) 
      capture the real biology of the function through the assessment of standardized 
      tasks mirroring specific functional subdomains; and 4) mirror the quality of 
      specific mechanisms underlying more complex and multidomain functions. Among the 
      most commonly used instruments, the usual gait speed test, the Short Physical 
      Performance Battery, the handgrip strength, the Timed Up-and-Go test, the 
      6-minute walk test, and the 400-meter walk test are widely adopted by clinicians 
      and researchers. The clinical and research importance of all these instruments 
      has been demonstrated by their predictive capacity for negative health-related 
      outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, falls, institutionalization, disability, 
      mortality). Moreover, they have shown to be associated with subclinical and 
      clinical conditions that are also not directly related to the physical domain 
      (e.g., inflammation, oxidative stress, overall mortality). For this reason, they 
      have been repeatedly indicated as markers of wellbeing linked to the burden of 
      multiple chronic conditions rather than mere parameters of mobility or strength. 
      In this work protocols of the main tests for the objective assessment of physical 
      function in older adults are presented.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Social frailty is a complex concept and there is still no consensus 
      on the criteria that best define it, nor on the role that social dimensions play 
      in well-established frailty models. AIM: To analyse the predictive value of 
      social frailty dimensions on distinct frailty models. METHOD: A non-probabilistic 
      sample of 193 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and over was recruited in 
      2016 and followed for three years. Frailty was assessed by the Tilburg Frailty 
      Indicator, the Groningen Frailty Indicator, and the Fried Phenotype criteria. 
      Questions about living alone, social network, social support, loneliness, and 
      frequency of social activities engagement were used to assess social criteria. 
      Bivariate correlations and sequential multiple hierarchical logistic regression 
      analyses were performed. RESULTS: At baseline, 22.2% older adults lived alone, 
      47.2% reported missing people around them, 21.1% reported lack of social support, 
      26.1% reported having reduced their participation in social activities recently 
      and 52.2% reported loneliness. The percent of frail individuals varied across 
      frailty measures, and social criteria showed significant correlations and 
      increased the prediction of frailty status. Loneliness and social activities 
      engagement were associated with frailty as assessed by the Tilburg frailty 
      Indicator and by the Fried Phenotype criteria; the lack of social support is 
      associated with frailty as assessed by the Groningen Frailty Indicator. Living 
      alone and lack of social relationships did not predict frailty. CONCLUSION: 
      Including social dimensions in a frailty model needs a consensual theoretical 
      basis as they have different roles in predicting frailty, varying over time and 
      across assessment tools.

TI  - Interventions to Reduce Hospital Length of Stay in High-risk Populations: A 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - e2125846
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25846 [doi]
LID - e2125846
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Many strategies to reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) have been 
      implemented, but few studies have evaluated hospital-led interventions focused on 
      high-risk populations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 
      Learning Health System panel commissioned this study to further evaluate 
      system-level interventions for LOS reduction. OBJECTIVE: To identify and 
      synthesize evidence regarding potential systems-level strategies to reduce LOS 
      for patients at high risk for prolonged LOS. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Multiple databases, 
      including MEDLINE and Embase, were searched for English-language systematic 
      reviews from January 1, 2010, through September 30, 2020, with updated searches 
      through January 19, 2021. The scope of the protocol was determined with input 
      from AHRQ Key Informants. Systematic reviews were included if they reported on 
      hospital-led interventions intended to decrease LOS for high-risk populations, 
      defined as those with high-risk medical conditions or socioeconomically 
      vulnerable populations (eg, patients with high levels of socioeconomic risk, who 
      are medically uninsured or underinsured, with limited English proficiency, or who 
      are hospitalized at a safety-net, tertiary, or quaternary care institution). 
      Exclusion criteria included interventions that were conducted outside of the 
      hospital setting, including community health programs. Data extraction was 
      conducted independently, with extraction of strength of evidence (SOE) ratings 
      provided by systematic reviews; if unavailable, SOE was assessed using the AHRQ 
      Evidence-Based Practice Center methods guide. FINDINGS: Our searches yielded 4432 
      potential studies. We included 19 systematic reviews reported in 20 articles. The 
      reviews described 8 strategies for reducing LOS in high-risk populations: 
      discharge planning, geriatric assessment, medication management, clinical 
      pathways, interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary care, case management, 
      hospitalist services, and telehealth. Interventions were most frequently designed 
      for older patients, often those who were frail (9 studies), or patients with 
      heart failure. There were notable evidence gaps, as there were no systematic 
      reviews studying interventions for patients with socioeconomic risk. For patients 
      with medically complex conditions, discharge planning, medication management, and 
      interdisciplinary care teams were associated with inconsistent outcomes (LOS, 
      readmissions, mortality) across populations. For patients with heart failure, 
      clinical pathways and case management were associated with reduced length of stay 
      (clinical pathways: mean difference reduction, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.33 to 2.44] days; 
      case management: mean difference reduction, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.52 to 2.04] days). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review found inconsistent results 
      across all high-risk populations on the effectiveness associated with 
      interventions, such as discharge planning, that are often widely used by health 
      systems. This systematic review highlights important evidence gaps, such as the 
      lack of existing systematic reviews focused on patients with socioeconomic risk 
      factors, and the need for further research.

AB  - The management of frailty in older persons is not easy, implying interventions 
      beyond the simple prescription of medications. Biological complexity, 
      multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and social issues often hamper the possibility to 
      directly translate the evidence coming from research into clinical practice. 
      Frailty indeed represents the most relevant cause of the “evidence-based medicine 
      issue” influencing clinical decisions in geriatric care. Today, patients with 
      Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are much older and frailer than some decades ago. They 
      also tend to have more drugs prescribed. In parallel, research on AD has evolved 
      over the years, hypothesizing that anticipating the interventions to the earliest 
      stages of the disease may provide beneficial effects (to date, still lacking). In 
      this article, we argue that, by focusing exclusively on “the disease” and pushing 
      to anticipate its detection (sometimes even before the appareance of its clinical 
      manifestations) may overshadow the person’s values and priorities. Research 
      should be developed for better integrating the concept of aging and frailty in 
      the design of clinical trials in order to provide results that can be implemented 
      in real life. On the other hand, clinicians should be less prone to the easy (but 
      unsupported by evidence) pharmacological prescription.

TI  - Gut microbiome, Vitamin D, ACE2 interactions are critical factors in 
      immune-senescence and inflammaging: key for vaccine response and severity of 
      COVID-19 infection.
PG  - 13-26
LID - 10.1007/s00011-021-01510-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread sporadically in the 
      Unites States and worldwide. The severity and mortality excessively affected the 
      frail elderly with co-existing medical diseases. There is growing evidence that 
      cross-talk between the gut microbiome, Vitamin D and RAS/ACE2 system is essential 
      for a balanced functioning of the elderly immune system and in regulating 
      inflammation. In this review, we hypothesize that the state of gut microbiome, 
      prior to infection determines the outcome associated with COVID-19 sepsis and may 
      also be a critical factor in success to vaccination. METHODS: Articles from 
      PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using a combination of terms "SARS-CoV-2, 
      COVID-19, Inflammaging, Immune-senescence, Gut microbiome, Vitamin D, RAS/ACE2, 
      Vaccination". CONCLUSION: Evidence indicates a complex association between gut 
      microbiota, ACE-2 expression and Vitamin D in COVID-19 severity. Status of gut 
      microbiome is highly predictive of the blood molecular signatures and 
      inflammatory markers and host responses to infection. Vitamin D has 
      immunomodulatory function in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral 
      infection. Anti-inflammatory functions of Vit D include regulation of gut 
      microbiome and maintaining microbial diversity. It promotes growth of 
      gut-friendly commensal strains of Bifida and Fermicutus species. In addition, 
      Vitamin D is a negative regulator for expression of renin and interacts with the 
      RAS/ ACE/ACE-2 signaling axis. Collectively, this triad may be the critical, link 
      in determination of outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presented data are 
      empirical and informative. Further research using advanced systems biology 
      techniques and artificial intelligence-assisted integration could assist with 
      correlation of the gut microbiome with sepsis and vaccine responses. Modulating 
      these factors may impact in guiding the success of vaccines and clinical outcomes 
      in COVID-19 infections.

AB  - High blood pressure (BP) affects 75% of people aged over 70. Ageing alters BP 
      homeostasis, resulting in postural hypotension and increased BP variability. 
      Co-morbidity and frailty add complexity to understanding BP changes in later 
      life. Longitudinal BP declines are likely driven by accumulating co-morbidity and 
      are accelerated in both frailty and dementia. This narrative review summarises 
      what is known about the association between BP and frailty, the clinical 
      management of BP in frailty and the association between BP, cognitive decline and 
      dementia.

TI  - Adverse drug reactions in older adults: a narrative review of the literature.
PG  - 463-473
LID - 10.1007/s41999-021-00481-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a common and potentially 
      preventable cause of unplanned hospitalization, increasing morbidity, mortality, 
      and healthcare costs. We aimed to review the classification and occurrence of 
      ADRs in the older population, discuss the role of age as a risk factor, and 
      identify interventions to prevent ADRs. METHODS: We performed a narrative scoping 
      review of the literature to assess classification, occurrence, factors affecting 
      ADRs, and possible strategies to identify and prevent ADRs. RESULTS: Adverse drug 
      reactions (ADRs) are often classified as Type A and Type B reactions, based on 
      dose and effect of the drugs and fatality of the reaction. More recently, other 
      approaches have been proposed (i.e. Dose, Time and Susceptibility (DoTS) and 
      EIDOS classifications). The frequency of ADRs varies depending on definitions, 
      characteristics of the studied population, and settings. Their occurrence is 
      often ascribed to commonly used drugs, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet 
      agents, digoxin, insulin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Age-related 
      factors-changes in pharmacokinetics, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and 
      frailty-have been related to ADRs. Different approaches (i.e. medication review, 
      software identifying potentially inappropriate prescription and drug 
      interactions) have been suggested to prevent ADRs and proven to improve the 
      quality of prescribing. However, consistent evidence on their effectiveness is 
      still lacking. Few studies suggest that a comprehensive geriatric assessment, 
      aimed at identifying individual risk factors, patients' needs, treatment 
      priorities, and strategies for therapy optimization, is key for reducing ADRs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a relevant health burden. The 
      medical complexity that characterizes older patients requires a holistic approach 
      to reduce the burden of ADRs in this population.

TI  - Pre-Frailty and Frailty in Dialysis and Pre-Dialysis Patients: A Systematic 
      Review of Clinical and Biochemical Markers.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18189579 [doi]
LID - 9579
AB  - Patients under dialysis are known to be more vulnerable to frailty, a dynamic 
      geriatric syndrome defined as a state of vulnerability to stressors, due to 
      numerous metabolic changes. With rise of life expectancy globally, it is 
      important to understand the complexity of the pathophysiology of frailty and 
      identify possible markers that can help with the prognosis and diagnosis of 
      frailty. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of the 
      knowledge regarding clinical and biochemical markers associated with pre-frailty 
      and frailty in dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. In November 2020, PubMed, 
      Embase and Web of Science were searched. Studies regarding biomarkers associated 
      with (pre-)frailty in (pre-)dialysis patients were included. This systematic 
      review identified clinical and biochemical markers in pre-frail and frail 
      patients under dialysis or pre-dialysis published in the literature. This study 
      shows that more investigation is necessary to identify markers that can 
      differentiate these processes to be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in 
      routine care and management of geriatric needs. Interventions that can improve 
      health outcomes in pre-frail and frail older adults under dialysis or 
      pre-dialysis are essential to improve not only the individual's quality of life 
      but also to reduce the burden to the health systems.

PG  - 289-299
LID - 10.1080/14779072.2021.1902306 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) and malignancy are 
      both high, especially in elderly people and in developed countries. These two 
      conditions frequently coexist and share the same risk factors as atherosclerotic 
      disease.Area covered. The progression of calcified AS may be accelerated by both 
      cardiovascular risk factors and cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy. The 
      standard treatment for symptomatic severe AS is surgical aortic valve 
      replacement; however, in cancer patients, transcatheter implantation may be 
      preferred as they are often at high-risk for cardiac surgery. In patients with AS 
      and cancer, physicians may face difficult treatment decisions.To date, there is 
      limited information on the impact of malignancy on outcomes in patients with 
      severe AS; hence, there is no established treatment policy.Expert Opinion. 
      Treating clinicians must integrate complex information about the severity of 
      valve disease and expected cardiac outcomes with information regarding the cancer 
      prognosis and the need for specific treatment, including surgery. Other 
      comorbidities, age and frailty also contribute to decision-making about whether, 
      when, and how to perform aortic valve replacement.

TI  - Association of frailty and pre-frailty with increased risk of mortality among 
      older Canadians.
PG  - 15-26

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex syndrome that is associated with aging but not 
      synonymous with the normal aging process. It has been associated with all-cause 
      mortality, but less is known about frailty and mortality from specific causes. 
      DATA AND METHODS: Data from the 2013 and 2014 Canadian Community Health Survey 
      (CCHS) linked to the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database were used to 
      estimate the prevalence of frailty among Canadians aged 65 or older. Levels of 
      frailty were based on validated cut-points for the 30-item frailty index. The 
      relationship of frailty to mortality risk during the period of three to five 
      years following the CCHS interview was assessed with Cox proportional hazards 
      models adjusted for sociodemographic factors and health behaviours. Associations 
      between frailty and mortality from neoplasms, circulatory diseases and disease of 
      the respiratory system were examined in separate models. RESULTS: An estimated 
      1.1 million (22%) community-dwelling older adults were frail in 2013 and 2014, 
      and another 1.6 million (32%) were considered pre-frail. Frailty was more common 
      among females than males and among those in older age groups. The risk of 
      mortality increased significantly with increasing levels of frailty, even after 
      accounting for sociodemographic factors and health behaviours. This was the case 
      for all-cause mortality, as well as for death from three major underlying 
      causes-neoplasms, and diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems. 
      DISCUSSION: Even individuals who were classified as pre-frail had an increased 
      risk of mortality overall and from three leading causes compared with those who 
      were robust, demonstrating the importance of screening community-dwelling older 
      adults for frailty.

TI  - Frailty: the current challenge for aging people with HIV.
PG  - 133-140
LID - 10.1097/COH.0000000000000677 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Older adults account for the majority of people with HIV (PWH) 
      in high-income countries and have increasingly complex clinical profiles related 
      to premature aging. Frailty is an important geriatric syndrome affecting a 
      minority of PHW. Frailty negatively affects PHW's clinical status and quality of 
      life. This review will update care providers on the current state of frailty that 
      limits the healthspan of PWH. RECENT FINDINGS: Ongoing low-level HIV replication 
      in treated PWH leads to immune activation and chronic inflammation contributing 
      to the destabilization of normally autoregulated physiologic systems in response 
      to environmental and biologic challenges characteristic of frailty. Understanding 
      these underlying mechanisms will determine potential intervention options. 
      Potentially reversible risk factors that promote progression to and reversion 
      from the dynamic state of frailty are being studied and will help prevent 
      frailty. Simple assessment tools and treatment strategies for frailty are being 
      adapted for aging PWH. SUMMARY: Insight into underlying biologic mechanisms and 
      adapting proven geriatric principles of interdisciplinary care will inform the 
      healthy aging of PWH.

AB  - The interplay of frailty, multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the older person 
      results in complex care needs. Monitoring and proactive management of chronic 
      diseases in this context can be challenging. Early identification of 
      deterioration reduces the risk of hospitalisation in older people, particularly 
      in residential care, where the person can be particularly vulnerable. 
      Deterioration of a resident often results in an expectation of in-hospital care, 
      which especially where there are life-limiting conditions, may not align to the 
      wishes of the person and their family. However, links between tertiary hospital 
      services with the expertise to upskill and mentor those providing the more 
      complex care to residents of aged care facilities need to be developed. Current 
      models of care need to be adapted to incorporate the provision of specialist 
      nursing within residential facilities to support higher-level care delivered in 
      the person's familiar environment, improve the person and family experience, and 
      reduce the costs and potential for iatrogenic problems associated with 
      hospitalisation. Vascular dysfunction is common in aged care and results in 
      impaired healing and complex wounds. We developed a Vascular and Geriatric (VaG) 
      model of care to support specialist care for aged care residents with vascular 
      dysfunction. The VaG model enhances existing links between hospital and 
      residential care settings and builds workforce capacity in residential care 
      facilities by the use of clinical consultation, peer learning and networking to 
      increase the vascular skill set initially of the hospital outreach nurse and then 
      modelled to residential care clinicians. This paper reports the development and 
      implementation of the VaG model as part of the Aged Care Outreach Service.

TI  - Social factors influencing utilization of home care in community-dwelling older 
      adults: a scoping review.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.1186/s12877-021-02069-1 [doi]
LID - 145
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults want to live at home as long as possible, even in the 
      face of circumstances that limit their autonomy. Home care services reflect this 
      emergent preference, allowing older adults to 'age in place' in familiar settings 
      rather than receiving care for chronic health conditions or ageing needs in an 
      institutionalized setting. Numerous social factors, generally studied in 
      isolation, have been associated with home care utilization. Even so, social 
      circumstances are complex and how these factors collectively influence home care 
      use patterns remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To provide a broad and comprehensive 
      overview of the social factors influencing home care utilization; and to evaluate 
      the influence of discrete social factors on patterns of home care utilization in 
      community-dwelling older adults in high-income countries. METHODS: A scoping 
      review was conducted of six electronic databases for records published between 
      2010 and 2020; additional records were obtained from hand searching review 
      articles, reference lists of included studies and documents from international 
      organisations. A narrative synthesis was presented, complemented by vote counting 
      per social factor, harvest plots and an evaluation of aggregated findings to 
      determine consistency across studies. RESULTS: A total of 2,365 records were 
      identified, of which 66 met inclusion criteria. There were 35 discrete social 
      factors grouped into four levels of influence using a socio-ecological model 
      (individual, relationship, community and societal levels) and grouped according 
      to outcome of interest (home care propensity and intensity). Across all studies, 
      social factors consistently showing any association (positive, negative, or 
      equivocal in pattern) with home care propensity were: age, ethnicity/race, 
      self-assessed health, insurance, housing ownership, housing problems, marital 
      status, household income, children, informal caregiving, social networks and 
      urban/rural area. Age, education, personal finances, living arrangements and 
      housing ownership were associated with home care intensity, also with variable 
      patterns in utilization. Additional community and societal level factors were 
      identified as relevant but lacking consistency across the literature; these 
      included rurality, availability of community services, methods of financing home 
      care systems, and cultural determinants. CONCLUSION: This is the first literature 
      review bringing together a wide range of reported social factors that influence 
      home care utilization. It confirms social factors do influence home care 
      utilization in complex interactions, distinguishes level of influences at which 
      these factors affect patterns of use and discusses policy implications for home 
      care reform.

TI  - Considering Frailty in SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development: How Geriatricians Can 
      Assist.
PG  - 731-738
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S295522 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted frail older adults, 
      especially residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. This has appropriately 
      led to prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care 
      for them, in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct 
      immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood 
      through a lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of 
      COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been 
      optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination 
      programs are being implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not 
      tested in Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. 
      We argue that geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to 
      the development, testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. 
      We discuss roles for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development 
      process, covering vaccine design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment 
      and interpretation of illness definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of 
      relevant health measures such as frailty and function, analysis methods to 
      account for frailty and differential vulnerability, contributions in regulatory 
      and advisory roles, post-marketing surveillance, and program implementation and 
      public health messaging. In presenting key recommendations pertinent to each 
      stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on how to push the field of 
      vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty. Making vaccines that can 
      benefit frail older adults will benefit everyone in the fight against COVID-19.

      tool for individualized treatment?
PG  - 648-657
LID - 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000792 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Multiple myeloma is a disease of elderly adults. Improvement 
      in survival has occurred because of biological insights and novel agents. 
      Therapeutic options involve choices today, thus have become more complex. 
      Demographics have led to an increased number of elderly patients and age may be 
      associated with a poorer outcome but is not the only prognostic predictor today. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: To evaluate patients' health status rather than their 
      chronological age alone, frailty scores and functional geriatric assessments are 
      used to identify prognostic groups, avoid adverse events, compare clinical trials 
      and tailor treatment. As most clinical trials exclude frail elderly patients, 
      those enrolled therein are often younger and healthier than the typical multiple 
      myeloma patient. This represents a challenge for frail cohorts because of their 
      increased risk of adverse events, overtreatment and undertreatment and/or therapy 
      discontinuation, which may lead to poorer survival and quality of life (QoL). 
      Reassessing patients' status via geriatric assessments is also relevant during 
      treatment to adjust interventions appropriately. SUMMARY: Integrating geriatric 
      assessments may lead to individual treatment decisions, dose adjustments, better 
      clinical outcome and QoL. Prospective clinical trials that enroll elderly 
      multiple myeloma patients with comorbidities, incorporate frailty 
      scores/geriatric assessments and help with prognostication, adverse event 
      avoidance and QoL maintenance, remain warranted.

AB  - Frailty is a highly prevalent multisystem syndrome in older adults with heart 
      failure (HF) and is associated with poor clinical prognosis and increased 
      complexity of care. While frailty is neither disease nor age specific, it is a 
      clinical manifestation of aging-related processes that reflects a reduced 
      physiological ability to tolerate and recover from stress associated with aging, 
      disease, or therapy. Within this context, physical frailty, which is distinctly 
      oriented to physical functional domains (e.g., muscle weakness, slowness, and low 
      activity), has been recognized as a critical vital sign in older persons with HF. 
      Identification and routine assessment of physical frailty, using objective 
      physical performance measures, may guide the course of patient-centered treatment 
      plans that maximize the likelihood of improving clinical outcomes in older HF 
      patients. Exercise-based rehabilitation is a primary therapy to improve 
      cardiovascular health in patients with HF; however, the limited evidence 
      supporting the effectiveness of exercise tailored to older and frail HF patients 
      underscores the current gaps in management of their care. Interdisciplinary 
      exercise interventions designed with consideration of physical frailty as a 
      therapeutic target may be an important strategy to counteract functional deficits 
      characteristic of frailty and HF, and to improve patient-centered outcomes in 
      this population. The purpose of this current review is to provide a better 
      understanding of physical frailty and its relation to management of care in older 
      patients with HF. Implications of movement-based interventions, including 
      exercise and physical rehabilitation, to prevent or reverse physical frailty and 
      improve clinical outcomes will further be discussed.

PG  - 1839-1849

AB  - Unruptured cerebral aneurysms are increasingly identified in elderly patients as 
      the global life expectancy continues to rise and non-invasive vascular imaging 
      becomes more prevalent. The optimal management of unruptured aneurysms in elderly 
      patients remains controversial. Variability in life expectancy, comorbidities and 
      rupture risk coupled with heterogenous endovascular and surgical treatments 
      contribute to a paucity of clear guidelines, and current management is highly 
      individualized. Elderly patients present unique considerations including frailty, 
      cognitive dysfunction, vasculopathy, reduced life expectancy and overall worse 
      prognosis in case of rupture which shape the risks and likelihood of success of 
      endovascular and microsurgical treatment. In this review, we provide a 
      comprehensive overview of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in the elderly, with a 
      particular focus on the natural history, key challenges associated with advanced 
      age, management and future innovations to further refine treatment.Key 
      MessagesThe management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in elderly patients 
      remains controversial.Key challenges including frailty, cognitive dysfunction, 
      reduced life expectancy, vasculopathy and poor prognosis with aneurysm rupture 
      add complexity to endovascular and surgical decision making not encountered with 
      younger demographics.A thorough understanding of available treatment options, 
      likelihood of treatment success and associated risks weighed against the risk of 
      aneurysm rupture informs patient discussion and management.

AB  - Aging is associated with loss of function across organ systems, contributing to 
      systemic frailty. Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, in particular, is a 
      major source of frailty in older adults, severely impacting quality of life. Some 
      loss of muscle mass and strength with aging is inevitable, and sarcopenia, the 
      severe loss of muscle mass with aging, is common. Sarcopenia is determined in 
      part by genetics but can be modified by lifestyle choices. The pathophysiologic 
      underpinnings of sarcopenia are complex and multifactorial. In this review, the 
      causes of sarcopenia are surveyed at the systems, cell, subcellular, and 
      molecular levels with emphasis on the interplay between these various causes of 
      this degenerative disease process.

TI  - Frailty Status and Polypharmacy Predict All-Cause Mortality in Community Dwelling 
      Older Adults in Europe.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18073580 [doi]
LID - 3580
AB  - European population ageing is associated with frailty, a complex geriatric 
      syndrome, and polypharmacy, both resulting in adverse health outcomes. In this 
      study we aimed to evaluate the impact of frailty and polypharmacy, on mortality 
      rates, within 30 months, using a cohort of SHARE participants aged 65 years old 
      or more. Frailty was assessed using a version of Fried's phenotype criteria 
      operationalized to SHARE while polypharmacy was defined as taking five or more 
      drugs per day. We found a prevalence of 40.4% non-frail, 47.3% pre-frail and 
      12.3% frail participants. Moreover, a prevalence of polypharmacy of 31.3% was 
      observed, being 3 three times more prevalent in frail individuals and two times 
      in pre-frail individuals, when compared with non-frail. Individuals with both 
      conditions had shown higher mortality rates. Comparing with non-polymedicated 
      non-frail individuals all the other conditions are more prone to die within 30 
      months. Polymedicated older and male participants exhibited also higher mortality 
      rates. This work shows polypharmacy and frailty to be associated with a higher 
      risk of all-cause of mortality and highlights the need to decrease 'unnecessary' 
      polypharmacy to reduce drug-related issues and also the need to assess frailty 
      early to prevent avoidable adverse outcomes.

TI  - Frailty Index for prediction of surgical outcome in ovarian cancer: Results of a 
      prospective study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complete macroscopic tumor resection is the strongest prognostic 
      factor for patients with ovarian cancer, which requires complex surgery for 
      achievement. Based on the mostly advanced tumor stage and high symptom burden 
      many patients are classified as frail which may limit optimal surgical outcome. 
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive ability of Frailty Index for 
      surgical outcomes in patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: This prospective 
      study enrolled patients with ovarian cancer undergoing cytoreductive surgery. We 
      classified frailty proposed by Mitnitski et al. regarding the cumulative deficit 
      model of frailty. Utilizing Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis and 
      logistic regression, we determined predictive clinical factors for severe 
      postoperative complications. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used 
      for overall survival analysis. RESULTS: Out of f 144 enrolled patients, the 
      overall prevalence of frailty based on a Frailty Index >0.26 and Frailty Index 
      >0.15 was 33% and 74%, respectively. The logistic regression shows that frail 
      patients with a Frailty Index >0.26 (Odds ratio (OR): 3.64, 95% CI: 1.34-9.85, 
      p = 0.01), ECOG PS > 1 (OR 6.33, 95% CI:1.31-30.51, p = 0.02) and high surgical 
      complexity score (OR 8.86, 95% CI:1.88-41.76, p = 0.006) had a significant higher 
      risk for severe postoperative complications. According to multivariable cox 
      regression Frailty Index >0.15 (hazard ratio (HR) (HR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.01-3.47, 
      p = 0.048), residual tumor <1 cm (HR 2.75, 95%CI: 1.53-4.99, p = 0.001), residual 
      tumor >1 cm (HR 5.00, 95% CI: 2.74-9.13, p < 0.001) and albumin<35.5 g/dl (HR 
      1.92, 95% CI: 1.08-3.43, p = 0.03) resulted as significant parameters for poor 
      overall survival. Resulted as significant parameters for poor overall survival. 
      CONCLUSION: Next to surgical complexity score, ECOG PS > 1 and recurrent surgery, 
      Frailty Index >0.26 is associated with severe postoperative complications in

TI  - Comprehensive geriatric assessment in older adults with cancer: Recommendations 
      by the Italian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SIGG).
PG  - e13347
LID - 10.1111/eci.13347 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Optimizing the approach to older adults with cancer is now a 
      priority given the increasing frequency of new cancer diagnoses that are made in 
      the older population. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the 
      gold-standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer 
      treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of 
      frail older persons, and (3) designing person-tailored interventions. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the 
      literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA 
      model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach 
      to older patients with cancer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A widespread use of this 
      standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote 
      studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion 
      of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict 
      that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of 
      geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving 
      therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.

AB  - Older people with frailty and health crises have complex physical and social 
      needs. Modern emergency care systems are fast-flowing, using protocols optimised 
      for single-problem presentations. Systems must incorporate individualised care to 
      best serve people with multiple problems. Healthcare quality is typically 
      appraised with service metrics, such as department length of stay and mortality. 
      Worldwide, patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) and patient-reported 
      experience measures (PREM) are increasingly used in research, service development 
      and performance evaluation, paving the ground for their use to support individual 
      clinical decision-making. The PROMs and PREMs are person-centred metrics, which 
      inform healthcare decisions at the individual level and which at the strategic 
      level drive improvement through comparison of interprovider effectiveness. To 
      date, there is no PROM or PREM specifically developed for older people with 
      frailty and emergency care needs.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy, accounts for ~10% of hematologic 
      malignancies and predominantly affects the older population. It exhibits a 
      heterogeneous biology and a complex genetic phenotype that affect patient 
      prognosis. The treatment of MM has evolved significantly over the last decade 
      with the use of autologous stem cell transplantation and several novel agents. 
      Consequently, outcomes have improved in this time period, with the most impact in 
      younger patients. Management of MM in elderly frail patients requires a 
      thoughtful approach as majority of these patients carry multiple comorbidities 
      and are precluded from high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell 
      transplantation-accounting for the more modest improvement in outcomes. Assessing 
      transplant eligibility and performance status is a critical first step. 
      Subsequently, the choice of frontline therapy in transplant-ineligible frail 
      patients must balance efficacy with adverse effects to optimize quality of life. 
      Here, we review the current state of induction regimens in this patient 
      population.

AB  - The incidence of hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) cancers is increasing worldwide. 
      Despite improvements in cancer surveillance and earlier access to therapy, these 
      cancers still have poor survival rates, especially in elderly patients. There are 
      several challenges in elucidating the epidemiology of these malignancies 
      especially in view of the heterogeneous exposure to recognised risk factors and 
      the coding systems used. Early diagnosis, crucial to improved survival, remains 
      challenging as many patients present sporadically. Furthermore, the indolent 
      nature of these tumours means they tend to present late, when curative treatments 
      are no longer an option. Importantly, even when patients are diagnosed early and 
      treated with curative intent, recurrence rates remain high. HPB cancers display a 
      heterogenous molecular profile resulting in poorly effective systemic therapies 
      in patients for whom curative treatments cannot be considered. Globally, people 
      now live longer, and it is predicted that the population of individuals older 
      than 85 will double by 2033. With increasing age comes increased cancer risk. 
      There is a plethora of recognised challenges in elderly patients presenting with 
      cancer and this is no different with HPB cancers. Complex co-morbidities 
      including chronic disease, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and increasing 
      psychosocial needs confer an extra layer of complexity in the management of this 
      elderly sub population. The frailty that usually accompanies advancing age often 
      means that patients take longer to recover and develop more complications after 
      cancer therapies. In this article, we review the epidemiology of malignant HPB 
      tumours with a focus on the elderly.

AB  - Elderly patients represent a growing proportion of the acute coronary syndrome 
      population in Western countries. However, their frequent atypical symptoms at 
      presentation often lead to delays in management and to misdiagnosis. Furthermore, 
      their prognosis is poorer than that of younger patients because of physiological 
      changes in platelet function, haemostasis and fibrinolysis, but also a higher 
      proportion of comorbidities and frailty, both of which increase the risk of 
      recurrent thrombotic and bleeding events. This complex situation, with ischaemic 
      and haemorrhagic risk factors often being intertwined, may lead to confusion 
      about the required treatment strategy, sometimes resulting in inadequate 
      management or even to therapeutic nihilism. It is therefore critical to provide a 
      comprehensive overview of our understanding of the pathophysiological processes 
      underlying acute coronary syndrome in elderly patients, and to summarise the 
      results from the latest clinical trials to help decision making for these 
      high-risk patients.

TI  - A narrative review of frailty assessment in older patients at the emergency 
      department.

AB  - Optimizing emergency care for the aging population is an important future 
      challenge, as the proportion of older patients at the emergency department (ED) 
      rapidly increases. Older patients, particularly those who are frail, have a high 
      risk of adverse outcomes after an ED visit, such as functional decline, 
      institutionalization, and death. The ED can have a key position in identifying 
      frail older patients who benefit most from comprehensive geriatric care 
      [including delirium preventive measures, early evaluation of after-discharge 
      care, and a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)]. However, performing 
      extensive frailty assessment is not suitable at the ED. Therefore, quick and 
      easy-to-use instruments are needed to identify older patients at risk for adverse 
      outcomes. This narrative review outlines the importance and complexity of frailty 
      assessment at the ED. It aligns the available screening instruments, including 
      clinical judgment as frailty assessment, and summarizes arguments for and against 
      frailty assessment at the ED.

TI  - Impact of Social Frailty on Relocation of Older Adults.
PG  - 254-258
LID - 10.14283/jfa.2021.3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between frailty and variables such as housing are 
      the least included in models of frailty and research on frailty or social frailty 
      and relocation is negligible. The decision to relocate is complex and demanding 
      for older adults with a loss of independence but little is known about what makes 
      older adults relocate to congregated housing designated for older adults, let 
      alone in combination with social frailty, and how they navigate this transition. 
      OBJECTIVES: This mixed method descriptive study aims to understand the influence 
      of social frailty for a population of French-speaking semi-independent older 
      adults relocating to a housing continuum community. DESIGN: Semi-structured 
      individual interviews including sociodemographic data and the PRISMA-7 Frailty 
      Scale were conducted with recently relocated older adults. SETTING: A newly 
      opened French-speaking housing continuum community in Eastern Canada that offers 
      luxury apartments for independent older adults, two assisted living facilities 
      for semi-independent older adults along with a long-term care facility. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine older adults with a mean age of 85 years, mostly 
      female, married or widowed and highly educated. MEASUREMENTS: Content analysis of 
      the transcribed recorded interviews and descriptive statistical analyses to 
      examine relationships between the frailty PRISMA-7 scale, answers to additional 
      questions and the sociodemographic data. RESULTS: There was not a significant 
      difference in the scores for socialization before and after relocation nor 
      between prior help and current help; however, there was a significant negative 
      correlation between help and socialization before and after relocation. Three 
      main themes included: imposed influences, push and pull factors and post 
      relocation. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that several social factors 
      contributed to relocation and that participants were experiencing social frailty. 
      Participants were at the crossover point of being vulnerable to experiencing 
      additional deficits which would potentially have led to higher frailty had they 
      not relocated.

TI  - Biological aspects of aging that influence response to anticancer treatments.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000536 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer is a disease of older adults, where fitness and frailty 
      are a continuum. This aspect poses unique challenges to the management of cancer 
      in this population. In this article, we review the biological aspects influencing 
      the efficacy and safety of systemic anticancer treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: The 
      organ function decline associated with the ageing process affects multiple 
      systems, including liver, kidney, bone marrow, heart, muscles and central nervous 
      system. These can have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of systemic anticancer agents. Comorbidities also represent a 
      key aspect to consider in decision-making. Renal disease, liver conditions and 
      cardiovascular risk factors are prevalent in this age group and may impact the 
      risk of adverse outcomes in this setting. SUMMARY: The systematic integration of 
      geriatrics principles in the routine management of older adults with cancer is a 
      unique opportunity to address the complexity of this population and is standard 
      of care based on a wide range of benefits. This approach should be 
      multidisciplinary and involve careful discussion with hospital pharmacists.

TI  - A systematic review and gap analysis of frailty and oral health characteristics 
      in older adults: A call for clinical translation.
PG  - 338-350
LID - 10.1111/ger.12577 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This systematic review updates the evidence for association between 
      oral health characteristics and frailty status, identifying gaps in translational 
      dental research and application of frailty assessment into clinical practice. 
      BACKGROUND: Clinicians have little guidance on stage-appropriate dental treatment 
      for medically complex older adults. Oral health characteristics have been 
      associated with frailty status, determined through validated assessment tools 
      representing a concise measure of health. Translation of frailty assessment into 
      dental practice has not been the focus of previous reviews. METHODS: Utilising 
      the PRISMA framework for systematic reviews, a comprehensive database search 
      identified articles describing the association of interest. Those included were 
      cross-sectional or longitudinal, in English, included participants aged 50 years 
      or older, used validated frailty assessments and measured clinically relevant 
      oral health outcomes. From 835 screened articles, 26 full-text articles were 
      eligible for quality appraisal and synthesis. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence ranged 
      from 8.5% to 66.0%. Most studies utilised the Fried frailty criteria. Qualitative 
      synthesis of 17 cross-sectional and nine longitudinal studies demonstrated 
      significant covariate-adjusted association between frailty status and number of 
      teeth, chewing ability, prosthetic characteristics, dental caries, periodontitis, 
      dental utilisation and oral health-related quality of life factors. Variability 
      in findings reflected study sample diversity based on country of study origin, 
      age at recruitment, sample size, frailty assessment type, use of clinical versus 
      self-reported outcome measures and differences in statistical analysis. 
      CONCLUSION: Despite robust evidence of association with oral health 
      characteristics, frailty assessment has yet to be sufficiently applied to 
      translational dental research and clinical practice.

TI  - Association Between Fear of Falling and Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older 
      Adults: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 129-140
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S328423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Fear of falling (FoF) and frailty are common problems in 
      older adults. FoF can lead to self-imposed restriction of activities and then 
      further decline in physical capacities that predispose older adults to frailty. 
      Evaluating the association of these two geriatric syndromes may be the first step 
      for understanding their complex relationship and might ultimately lead to 
      establishing therapeutic goals and guiding treatments for older adults with 
      frailty. This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence regarding the 
      association between FoF and frailty. METHODS: All the articles that provided 
      information on the association between FoF and frailty were selected from PubMed, 
      Scopus, CINAHL, and EMBASE in search of relevant papers. Articles reporting 
      information on the association between FoF (exposure) and frailty (outcome), with 
      older adults (age ≥60 years) living in the community (ie, living either at home 
      or in places of residence that do not provide nursing care or rehabilitation) 
      were included. Only original articles with observational design (cross-sectional 
      or longitudinal/cohort) were included. The methodological quality of included 
      articles was evaluated independently by the two assessors through the 
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical 
      appraisal checklist for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, respectively. 
      RESULTS: The initial searches found 4,342 articles, of which 10 articles were 
      included in this review: 7 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies, and 1 
      study with cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The total sample was 
      composed of 6,294 community-dwelling older adults (61.8% women). Among the 
      longitudinal studies, adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.18 (95% CI = 1.02; 1.36) 
      to 9.87 (95% CI = 5.22; 18.68), while the adjusted odds ratios of the 
      cross-sectional studies ranged from 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02; 1.07) to 7.16 (95% CI = 
      2.34; 21.89). CONCLUSION: FoF increases the risk of frailty in community-dwelling 
      older adults. The knowledge of this association is of utmost importance in 
      clinical practice, since it can help health professionals in the development of 
      rehabilitation, prevention, and health promotion protocols. In addition, these 
      findings can contribute to the development of public health policies and actions 
      aimed at reducing the FoF and consequently the frailty. PROSPERO: CRD42021276775.

TI  - The Dilemma of Falls in Older Persons: Never Forget to Investigate the Syncope.
LID - 10.3390/medicina57060623 [doi]
LID - 623
AB  - Background and objectives: Falls represent a major cause of morbidity, 
      hospitalizations, and mortality in older persons. The identification of risk 
      conditions for falling is crucial. This study investigated the presence of 
      syncope as a possible cause of falls in older persons admitted to a Sub-Acute 
      Care Unit (SACU) with a diagnosis of accidental fall after initial management in 
      an emergency department and acute hospitalization. Materials and methods: A 
      retrospective monocentric study of patients aged ≥65 years, consecutively 
      admitted to a SACU with a diagnosis of fall-related trauma. All patients 
      underwent a complete assessment of the index event and clinical status. Patients 
      were categorized into three groups according to the identified cause of falls: 
      (1) transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC), (2) unexplained fall (UF), and (3) 
      definite accidental fall (AF). Results: A total of 100 patients were evaluated. 
      T-LOC was present in 36 patients, UF in 37, and AF in 27. Of the 36 patients with 
      T-LOC, a probable origin was identified in most cases (n = 33, 91%), 19 subjects 
      (53%) had orthostatic hypotension, 9 (25%) a cardiac relevant disturbance, 2 (6%) 
      a reproduced vaso-vagal syncope, 2 (6%) severe anemia, and 1 (3%) severe 
      hypothyroidism. The T-LOC group was older and more clinically complex than the 
      other groups. Conclusion: In older patients who recently experienced a fall 
      event, the prevalence of syncope is relevant. In frail and clinically complex 
      patients with falls, the identification of the underlying cause is pivotal and 
      can be achieved through prolonged monitoring and a comprehensive assessment of 
      the person.

TI  - Frailty predicts outcome of partial nephrectomy and guides treatment decision 
      towards active surveillance and tumor ablation.
PG  - 2843-2851
LID - 10.1007/s00345-020-03556-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine frailty and comorbidity as predictors of outcome of nephron 
      sparing surgery (NSS) and as decision tools for identifying candidates for active 
      surveillance (AS) or tumor ablation (TA). METHODS: Frailty and comorbidity were 
      assessed using the modified frailty index of the Canadian Study of Health and 
      Aging (11-CSHA) and the age-adjusted Charlson-Comorbidity Index (aaCCI) as well 
      as albumin and the radiological skeletal-muscle-index (SMI) in a cohort of 
      n = 447 patients with localized renal masses. Renal tumor anatomy was classified 
      according to the RENAL nephrometry system. Regression analyses were performed to 
      assess predictors of surgical outcome of patients undergoing NSS as well as to 
      identify possible influencing factors of patients undergoing alternative 
      therapies (AS/TA). RESULTS: Overall 409 patient underwent NSS while 38 received 
      AS or TA. Patients undergoing TA/AS were more likely to be frail or comorbid 
      compared to patients undergoing NSS (aaCCI: p < 0.001, 11-CSHA: p < 0.001). 
      Gender and tumor complexity did not vary between patients of different treatment 
      approach. 11-CSHA and aaCCI were identified as independent predictors of major 
      postoperative complications (11-CSHA ≥ 0.27: OR = 3.6, p = 0.001) and hospital 
      re-admission (aaCCI ≥ 6: OR = 4.93, p = 0.003) in the NSS cohort. No impact was 
      found for albumin levels and SMI. An aaCCI > 6 and/or 11-CSHA ≥ 0.27 (OR = 9.19, 
      p < 0.001), a solitary kidney (OR = 5.43, p = 0.005) and hypoalbuminemia 
      (OR = 4.6, p = 0.009), but not tumor complexity, were decisive factors to undergo 
      AS or TA rather than NSS. CONCLUSION: In patients with localized renal masses, 
      frailty and comorbidity indices can be useful to predict surgical outcome and 
      support decision-making towards AS or TA.

TI  - Strategies to simplify complex medication regimens.
PG  - 43-48
LID - 10.31128/AJGP-04-20-5322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people use increasingly complex medication regimens. Complex 
      regimens are challenging to administer, particularly for those with cognitive 
      impairment, frailty, poor eyesight or limited dexterity. Complex regimens have 
      been linked to non-adherence, medication errors and hospital admissions. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe strategies to reduce the 
      complexity of medication regimens in community and residential aged care 
      settings. DISCUSSION: Medication regimen simplification is the process of 
      reducing medication burden through strategies such as consolidating dosing times, 
      standardising routes of administration, using long-acting rather than 
      shorter-acting formulations, and switching to combination products in place of 
      single-ingredient products. Obtaining a best possible medication history, 
      ensuring appropriateness of current therapy, and deprescribing are important 
      steps prior to implementing regimen simplification. Implementing such strategies 
      should be based on a discussion and consideration of patient preferences, and 
      include clinical judgement to limit the risk of unintended consequences for 
      patients or carers.

TI  - The Effect of Orthostatic Hypotension Detected Pre-Operatively on Post-Operative 
      Outcome.
PG  - 767-772
LID - 10.1111/jgs.16966 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exacerbation of or new onset orthostatic hypotension in perioperative 
      patients can occur. There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further 
      derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery. 
      The implications for post-operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail 
      and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of 
      post-operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre-operative orthostatic 
      hypotension. METHODS: Supine and 1-minute and 3-minute standing blood pressure 
      measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or 
      uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post-operative outcome, specifically, 
      evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to 
      stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20 mmHg or more and/or 10 mmHg or 
      more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within 
      ~3 minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram. RESULTS: 
      Whilst all patients included had a 1-minute standing blood pressure assessment 
      (N = 170), 3-minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). 
      Nevertheless, one-quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre-operative 
      orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or 
      neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in 
      older patients and in those aged 65 years or more with higher clinical frailty 
      scale scores. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to 
      surgery within the planned study timescale (N = 143/170; 84.1%). Nevertheless, 
      patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital post-operatively 
      and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness and/or dizziness 
      documented (un-prompted) in their notes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further 
      impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with 
      orthostatic hypotension. These risks are not confined to those with a 
      pre-existing dysautonomia diagnosis.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third 
      highly pathogenic coronavirus to emerge in the human population in last two 
      decades. SARS-CoV-2 spread from Wuhan, China, across the globe, causing an 
      unprecedented public healthcare crisis. The virus showed remarkable age dependent 
      pathology, with symptoms resembling common cold in most adults and children while 
      causing more severe respiratory distress and significant mortality in older and 
      frail humans. Even before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak infectious diseases represented 
      one of the major causes of death of older adults. Loss of immune function and 
      reduced protection from infectious agents with age - immunosenescence - is a 
      result of complex mechanisms affecting production and maintenance of immune cells 
      as well as the initiation, maintenance and termination of properly directed 
      immune responses. Here we briefly discuss the current knowledge on how this 
      process affects age-dependent outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Pre-operative frailty is predictive of adverse post-operative outcomes in 
      colorectal cancer patients.

LID - 10.1111/ans.16319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of elderly patients are presenting for elective 
      surgery. Pre-operative risk assessment in this population is inexact due to the 
      complex interplay between age, comorbidity and functional status. Frailty 
      assessment may provide a surrogate measure of a patient's physiological reserve 
      and aid operative decision-making. The aim of this study is to determine the 
      association between pre-operative frailty, as assessed using the Edmonton Frail 
      Scale, and post-operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective 
      colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: A prospective analysis of 86 patients over 
      the age of 65 undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery at a tertiary centre 
      between October 2017 and October 2018 was performed. Frailty assessment was 
      conducted pre-operatively using the Edmonton Frail Scale. Primary outcomes 
      included length of stay and post-operative complication rates. Multivariable 
      logistic regression analyses were used to determine the influence of frailty on 
      post-operative outcomes including mortality, prolonged hospital admission, 
      complication rates and quality of life. RESULTS: Of 86 patients, 12 (14.0%) were 
      identified as frail. Frailty was associated with a significantly increased median 
      length of stay (20 days versus 6 days, incidence rate ratio 2.83, P < 0.01) and a 
      significantly increased risk of major post-operative complications (50.0% versus 
      6.7%, odds ratio 13.8, P < 0.01). Frailty was not associated with a significant 
      reduction in quality of life scores at 30 and 90 days post-operatively. 
      CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with adverse post-operative outcomes in elderly 
      patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. Frailty assessment is an 
      important component of pre-operative risk assessment and may identify targets for 
      pre-operative optimisation.

AB  - Polypharmacy is an important aspect of medication management and particularly 
      affects elderly and chronically ill people. Patients with dementia, Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), or multiple sclerosis (MS) are at high risk of multi medication due 
      to their complex symptomatology. Our aim was to provide an overview of different 
      definitions of polypharmacy and to present the current state of research on 
      polypharmacy in patients with dementia, PD, or MS. The most common definition of 
      polypharmacy in the literature is the concomitant use of ≥5 medications 
      (quantitative definition approach). Polypharmacy rates of up to >50% have been 
      reported for patients with dementia, PD, or MS, although MS patients are on 
      average significantly younger than those with dementia or PD. The main predictor 
      of polypharmacy is the complex symptom profile of these neurological disorders. 
      Potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), drug-drug interactions, poor 
      treatment adherence, severe disease course, cognitive impairment, 
      hospitalisation, poor quality of life, frailty, and mortality have been 
      associated with polypharmacy in patients with dementia, PD, or MS. For patients 
      with polypharmacy, either the avoidance of PIM (selective deprescribing) or the 
      substitution of PIM with more suitable drugs (appropriate polypharmacy) is 
      recommended to achieve a more effective therapeutic management.

AB  - In the recent years a lot of attention has been gathered by the issue of frailty 
      outside the boundaries of the geriatric medicine, for example in the field of 
      cardiovascular medicine. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is known as a very common 
      cardiological condition, often burdened by high level of clinical complexity. Aim 
      of this narrative review is to examine the most relevant evidence about the 
      relationship between frailty and AF, focusing also on its impact on clinical 
      management and natural history of patients with this condition. Data reported 
      underline how a relevant relationship exists between these two conditions, even 
      though the burden of frailty among AF cohorts is still unclear. Frailty seems to 
      affect the clinical management, even though no definitive data are yet available. 
      Lastly, frailty significantly increases the risk of all-cause mortality but it's 
      still unclear the impact on thromboembolic and bleeding events. Despite several 
      data are already available, more research is still needed to fully elucidate the 
      relationship between these two clinical entities.

      Study.
PG  - 160-167
LID - 10.14283/jfa.2020.57 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty and cognitive impairment are common manifestations of the 
      ageing process and are closely related. But the mechanisms linking aging, 
      physical frailty, and cognitive disorders, are complex and remain unclear. 
      OBJECTIVES: We aim to explore the role of cerebral amyloid pathology, but also a 
      range of nutritional, physical, biological or brain-aging marker in the 
      development of cognitive frailty. METHOD: COGFRAIL study is a monocentric 
      prospective study of frail older patients with an objective cognitive impairment 
      (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale global score at 0.5 or 1). 
      Three-hundred-and-twenty-one patients are followed up every 6 months, for 2 
      years. Clinical assessment at baseline and during follow-up included frailty, 
      physical, mood, sensory, nutritional, and cognitive assessment (with a set of 
      neuropsychological tests). Cerebral amyloid pathology is measured by amyloid 
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or amyloid-β-1-42 level in cerebrospinal 
      fluid. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, measurement of body composition using 
      Dual X Ray Absorptiometry and blood sampling are performed. The main outcome of 
      the study is to assess the prevalence of positive cerebral amyloid status 
      according to amyloid PET or amyloid-β-1-42 level CSF. Secondary outcomes included 
      biological, nutritional, MRI imaging, cognitive, clinical, physical and body 
      composition markers to better understand the mechanisms of cognitive frailty. 
      PERSPECTIVE: COGFRAIL study will give the opportunity to better understand the 
      link between Gerosciences, frailty, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's 
      disease, and to better characterize the physical and cognitive trajectories of 
      frail older adults according to their amyloid status. Understanding the 
      relationship between physical frailty and cognitive impairment is a prerequisite 
      for the development of new interventions that could prevent and treat both 
      conditions.

AB  - The implementation of effective interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) 
      is perceived as one of the most pressing research priorities in the field of 
      dementia and one of the main unmet needs from the perspective of affected 
      individuals and their caregivers and relatives. Nevertheless, to date, only a 
      relatively marginal part of dementia research has focused on NPS. This study 
      aimed to describe and discuss the state of the art concerning the identification 
      and development of new pharmacological treatments for NPS in dementia. A review 
      of 320 ongoing phase 1, 2, 3, and 4 protocols registered in the 
      clinicaltrials.gov database was performed. All the trials enrolling patients with 
      dementia were selected. Only studies adopting clinical measures of NPS frequency 
      and/or severity as primary outcome were retained and analyzed. Overall, only a 
      minority of ongoing phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 protocols on dementia (i.e., 9.0%) is 
      primarily targeting NPS. Most of these studies are adopting a placebo-controlled 
      parallel assignment design, testing oral compounds, and targeting specific NPS 
      (mostly agitation and/or aggression). A total of 3,445 subjects with dementia 
      will tentatively be recruited in these trials. The methodologies adopted in these 
      studies, the characteristics of the tested interventions, the eligibility 
      criteria, and the operational definitions of NPS are presented and discussed. The 
      relevance of NPS is not yet matched by an adequate research effort. The current 
      tendency at privileging disease-modifying approaches and other symptoms of 
      dementia and the methodological complexity of studying NPS are still 
      substantially contributing to the gap between research activities and clinical 
      needs.

TI  - Aspirin and statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 
      older adults.

AB  - The value of primary preventative therapies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 
      older adults (age ≥75 years) is less certain than in younger patients. There is a 
      lack of quality evidence in older adults due to underenrolment in pivotal trials. 
      While aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in primary prevention of 
      CVD in older adults, statins may be efficacious. However, it is unclear which 
      patient subgroups may benefit most, and guidelines differ between expert panels. 
      Three relevant geriatric conditions (cognitive impairment, functional impairment 
      and polypharmacy) may influence therapeutic decision making; for example, 
      baseline frailty may affect statin efficacy, and some have advocated for 
      deprescription in this scenario. Evidence regarding statins and incident 
      functional decline are mixed, and vigilance for adverse effects is important, 
      especially in the setting of polypharmacy. However, aspirin has not been shown to 
      affect incident cognitive or functional decline, and its lack of efficacy extends 
      to patients with baseline cognitive impairment or frailty. Ultimately, the 
      utility of primary preventative therapies for CVD in older adults depends on 
      potential lifetime benefit. Rather than basing treatment decisions on absolute 
      risk alone, consideration of comorbidities, polypharmacy and life expectancy 
      should play a significant role in decision making. Coronary calcium score and new 
      tools for risk stratification validated in older adults that account for the 
      competing risk of death may aid in evaluating potential benefits. Given the 
      complexity of therapeutic decisions in this context, shared decision making 
      provides an important framework.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a common but complex problem in older adults. Frailty 
      assessment using routine clinical data has been suggested as a pragmatic approach 
      based on electronic health records from primary care center or hospital settings. 
      PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the tools and outcome variables used in the 
      published studies on frailty assessment using routine clinical data. METHODS: An 
      integrative literature review was conducted using the method of Whittemore and 
      Knafl. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from 
      January 2010 to October 2021. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies and thirteen frailty 
      assessment tools were analyzed. The assessment items were generally biased toward 
      frailty's risk factors rather than the mechanisms or phenotypes of frailty. 
      Similar to using conventional tools, routine clinical data-based frailty was 
      associated with adverse health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessment based on 
      routine clinical data could efficiently evaluate frailty using electronic health 
      records from primary care centers or hospitals. However, they need refinement to 
      consider the risk factors, mechanisms, and frailty phenotypes.

TI  - Identification of traumatic acid as a potential plasma biomarker for sarcopenia 
      using a metabolomics-based approach.
PG  - 276-286
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.12895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and has not been well 
      explored. Identifying biomarkers is a promising strategy for exploring the 
      mechanism of sarcopenia. This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers of 
      sarcopenia through a metabolomic analysis of plasma metabolites in elderly 
      subjects (≥65 years of age) vs. younger adults (<65 years of age). METHODS: Of 
      the 168 candidates in the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and Frailty Study of 
      Elderly Outpatients, 24 elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) with sarcopenia were 
      age and sex matched with 24 elderly subjects without sarcopenia. In addition, 24 
      younger adults were recruited for comparison. Muscle strength, gait speed, and 
      metabolic and inflammatory parameters, including plasma tumour necrosis factor-α, 
      C-reactive protein, irisin, and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) levels 
      were assessed. Metabolomic analysis was carried out using the plasma metabolites. 
      RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were enrolled, including 10 (41.6%) men and 14 
      (58.3%) women in both groups of elderly subjects. The median ages of elderly 
      subjects with and without sarcopenia were 82 (range: 67-88) and 81.5 (range: 
      67-87) years, respectively. Among the 242 plasma metabolic peaks analysed among 
      these three groups, traumatic acid was considered as a sarcopenia-related 
      metabolite. The plasma traumatic acid signal intensity level was significantly 
      higher in elderly subjects with sarcopenia than in elderly subjects without 
      sarcopenia [591.5 (inter-quartile range, IQR: 491.5-664.5) vs. 430.0 (IQR: 
      261.0-599.5), P = 0.0063]. The plasma concentrations of traumatic acid were 15.8 
      (IQR: 11.5-21.7), 21.1 (IQR: 16.0-25.8), and 24.3 (IQR: 18.0-29.5) ppb in younger 
      adults [age range: 23-37 years, 12 (50%) men], elderly subjects without 
      sarcopenia, and elderly subjects with sarcopenia, respectively, thereby depicting 
      an increasing tendency (P for trend = 0.034). This pattern was similar to that of 
      GDF-15, a recognized sarcopenia-related factor. Plasma traumatic acid 
      concentrations were also positively correlated with the presence of hypertension 
      (r = 0.25, P = 0.034), glucose AC (r = 0.34, P = 0.0035), creatinine (r = 0.40, 
      P = 0.0006), and GDF-15 levels (r = 0.25, P = 0.0376), but negatively correlated 
      with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-simplify-glomerular filtration 
      rate (r = -0.50, P < 0.0001). Similarly, plasma GDF-15 concentrations were 
      associated with these factors. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic acid might represent a 
      potential plasma biomarker of sarcopenia. However, further studies are needed to 
      validate the results and investigate the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Recognizing and responding to deterioration in care homes: a scoping review 
      protocol.
PG  - 447-453
LID - 10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00413 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the available published primary research and any relevant 
      policies, guidelines, or protocols regarding how care home staff recognize and 
      respond to an acutely deteriorating resident. INTRODUCTION: Older people living 
      in care homes have complex health care needs. Chronic illnesses, comorbidities, 
      frailty, cognitive impairment, and physical dependency can contribute to 
      unpredictable changes in their health status that can lead to residents becoming 
      unwell and acutely deteriorating. Exploring how care home staff recognize and 
      respond to acutely deteriorating health among residents is important to 
      understand whether opportunities exist to minimize these unpredictable changes in 
      health. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will consider studies that 
      feature the recognition and response to acute deterioration in care home 
      residents. This review will consider qualitative and quantitative primary 
      research. Non-indexed and gray literature such as policies, deterioration tools, 
      and reports from health policy organizations will also be included. METHODS: The 
      searches will be conducted using bibliographic databases, university 
      repositories, and non-indexed and gray literature, such as reports by health care 
      and health policy organizations. The studies will be independently selected from 
      the inclusion criteria by two researchers based on their title and abstract. In 
      case of disagreement, a third researcher will be consulted. An adapted version of 
      the JBI data extraction form will be used to extrapolate data from included 
      studies. The results will be presented in tabular form, accompanied by a 
      narrative summary related to the objectives of the scoping review.

      Return Visits.
PG  - 395-406
LID - 10.1177/00084174211051165 [doi]
AB  - Background. Occupational therapy facilitates care for complex frail emergency 
      department (ED) patients who may have unscheduled return visits (URVs). Purpose. 
      To determine the prevalence of frailty amongst ED patients referred to 
      occupational therapy and if frailty affected the rates and reasons for URVs. 
      Methods. A mixed-methods health records review was conducted of older adults 
      referred to an ED-based occupational therapy program. Findings. Most patients 
      were frail (60.6%). 31.0% of patients discharged home had a URV within 30 days, 
      with no difference in URV rates between frail and non-frail populations. 
      Providing occupational therapy education reduced the frequency of URVs. Frail 
      patients had complex reasons for their URVs, including functional, 
      social/environmental, safety concerns, and/or "failure to thrive". Occupational 
      therapy ED patients were typically vulnerable to moderately frail, dependent in 
      some activities of daily living, and complex. Implications. ED-based occupational 
      therapists must be aware of their patient's frailty and risk of URVs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is a common problem worldwide. It carries the risk of 
      reduced quality of life, disability, frequent hospitalizations, and death. The 
      present study was designed to assess the relationships that exist between 
      multimorbidity and disability in elderly patients. METHODS: The study included 
      100 patients and was conducted between October 2020 and January 2021. Inclusion 
      criteria included age &gt;65 years, presence of a minimum of two comorbidities in 
      the subject, and consent to participate in the study. Standardized survey 
      instruments such as Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), Charlson Comorbidities Index 
      (CCI), Assessment of Basic Activities of Daily Living-Katz Scale (ADL), and 
      Assessment of Complex Activities of Daily Living-Lawton Scale (IADL) were used in 
      the study. RESULTS: The majority of the subjects (92) had a frailty syndrome 
      (TFI). A small group of respondents (8%) suffered from severe comorbidities 
      (CCI). Among the subjects surveyed, 71% maintained full function in performing 
      simple activities of daily living (ADL), while 29% demonstrated moderate 
      disability on the scale. Full independence in performing complex activities of 
      daily living (IADL) was present in 33% of the respondents, and 67% were partially 
      independent. Independence in complex activities of daily living (IADL) was 
      significantly higher in patients with fewer comorbidities. The severity of 
      comorbidities (CCI) had a significant effect on the decrease in the level of 
      independence (ADL and IADL). Independence in performing complex activities (IADL) 
      was worse among older patients. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the number of 
      comorbidities contributes to a decrease in the level of performance of complex 
      activities of daily living. The severity of comorbidities significantly reduces 
      the level of independence of the subjects in simple and complex activities of 
      daily living. In patients with a higher level of independence in performing 
      simple and complex activities, the co-occurrence of frailty syndrome was less 
      severe. As the age of the subjects increases, the frequency in which they show 
      moderate dependence on third parties in performing complex activities of daily 
      living increases.

      Frailty Screening in Nursing Homes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate frailty prevalence, cross-sectional associations, 
      predictive validity, concurrent validity, and cross-cultural adaptations of the 
      FRAIL-NH scale. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Frail 
      residents living in nursing homes. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane 
      Library were searched from January 2015 to June 2021 for primary studies that 
      used the FRAIL-NH scale, irrespective of study designs and publication language. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 40 studies conducted across 20 countries utilized the FRAIL-NH 
      scale; majority in Australia (n=14), followed by China (n=6), United States 
      (n=3), and Spain (n=3). The scale has been translated and back-translated into 
      Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. Various cut-offs have been used, 
      with ≥2 and ≥6 being the most common cut-offs for frail and most frail, 
      respectively. When defined using these cut-offs, frailty prevalence varied from 
      15.1-79.5% (frail) to 28.5-75.0% (most frail). FRAIL-NH predicted falls (n=2), 
      hospitalization or length of stay (n=4), functional or cognitive decline (n=4), 
      and mortality (n=9) over a median follow-up of 12 months. FRAIL-NH has been 
      compared to 16 other scales, and was correlated with Fried's phenotype (FP), 
      Frailty Index (FI), and FI-Lab. Four studies reported fair-to-moderate agreements 
      between FRAIL-NH and FI, FP, and the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. Ten 
      studies assessed the sensitivity and specificity of different FRAIL-NH cut-offs, 
      with ≥8 having the highest sensitivity (94.1%) and specificity (82.8%) for 
      classifying residents as frail based on FI, while two studies reported an optimal 
      cut-off of ≥2 based on FI and FP, respectively. CONCLUSION: In seven years, the 
      FRAIL-NH scale has been applied in 20 countries and adapted into three languages. 
      Despite being applied with a range of cut-offs, FRAIL-NH was associated with 
      higher care needs and demonstrated good agreement with other well-established but 
      more complex scales. FRAIL-NH was predictive of adverse outcomes across different 
      settings, highlighting its value in guiding care for frail residents in nursing 
      homes.

AB  - There are two peaks of diagnosis of epilepsy: in childhood and in people over 65. 
      Older people may have complex needs like co-morbidity, polypharmacy, frailty, and 
      social isolation. This scoping review focusses on the care of older people with 
      epilepsy beyond diagnosis and medical treatment. We sought to identify areas 
      within the UK health service needing development either in clinical practice or 
      through further research. The search returned 4864 papers with 33 papers included 
      in the review. The papers were grouped into psychosocial, self-management and 
      services themes. Only one randomised controlled trial was found. Research was 
      mainly based on cohort and case-control studies. Older people require more 
      information to self-manage epilepsy and more psychological support to help with 
      symptoms of anxiety and depression. People reported experiencing stigma and a 
      reluctance to disclose their condition. This may increase the risk of isolation 
      and difficulties in managing epilepsy. Studies reported that older people are 
      referred less to neurologists, suggesting there may be a gap in care provision 
      compared to younger people. Generalist health professionals may be better placed 
      to provide holistic care, but they may need additional training to alleviate 
      uncertainties in managing epilepsy. Care plans could help provide information, 
      particularly for co-morbidity, but few had one. Our findings highlight 
      psychological and self-management needs for managing epilepsy in older people. 
      Health service staff may require upskilling to shift epilepsy management from 
      neurologists to generalists. More research is needed regarding psychological and 
      self-management interventions, particularly in the form of randomised controlled 
      trials.

TI  - Frailty Index, Hospital Admission and Number of Days Spent in Hospital in Nursing 
      Home Residents: Results from the Incur Study.
PG  - 155-159
LID - 10.1007/s12603-020-1561-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive capacity of an age-related deficit 
      accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood) for 
      hospital admission (HA) and number of days spent in hospital (DSH) among nursing 
      home residents. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data are from a longitudinal 
      cohort study, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home 
      Residents (INCUR), of 768 elder people (75.4% women) living in 13 nursing homes 
      in France. MEASUREMENTS: The FI was computed taking into account 30 possible 
      deficits at the baseline visit. Hospital admissions were defined as all urgent 
      and involuntary admissions including unplanned readmissions. The length of stay 
      was the total number of days spent by the resident in the hospital. Cox 
      proportional hazard models in the presence of competing risks (death) were 
      performed to study the relationship between the FI and HA over a 12-month 
      follow-up. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was performed to study 
      the association between the FI and DSH. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 
      86.7 (standard deviation [SD] 6.9) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11). At 
      the end of the follow-up, 238 (30.9%) HA events were recorded. Positive 
      associations of the FI with DSH and HA were reported (per 0.01 FI increment: age- 
      and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.020-1.297, 
      p=0.02 and OR 1.209 (1.075 - 1.359, p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: The FI is a strong predictor of negative health-related outcomes as 
      HA and DSH events, even with very old and complex nursing home residents.

TI  - Aging of enteric neuromuscular systems in gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - e14352
LID - 10.1111/nmo.14352 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aging is a complex biological process and associated with a 
      progressive decline in functions of most organs including the gastrointestinal 
      (GI) tract. Age-related GI motor disorders/dysfunctions include esophageal 
      reflux, dysphagia, constipation, fecal incontinence, reduced compliance, and 
      accommodation. Although the incidence and severity of these diseases and 
      conditions increase with age, they are often underestimated due in part to 
      nonspecific and variable symptoms and lack of sufficient medical attention. They 
      negatively affect quality of life and predispose the elderly to other diseases, 
      sarcopenia, and frailty. The mechanisms underlying aging-associated GI 
      dysfunctions remain unclear, and there is limited data examining the effect of 
      aging on GI motor functions. Many studies on aging-associated changes to cells 
      within the tunica muscularis including enteric neurons, smooth muscles, and 
      interstitial cells have proposed that cell loss and/or molecular changes may be 
      involved in the pathogenesis of age-related GI motor disorders/dysfunctions. 
      There is also evidence that the aging contributes to phenotypic changes in innate 
      immune cells, which are physically and functionally linked to other cells in the 
      tunica muscularis and can alter GI (patho) physiology. However, various patterns 
      of changes have been reported, some of which are contradictory, indicating a need 
      for additional work in this area. PURPOSE: Although GI infection due to 
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bleeding, and cancers are also important and 
      common problems in the elderly patients, this mini-review focuses on data 
      obtained from enteric neuromuscular aging research with the goal of better 
      understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of enteric neuromuscular 
      aging to enhance future therapy.

TI  - The relationship between insomnia symptoms and frailty in community-dwelling 
      older persons: a path analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between sleep and frailty in older age is complex. 
      Most previous studies focused on sleep duration, while insomnia, a common sleep 
      problem in older adults, has not been adequately examined and the factors 
      implicated in its association with frailty were under-explored. METHODS: A 
      community-based sample of 345 prefrail and frail older adults were recruited and 
      completed the measures on insomnia symptoms (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and 
      frailty status (FRAIL Scale). The relationship between insomnia symptoms and 
      frailty, with potential mediators including physical performance (Short Physical 
      Performance Battery), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and level of 
      physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly), were tested in path 
      analysis adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and sleep medications. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep-onset insomnia was higher in frail participants 
      than their prefrail counterparts (48% vs. 34%, aOR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.09, 2.76; 
      p = 0.02), but there was no significant difference in the prevalence of 
      sleep-maintenance insomnia (61% vs. 54%). The association between sleep-onset 
      insomnia and frailty was explained by reduced physical performance (standardized 
      coefficient = 0.11; 95% BCa CI [0.002, 0.233]), but not depression and level of 
      physical activity. Sleep-maintenance insomnia was not associated with frailty. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia symptoms are prevalent in frail and prefrail older adults. 
      Sleep-onset insomnia is associated with poorer physical performance, which is 
      further linked to a higher risk for frailty in older persons. The findings 
      highlight the importance of timely assessing and managing insomnia among older 
      adults at risk of frailty.

TI  - Frailty Assessment in the Emergency Department for Risk Stratification of 
      COVID-19 Patients Aged ≥80 Years.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in a cohort of adults aged ≥80 years, the overlapping 
      effect of clinical severity, comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and frailty, 
      for the in-hospital death risk stratification of COVID-19 older patients since 
      emergency department (ED) admission. DESIGN: Single-center prospective 
      observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in 
      the ED of a teaching hospital that is a referral center for COVID-19 in central 
      Italy. We enrolled all patients with aged ≥80 years old consecutively admitted to 
      the ED between April 2020 and March 2021. METHODS: Clinical variables assessed in 
      the ED were evaluated for the association with all-cause in-hospital death. 
      Evaluated parameters were severity of disease, frailty, comorbidities, cognitive 
      impairment, delirium, and dependency in daily life activities. Cox regression 
      analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for poor outcomes. 
      RESULTS: A total of 729 patients aged ≥80 years were enrolled [median age 
      85 years (interquartile range 82-89); 346 were males (47.3%)]. According to the 
      Clinical Frailty Scale, 61 (8.4%) were classified as fit, 417 (57.2%) as 
      vulnerable, and 251 (34.4%) as frail. Severe disease [hazard ratio (HR) 1.87, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.59], ≥3 comorbidities (HR 1.54, 95% CI 
      1.11-2.13), male sex (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.87), and frailty (HR 6.93, 95% CI 
      1.69-28.27) for vulnerable and an overall HR of 12.55 (95% CI 2.96-53.21) for 
      frail were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: The ED approach to older patients with COVID-19 should take into 
      account the functional and clinical characteristics of patients being admitted. A 
      sole evaluation based on the clinical severity and the presence of comorbidities 
      does not reflect the complexity of this population. A comprehensive evaluation 
      based on clinical severity, multimorbidity, and frailty could effectively predict 
      the clinical risk of in-hospital death for patients with COVID-19 aged ≥80 years 
      at the time of ED presentation.

TI  - Functional Performance After Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair: A Single-Center 
      Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 852-859
LID - 10.1177/15266028211028222 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Complex endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedures provide a treatment 
      option for patients with aortic aneurysms involving visceral branches. Good 
      technical results and short-term outcomes have been reported. Whether complex 
      EVAR provides acceptable functional outcomes is not clear. The current study aims 
      to describe postoperative functional outcomes in complex EVAR patients-an older 
      and relatively frail patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center 
      retrospective cohort study was performed, using data from a computerized database 
      of consecutive patients who underwent complex EVAR in the Leiden University 
      Medical Center (LUMC, The Netherlands) between July 2013 and September 2020. As 
      of May 2017, patients scheduled for complex EVAR were referred to a geriatric 
      care pathway to determine (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) 
      scores at baseline and, if informed consent was given, after 12 months. For the 
      total patient group, adverse functional performance outcomes were: discharge to a 
      nursing home and 12-month mortality. For the patients included in geriatric 
      follow-up, the additional outcome was the incidence of functional decline 
      (defined by a ≥2 point increase in (I)ADL-score) at 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: 
      Eighty-two patients underwent complex EVAR, of which 68 (82.9%) were male. Mean 
      age was 73.3 years (SD=6.3). Within 30 days postsurgery, 6 patients (7.3%) died. 
      Mortality within 12 months for the total patient group was 14.6% (n=12). After 
      surgery, no patients had to be discharged to a nursing home. Fifteen patients 
      (18.3%) were discharged to a rehabilitation center. Twenty-three patients gave 
      informed consent and were included in geriatric follow-up. Five patients (21.7%) 
      presented functional decline 12 months postsurgery and 4 patients had died 
      (17.4%) by that time. This means that 39.1% of the patients in the care pathway 
      suffered an adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the only study 
      that examined functional performance after complex EVAR, using a prospectively 
      maintained database. No patients were newly discharged to a nursing home and 
      functional performance results at 12 months are promising. Future 
      multidisciplinary research should focus on determining which patients are most 
      prone to deterioration of function, so that efforts can be directed toward 
      preventing postoperative functional decline.

TI  - Challenges in Geriatric Oncology-A Surgeon's Perspective.
PG  - 659-674
LID - 10.3390/curroncol29020058 [doi]
AB  - As our global population ages, we will see more cancer diagnoses in older adults. 
      Surgery is an important treatment modality for solid tumours, forming the 
      majority of all cancers. However, the management of older adults with cancer can 
      be more complex compared to their younger counterparts. This narrative review 
      will outline the current challenges facing older adults with cancer and potential 
      solutions. The challenges facing older adults with cancer are complex and include 
      lack of high-level clinical trials targeting older adults and selection of the 
      right patient for surgery. This may be standard surgical treatment, minimally 
      invasive surgery or alternative therapies (no surgery) which can be local or 
      systemic. The next challenge is to identify the individual patient's 
      vulnerabilities to allow them to be maximally optimised for treatment. 
      Prehabilitation has been shown to be of benefit in some cancer settings but 
      uniform guidance across all surgical specialties is required. Greater awareness 
      of geriatric conditions amongst surgical oncologists and integration of geriatric 
      assessment into a surgical clinic are potential solutions. Enhanced recovery 
      programmes tailored to older adults could reduce postoperative functional 
      decline. Ultimately, the greatest challenge an older adult with cancer may face 
      is the mindset of their treating clinicians-a shared care approach between 
      surgical oncologists and geriatricians is required.

TI  - Clinical trials in older people.

LID - afab282
AB  - Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) usually provide the best evidence for 
      treatments and management. Historically, older people have often been excluded 
      from clinical medication trials due to age, multimorbidity and disabilities. The 
      situation is improving, but still the external validity of many trials may be 
      questioned. Individuals participating in trials are generally less complex than 
      many patients seen in geriatric clinics. Recruitment and retention of older 
      participants are particular challenges in clinical trials. Multiple channels are 
      needed for successful recruitment, and especially individuals experiencing 
      frailty, multimorbidity and disabilities require support to participate. 
      Cognitive decline is common, and often proxies are needed to sign informed 
      consent forms. Older people may fall ill or become tired during the trial, and 
      therefore, special support and empathic study personnel are necessary for the 
      successful retention of participants. Besides the risk of participants dropping 
      out, several other pitfalls may result in underestimating or overestimating the 
      intervention effects. In nonpharmacological trials, imperfect blinding is often 
      unavoidable. Interventions must be designed intensively and be long enough to 
      reveal differences between the intervention and control groups, as control 
      participants must still receive the best normal care available. Outcome measures 
      should be relevant to older people, sensitive to change and targeted to the 
      specific population in the trial. Missing values in measurements are common and 
      should be accounted for when designing the trial. Despite the obstacles, RCTs in 
      geriatrics must be promoted. Reliable evidence is needed for the successful 
      treatment, management and care of older people.

TI  - A Multi-Domain Group-Based Intervention to Promote Physical Activity, Healthy 
      Nutrition, and Psychological Wellbeing in Older People with Losses in Intrinsic 
      Capacity: AMICOPE Development Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115979 [doi]
LID - 5979
AB  - The World Health Organization has developed the Integrated Care of Older People 
      (ICOPE) strategy, a program based on the measurement of intrinsic capacity (IC) 
      as "the composite of all physical and mental attributes on which an individual 
      can draw". Multicomponent interventions appear to be the most effective approach 
      to enhance IC and to prevent frailty and disability since adapted physical 
      activity is the preventive intervention that has shown the most evidence in the 
      treatment of frailty and risk of falls. Our paper describes the development of a 
      multi-domain group-based intervention addressed to older people living in the 
      community, aimed at improving and/or maintaining intrinsic capacity by means of 
      promoting physical activity, healthy nutrition, and psychological wellbeing in 
      older people. The process of intervention development is described following the 
      Guidance for reporting intervention development studies in health research 
      (GUIDED). The result of this study is the AMICOPE intervention (Aptitude 
      Multi-domain group-based intervention to improve and/or maintain IC in Older 
      PEople) built upon the ICOPE framework and described following the Template for 
      Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) guidelines. The intervention 
      consists of 12 face-to-face sessions held weekly for 2.5 h over three months and 
      facilitated by a pair of health and social care professionals. This study 
      represents the first stage of the UK Medical Research Council framework for 
      developing and evaluating a complex intervention. The next step should be 
      carrying out a feasibility study for the AMICOPE intervention and, at a later 
      stage, assessing the effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elder abuse in nursing homes (NH) is a widespread and complex 
      problem. Residents' ability to share their experiences are impeded, due to a high 
      degree of cognitive problems and frailty, and previous studies are thus mainly 
      based on reports from staff. Therefore, we aimed to give voice to the residents 
      by investigating their relatives' experiences with elder abuse in NH. METHODS: 
      Qualitative individual interviews were conducted with 16 relatives of residents 
      with experience of abuse and/or neglect in NH. Content analysis was used to 
      analyse the data. RESULTS: Relatives perceived neglect as most pervasive and 
      staff-to-resident psychological abuse as a key problem. Physical abuse was mostly 
      related to resident-to-resident aggression. Relatives perceived elder abuse in NH 
      to be related to low competence among staff, low staffing, poor NH leadership, 
      working cultures characterized by fear and loyalty to employer or co-workers, and 
      a lack of individualized care for the residents. Furthermore, relatives 
      themselves experienced maltreatment from NH, which caused them to suffer stress, 
      anxiety and distrust. Relatives also expressed a need to compensate for lack of 
      care. CONCLUSIONS: Relatives of NH residents who had experienced abuse reported 
      that neglect of basic care and individual rights was predominant and viewed 
      organizational explanations as most important. Relatives perceive themselves as 
      collaborators in care and are emotionally attached to their family member. 
      Therefore, if relatives experience resident abuse or neglect, it inflicts a 
      feeling of being mistreated themselves, particularly if they are not listened to 
      or their notice of abuse on the part of the resident is ignored or trivialized. 
      Including relatives in a committed partnership with NH in care practices is not 
      only a valuable path to reduce the risk of abuse, but it also leads to a more 
      sustainable healthcare with high standards of quality and safety.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Advancements in medical and consumer-grade technologies have made 
      it easier than ever to monitor a patient's heart rhythm and to diagnose 
      arrhythmias. Octogenarians with symptomatic arrhythmias have unique management 
      challenges due to their frailty, complex drug interactions, cognitive impairment, 
      and competing comorbidities. The management decisions are further complicated by 
      the lack of randomized evidence to guide treatment. AREAS COVERED: A 
      comprehensive literature review was undertaken to outline various 
      tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and their management, the role of cardiac 
      implantable electronic devices, cardiac ablations, and specific geriatric 
      arrhythmia considerations as recommended in international guidelines. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is arguably the most important arrhythmia in 
      the elderly and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early 
      diagnosis of AF, potentially with smart devices (wearables), has the potential to 
      reduce the incidence of stroke, systemic emboli, and the risk of dementia. 
      Bradyarrhythmias have a high incidence in the elderly as well, often requiring 
      implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Leadless pacemakers implanted directly 
      into the right ventricle are great options for gaining traction in elderly 
      patients.

TI  - Incorporating pharmacokinetic data into personalised prescribing for older 
      people: challenges and opportunities.
PG  - 435-442
LID - 10.1007/s41999-020-00437-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We discuss the known age-associated changes in drug metabolism and 
      elimination, the potential use of this information when selecting specific 
      therapeutic strategies in older patients, and the steps required to fill the 
      knowledge gap in this field. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review that 
      encapsulates the current knowledge regarding the main age-associated changes in 
      drug metabolism and elimination and discusses their possible inclusion in current 
      and future personalised prescribing tools for the older patient population. 
      RESULTS: Despite some progress in this field, the lack of specific information 
      regarding the impact of frailty, pharmacogenomics, and drug-drug, drug-disease, 
      and organ-organ interactions, particularly in subjects > 80 years, currently 
      prevents the routine incorporation of pharmacokinetic data, barring measures of 
      renal function, into personalised prescribing tools. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      incorporation of pharmacokinetic data into personalised prescribing, an approach 
      based on the consideration of a number of patient's characteristics when 
      selecting the right drug(s) and dose regimen(s) to maximize effectiveness and 
      limit toxicity, remains a hypothetical construct in geriatric care. Pending the 
      inclusion of frail and complex older patients in pre- and post-marketing studies, 
      a better understanding of the key pharmacokinetic alterations of common 
      medications in "real-life" patients, together with the implementation of 
      effective strategies tackling inappropriate prescribing, is likely to improve 
      clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare utilization in the older population.

AB  - The use of polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) is an 
      increasingly common, concerning public health issue in older adults, and a 
      concurrent cancer diagnosis only further escalates the prevalence and complexity. 
      Polypharmacy and PIM use has been associated with negative patient outcomes, 
      including falls, chemotherapy toxicities and other adverse events, postoperative 
      complications, frailty, functional impairment, and shortened survival. Despite 
      the recognition of the harms, the prevalence of polypharmacy and PIM use 
      continues to rise due to a lack of standardized identification and intervention 
      methods. Efforts to reduce the prevalence have included use of explicit PIM 
      screening tools (e.g., Beers criteria), comprehensive medication reviews, and 
      deprescribing algorithms. However, these efforts are not widespread and the 
      research on the effectiveness of such interventions is limited. To better 
      understand what is known, this paper summarized available studies evaluating the 
      effect of interventions on reducing the burden of polypharmacy/PIMs and provided 
      recommendations to guide further practice models to reduce the negative 
      consequences associated with polypharmacy and PIM use. Furthermore, we aim to 
      establish a framework for clinical practice and to highlight areas for future 
      intervention-based research to improve outcomes for older adults with cancer.

TI  - The features of the typical traumatic brain injury patient in the ICU are 
      changing: what will this mean for the intensivist?
PG  - 80-86

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the key features and epidemiology of traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI) and how they may be changing, with an emphasis on how this may 
      affect care in the intensive care unit. RECENT FINDINGS: TBI has been 
      traditionally perceived as occurring mainly in a younger, predominantly male 
      population injured in high velocity motor vehicle crashes or assaults. However, 
      there are an increasing number of patients over 65 years who have sustained a TBI 
      secondary to low velocity falls. Considering the effects of frailty, 
      comorbidities and extracranial injuries is important when making management 
      decisions. Mild TBI comprises a third of those admitted and as a significant 
      proportion may have poor outcomes secondary to their TBI they should be assessed 
      to ensure appropriate follow-up. Multimodal monitoring may offer a way in the 
      future to offer more personalised management to this very complex and 
      heterogeneous patient group. SUMMARY: This review highlights the urgent need to 
      develop more age-inclusive TBI consensus management guidelines aimed at improving 
      short- and long-term outcomes for the large and growing TBI population. Being 
      elderly does not necessarily portend a poor outcome, and more research is needed 
      to better triage, guide management and prognosticate on these patients.

TI  - Association between preoperative frailty and outcomes among adults undergoing 
      cardiac surgery: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - E777-E787
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20200034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of frailty before complex and invasive procedures 
      may have relevance for prognostic and recovery purposes, to optimally inform 
      patients, caregivers and clinicians about perioperative risk and postoperative 
      care needs. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of frailty and 
      describe the associated clinical course and outcomes of patients referred for 
      nonemergent cardiac surgery. METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients aged 50 
      years and older referred for nonemergent cardiac surgery in Alberta, Canada, from 
      November 2011 to March 2014 were screened preoperatively for frailty, defined as 
      a Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score of 5 or greater. Postoperatively, patients 
      were followed by telephone to assess CFS score, health services use and vital 
      status. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes 
      included health services use, hospital discharge disposition, 1-year 
      health-related quality of life and all-cause 5-year mortality. RESULTS: The 
      cohort (n = 529) had a mean age of 67 (standard deviation [SD] 9) years; 25.9% 
      were female, and the prevalence of frailty was 9.6% (n = 51; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 7.3%-12.5%). Frail patients were older (median age 75, 
      interquartile range [IQR] 65-80 v. 67, IQR 60-73, yr; p < 0.001), were more 
      likely to be female (51.0% v. 23.2%; p < 0.001), had a higher mean EuroSCORE II 
      (8, SD 3 v. 5, SD 3; p < 0.001) and received combined coronary artery bypass 
      grafting and valve procedures more frequently (29.4% v. 15.9%; p = 0.02) than 
      nonfrail patients. Postoperatively, frail patients had a longer median duration 
      of stay in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (median difference 2.2, 95% CI 
      1.60-2.79) and hospital (median difference 9.3, 95% CI 8.2-10.3). Hospital 
      mortality was 9.8% among frail patients and 1.0% among nonfrail patients 
      (adjusted hazard ratio 3.84, 95% CI 0.90-16.34). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative 
      frailty was present in 10% of patients and was associated with a higher risk of 
      morbidity and greater health services use. Preoperative frailty has important 
      implications for the postoperative clinical course and resource utilization of 
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

LID - 11310
AB  - (1) Background: Ageing is associated with complex and dynamic changes leading to 
      multimorbidity and, therefore, polypharmacy. The main objectives were to study an 
      older community-dwelling cohort, to detect inappropriate prescriptions (IP) 
      applying the Patient-Centred Prescription model, and to evaluate the most 
      associated factors. (2) Methods: This was a prospective, descriptive, and 
      observational study conducted from June 2019 to October 2020 on patients ≥ 65 
      years with multimorbidity who lived in the community. Demographic, clinical and 
      pharmacological data were assessed. Variables assessed were: degree of frailty, 
      using the Frail-VIG index; therapeutical complexity and anticholinergic and 
      sedative burden; and the number of chronic drugs to determine polypharmacy or 
      excessive polypharmacy. Finally, a medication review was carried out through the 
      application of the Patient-Centred Prescription model. We used univariate and 
      multivariate regression to identify the factors associated with IP. (3) Results: 
      We recruited 428 patients (66.6% women; mean age 85.5, SD 7.67). A total of 50.9% 
      of them lived in a nursing home; the mean Barthel Index was 49.93 (SD 32.14), and 
      73.8% of patients suffered some degree of cognitive impairment. The prevalence of 
      frailty was 92.5%. Up to 90% of patients had at least one IP. An increase in IP 
      prevalence was detected when the Frail-VIG index increased (p < 0.05). With the 
      multivariate model, the relationship of polypharmacy with IP detection stands out 
      above all. (4) Conclusions: 90% of patients presented one IP or more, and this 
      situation can be detected through the PCP model. Factors with higher association 
      with IP were frailty and polypharmacy.

AB  - Population aging is a defining demographic reality of our era. It is associated 
      with an increase in the societal burden of delivering care to older adults with 
      chronic conditions or frailty. How to integrate global population aging and 
      technology development to help address the growing demands for care facing many 
      aging societies is both a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. We propose 
      a social technology approach that promotes use of technologies to assist 
      individuals, families, and communities to cope more effectively with the 
      disabilities of older adults who can no longer live independently due to 
      dementia, serious mental illness, and multiple chronic health problems. The main 
      contributions of the social technology approach include: (1) fostering 
      multidisciplinary collaboration among social scientists, engineers, and 
      healthcare experts; (2) including ethical and humanistic standards in creating 
      and evaluating innovations; (3) improving social systems through working with 
      those who deliver, manage, and design older adult care services; (4) promoting 
      social justice through social policy research and innovation, particularly for 
      disadvantaged groups; (5) fostering social integration by creating age-friendly 
      and intergenerational programs; and (6) seeking global benefit by identifying and 
      generalizing best practices. As an emergent, experimental approach, social 
      technology requires systematic evaluation in an iterative process to refine its 
      relevance and uses in different local settings. By linking technological 
      interventions to the social and cultural systems of older people, we aim to help 
      technological advances become an organic part of the complex social world that 
      supports and sustains care delivery to older adults in need.

AB  - Older patients represent a growing proportion of the general surgical caseload. 
      This includes those undergoing liver resection, with figures rising faster than 
      the rate of population ageing. The physiology of ageing leads to changes in all 
      body systems which may render the provision of safe anaesthesia more challenging 
      than in younger patients. Anaesthesia for liver surgery has specific principles, 
      largely aimed at reducing venous bleeding from the liver, and those related to 
      complex major surgery. This review explores the principles of anaesthesia for 
      liver resection and describes how they may require modification in the older 
      patient. The traditional approach of low central venous pressure anaesthesia in 
      order to reduce bleeding may need to be altered in the presence of a 
      cardiovascular system less able to tolerate hypotension and hypoperfusion. These 
      changes in physiology should also lower the threshold for invasive monitoring. 
      The provision of effective analgesia perioperatively should be tailored to 
      minimise the surgical stress response and opiate use. Careful consideration of 
      general principles of intra-operative care for older patients, such as 
      positioning, drug dosing, avoidance of excessively deep anaesthesia, and 
      maintenance of normothermia are also important given the prolonged, complex 
      nature of liver surgery. This individualised approach, with careful attention to 
      changes in physiology allows liver resections to be undertaken in older patients 
      without increases in mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of surgical complexity 
      on postoperative complications and mortality, according to patient's frailty 
      (mFI) following surgery for ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients undergoing 
      cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer from 2008 to 2018 were identified from 
      our database. A surgical complexity score from 1 to 3 was used to assess the 
      extent of surgery (simple to complex, respectively). mFI with 11 variables, based 
      on mapping the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index to the NSQIP 
      comorbidities was evaluated. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, 
      independent sample t-test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 263 patients 
      identified, 33% reported at least one postoperative complication and 6% had 
      severe complications. BMI ≥ 30 (p = 0.04) increased mFI (p = 0.04) and 
      high-complexity surgery (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of severe 
      complications (G3-G5). Patients with high frailty index score (mFI ≥ 3) who 
      underwent intermediate or high-complexity surgery were at higher risk of severe 
      complications ranging from 29.4% to 50. CONCLUSIONS: The combined evaluation of 
      mFI and surgical complexity expected may identify patients at higher risk for 
      severe morbidity allowing to stratify patients who are less likely to tolerate a 
      surgical extensive treatment.

TI  - The Correlation Between Case Total Work Relative Value Unit, Operative Stress, 
      and Patient Frailty: Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 637-645
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005068 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assess the relationships between case total work relative value units 
      (wRVU), patient frailty, and the physiologic stress of surgical interventions. 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgeon reimbursement is frequently apportioned by 
      wRVU. These subjective, procedure-specific valuations generated by physician 
      survey estimate the intensity and time for typical patient care services. We 
      hypothesized wRVU would not adequately account for patient-specific factors, such 
      as frailty, that modify the required physician work, regardless of procedural 
      complexity. METHODS: Using National and Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Programs (2015-2018), we evaluated the correlation between case total 
      wRVU, patient frailty (risk analysis index) and physiologic surgical stress 
      (operative stress score). RESULTS: Of 4,111,371 (86%) cases, the correlation 
      between total wRVU and operative stress was moderate [ρs = 0.587 (95% confidence 
      interval, 0.586-0.587)], but negligible with frailty ρ = 0.177 (95% confidence 
      interval, 0.176-0.178)]. Very high operative stress procedures [n = 34,047 (1%)] 
      generated a mean total wRVU of 55.1 (standard deviation, 12.9), comprising 7%, 
      2%, and 1% of thoracic, vascular, and general surgical cases, respectively. Very 
      frail patients [n = 152,535 (4%)] accounted for 9% of thoracic, 9% of vascular, 
      4% of general, 5% of urologic, and 4% of neurologic surgical cases, generating 
      21.0 (standard deviation, 12.4) mean total wRVU. Some nonfrail patients 
      undergoing low operative stress procedures [n = 60,128 (2%)] nonetheless 
      generated the highest quintile wRVU; these comprised >15% of plastic, 
      gynecologic, and urologic surgical cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon reimbursement 
      correlates with operative stress but not patient frailty. The total wRVU does not 
      adequately reflect patient-specific factors that increase the physician workload 
      required to render optimal care to complex patients.

TI  - The association of alcohol use with all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related 
      hospitalizations or death in older, high-risk Veterans.
PG  - 1215-1224

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of alcohol misuse among older adults has grown 
      dramatically in the past decade, yet little is known about the association of 
      alcohol misuse with hospitalization and death in this patient population. 
      METHODS: We examined the association between alcohol use (measured by a screening 
      instrument in primary care) and rates of all-cause and cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD)-related 6-month hospitalization or death via electronic health records 
      (EHRs) in a nationally representative sample of older, high-risk Veterans. Models 
      were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including 
      frailty and comorbid conditions. RESULTS: The all-cause hospitalization or death 
      rate at 6 months was 14.9%, and the CVD-related hospitalization or death rate was 
      1.8%. In adjusted analyses, all-cause hospitalization or death was higher in 
      older Veterans who were nondrinkers or harmful use drinkers compared to moderate 
      use drinkers, but CVD-related hospitalization or death was similar in all 
      categories of drinking. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the complex 
      association between alcohol and all-cause acute healthcare utilization found in 
      the broader population is similar in older, high-risk Veteran patients. These 
      findings do not support an association between alcohol consumption and 
      CVD-specific hospitalizations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aging population and increasing chronic diseases make a 
      tremendous burden on the health care system. The study evaluated the relationship 
      between comorbidity indices and common geriatric syndromes. METHODS: A total of 
      366 patients who were hospitalized in a university geriatric inpatient service 
      were included in the study. Sociodemographic characteristics, laboratory 
      findings, and comprehensive geriatric assessment(CGA) parameters were recorded. 
      Malnutrition, urinary incontinence, frailty, polypharmacy, falls, orthostatic 
      hypotension, depression, and cognitive performance were evaluated. Comorbidities 
      were ranked using the Charlson Comorbidity Index(CCI), Elixhauser Comorbidity 
      Index(ECM), Geriatric Index of Comorbidity(GIC), and Medicine Comorbidity 
      Index(MCI). Because, the CCI is a valid and reliable tool used in different 
      clinical settings and diseases, patients with CCI score higher than four was 
      accepted as multimorbid. Additionally, the relationship between geriatric 
      syndromes and comorbidity indices was assessed with regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      Patients' mean age was 76.2 ± 7.25 years(67.8% female). The age and sex of 
      multimorbid patients according to the CCI were not different compared to others. 
      The multimorbid group had a higher rate of dementia and polypharmacy among 
      geriatric syndromes. All four indices were associated with frailty and 
      polypharmacy(p < 0.05). CCI and ECM scores were related to dementia, 
      polypharmacy, and frailty. Moreover, CCI was also associated with separately slow 
      walking speed and low muscle strength. On the other hand, unlike CCI, ECM was 
      associated with malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: In the study comparing the four 
      comorbidity indices, it is revealed that none of the indices is sufficient to use 
      alone in geriatric practice. New indices should be developed considering the 
      complexity of the geriatric cases and the limitations of the existing indices.

TI  - Timely short-term specialized palliative care service intervention for older 
      people with frailty and their family carers in primary care: Development and 
      modelling of the frailty+ intervention using theory of change.
PG  - 1961-1974
LID - 10.1177/02692163211040187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Palliative care is advocated for older people with frailty and 
      multimorbidity in the community. However, how to best deliver it is unclear. AIM: 
      To develop and model an intervention of short-term specialized palliative care 
      that is initiated timely based on complex care needs and integrated with primary 
      care for older people with frailty and their family, detailing the intervention 
      components, outcomes and preconditions needed for implementation, using a novel 
      theoretical approach. DESIGN: Observational study informed by the UK MRC guidance 
      for complex interventions integrated with a Theory of Change (i.e. hypothetical 
      causal pathway to impact) approach. We synthesized evidence from a systematic 
      review, semi-structured interviews, group discussions and Theory of Change 
      workshops. SETTING: Primary care in Flanders, Belgium. RESULTS: We identified 
      patient and family carer-related long-term outcomes and preconditions to achieve 
      them for example, service providers are willing and able to deliver the 
      intervention. The intervention components included implementation components, for 
      example, training for service providers, and a core component, that is, provision 
      of timely short-term specialized palliative care by a specialized palliative home 
      care nurse. The latter includes: short-term service delivery; collaborative and 
      integrative working within primary care; delivery of holistic needs- and 
      capacity-based care; person-centred and family-focussed; and goal-oriented 
      pro-active care. CONCLUSIONS: The Theory of Change approach allowed us to 
      identify multiple intervention components targeting different stakeholders to 
      achieve the desired outcomes. It also facilitated a detailed description of the 
      intervention which aims to increase replicability and effective comparisons with 
      other interventions.

TI  - Frailty Is Associated with Impaired Diabetic Foot Ulcer Healing and All-Cause 
      Re-Hospitalization.
PG  - 169-173
LID - 10.1007/s12603-022-1726-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are a common and feared complication of 
      type 1 and type 2 diabetes. People with DFUs often present a significant clinical 
      complexity due to multimorbidity, frailty, polypharmacy, and disabling 
      conditions. Frailty, defined using the accumulation of health deficits model, has 
      shown to predict worsening health status, hospitalizations, and death in older 
      persons. There are no clinical studies, to date, that have examined the 
      prevalence and effect of frailty on DFUs outcomes. The aim of our study was to 
      explore the impact of frailty on DFUs healing and re-hospitalization in a cohort 
      of patients hospitalized with DFUs. DESIGN: prospective cohort study. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: The frailty status of 76 consecutive hospitalized patients with 
      DFUs was assessed by using the Frailty Index (FI). MEASUREMENTS: The primary 
      outcome was the non-healing of the DFU. Secondary outcome was re-hospitalization 
      events (for any cause) within 6 months from hospital discharge. Frailty was 
      defined as FI>0.25. RESULTS: Out of 76 patients (median age 65 years, range 
      31-84), 56 (74%) were frail. At six months, 81.5% of frail patients had 
      non-healing of the DFU compared to 55% in non-frail patients (p=0.02). The rate 
      of of re-hospitalization was also higher in frail compared to non-frail (90.3% vs 
      54%, respectively; p=0.01) patients. In multivariable analyses, frailty was 
      significantly associated with a more than fivefold increased risk of DFU 
      non-healing [odds ratio 5.54 (95% confidence interval 1.28-23.91), p=0.02]. 
      Similarly, re-hospitalization was also significantly higher in frail patients 
      compared to the non-frail ones. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with DFUs, 
      frailty was highly prevalent. Frailty emerged as an independent risk factor for 
      DFU non-healing and re-hospitalization events. Patients with DFUs require a 
      comprehensive assessment of their frailty status which would enable 
      personalization of their management and interventions.

AB  - The corona pandemic challenges countries worldwide in many different ways. Due to 
      its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several 
      shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and 
      deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, 
      such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has 
      quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The 
      nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive 
      collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before 
      this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was 
      mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care 
      between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this 
      specific and complex care in their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
      This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital 
      and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, 
      resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge 
      exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more 
      efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Common bile duct stone (CBDS) is a common condition the rate of which 
      increases with age. Decision to treat in particular elderly and frail patients 
      with CBDS is often complex and requires careful assessment of the risk for 
      treatment-related cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study was to 
      compare the rate of postoperative cardiovascular events in CBDS patients treated 
      with the following: ERCP only; cholecystectomy only; cholecystectomy followed by 
      delayed ERCP; cholecystectomy together with ERCP; or ERCP followed by delayed 
      cholecystectomy. METHODS: The study was based on data from procedures for 
      gallstone disease registered in the Swedish National Quality Register for 
      Cholecystectomy and Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (GallRiks) 
      2006-2014. ERCP and cholecystectomy procedures performed for confirmed or 
      suspected CBDS were included. Postoperative events were registered by 
      cross-matching GallRiks with the National Patient Register (NPR). A postoperative 
      cardiovascular event was defined as an ICD-code in the discharge notes indicating 
      myocardial infarct, pulmonary embolism or cerebrovascular disease within 30 days 
      after surgery. In cases where a patient had undergone ERCP and cholecystectomy on 
      separate occasions, the 30-day interval was timed from the first intervention. 
      RESULTS: A total of 23,591 underwent ERCP or cholecystectomy for CBDS during the 
      study period. A postoperative cardiovascular event was registered in 164 patients 
      and death within 30 days in 225 patients. In univariable analysis, adverse 
      cardiovascular event and death within 30 days were more frequent in patients who 
      underwent primary ERCP (p < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, adjusting for 
      history of cardiovascular disease or events, neither risk for cardiovascular 
      complication nor death within 30 days remained statistically significant in the 
      ERCP group. CONCLUSIONS: Primary ERCP as well as cholecystectomy may be performed 
      for CBDS with acceptable safety. More studies are required to provide reliable 
      guidelines for the management of CBDS.

AB  - Introduction: With a rapidly aging population, the Malaysian health care system 
      needs to develop solutions to address the lack of resources that are required for 
      the assessment of the older person. The complex nature of geriatric syndromes 
      coupled with the occurrence of multiple comorbid illnesses with aging, make 
      geriatric assessment a resource intensive process. Digital health solutions could 
      play an important role in supporting existing health care systems, especially in 
      low and middle income countries, with limited speciality services in geriatrics. 
      Objective: This is a pilot study aimed at screening for geriatric syndromes 
      through self-administered online surveys in urban community dwelling older 
      Malaysians and assessing the pattern of geriatric syndromes in relation to the 
      frailty status of the study participants. Methods: This is a cross-sectional 
      pilot study conducted between July-September 2020. Community dwelling adults aged 
      60 years and over were invited to take part in an online survey. Information on 
      sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, and the self-reported results of 
      geriatric syndromes (frailty, sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, urinary 
      incontinence, falls, and cognitive impairment), were collected through the 
      survey. Results: Data was collected for 162 participants over a period of 2 
      months. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 66.42 (5.25) years with 64.9% 
      females. Majority of the respondents were of Chinese ethnic origin (67.9%) and 
      had tertiary level of education (75.9%). The average time taken by participants 
      to complete the survey was 16.86 min. Urinary incontinence was the highest 
      reported geriatric syndrome (55.1%) followed by falls (37.6%), anorexia of aging 
      (32.8%), cognitive impairment (27.8%), and sarcopenia (8.3%). Frailty was 
      detected in 4.5% of the study population. Loss of weight in the previous year was 
      the highest reported component of the frailty assessment tool. The presence of 
      sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, poor/fair self-rated health, urinary incontinence, 
      and multimorbidity were significantly higher in older adults who were frail or 
      prefrail. Conclusion: Screening for geriatric syndromes through online surveys is 
      a feasible approach to identify older adults in the community who are likely to 
      benefit from geriatric assessment. However, the demographic profile of the older 
      population that are accessible through such digital platforms is limited.

TI  - A methodology for identifying high-need, high-cost patient personas for 
      international comparisons.
PG  - 1302-1316

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a methodological approach to compare two high-need, 
      high-cost (HNHC) patient personas internationally. DATA SOURCES: Linked 
      individual-level administrative data from the inpatient and outpatient sectors 
      compiled by the International Collaborative on Costs, Outcomes, and Needs in Care 
      (ICCONIC) across 11 countries: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, the 
      Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. 
      STUDY DESIGN: We outline a methodological approach to identify HNHC patient types 
      for international comparisons that reflect complex, priority populations defined 
      by the National Academy of Medicine. We define two patient profiles using 
      accessible patient-level datasets linked across different domains of 
      care-hospital care, primary care, outpatient specialty care, post-acute 
      rehabilitative care, long-term care, home-health care, and outpatient drugs. The 
      personas include a frail older adult with a hip fracture with subsequent hip 
      replacement and an older person with complex multimorbidity, including heart 
      failure and diabetes. We demonstrate their comparability by examining the 
      characteristics and clinical diagnoses captured across countries. DATA 
      COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data collected by ICCONIC partners. PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: Across 11 countries, the identification of HNHC patient personas was 
      feasible to examine variations in healthcare utilization, spending, and patient 
      outcomes. The ability of countries to examine linked, individual-level data 
      varied, with the Netherlands, Canada, and Germany able to comprehensively examine 
      care across all seven domains, whereas other countries such as England, 
      Switzerland, and New Zealand were more limited. All countries were able to 
      identify a hip fracture persona and a heart failure persona. Patient 
      characteristics were reassuringly similar across countries. CONCLUSION: Although 
      there are cross-country differences in the availability and structure of data 
      sources, countries had the ability to effectively identify comparable HNHC 
      personas for international study. This work serves as the methodological paper 
      for six accompanying papers examining differences in spending, utilization, and 
      outcomes for these personas across countries.

TI  - Frailty status as a potential factor in increased postoperative opioid use in 
      older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prescription opioids are commonly used for postoperative pain relief 
      in older adults, but have the potential for misuse. Both opioid side effects and 
      uncontrolled pain have detrimental impacts. Frailty syndrome (reduced reserve in 
      response to stressors), pain, and chronic opioid consumption are all complex 
      phenomena that impair function, nutrition, psychologic well-being, and increase 
      mortality, but links among these conditions in the acute postoperative setting 
      have not been described. This study seeks to understand the relationship between 
      frailty and patterns of postoperative opioid consumption in older adults. 
      METHODS: Patients ≥ 65 years undergoing elective surgery with a planned hospital 
      stay of at least one postoperative day were recruited for this cohort study at 
      pre-anesthesia clinic visits. Preoperatively, frailty was assessed by Edmonton 
      Frailty and Clinical Frailty Scales, pain was assessed by Visual Analog and Pain 
      Catastrophizing Scales, and opioid consumption was recorded. On the day of 
      surgery and subsequent hospitalization days, average pain ratings and total 
      opioid consumption were recorded daily. Seven days after hospital discharge, 
      patients were interviewed using uniform questionnaires to measure opioid 
      prescription use and pain rating. RESULTS: One hundred seventeen patients (age 
      73.0 (IQR 67.0, 77.0), 64 % male), were evaluated preoperatively and 90 completed 
      one-week post discharge follow-up. Preoperatively, patients with frailty were 
      more likely than patients without frailty to use opioids (46.2 % vs. 20.9 %, 
      p = 0.01). Doses of opioids prescribed at hospital discharge and the prescribed 
      morphine milligram equivalents (MME) at discharge did not differ between groups. 
      Seven days after discharge, the cumulative MME used were similar between cohorts. 
      However, patients with frailty used a larger fraction of opioids prescribed to 
      them (96.7 % (31.3, 100.0) vs. 25.0 % (0.0, 83.3), p = 0.007) and were more 
      likely (OR 3.7, 95 % CI 1.13-12.13) to use 50 % and greater of opioids prescribed 
      to them. Patients with frailty had higher pain scores before surgery and seven 
      days after discharge compared to patients without frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns 
      of postoperative opioid use after discharge were different between patients with 
      and without frailty. Patients with frailty tended to use almost all the opioids 
      prescribed while patients without frailty tended to use almost none of the 
      opioids prescribed.

TI  - Associations of Baseline Frailty Status and Age With Outcomes in Patients 
      Undergoing Vestibular Schwannoma Resection.
PG  - 608-614
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.0670 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Although numerous studies have evaluated the influence of advanced 
      age on surgical outcomes following vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection, few if 
      any large-scale investigations have assessed the comparative prognostic effects 
      of age and frailty. As the population continues to age, it is imperative to 
      further evaluate treatment and management strategies for older patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based evaluation of the independent 
      associations of chronological age and frailty (physiological age) with outcomes 
      following VS resection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this large-scale, 
      multicenter, cross-sectional analysis, weighted discharge data from the National 
      Inpatient Sample were searched to identify adult patients (≥18 years old) who 
      underwent VS resection from 2002 through 2017 using International Classification 
      of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and Tenth Revision, Clinical 
      Modification codes. Data collection and analysis took place September to December 
      2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complex samples regression models and receiver 
      operating characteristic curve analysis were used to evaluate the independent 
      associations of frailty and age (along with demographic confounders) with 
      complications and discharge disposition. Frailty was evaluated using the 
      previously validated 11-point modified frailty index (mFI). RESULTS: Among the 
      27 313 patients identified for VS resection, the mean (SEM) age was 50.4 (0.2) 
      years, 15 031 (55.0%) were women, and 4720 (21.0%) were of non-White 
      race/ethnicity, as determined by the National Inpatient Sample data source. Of 
      the included patients, 15 090 (55.2%) were considered robust (mFI score = 0), 
      8204 (30.0%) were prefrail (mFI score = 1), 3022 (11.1%) were frail (mFI 
      score = 2), and 996 (3.6%) were severely frail (mFI score ≥3). On univariable 
      analysis, increasing frailty was associated with development of postoperative 
      hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR], 2.44 [95% CI, 2.07-2.87]; area 
      under the curve, 0.73), while increasing age was not. Following multivariable 
      analysis, increasing frailty and non-White race/ethnicity were independently 
      associated with both mortality (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.32 [95% CI, 1.70-3.17], and 
      aOR, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.02-9.12], respectively) and extended hospital stays (aOR, 
      1.54 [95% CI, 1.41-1.67], and aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.42-2.05], respectively), while 
      increasing age was not. Increasing frailty (aOR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.56-0.67]), age 
      (aOR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97-0.99]), and non-White race/ethnicity (aOR, 0.62 [95% CI 
      0.51-0.75]) were all independently associated with routine discharge. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, findings suggest that frailty may 
      be more accurate for predicting outcomes and guiding treatment decisions than 
      advanced patient age alone following VS resection.

TI  - ICT technologies as new promising tools for the managing of frailty: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 1453-1464
LID - 10.1007/s40520-020-01626-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frailty is a major health issue as it encompasses functional decline, 
      physical dependence, and increased mortality risk. Recent studies explored 
      Information and Communication Technology (ICT) interventions as alternatives to 
      manage frailty in older persons. The aim of the present systematic review was to 
      synthesize current evidence on ICT application within the complex models of 
      frailty care in older people. METHODS: Data sources included PubMed, PsycINFO, 
      EMBASE and Web of Science, considering eligible those reviews on ICT application 
      in samples of older persons formally assessed as frail. Records were screened by 
      two independent researchers, who extracted data and appraised methodological 
      quality of reviews and studies. RESULTS: Among the 764 retrieved papers, two 
      systematic reviews were included. Most of the studies analyzed defined frailty 
      considering only few components of the phenotype and used ICT to stratify 
      different levels of frailty or to support traditional screening strategies. 
      Assessment of frailty was the context in which ICT has been mostly tested as 
      compared to intervention. Cost effectiveness evaluations of the ICT technologies 
      were not reported. CONCLUSIONS: The research investigating the use of ICT in the 
      context of frailty is still at the very beginning. Few studies strictly focused 
      on the assessment of frailty, while intervention on frailty using ICT was rarely 
      reported. The lack of a proper characterization of the frail condition along with 
      the methodological limitations prevented the investigation of ICT within complex 
      care models. Future studies are needed to effectively integrate ICT in the care 
      of frailty in orders.

TI  - Being Your Best: protocol for a feasibility study of a codesigned approach to 
      reduce symptoms of frailty in people aged 65 years or more after transition from 
      hospital.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The population is ageing, with increasing health and supportive 
      care needs. For older people, complex chronic health conditions and frailty can 
      lead to a cascade of repeated hospitalisations and further decline. Existing 
      solutions are fragmented and not person centred. The proposed Being Your Best 
      programme integrates care across hospital and community settings to address 
      symptoms of frailty. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre pragmatic mixed methods 
      study aiming to recruit 80 community-dwelling patients aged ≥65 years recently 
      discharged from hospital. Being Your Best is a codesigned 6-month programme that 
      provides referral and linkage with existing services comprising four modules to 
      prevent or mitigate symptoms of physical, nutritional, cognitive and social 
      frailty. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of recruitment, acceptability of 
      the intervention to participants and level of retention in the programme. Changes 
      in frailty (Modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State 
      Examination), functional ability (Barthel and Lawton), loneliness (University of 
      California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-3 items) and nutrition (Malnutrition 
      Screening Tool) will also be measured at 6 and 12 months. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from Monash Health Human Research 
      Ethics Committee (RES-19-0000904L). Results will be disseminated through 
      peer-reviewed journals, conference and seminar presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION 
      NUMBER: ACTRN12620000533998; Pre-results.

AB  - From the orthopedic trauma surgeon's perspective, successful injury management 
      hinges on fracture fixation and restoration of patient mobility in a safe and 
      expeditious manner. Management of critically injured polytrauma patients and 
      shared decisions regarding regional anesthetics presents a myriad of challenges 
      for orthopedic trauma surgeons and anesthesiologists alike. As the populations 
      age, the typical patient sustaining traumatic orthopedic injuries are 
      increasingly frail and elderly. This trend in demographics has mandated that care 
      for orthogeriatric patients is coordinated by multidisciplinary teams working in 
      concert on medically complex cases to a common end. In this article, we highlight 
      opportunities for improved communication and care integration between orthopedic 
      trauma surgeons and anesthesiologists.

TI  - Identification of biomarkers for physical frailty and sarcopenia through a new 
      multi-marker approach: results from the BIOSPHERE study.
PG  - 727-740
LID - 10.1007/s11357-020-00197-x [doi]
AB  - Physical frailty and sarcopenia (PF&S) is a prototypical geriatric condition 
      characterized by reduced physical function and low muscle mass. The aim of the 
      present study was to provide an initial selection of biomarkers for PF&S using a 
      novel multivariate analytic strategy. Two-hundred community-dwellers, 100 with 
      PF&S and 100 non-physically frail, non-sarcopenic (nonPF&S) controls aged 70 and 
      older were enrolled as part of the BIOmarkers associated with Sarcopenia and 
      Physical frailty in EldeRly pErsons (BIOSPHERE) study. A panel of 74 serum 
      analytes involved in inflammation, muscle growth and remodeling, neuromuscular 
      junction damage, and amino acid metabolism was assayed. Biomarker selection was 
      accomplished through sequential and orthogonalized covariance selection 
      (SO-CovSel) analysis. Separate SO-CovSel models were constructed for the whole 
      study population and for the two genders. The model with the best prediction 
      ability obtained with the smallest number of variables was built using seven 
      biomolecules. This model allowed correct classification of 80.6 ± 5.3% PF&S 
      participants and 79.9 ± 5.1% nonPF&S controls. The PF&S biomarker profile was 
      characterized by higher serum levels of asparagine, aspartic acid, and 
      citrulline. Higher serum concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor BB, 
      heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72), myeloperoxidase, and α-aminobutyric acid defined 
      the profile of nonPF&S participants. Gender-specific SO-CovSel models identified 
      a "core" biomarker profile of PF&S, characterized by higher serum levels of 
      aspartic acid and Hsp72 and lower concentrations of macrophage inflammatory 
      protein 1β, with peculiar signatures in men and women.SO-CovSel analysis allowed 
      identifying a set of potential biomarkers for PF&S. The adoption of such an 
      innovative multivariate approach could help address the complex pathophysiology 
      of PF&S, translate biomarker discovery from bench to bedside, and unveil novel 
      targets for interventions.

TI  - The impact of frailty Screening of Older adults with muLtidisciplinary assessment 
      of those At Risk during emergency hospital attendance on the quality, safety and 
      cost-effectiveness of care (SOLAR): a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 581

LID - 581
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people account for 25% of all Emergency Department (ED) 
      admissions. This is expected to rise with an ageing demographic. Older people 
      often present to the ED with complex medical needs in the setting of multiple 
      comorbidities. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been shown to improve 
      outcomes in an inpatient setting but clear evidence of benefit in the ED setting 
      has not been established. It is not feasible to offer this resource-intensive 
      assessment to all older adults in a timely fashion. Screening tools for frailty 
      have been used to identify those at most risk for adverse outcomes following ED 
      visit. The overall aim of this study is to examine the impact of CGA on the 
      quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of care in an undifferentiated population 
      of frail older people with medical complaints who present to the ED and Acute 
      Medical Assessment Unit. METHODS: This will be a parallel 1:1 allocation 
      randomised control trial. All patients who are ≥ 75 years will be screened for 
      frailty using the Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) tool. Those with a 
      score of ≥ 2 on the ISAR will be randomised. The treatment arm will undergo 
      geriatric medicine team-led CGA in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit 
      whereas the non-treatment arm will undergo usual patient care. A dedicated 
      multidisciplinary team of a specialist geriatric medicine doctor, senior 
      physiotherapist, specialist nurse, pharmacist, senior occupational therapist and 
      senior medical social worker will carry out the assessment, as well as 
      interventions that arise from that assessment. Primary outcomes will be the 
      length of stay in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit. Secondary outcomes 
      will include ED re-attendance, re-hospitalisation, functional decline, quality of 
      life and mortality at 30 days and 180 days. These will be determined by telephone 
      consultation and electronic records by a research nurse blinded to group 
      allocation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the 
      Health Service Executive (HSE) Mid-Western Regional Hospital Research Ethics 
      Committee (088/2020). Our lay dissemination strategy will be developed in 
      collaboration with our Patient and Public Involvement stakeholder panel of older 
      people at the Ageing Research Centre and we will present our findings in 
      peer-reviewed journals and national and international conferences. TRIAL

TI  - Management of acute coronary syndromes in older adults.
PG  - 1542-1553
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehab391 [doi]
AB  - Older patients are underrepresented in prospective studies and randomized 
      clinical trials of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Over the last decade, a few 
      specific trials have been conducted in this population, allowing more 
      evidence-based management. Older adults are a heterogeneous, complex, and 
      high-risk group whose management requires a multidimensional clinical approach 
      beyond coronary anatomic variables. This review focuses on available data 
      informing evidence-based interventional and pharmacological approaches for older 
      adults with ACS, including guideline-directed management. Overall, an invasive 
      approach appears to demonstrate a better benefit-risk ratio compared to a 
      conservative one across the ACS spectrum, even considering patients' clinical 
      complexity and multiple comorbidities. Conversely, more powerful strategies of 
      antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention have been associated with 
      increased bleeding events and no benefit in terms of mortality reduction. An 
      interdisciplinary evaluation with geriatric assessment should always be 
      considered to achieve a holistic approach and optimize any treatment on the basis 
      of the underlying biological vulnerability.

TI  - Can an individualized adherence education program delivered by nurses improve 
      therapeutic adherence in elderly people with acute myocardial infarction?: A 
      randomized controlled study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ageing of the population is leading to an increase in the number 
      of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. These patients are at 
      higher risk for complications and poor medication adherence, which in turn are 
      associated with higher healthcare resource expenditures. Nursing programmes might 
      help to improve adherence in these complex patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of 
      this study was to assess the impact of a nursing intervention on therapeutic 
      adherence in elderly patients after myocardial infarction compared to a control 
      group. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS: Heart 
      disease institute of a tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥75 
      years with myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed during the admission 
      in all patients (N=143). Patients were randomly allocated to a nursing 
      intervention group (n=68) or a usual care group (n=75). In patients from the 
      intervention group, a nursing intervention programme was performed 3 months after 
      admission based on education support and patient monitoring to improve 
      therapeutic adherence. The main outcome measured was 12-months therapeutic 
      adherence, as defined by a combination of measurement tools (Morisky-Green and 
      Hayness-Sacket scales, attendance at visits and withdrawal of medication from the 
      pharmacy). Therapeutic adherence was assessed by nurses blinded to the assignment 
      group. RESULTS: The mean age was 82.2 years. The proportion of comorbidities was 
      significant (diabetes mellitus 51/143 (35.7%), hypertension 110/143 (76.9%), 
      prior stroke 22/143 (15.4%)). Likewise, the proportion of geriatric syndromes was 
      noticeable (frailty 26/143 (18.2%), risk of malnutrition 38/143 (26.6%), 
      cognitive impairment 28/143 (19.6%)). Most patients (92.3%) had a low educational 
      level. A total of 119 patients achieved 12-month assessment adherence. Among 
      these patients, the proportions of adherence were as follows: Morisky-Green test: 
      76/119 (63.9%), Haynes-Sackett test 99/119 (83.2%), medical visits compliance 
      95/119 (79.8%), and correct acquisition of drugs in the pharmacy 74/119 (62.2%). 
      A total of 42/119 patients (35.3%) were adherent as defined by the combination of 
      the 4 measures. Therapeutic adherence at 12 months was achieved in a 
      significantly higher proportion of patients from the nursing intervention group 
      (51.9% vs 21.5%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of elderly 
      patients with myocardial infarction were non-adherent at 12 months. The 
      proportion of adherent patients was highly variable according to the different 
      tools used. A structured nursing intervention was independently associated with a 
      higher adherence rate, as assessed by a multidimensional measurement, in this 
      subset of complex high-risk elderly patients with myocardial infarction. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although nearly 1 million older adults are admitted for emergency 
      general surgery conditions yearly, the extent to which baseline health influences 
      the development and treatment of emergency general surgery conditions is unknown. 
      We evaluated baseline health and older patients with and without emergency 
      general surgery conditions. METHODS: We used the prospectively collected Medicare 
      Current Beneficiary Survey with Medicare claims and 2 validated health 
      frameworks: (1) Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score and (2) Complex 
      Multimorbidity. Self-reported health and function items were used to derive 
      pre-emergency general surgery conditions Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score and 
      Complex Multimorbidity scores. Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score ranges from 0 
      (no frailty deficits) to 100 (all possible deficits present). Complex 
      Multimorbidity is a 3-point categorical rank based on the presence of chronic 
      conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes. Specific survey 
      factors were also examined to determine association with development of emergency 
      general surgery conditions or use of operative management. RESULTS: Of 54,417 
      individuals, 1,960 had emergency general surgery conditions (median age 79 
      [interquartile range 73-84]). Patients with emergency general surgery conditions 
      had significantly higher Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score (19 [interquartile 
      range 11-31] vs 14 [8-24]) and were more likely to be in the most severe Complex 
      Multimorbidity category (38% vs 29%). Emergency general surgery conditions 
      patients had higher proportions of nearly every health category, with the most 
      striking differences in functional limitations. Patients who were treated 
      nonoperatively had the poorest overall baseline health. CONCLUSION: Patients who 
      developed emergency general surgery conditions had more severe health burden than 
      patients who did not, particularly in functional status. Clinicians must better 
      understand the interaction between baseline health vulnerability and emergency 
      surgical disease to improve prognostication and ensure alignment of patient goals 
      and treatment strategies.

AB  - Healthcare systems need to adapt to better serve an aging population with complex 
      presentations. Frailty assessments are a potential means to address this 
      heterogeneity in aging to identify individuals at increased risk for adverse 
      health outcomes. Furthermore, frailty assessments offer an opportunity to 
      optimize patient care in various healthcare settings. While the vast number of 
      frailty assessment tools available can be a source of confusion for clinicians, 
      each tool has features adaptable to the constraints and goals of different 
      healthcare settings. This review discusses and compares barriers, facilitators, 
      and the application of frailty assessments in primary care, the emergency 
      department/intensive care unit and surgical care to cover a breadth of settings 
      with different frailty assessment considerations. The implementation of 
      frailty-aware care across healthcare settings potentiates better healthcare 
      outcomes for older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little data on major muscular hematomas and the little there 
      is has mainly focused on patients exposed to oral anticoagulants. OBJECTIVE: To 
      describe the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of patients 
      admitted to emergency department (ED) for major muscular hematoma associated with 
      an antithrombotic agent, and to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a three-year period, all consecutive cases of adult 
      patients admitted to the ED of 5 tertiary care hospitals for major muscular 
      hematoma while exposed to an antithrombotic agent were prospectively collected 
      and medically validated. Clinical and biological data, therapeutic management of 
      the bleeding event, and in-hospital mortality were collected from the medical 
      records and compared across five groups of hematoma locations. Potential 
      confounders were taken in account using a multivariate binomial regression model. 
      RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-five patients were included (mean 
      age = 81.4 years): 271 were exposed to vitamin K antagonists, 58 to parenteral 
      anticoagulants (heparin, LMWH, fondaparinux), 33 to antiplatelets, and 13 to 
      direct oral anticoagulants. The muscular hematomas were located in the lower 
      limbs (n = 198), the rectus sheath (n = 71), the iliopsoas (n = 45), the upper 
      limbs (n = 33), or elsewhere (n = 28). Reversal therapy was prescribed for 48.5% 
      of patients, red cell transfusions for 63.6%, surgery for 12.3% and embolization 
      for 3.5%. For 84% of patients, hospitalization was required, with a median length 
      of stay of 10 days. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 8.5%. Reversal therapy, 
      the need for intensive care and mortality were significantly more frequent among 
      patients with iliopsoas hematomas. The independent predictors of in-hospital 
      mortality were: decrease in mean arterial pressure (RR = 1.84), decrease in 
      hemoglobin level (RR = 1.37) and the iliopsoas location (RR = 3.06). CONCLUSION: 
      Frail elderly patients with major muscular hematomas linked to antithrombotic 
      agents risk substantial morbidity and in-hospital mortality. The iliopsoas 
      location was the most life-threatening bleeding site. Close observation of this 
      population is warranted to ensure better outcomes.

      for prevention and treatment.
PG  - 123-129
LID - 10.1111/nbu.12538 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a syndrome of growing importance given the global increase in the 
      number of older people. While frailty is a complex, multifactorial process, poor 
      nutritional status is considered to be a key contributor to its pathophysiology. 
      However, the role of nutrition and its influence on the development and 
      progression of frailty is poorly understood. As nutrition is a modifiable risk 
      factor for frailty, future prevention and treatment strategies should consider 
      the potential of diet and dietary change as a component of interventions. This 
      article reports on a UK Nutrition Research Partnership 'Hot Topic' workshop on 
      nutrition and frailty. The aim of the workshop was to bring together experts and 
      early career researchers from a range of disciplines to synthesise current 
      understanding of dietary influences on frailty, with a focus on opportunities for 
      prevention and treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frail older adults who are hospitalized, are more likely to 
      experience missed nursing care (MNC) due to high care needs, communication 
      problems, and complexity of nursing care. We conducted a qualitative study to 
      examine the factors affecting MNC among hospitalized frail older adults in the 
      medical units. METHODS: This qualitative study was carried using the conventional 
      content analysis approach in three teaching hospitals. Semi-structured interviews 
      were conducted with 17 nurses through purposive and snowball sampling. The 
      inclusion criteria for the nurses were: at least two years of clinical work 
      experience on a medical ward, caring for frail older people in hospital and 
      willingness to participate. Data were analyzed in accordance with the process 
      described by Graneheim and Lundman. In addition, trustworthiness of the study was 
      assessed using the criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba. RESULTS: In general, 20 
      interviews were conducted with nurses. A total of 1320 primary codes were 
      extracted, which were classified into two main categories: MNC aggravating and 
      moderating factors. Factors such as "age-unfriendly structure," "inefficient 
      care," and "frailty of older adults" could increase the risk of MNC. In addition, 
      factors such as "support capabilities" and "ethical and legal requirements" will 
      moderate MNC. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized frail older adults are more at risk of 
      MNC due to high care needs, communication problems, and nursing care complexity. 
      Nursing managers can take practical steps to improve the quality of care by 
      addressing the aggravating and moderating factors of MNC. In addition, nurses 
      with a humanistic perspective who understand the multidimensional problems of 
      frail older adults and pay attention to their weakness in expressing needs, can 
      create a better experience for them in the hospital and improve patient safety.

TI  - Polypharmacy, comorbidity and frailty: a complex interplay in older patients at 
      the emergency department.
PG  - 849-857
LID - 10.1007/s41999-022-00664-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Older adults at the emergency department (ED) with polypharmacy, 
      comorbidity, and frailty are at risk of adverse health outcomes. We investigated 
      the association of polypharmacy with adverse health outcomes, in relation to 
      comorbidity and frailty. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study in ED 
      patients  ≥ 70 years. Non-polypharmacy was defined as 0-4 medications, 
      polypharmacy 5-9 and excessive polypharmacy ≥ 10. Comorbidity was classified by 
      the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Frailty was defined by the Identification 
      of Seniors At Risk-Hospitalized Patients (ISAR-HP) score. The primary outcome was 
      3-month mortality. Secondary outcomes were readmission to an ED/hospital ward and 
      a self-reported fall < 3 months. The association between polypharmacy, 
      comorbidity and frailty was analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS: 881 
      patients were included. 43% had polypharmacy and 18% had excessive polypharmacy. 
      After 3 months, 9% died, 30% were readmitted, and 21% reported a fall. Compared 
      with non-polypharmacy, the odds ratio (OR) for mortality ranged from 2.62 (95% CI 
      1.39-4.93) in patients with polypharmacy to 3.92 (95% CI 1.95-7.90) in excessive 
      polypharmacy. The OR weakened after adjustment for comorbidity: 1.80 (95% CI 
      0.92-3.52) and 2.32 (95% CI 1.10-4.90). After adjusting for frailty, the OR 
      weakened to 2.10 (95% CI 1.10-4.00) and OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.15-5.02). No 
      significant association was found for readmission or self-reported fall. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy is common in older patients at the ED. Polypharmacy, 
      and especially excessive polypharmacy, is associated with an increased risk of 
      mortality. The observed association is complex given the confounding effect of 
      comorbidity and frailty.

TI  - Blood pressure control and complex health conditions in older adults: impact of 
      recent hypertension management guidelines.
PG  - 280-289
LID - 10.1038/s41371-020-0334-4 [doi]
AB  - The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 
      2017 guidelines for hypertension management lowered blood pressure (BP) 
      thresholds to 130/80 mmHg to define hypertension while the European Society of 
      Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) 2018 guidelines 
      retained 140/90 mmHg. Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older 
      patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how 
      to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the 
      prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of 
      participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used 
      data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65+ aged between 67 and 80 
      years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were 
      self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants 
      reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. 
      Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% 
      percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using 
      ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four 
      out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, 
      i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA 
      guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a 
      serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex 
      health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how 
      to manage hypertension.

TI  - Magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy feasibility in elderly cancer patients: 
      proposal of the MASTER scoring system.
PG  - 26-31
LID - 10.1177/0300891620920709 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are often excluded from advanced treatments owing to 
      clinical complexity or frailty. Magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) 
      represents a new frontier of radiotherapy delivery that can play an important 
      role in the management of these patients. AIM: To assess MRgRT feasibility in 
      elderly patients, describe their compliance with this treatment, and provide a 
      scoring system for elderly patient selection. METHODS: Patients aged >75 years 
      were enrolled. No restrictions on tumor site, staging, or treatment intent were 
      applied. Patients underwent joint radiation oncology-geriatrics visits to assess 
      the feasibility of MRgRT and to identify the most significant items (i.e. 
      clinical variables) for the setup of a scoring system. The proposed scoring 
      system was then internally validated on a prospectively enrolled cohort of 
      elderly patients who were candidates for MRgRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were 
      enrolled between February and March 2018. Their mean age was 81.4 ± 3.4 years 
      (range 75-88). Radiotherapy intent was curative in 26 patients; 14 patients were 
      considered frail at screening tests before radiotherapy. Twelve items were 
      identified as clinically significant for the setup of the MASTER score 
      (MRI-Guided Radiotherapy Selection Elderly Score) score. Validation of the score 
      showed 100% reliability, with no patient discharged after selection. CONCLUSIONS: 
      MRgRT appears to be feasible in elderly patients and the MASTER score is proposed 
      to support clinical decision-making in recommending elderly patients for this 
      technology.

AB  - Urinary incontinence (UI), the involuntary loss of urine, is a common health 
      condition that may decrease the quality of life and which increases in incidence 
      and prevalence with age. Recent epidemiologic data suggest an overall prevalence 
      of 38% in women older than 60 years, increasing to 77% in older women living in 
      nursing homes. Despite this high prevalence, incontinence remains underdiagnosed 
      and undertreated in this age group. In a representative population of 7,000 
      participants drawn from the Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing, 750 had UI of 
      whom 285 (38%) had not sought the help of a health care professional. The reasons 
      that older people do not seek help for incontinence are complex and multiplex. 
      Stigma surrounding diagnosis, a sense of futility coupled to a notion that 
      incontinence is a part of normal ageing and the fact that incontinence simply 
      gets 'lost' in the midst of multimorbidity and frailty have all been shown to 
      play a role. Active case finding has therefore been highlighted as a cornerstone 
      of effective care in serial international guidelines.

TI  - Impact of organizational context on patient outcomes in a proactive primary care 
      program:a longitudinal observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of health care interventions is co-determined by 
      contextual factors. Unknown is the extent of this impact on patient outcomes. 
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore which characteristics of general 
      practices are associated with patient outcomes in a proactive primary care 
      program, the U-PROFIT 2.0. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was 
      conducted from January 2016 till October 2017. Two questionnaires were send out, 
      one to collect characteristics of general practices such as practice 
      neighbourhood socio-economic status, general practice versus healthcare centre 
      (involving multiple primary care professionals), and professional- frail older 
      patient ratio per practice of general practitioners and practice nurses. 
      Regarding delivering the program, the practice or district nurse who delivered 
      the program, number of years since the start of the implementation, and choice of 
      age threshold for frailty screening were collected. Patient outcomes collected by 
      the second questionnaire and send to frail patients were daily functioning, 
      hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and general practice 
      out-of-hours consultations. Linear and generalized linear mixed models were used. 
      RESULTS: A total of 827 frail older people were included at baseline. Delivery of 
      the program by a district nurse compared to a practice nurse was significantly 
      associated with a decrease in daily functioning on patient-level (β = 2.19; 
      P = < 0.001). Duration since implementation of 3 years compared to 9 years was 
      significantly associated with less out-of-hours consultations to a general 
      practice (OR 0.11; P = 0.001). Applying frailty screening from the age of 75 
      compared to those targeted from the age of 60 showed a significant increase in 
      emergency visits (OR 5.26; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Three associations regarding 
      the organizational context 1) the nurse who delivered the program, 2) the number 
      of years the program was implemented and 3) the age threshold for defining a 
      frail patient are significant and clinically relevant for frail patients that 
      receive a proactive primary care program. In general, contextual factors need 
      more attention when implementing complex primary care programs which can result 
      in better balanced choices to enhance effective proactive care for older people 
      living in the community.

AB  - Vascular aging is a complex and multifaceted process that provokes profound 
      molecular, structural, and functional changes in the vasculature. Eventually, 
      these profound aging alterations make arteries more prone to vascular disease, 
      including hypertension, atherosclerosis and other arterial complications that 
      impact the organism beyond the cardiovascular system and accelerate frailty. For 
      these reasons, preventing or delaying the hallmarks of vascular aging is nowadays 
      a major health goal, especially in our aged societies. In this context, 
      angiotensin(Ang)-(1-7), a major player of the protective branch of the 
      renin-angiotensin system, has gained relevance over recent years as growing 
      knowledge on its anti-aging properties is being unveiled. Here, we briefly review 
      the main actions of Ang-(1-7) against vascular aging. These include protection 
      against vascular cell senescence, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects 
      together with the induction of cytoprotective systems. Ang-(1-7) further 
      ameliorates endothelial dysfunction, a hallmark of vascular aging and disease, 
      attenuates fibrosis and calcification and promotes protective angiogenesis and 
      repair. Although further research is needed to better understand the anti-aging 
      properties of Ang-(1-7) on the vasculature, this heptapeptide arises as a 
      promising pharmacological tool for preventing vascular aging and frailty.

TI  - Association between frailty index, lung function, and major clinical determinants 
      in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 2165-2173
LID - 10.1007/s40520-021-01878-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airflow limitation alone is unable to capture the complexity of 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), better explained by comprehensive 
      disease-specific indexes. Frailty is a clinical condition characterized by high 
      vulnerability to internal and external stressors and represents a strong 
      predictor of adverse outcomes. AIMS: Primary objective was to test the 
      association between indexes of lung function and COPD severity with frailty index 
      (FI), and secondary to evaluate the association between FI and comorbidities, 
      cognitive and physical function, BODE index, and mortality. METHODS: 150 stable 
      COPD outpatients were enrolled and followed up to 4 years. At baseline, 
      participants performed a geriatric multidimensional assessment, pulmonary 
      function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, 6-min walking test, and bioimpedance 
      analysis. BODE and FI were calculated. Spearman's ρ was used to assess 
      correlations. Mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: 
      Participants were followed up for a median of 39 months. Mean age was 73 years 
      and median frailty index 0.15 (IQR 0.11-0.19). FI was higher in frequent 
      exacerbators (≥ 2/year) (mean 0.18 vs 0.15, p 0.01) and dyspnoeic patients 
      (mMRC ≥ 2) (mean 0.21 vs 0.14, p < 0.01) and correlated with lung volumes, 
      expiratory flows, and pressure of arterial oxygen. FI was positively correlated 
      with the number of comorbidities, depressive symptoms, cognitive decline, and 
      BODE index. Mortality was higher in patients with BODE higher than 3 (HR 3.6, 95% 
      CI 1.2-10.9), and not associated with FI. DISCUSSION: FI positively correlates 
      with all clinical drivers orienting the choice of treatment in COPD. CONCLUSIONS: 
      FI associates with lung function and COPD severity, but does not associate with 
      mortality.

TI  - Exploring rehabilitation potential in older people living with frailty: a 
      qualitative focus group study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation interventions are frequently cited as key in 
      supporting frail older people's recovery following periods of decompensation and 
      acute ill-health. Clinicians are required to make decisions about a patient's 
      potential to respond to rehabilitation. 'Rehabilitation potential' decisions can 
      determine access to services. In acute settings clinicians have limited time to 
      assess and work with patients, families and carers. The complexities of ageing, 
      recovery, rehabilitation and frailty may not be fully appreciated. This study 
      aimed to explore multiple perspectives of the concept of rehabilitation potential 
      and how it is assessed in older people living with frailty in the acute 
      healthcare setting. METHODS: Five focus groups with a purposive sample of 28 
      participants which included clinicians and members of the public were conducted. 
      Analysis comprised a thematic approach using the Framework method. RESULTS: 
      Rehabilitation potential was found to encapsulate a complex decision-making 
      process where clinicians judged an individual's ability to benefit from and 
      participate in targeted rehabilitation. They asked, "Will it work?", "Is it 
      wanted?" and "Is it available?" In order to predict who would benefit from 
      rehabilitation interventions, clinicians assessed a range of holistic clinical 
      and non-clinical factors. An iterative approach to assessment delivered by a 
      multi-disciplinary team, centred around patient and carer needs and wants was 
      needed to accommodate complexity. Participants believed that everyone had some 
      form of potential but this was dependent on availability of rehabilitation 
      resources and conceptualisations of frailty and rehabilitation. Tensions between 
      iterative approaches to rehabilitation potential assessment and the realities of 
      rapid decision making in the acute hospital setting were found. CONCLUSION: 
      Rehabilitation potential decisions involve a complex process of multidisciplinary 
      decision-making and prognostication on the likely outcome and benefit from 
      rehabilitation programmes. These findings lay the foundation for developing 
      structured approaches to rehabilitation potential decision making tools and 
      guidance.

TI  - VA home-based primary care interdisciplinary team structure varies with Veterans' 
      needs, aligns with PACE regulation.
PG  - 1729-1737

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interdisciplinary team (IDT) care is central to home-based primary 
      care (HBPC) of frail elders. Traditionally, all HBPC disciplines managed a 
      patient (Full IDT), a costly approach to maintain. The recent PACE (Program of 
      All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) regulation provides for a flexible approach 
      of annual assessments from a core team with involvement of additional disciplines 
      dependent upon patient needs (Core+). Current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
      HBPC guidance specifies Full IDTs care for medically complex and functionally 
      impaired Veterans similar to PACE participants. We evaluated whether VA HBPC has 
      adopted the flexible structure of the PACE regulation, aligned to Veteran needs. 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: All 139 VA HBPC programs administered 
      across 379 sites. PARTICIPANTS: About 55,173 Veterans enrolled in HBPC during 
      fiscal year 2018. MEASUREMENTS: Patients' HBPC physician, nurse, 
      psychologist/psychiatrist, social worker, therapist, dietitian, and pharmacist 
      visits were grouped into interdisciplinary team types. Patient frailty was 
      classified using VA HNHR v2 (High-Need High-Risk version 2, a measure of high, 
      medium, and low risk of long-term institutionalization). Medical complexity was 
      measured by clusters of impairment in the JEN frailty index (JFI). JFI clusters 
      were validated by VA's Nosos measure to project cost and Care Assessment Need 
      (CAN) measure of hospitalization and mortality risk. RESULTS: HBPC provided Full 
      IDT care to 21%, Core+ care to 54%, and Home Health+ (HHA+) care (skilled home 
      health services plus additional disciplines, without primary care) to 16% of 
      Veterans. Team type was associated with medical complexity (X(2) 2863.5 [66 df], 
      p < 0.0001). High-risk Veterans (72% of sample) were more likely to receive Full 
      IDT care (X(2) 62.9, 1 df), p < 0.0001), while low-risk Veterans (28%) were more 
      likely to receive HHA+ care (X(2) 314.8, 1 df, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is 
      a strong association between HBPC team patterns and patient frailty, indicating 
      tailoring of care to match Veteran needs.

TI  - Prognostic importance of the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score in 
      patients undergoing cardiac resynchronisation therapy.
LID - 10.1136/openhrt-2021-001740 [doi]
LID - e001740
AB  - AIMS: Malnutrition is common and associated with worse clinical outcomes in 
      patients with heart failure (HF). The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) 
      score is an integrated index for evaluating diverse aspects of the complex 
      mechanism of malnutrition. However, the relationship between the severity of 
      malnutrition assessed by the CONUT score and clinical outcomes of HF patients 
      receiving cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) has not been fully clarified. 
      METHODS: Clinical records of 263 patients who underwent pacemaker or 
      defibrillator implantation for CRT between March 2003 and October 2020 were 
      retrospectively evaluated. The CONUT score was calculated from laboratory data 
      obtained before CRT device implantation. Patients were divided into three groups: 
      normal nutrition (CONUT scores 0-1, n=58), mild malnutrition (CONUT scores 2-4, 
      n=132) and moderate or severe malnutrition (CONUT scores 5-12, n=73). The primary 
      endpoint was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The moderate or severe malnutrition 
      group had a lower body mass index, more advanced New York Heart Association 
      functional class, higher Clinical Frailty Scale score, lower levels of 
      haemoglobin and higher levels of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (all 
      p<0.05). In the moderate or severe malnutrition group, the CRT response rate was 
      significantly lower than for the other two groups (p=0.001). During a median 
      follow-up period of 31 (10-67) months, 103 (39.1%) patients died. Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis revealed that the moderate or severe malnutrition group had a 
      significantly higher mortality rate (log-rank p<0.001). A higher CONUT score and 
      CONUT score ≥5 remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality after 
      adjusting for previously reported clinically relevant factors and the 
      conventional risk score (VALID-CRT risk score) (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      higher CONUT score before CRT device implantation was strongly associated with HF 
      severity, frailty, lower CRT response rate and subsequent long-term all-cause 
      mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
      established a list of hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) with significant 
      deleterious effects on both patients and providers. Adult spinal deformity (ASD) 
      surgery is complex and highly invasive, and as such may result in significant 
      morbidity including these HACs. PURPOSE: Identify predictors for developing the 
      most common HACs among adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients undergoing 
      corrective surgery. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE: 
      One thousand one hundred and seventy-one ASD patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: HACs, 
      Health-Related Quality of Life scores(HRQLs), Reoperation, Integrated Health 
      State (IHS) METHODS: ASD pts undergoing surgery (>18 years, scoliosis ≥20°, SVA 
      ≥5 cm, PT ≥25° and/or TK >60°) with complete data at BL and up to 2 years post-op 
      were included. Patients were stratified by presence of >1 HAC, defined as at 
      least one superficial/deep SSI, UTI, DVT, or PE within a 30-day post-op window. 
      Random forest analysis generated 5,000 Conditional Inference Trees to compute a 
      variable importance table for top predictors of HACs. An area-under-the-curve 
      (AUC) methodology compared normalized HRQL scores between groups to determine an 
      IHS with 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: Total of 1,171 pts (59.8 years, 76.2%F, 
      28.1kg/m(2)) underwent corrective ASD surgery, with 1,053 pts in the non-HAC 
      group and 118 in the HAC group. Of these pts, 25.4% had UTI, 15.4% DVT, 19.2% 
      superficial SSI, 20.8% deep SSI, and 19.2% PE. HAC pts were on average older 
      (63.5 vs 59.3, p=.004) and more often frail (51.3 vs 39.7%, p=.021) than non-HAC 
      pts. Postop LOS and reoperation were most associated with HAC groups: [1] LOS >7 
      days [2] reoperation. Patient-related predictors of HACs were [3] age >50 yerr, 
      [4] frailty, and [13] BMI >31. Procedure-related predictors of HACs were [5] 
      operative-time >405 minutes, [6] levels fused >9, EBL >1450 mL, and [11] 
      decompression. BL radiographic predictors were [7] PT >20°, [9] PI-LL>6°, [10] TL 
      Cobb angle >15°, [12] SVA C7-S1 >29 mm. No differences were observed between 
      groups with regards to IHS ODI (0.73 vs 0.74, p=.863), SRS (1.3 vs1.3, p=.374), 
      NRS Back (0.6 vs 0.6, p=.158). HAC had higher rates of reoperation than non-HAC 
      (0.08 vs 0.01, p=.066), and any HAC within 30-days of index was a significant 
      predictor of reoperation (OR: 2.448 [1.94-3.09], p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a 
      population of ASD patients, HACs were associated with length of stay, 
      reoperation, age, and frailty. Radiographic parameters such as pelvic tilt >20°, 
      PI-LL >6°, & SVA >29 mm also increased odds of HACs, and should raise 
      postoperative awareness for HAC development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about resilience in an internal medicine setting. We 
      aimed to assess the relationship between resilience and frailty and other 
      clinical and sociodemographic characteristics in a cohort of prospectively 
      enrolled hospitalised patients. METHODS: In 2017-2019, we consecutively enrolled 
      patients in our internal medicine wards. We selected all patients who filled in 
      the 25-item Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC). Mean resilience was 
      evaluated according to baseline demographic (i.e., age, sex, marital and 
      socioeconomic status) and clinical (i.e., Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS], 
      Edmonton Frail Scale [EFS], Barthel index, Short Blessed test, length of stay 
      [LOS]) data. A multivariable analysis for assessing factors affecting resilience 
      was fitted. RESULTS: Overall, 143 patients (median age 69 years, interquartile 
      range 52-79, 74 females) were included. Resilience was significantly lower in 
      frail (p = 0.010), elderly (p = 0.021), dependent (p = 0.032), and more 
      clinically (p = 0.028) and cognitively compromised patients (p = 0.028), and in 
      those with a low educational status (p = 0.032). No relation between resilience 
      and LOS was noticed (p = 0.597). Frail patients were significantly older 
      (p < 0.001), had a greater disease burden as measured by CIRS comorbidity 
      (p < 0.001) and severity indexes (p < 0.001), were more dependent (p < 0.001), 
      more cognitively impaired (p < 0.001), and displayed a lower educational level 
      (p = 0.011) compared to non-frail patients. At multivariable analysis, frailty 
      (p = 0.022) and dependency (p = 0.031; according to the Barthel index) were 
      associated with lower resilience in the age groups 18-64 and ≥ 65 years, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Low resilience was associated with frailty and 
      dependency with an age-dependent fashion. Studies assessing the impact of this 
      finding on important health outcomes are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical

TI  - Evidence from two cohorts for the frailty syndrome as an emergent state of 
      parallel dysregulation in multiple physiological systems.
PG  - 63-79
LID - 10.1007/s10522-020-09903-w [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a clinical syndrome often present in older adults and characterized by 
      a heightened vulnerability to stressors. The biological antecedents and etiology 
      of frailty are unclear despite decades of research: frailty is associated with 
      dysregulation in a wide range of physiological systems, but no specific cause has 
      been identified. Here, we test predictions stemming from the hypothesis that 
      there is no specific cause: that frailty is an emergent property arising from the 
      complex systems dynamics of the broad loss of organismal homeostasis. 
      Specifically, we use dysregulation of six physiological systems using the 
      Mahalanobis distance approach in two cohorts of older adults to test the breadth, 
      diffuseness, and nonlinearity of associations between frailty and system-specific 
      dysregulation. We find clear support for the breadth of associations between 
      frailty and physiological dysregulation: positive associations of all systems 
      with frailty in at least some analyses. We find partial support for diffuseness: 
      the number of systems or total amount of dysregulation is more important than the 
      identity of the systems dysregulated, but results only partially replicate across 
      cohorts. We find partial support for nonlinearity: trends are exponential but not 
      always significantly so, and power is limited for groups with very high levels of 
      dysregulation. Overall, results are consistent with-but not definitive proof 
      of-frailty as an emergent property of complex systems dynamics. Substantial work 
      remains to understand how frailty relates to underlying physiological dynamics 
      across systems.

TI  - Computerised cognitive remediation to enhance mobility in older adults: a 
      single-blind, single-centre, randomised trial.
PG  - e571-e579
LID - 10.1016/s2666-7568(21)00173-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decline in executive functions and related cognitive processes is 
      associated with mobility decline, and these functions might be amenable to 
      cognitive remediation. This study aimed to examine whether a computerised 
      cognitive remediation programme would improve walking in adults aged 70 years and 
      older. METHODS: This single-blind, randomised trial at one academic centre in the 
      USA evaluated the efficacy of an 8-week computerised programme (also known as 
      brain games) of progressive intensity and complexity to improve walking in older 
      adults at high-risk for mobility disability. Inclusion criteria included being 70 
      years or older; ambulatory; and at high-risk for mobility disability, defined 
      using a cutscore of nine or less (frail range) on the Short Physical Performance 
      Battery and a walking speed of 100 cm/s or less. Individuals with dementia, acute 
      or terminal medical illnesses, recent or planned surgery affecting mobility, 
      mobility limitations solely due to musculoskeletal limitation or pain that 
      prevented them from completing mobility tests, and those who were nursing home 
      residents were excluded. Participants were block randomised (1:1; block size 12 
      and no stratification) to the intervention group or the control group (low 
      complexity computer games and health education classes). Primary outcomes were 
      change in walking speed at normal pace and walking while talking conditions 
      assessed from baseline to 8 weeks post-intervention by investigators who were 
      masked to group assignment. Groups were compared using the intention-to-treat 
      principle with linear mixed models adjusted for confounders. This trial was 
      registered with ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT02567227. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2016, 
      and March 12, 2020, 383 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 
      intervention or control group. After randomisation, 11 (3%) patients were 
      diagnosed with dementia. 372 (97%; 271 [73%] women) were included in the 
      intention-to-treat analysis. The mean age of participants was 77·0 years [SD 
      5·6]). 183 (49·2%) participants were Black and 62 (16·7%) were Hispanic. 314 
      (93%) of the target 338 completers had finished the intervention when the trial 
      was terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there were significant 
      within-group improvements in both groups after the 8-week intervention, there was 
      no significant difference in normal walking speed (-1·03 cm/s [SD 1·30]; 95% CI 
      -3·60 to 1·54) and walking while talking conditions (0·59 cm/s [SD 1·61]; 95% CI 
      -2·59 to 3·76) between the intervention and control groups. Similarly, 
      within-group, but no between-group, differences were seen on executive function 
      tests and physical function. There were no severe adverse events related to 
      interventions. INTERPRETATION: Computerised cognitive remediation improved 
      walking in adults aged 70 years and older at high-risk for mobility disability, 
      but improvements were not significantly greater compared with an active control. 
      Although our findings corroborate the within-group improvements on cognition and 
      mobility reported in previous pilot clinical trials, future studies are required 
      to determine the optimal dose, frequency, intensity, and content of computerised 
      cognitive remediation programmes. FUNDING: National Institute on Aging.

TI  - Evaluating an integrated care pathway for frail elderly patients in Norway using 
      multi-criteria decision analysis.
PG  - 884
LID - 10.1186/s12913-021-06805-6 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: To provide value-based care for patients with multi-morbidity, 
      innovative integrated care programmes and comprehensive evaluations of such 
      programmes are required. In Norway, a new programme called "Holistic Continuity 
      of Patient Care" (HCPC) addresses the issue of multi-morbidity by providing 
      integrated care within learning networks for frail elderly patients who receive 
      municipal home care services or a short-term stay in a nursing home. This study 
      conducts a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate whether the HCPC 
      programme performs better on a large set of outcomes corresponding to the 'triple 
      aim' compared to usual care. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal survey data were 
      collected at baseline and follow-up after 6-months. The assessment of HCPC was 
      implemented by a novel MCDA framework. The relative weights of importance of the 
      outcomes used in the MCDA were obtained from a discrete choice experiment among 
      five different groups of stakeholders. The performance score was estimated using 
      a quasi-experimental design and linear mixed methods. Performance scores were 
      standardized and multiplied by their weights of importance to obtain the overall 
      MCDA value by stakeholder group. RESULTS: At baseline in the HCPC and usual care 
      groups, respectively, 120 and 89 patients responded, of whom 87 and 41 responded 
      at follow-up. The average age at baseline was 80.0 years for HCPC and 83.6 for 
      usual care. Matching reduced the standardized differences between the groups for 
      patient background characteristics and outcome variables. The MCDA results 
      indicated that HCPC was preferred to usual care irrespective of stakeholders. The 
      better performance of HCPC was mostly driven by improvements in enjoyment of 
      life, psychological well-being, and social relationships and participation. 
      Results were consistent with sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation. 
      CONCLUSION: Frail elderly with multi-morbidity represent complex health problems 
      at large costs for society in terms of health- and social care. This study is a 
      novel contribution to assessing and understanding HCPC programme performance 
      respecting the multi-dimensionality of desired outcomes. Integrated care 
      programmes like HCPC may improve well-being of patients, be cost-saving, and 
      contribute to the pursuit of evidence based gradual reforms in the care of frail 
      elderly.

TI  - Reexamining the Classification of Older Adults With Diabetes by Comorbidities and 
      Exploring Relationships With Frailty, Disability, and 5-year Mortality.
PG  - 2071-2079
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glab141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited research has been conducted to risk stratify older adults 
      with diabetes. Our objective was to reexamine the 2005-2006 classification 
      systems in participants who are now 5 years older. METHODS: We examined a 
      subsample of 884 community-residing older adults with the diagnosis of diabetes 
      from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. The primary objective 
      was to utilize a latent class analysis (LCA) to fit a model to 11 comorbidities, 
      comparing the 2010-2011 LCA model to that of 2005-2006. The secondary objective 
      was to evaluate the association of the identified classes with frailty, 
      disability, and 5-year mortality. RESULTS: Both 2005-2006 LCA and the 2010-2011 
      LCA model fit 3 similar comorbidity profiles: Class 1 with the lowest rates of 
      nearly all comorbidities, Class 2 had highest rates of obesity, hypertension, 
      arthritis, and incontinence, and Class 3 had the higher rates of myocardial 
      infarctions, congestive heart failure, and stroke. When compared to the healthier 
      Class 1 (class probability = 0.67), participants with a comorbidity profile with 
      more prevalent cardiovascular conditions (Class 3; 0.09) were at higher risk of 
      frailty and mortality, but not disability; whereas participants with a 
      comorbidity profile with more prevalent geriatric syndrome conditions (Class 2; 
      0.24) were at higher risk of frailty and disability, but not mortality. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We reconfirmed 3 latent classes with distinct comorbidity profiles 
      among older adults with diabetes. However, the complex relationships between 
      comorbidity classes with frailty, disability, and mortality will likely require 
      revision of the current rationale for stratified goal setting and treatment 
      selection.

TI  - Improving individualized prescription in patients with multimorbidity through 
      medication review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older patients tend to have multimorbidity, represented by multiple 
      chronic diseases or geriatric conditions, which leads to a growing number of 
      prescribed medications. As a result, pharmacological prescription has become a 
      major concern because of the increased difficulties to ensure appropriate 
      prescription in older adults. The study's main objectives were to characterize a 
      cohort of older adults with multimorbidity, carry out a medication review and 
      compare the pharmacological data before and after the medication review globally 
      and according to the frailty index. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental 
      (uncontrolled pre-post) study with a cohort of patients ≥ 65 years old with 
      multimorbidity. Data were collected from June 2019 to October 2020. Variables 
      assessed included demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data, degree of 
      frailty (Frail-VIG index), medication regimen complexity index, anticholinergic 
      and or sedative burden index, and monthly drug expenditure. Finally, a medication 
      review was carried out by an interdisciplinary team (primary care team and a 
      consultant team with a geriatrician and a clinical pharmacist) by applying the 
      Patient-Centered Prescription model to align the treatment with care goals. 
      RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-eight patients were recruited [66.6% women; mean age 
      85.5 (SD 7.67)]. The mean frail index was 0.39 (SD 0.13), corresponding with 
      moderate frailty. Up to 90% of patients presented at least one inappropriate 
      prescription, and the mean of inappropriate prescriptions per patient was 3.14 
      (SD 2.27). At the three-month follow-up [mortality of 17.7% (n = 76)], the mean 
      chronic medications per patient decreased by 17.96%, varying from 8.13 (SD 3.87) 
      to 6.67 (SD 3.72) (p < 0.001). The medication regimen complexity index decreased 
      by 19.03%, from 31.0 (SD 16.2) to 25.1 (SD 15.1), and the drug burden index mean 
      decreased by 8.40%, from 1.19 (SD 0.82) to 1.09 (SD 0.82) (p < 0.001). A decrease 
      in polypharmacy, medication regimen complexity index, and drug burden index was 
      more frequent among frail patients, especially those with severe frailty 
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An individualized medication review in frail older 
      patients, applying the Patient-Centered Prescription model, decreases 
      pharmacological parameters related to adverse drug effects, such as polypharmacy, 
      therapeutical complexity, and anticholinergic and, or sedative burden. The 
      benefits are for patients with frailty.

TI  - The CARDE-B Scoring System Predicts 30-Day Mortality After Revision Total Joint 
      Arthroplasty.
PG  - 424-431
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.20.00969 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There exists a substantial risk of having a perioperative 
      complication after revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The complex shared 
      decision-making between surgeon and patient would benefit from a high-fidelity 
      tool to identify patients at risk for mortality after revision TJA. Therefore, we 
      developed the CARDE-B score. CARDE-B is an acronym for congestive heart failure, 
      albumin or malnutrition (<3.5 mg/dL), renal failure on dialysis, dependence for 
      daily living, elderly (>65 years of age), and body mass index <25 kg/m2. We 
      developed and validated the CARDE-B score to determine the risk of death within 
      30 days of a revision TJA. METHODS: A total of 13,118 revision TJAs (40% hip and 
      60% knee) from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database 
      were analyzed. A simple 1-point scoring system, CARDE-B, was created for 
      predicting 30-day mortality after revision TJA, based on a logistic regression 
      model. The CARDE-B scoring system assigns 1 point to each criterion in the 
      acronym: congestive heart failure, albumin (<3.5 mg/dL), renal failure on 
      dialysis, dependence for daily living, elderly (>65 years of age), and body mass 
      index of <25 kg/m2. The CARDE-B scoring system was compared with 2 commonly 
      utilized scores: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 
      classification and the 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI-5). The area under 
      the curve (AUC) was used to assess the accuracy of each model. The 
      Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess goodness of fit. Finally, the Nationwide 
      Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used for external validation of the CARDE-B score in 
      19,153 patients who underwent revision TJA in 2017. RESULTS: Eighty-eight 
      patients (0.7%) did not survive 30 days after revision TJA. The AUC for the 
      logistic regression model was 0.88 in both the derivation and internal validation 
      samples using NSQIP. The predicted probability of 30-day mortality after revision 
      TJA increased stepwise from <0.01% for a CARDE-B score of 0 points to 39% for a 
      CARDE-B score of 5 points. The AUC for the CARDE-B score predicting 30-day 
      mortality after revision TJA was 0.85. This was more accurate (p < 0.001) than 
      the ASA physical status classification (AUC, 0.77) and the mFI-5 (AUC, 0.67). The 
      AUC for the CARDE-B score in the NIS external validation set was 0.75. The 
      Hosmer-Lemeshow p value for goodness of fit was 0.34, indicating goodness of fit 
      in the external validation sample. CONCLUSIONS: The CARDE-B score is a simple 
      system that predicts the risk of death within 30 days of a revision TJA, offering 
      surgeons and patients a valuable and validated risk-stratification tool. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete 
      description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Age is just a number: Is frailty being ignored in vascular access planning for 
      dialysis?
PG  - 192-197
LID - 10.1177/1129729821989902 [doi]
AB  - Current international guidelines advocate fistula creation as first choice for 
      vascular access in haemodialysis patients, however, there have been suggestions 
      that in certain groups of patients, in particular the elderly, a more tailored 
      approach is needed. The prevalence of more senior individuals receiving renal 
      replacement therapy has increased in recent years and therefore including patient 
      age in decision making regarding choice of vascular access for dialysis has 
      gained more relevance. However, it seems that age is being used as a surrogate 
      for overall clinical condition and it can be proposed that frailty may be a 
      better basis to considering when advising and counselling patients with regard to 
      vascular access for dialysis. Frailty is a clinical condition in which the person 
      is in a vulnerable state with reduced functional capacity and has a higher risk 
      of adverse health outcomes when exposed to stress inducing events. Prevalence of 
      frailty increases with age and has been associated with an increased risk of 
      mortality, hospitalisation, disability and falls. Chronic kidney disease is 
      associated with premature ageing and therefore patients with kidney disease are 
      prone to be frailer irrespective of age and the risk increases further with 
      declining kidney function. Limited data exists on the relationship between 
      frailty and vascular access, but it appears that frailty may have an association 
      with poorer outcomes from vascular access. However, further research is 
      warranted. Due to complexity in decision making in dialysis access, frailty 
      assessment could be a key element in providing patient-centred approach in 
      planning and maintaining vascular access for dialysis.

      Assessment of the Dimensions of Aging.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.1007/s12603-021-1722-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The co-occurrence of multiple medical or psycho-social conditions 
      (geriatric syndromes (GS) and age-related diseases) is a growing concern in older 
      people. Given the diversity of these conditions and their complex interactions, 
      our aim was to determine whether they could be structured into synthetic 
      dimensions in order to facilitate the management of multimorbidity. DESIGN: The 
      underlying structure of 10 GSs and 8 age-related diseases was identified using a 
      multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and confronted to subjective and 
      objective health outcomes. SETTING: community residents from Bordeaux City 
      (France) older than 75 years in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: 630 adults aged 75+ years who 
      lived in Bordeaux and participated in the 10-year follow-up of the Three-City 
      study. MEASUREMENTS: GSs included physical frailty, cognitive impairment and 
      dementia, dependency, depressive symptoms, polymedication, thinness, falls, 
      sensory deficit, social isolation, incontinence. Age-related diseases were 
      cancer, cardiac diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, 
      pulmonary diseases, osteoporosis, other chronic diseases. Association of the 
      MCA-derived independent dimensions was assessed with 10-year visit subjective 
      health and well-being, and with incident death and entry into institution during 
      the remaining cohort follow-up. RESULTS: Most of the participants (82%) had at 
      least two age-related syndromes or diseases. The MCA structured the 18 conditions 
      into three major dimensions: Degradation (D) driven by GS, Vascular (V), and 
      Psychosocial (P) representing 68.7%, 7.4%, and 5.7% of the total variance, 
      respectively. Dimension D was a strong predictor of future death and 
      institutionalization. Dimensions D and P were strongly associated with current 
      well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This work confirmed that multimorbidity is very common 
      among older adults, and demonstrated the essential role of GS as manifestations 
      of aging, even more than age-related diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions to support patients with complex needs have 
      proliferated in recent years, but the question of how to identify patients with 
      complex needs has received relatively little attention. There are innumerable 
      ways to structure inclusion and exclusion criteria for complex care 
      interventions, and little is known about the implications of choices made in 
      designing patient selection criteria. OBJECTIVE: To provide insights into the 
      design of patient selection criteria for interventions, by implementing criteria 
      sets within a large health plan member population and comparing the 
      characteristics of the resulting complex patient cohorts. DESIGN: Retrospective 
      observational descriptive study. SUBJECTS: Patients identified as having complex 
      needs, within the membership population of Kaiser Permanente Southern California, 
      a large, population-based health plan with more than 4 million members. We 
      characterize five commonly used archetypes of complex needs: high-cost patients, 
      patients with multiple chronic conditions, frail elders, emergency department 
      high-utilizers, and inpatient high-utilizers. MEASURES: We selected an initial 
      set of criteria for identifying patients in each of the archetypical complex 
      populations, based on available administrative data. We then tested multiple 
      variants of each definition. We compared the resulting patient cohorts using 
      univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 32.7% of 
      the 3,112,797 adults in our population-based sample were selected by at least one 
      of the 25 definitions of complexity we tested. Across definitions the total 
      number of patients identified as complex ranged from 622,560 to 1583 and complex 
      patient cohorts varied widely in demographic characteristics, chronic conditions, 
      healthcare utilization, spending, and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of patient 
      population is critical to the design of complex care programs. Exploratory 
      analyses of population criteria can provide useful information for program 
      planning in the setting of limited resources for interventions. Data such as 
      these should be generated as a key step in program design.

LID - e0255122
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty has been recognized as an independent risk factor for 
      inferior outcomes, but its effect on emergency general surgery (EGS) is 
      understudied. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to define the 
      impact of frailty on risk-adjusted mortality, non-home discharge, and readmission 
      following EGS operations. METHODS: Adults undergoing appendectomy, 
      cholecystectomy, small bowel resection, large bowel resection, repair of 
      perforated ulcer, or laparotomy within two days of an urgent admission were 
      identified in the 2016-2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was defined 
      using diagnosis codes corresponding to the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups 
      frailty indicator. Multivariable regression was used to study in-hospital 
      mortality and non-home discharge by operation, and Kaplan Meier analysis to study 
      freedom from unplanned readmission at up to 90-days follow-up. RESULTS: Among 
      655,817 patients, 11.9% were considered frail. Frail patients most commonly 
      underwent large bowel resection (37.3%) and cholecystectomy (29.2%). After 
      adjustment, frail patients had higher mortality rates for all operations compared 
      to nonfrail, including those most commonly performed (11.9% [95% CI 11.4-12.5%] 
      vs 6.0% [95% CI 5.8-6.3%] for large bowel resection; 2.3% [95% CI 2.0-2.6%] vs 
      0.2% [95% CI 0.2-0.2%] for cholecystectomy). Adjusted non-home discharge rates 
      were higher for frail compared to nonfrail patients following all operations, 
      including large bowel resection (68.1% [95% CI 67.1-69.0%] vs 25.9% [95% CI 
      25.2-26.5%]) and cholecystectomy (33.7% [95% CI 32.7-34.7%] vs 2.9% [95% CI 
      2.8-3.0%]). Adjusted hospitalization costs were nearly twice as high for frail 
      patients. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, frail patients had greater unplanned 
      readmissions (log rank P<0.001), with 1 in 4 rehospitalized within 90 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Frail patients have inferior clinical outcomes and greater resource 
      use following EGS, with the greatest absolute differences following complex 
      operations. Simple frailty assessments may inform expectations, identify patients 
      at risk of poor outcomes, and guide the need for more intensive postoperative 
      care.

TI  - A national intervention to support frail older adults in primary care: a protocol 
      for an adapted implementation framework.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older Canadians are high users of health care services, however the 
      health care system is not well-designed to meet the complex needs of many older 
      adults. Older persons often look to their primary care practitioners to assess 
      their needs and coordinate their care. The intervention seeks to improve primary 
      care for older persons living with frailty and will be implemented in six primary 
      care clinics in three Canadian provinces. Presently, more than 1.6 million older 
      Canadians are living with frailty, and this is projected to increase to 
      2.5 million within a decade (Canadian Frailty Network, Frailty Matters, 2020). 
      The model will include frailty screening, an online portal to expedite referrals 
      and improve coordination with community services, and several tools and 
      techniques to support patient and family engagement and shared decision-making. 
      Our project is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research 
      (CFIR) (Damschroder LJ, et al. Implement Scil, 4, 50, 2009). As others have done, 
      we adapted the CFIR for our work. Our adapted framework combines elements of the 
      socio-ecological model, key concepts from the CFIR, and elements from other 
      implementation science frameworks. Nested within a broader mixed-method 
      implementation study, the focus of this paper is to outline our guiding 
      conceptual framework and qualitative methods protocol. METHODS: We will use the 
      adapted CFIR framework to inform the data we collect and our analytic approach. 
      Our work is divided into three phases: (1) baseline assessment of 'usual care'; 
      (2) tailoring and implementing a new primary care model; and (3) evaluation. In 
      each of these phases we will engage in qualitative data collection, including 
      clinical observations, focus groups, in-depth interviews and extensive field 
      notes. At each site we will collect data with health care providers, key 
      informants (e.g., executive directors), and rostered patients ≥ 70 years. We will 
      engage in team-based analysis across multiple sites, three provinces and two 
      languages through regular telephone conferences, a comprehensive analysis 
      codebook, leadership from our Qualitative Working Group and a collective 
      appreciation that "science is a team sport" (Clinical Orthopaedics and Related 
      Research 471, 701-702, 2013). DISCUSSION: Outcomes of this research may be used 
      by other research teams who chose to adapt the CFIR framework to reflect the 
      unique contexts of their work, and clinicians seeking to implement our model, or 
      other models of care for frail older patients in primary care. TRIAL

TI  - Identifying Frequent Health Care Users and Care Consumption Patterns: Process 
      Mining of Emergency Medical Services Data.
PG  - e27499
LID - 10.2196/27499 [doi]
LID - e27499
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tracing frequent users of health care services is highly relevant to 
      policymakers and clinicians, enabling them to avoid wasting scarce resources. 
      Data collection on frequent users from all possible health care providers may be 
      cumbersome due to patient privacy, competition, incompatible information systems, 
      and the efforts involved. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the use of a single key 
      source, emergency medical services (EMS) records, to trace and reveal frequent 
      users' health care consumption patterns. METHODS: A retrospective study was 
      performed analyzing EMS calls from the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands 
      between 2012 and 2017. Process mining was applied to identify the structure of 
      patient routings (ie, their consecutive visits to hospitals, nursing homes, and 
      EMS). Routings are used to identify and quantify frequent users, recognizing 
      frail elderly users as a focal group. The structure of these routes was analyzed 
      at the patient and group levels, aiming to gain insight into regional 
      coordination issues and workload distributions among health care providers. 
      RESULTS: Frail elderly users aged 70 years or more represented over 50% of 
      frequent users, making 4 or more calls per year. Over the period of observation, 
      their annual number and the number of calls increased from 395 to 628 and 2607 to 
      3615, respectively. Structural analysis based on process mining revealed two 
      categories of frail elderly users: low-complexity patients who need dialysis, 
      radiation therapy, or hyperbaric medicine, involving a few health care providers, 
      and high-complexity patients for whom routings appear chaotic. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      efficient approach exploits the role of EMS as the unique regional "ferryman," 
      while the combined use of EMS data and process mining allows for the effective 
      and efficient tracing of frequent users' utilization of health care services. The 
      approach informs regional policymakers and clinicians by quantifying and 
      detailing frequent user consumption patterns to support subsequent policy 
      adaptations.

TI  - Clinical frailty scale: Inter-rater reliability of retrospective scoring in 
      emergency abdominal surgery.
PG  - 25-29
LID - 10.1111/aas.13974 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex syndrome shown to be an independent predictor of 
      morbidity and mortality after surgery in older patients. Frailty scoring may, 
      therefore, be important, for example, for pre-operative risk assessment and 
      prognosis estimation. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) has been developed to help 
      operationalize frailty in the individual patient. However, the inter-rater 
      reliability of retrospective CFS scoring through patient records by health care 
      personnel is currently unknown in patients over 80 years of age undergoing 
      emergency abdominal surgery. METHODS: Retrospective review of electronic patient 
      journal of 112 patients over 80 years of age undergoing emergency abdominal 
      surgery between 2015 and 2016. Three researchers individually assigned each 
      patient a CFS score. The inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen's 
      weighted kappa for the comparison of pairs of assessors, as well as Kendall's 
      coefficient of concordance for the comparison of all three raters simultaneously. 
      RESULTS: The agreement across raters was strong, with Cohen's kappa values 
      ranging between 0.74 and 0.85 and a Kendall's coefficient of concordance of 0.86. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The inter-rater reliability of assigned CFS from patient journals 
      seems acceptable. This could permit retrospective research utilizing CFS measures 
      from several raters and across centers.

TI  - Home-based Extended Rehabilitation for Older people (HERO): study protocol for an 
      individually randomised controlled multi-centre trial to determine the clinical 
      and cost-effectiveness of a home-based exercise intervention for older people 
      with frailty as extended rehabilitation following acute illness or injury, 
      including embedded process evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of older people (> 65 years) in hospital have frailty 
      and are at increased risk of readmission or death following discharge home. In 
      the UK, following acute hospitalisation, around one third of older people with 
      frailty are referred on for rehabilitation, termed 'intermediate care' services. 
      Although this rehabilitation can reduce early readmission to hospital 
      (< 30 days), recipients often do not feel ready to leave the service on 
      discharge, suggesting possible incomplete recovery. Limited evidence suggests 
      extended rehabilitation is of benefit in several conditions and there is 
      preliminary evidence that progressive physical exercise can improve mobility and 
      function for older people with frailty, and slow progression to disability. Our 
      aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Home-based Older People's Exercise 
      (HOPE) programme as extended rehabilitation for older people with frailty 
      discharged home from hospital or intermediate care services after acute illness 
      or injury. METHODS: A multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial, to 
      evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the HOPE programme. This 
      individualised, graded and progressive 24-week exercise programme is delivered by 
      NHS physiotherapy teams to people aged 65 and older with frailty, identified 
      using the Clinical Frailty Scale, following discharge from acute hospitalisation 
      and linked intermediate care rehabilitation pathways. The primary outcome is 
      physical health-related quality of life, measured using the physical component 
      summary score of the modified Short Form 36- item health questionnaire (SF36) at 
      12 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported physical and mental health, 
      functional independence, death, hospitalisations, care home admissions. Plans 
      include health economic analyses and an embedded process evaluation. DISCUSSION: 
      This trial seeks to determine if extended rehabilitation, via the HOPE programme, 
      can improve physical health-related quality of life for older people with frailty 
      following acute hospitalisation. Results will improve awareness of the 
      rehabilitation needs of older people with frailty, and provide evidence on the 
      clinical and cost-effectiveness of the targeted exercise intervention. There is 
      potential for considerable benefit for health and social care services through 
      widespread implementation of trial findings if clinical and cost-effectiveness is 
      demonstrated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 13927531 . Registered on April 19, 2017.

TI  - Psoas muscle area and attenuation are highly predictive of complications and 
      mortality after complex endovascular aortic repair.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the psoas muscle area and attenuation 
      (radiodensity), quantified by computed tomography, together with clinical risk 
      assessment, as predictors of outcomes after fenestrated and branched endovascular 
      aortic repair (FBEVAR). METHODS: The present single-center study included 504 
      patients who had undergone elective FBEVAR for pararenal or thoracoabdominal 
      aortic aneurysms. The clinical risk assessment included age, sex, comorbidities, 
      body mass index, glomerular filtration rate, aneurysm size and extent, cardiac 
      stress test results, ejection fraction, and American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      (ASA) score. Preoperative computed tomography was used to measure the psoas 
      muscle area and attenuation at the L3 level. The lean psoas muscle area (LPMA; 
      area in cm(2) multiplied by attenuation in Hounsfield units [HU]) was calculated 
      by multiplying the area by the attenuation. The risk factors for 90-day 
      mortality, major adverse events (MAEs), and long-term mortality were determined 
      using multivariable analysis. MAEs included 30-day or in-hospital death, acute 
      kidney injury, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, paraplegia, stroke, 
      and bowel ischemia. A novel risk stratification method was proposed according to 
      the strongest predictors of mortality and MAEs on multivariable analysis. 
      RESULTS: The 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and MAE rates were 2.0%, 5.6%, 
      and 20%, respectively. The independent predictors of 90-day mortality were 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, ASA score, and 
      LPMA. The independent predictors of MAEs were aneurysm diameter, glomerular 
      filtration rate, and LPMA. For long-term mortality, the independent predictors 
      were chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, extent I-III 
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, ASA score, and LPMA. The patients were 
      stratified into three groups according to the ASA score and LPMA: low risk, ASA 
      score II or LPMA >350 cm(2)HU (n = 290); medium risk, ASA score III and LPMA ≤350 
      cm(2)HU (n = 181); and high risk, ASA score IV and LPMA ≤350 cm(2)HU (n = 33). 
      The 90-day mortality and MAE rates were 1.7% and 16% in the low-, 7.2% and 24% in 
      the medium-, and 30% and 33% in the high-risk patients, respectively (P < .001 
      and P = .02, respectively). Patients with ASA score IV and LPMA <200 cm(2)HU, 
      indicating sarcopenia (n = 14) had a 43% risk of death within 90 days. The 3-year 
      survival estimates were 80% ± 3% for the low-, 70% ± 4% for the medium-, and 
      35% ± 9% for the high-risk patients (P < .001). The mean follow-up time was 3.1 ± 
      2.3 years. CONCLUSIONS: LPMA was a strong predictor of outcomes and the only 
      independent predictor of both mortality and MAEs after FBEVAR. A high muscle mass 
      was protective against complications, regardless of the ASA score. Risk 
      stratification based on the ASA score and LPMA can be used to identify patients 
      at excessively high operative risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome and serves as an indicator 
      for functional degradation in older adults. Regular exercise intervention could 
      reduce the level of frailty and improve general physical fitness. The aim of this 
      study was to test the effects of the Vitality Acupunch (VA) exercise on the 
      promotion of physical fitness and the improvement of frailty status among frail 
      older adults in long-term care facilities. METHOD: This study was a 
      cluster-randomized controlled trial adopted a pretest-posttest design. Using 
      convenience sampling, 81 frail adults older than 65 years of age from 10 
      long-term care facilities participated in this study. The older adults were 
      cluster-randomized by facility into an intervention group (5 long-term care 
      facilities, n = 40) and a control group (5 long-term care facilities, n = 41). 
      The intervention group engaged in the VA exercise 3 times a week, each lasting 
      40 min, for 24 weeks. The control group maintained regular activities of daily 
      living. The outcome measures for physical fitness were assessed before study 
      began (pretest), at the 12th week (posttest 1), and at the 24th week (posttest 2) 
      in the study. RESULTS: After a 24-week intervention, the frail older adults who 
      engaged in the VA exercise program showed significant improvements in handgrip 
      strength, upper-limb muscle endurance, lung function, shoulder flexibility, 
      forward flexion, shoulder joint flexion, and shoulder joint abduction (all 
      p < 0.05) but not in lower-limb muscle endurance (p = 0.502) compared against 
      their pretest data. The intervention group had significantly better physical 
      fitness and positive changes in frailty status than the control group (all 
      p < 0.001), except for the lower-limb muscle endurance (p = 0.557). CONCLUSION: 
      Regular engagement in the VA exercise program for 24 weeks significantly improved 
      the physical fitness and frailty status of frail older adults in long-term care 
      facilities.

TI  - Simple Carbohydrate Intake and Higher Risk for Physical Frailty Over 15 Years in 
      Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
PG  - 10-18
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glab243 [doi]
AB  - Insulin resistance is a major mechanism involved in the onset of physical frailty 
      (PF). Although rich carbohydrate diets may promote insulin resistance, few 
      studies have examined their association with PF risk. This study aimed to 
      investigate the spectrum of carbohydrate exposure, including carbohydrate intake 
      (simple, complex, and total), glycemic load (a measure of the diet-related 
      insulin demand), and adherence to a low-carbohydrate diet with the incident risk 
      of PF in community-dwelling older adults. Baseline carbohydrate exposure was 
      assessed in nonfrail participants of the Three-City Bordeaux cohort using a 
      24-hour dietary recall. Over 15 years of follow-up, participants were screened 
      for PF, defined by the FRAIL scale (≥3 criteria out of Fatigue, Resistance, 
      Ambulation, Illnesses, and weight Loss). Associations were estimated using 
      mixed-effects logistic models adjusted for sex, age, education, smoking status, 
      alcohol consumption, depressive symptomatology, global cognitive performances, 
      and protein and energy intakes. The sample included 1 210 participants (62% 
      females, mean age 76 years). Over the follow-up, 295 (24%) incident cases of PF 
      were documented (28% in females, 18% in males). Higher intake of simple 
      carbohydrates was significantly associated with greater odds of incident PF (per 
      1-SD increased: OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.02-1.62), specifically among males (OR = 
      1.52; 95% CI = 1.04-2.22). No association was observed with complex or total 
      carbohydrate intake, glycemic load, or low-carbohydrate diet. Among the whole 
      carbohydrate exposure, only higher consumption of simple carbohydrates in older 
      age was associated with a higher risk of developing PF. Further studies are 
      required to explore underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Medical decision-making for frail geriatric trauma patients is complex, 
      especially toward the end of life. The goal of this paper is to review aspects of 
      end-of-life decision-making, such as frailty, cognitive impairment, quality of 
      life, goals of care, and palliative care. Additionally, we make recommendations 
      for composing a patient-tailored treatment plan. In doing so, we seek to initiate 
      the much-needed discussion regarding end-of-life care for frail geriatric 
      patients.

TI  - Implications of the Metabolic Control of Diabetes in Patients with Frailty 
      Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191610327 [doi]
LID - 10327
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Frailty syndrome occurs more frequently in patients with diabetes 
      than in the general population. The reasons for this more frequent occurrence and 
      the interdependence of the two conditions are not well understood. To date, there 
      is no fully effective method for the diagnosis, prevention, and monitoring of 
      frailty syndrome. This study aimed to assess the degree of metabolic control of 
      diabetes in patients with frailty syndrome and to determine the impact of frailty 
      on the course of diabetes using a retrospective analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 103 individuals aged 60+ with diabetes were studied. The study 
      population included 65 women (63.1%) and 38 men (36.9%). The mean age was 72.96 
      years (SD 7.55). The study was conducted in the practice of a general 
      practitioner in Wielkopolska in 2018-2019. The research instrument was the 
      authors' original medical history questionnaire. The questions of the 
      questionnaire were related to age, education, and sociodemographic situation of 
      the respondents, as well as their dietary habits, health status, and use of 
      stimulants. Other instruments used were: the Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE), Lawton Scale (IADL-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), Katz Scale 
      (ADL-Activities of Daily Living), Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS), and 
      SHARE-FI scale (Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe). 
      Anthropometric and biochemical tests were performed. RESULTS: In the study, 
      frailty syndrome was diagnosed using the SHARE-FI scale in 26 individuals (25%): 
      32 (31.1%) were pre-frailty and 45 (43.7%) represented a non-frailty group. 
      Statistical analysis revealed that elevated HbA1c levels were associated with a 
      statistically significant risk of developing frailty syndrome (p = 0.048). In 
      addition, the co-occurrence of diabetes and frailty syndrome was found to be a 
      risk factor for loss of functional capacity or limitation in older adults (p = 
      0.00) and was associated with the risk of developing depression (p &lt; 0.001) 
      and cognitive impairment (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Concerning metabolic 
      control of diabetes, higher HbA1c levels in the elderly are a predictive factor 
      for the development of frailty syndrome. No statistical significance was found 
      for the other parameters of metabolic control in diabetes. People with frailty 
      syndrome scored significantly higher on the Geriatric Depression Rating Scale and 
      lower on the MMSE cognitive rating scale than the comparison group. This suggests 
      that frailty is a predictive factor for depression and cognitive impairment. 
      Patients with frailty and diabetes have significantly lower scores on the Basic 
      Activities of Daily Living Rating Scale and the Complex Activities of Daily 
      Living Rating Scale, which are associated with loss or limitation of functioning. 
      Frailty syndrome is a predictive factor for loss of functional capacity in the 
      elderly.

AB  - Case-Finding for Complex Chronic Conditions in Seniors 75+ (C5-75) is a 
      systematic approach to identify frailty using gait speed and hand-grip strength 
      and to screen for co-morbid conditions. We identified the C5-75 features offering 
      the highest yield for identifying frailty and to streamline the screening 
      program. Analyses included 1,948 C5-75 assessments completed from 2013 to 2018. 
      Age 85 or older, less than regular physical activity, and more than two falls in 
      the previous six months had the strongest associations with frailty. Exempting 
      patients under 85 who reported regular physical activity and less than two falls 
      excluded 39.1 per cent of the cohort while maintaining a sensitivity of 95.2 per 
      cent and a negative predictive value of 99.4 per cent for frailty. These findings 
      provide insight into optimizing screening for frailty, making it more feasible to 
      implement and to identify co-existing conditions that may contribute to or be 
      affected by frailty.

TI  - Frailty screening in older adults: is annual screening necessary in primary care?
PG  - 12-18
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmab055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Case-finding for Complex Chronic Conditions in Adults 75+ (C5-75) 
      involves annual frailty screening in primary care using dual-trait screening 
      measures of handgrip strength and gait speed, with additional screening for 
      co-existing conditions in those deemed frail. OBJECTIVE: To identify low-risk 
      individuals who could be screened for frailty every 2 years, rather than 
      annually. METHODS: This study examined a prospective cohort of patients who 
      completed at least two annual C5-75 screenings between April 2014 and December 
      2018. Handgrip strength and gait speed on initial assessment were categorized 
      based on proximity to frailty thresholds and were used to predict frailty risk on 
      the second assessment. We used Fisher's exact test to assess differences in risk. 
      Logistic regression models tested associations between independent variables of 
      age, patient activity level, falls history, grip strength and gait speed on first 
      assessment and dependent variable of frailty on subsequent assessment. RESULTS: 
      Analyses included 571 patients with two annual assessments. Frailty risk on the 
      second assessment was significantly higher for patients who had gait speed or 
      grip strength within 20% of the frailty threshold (5.7%), compared with the other 
      categories (0.7%, 0.9%, 0%; P = 0.002); 60% of patients fell within these lower 
      risk categories. Controlling for grip strength and gait speed, no other measures 
      had significant associations with frailty risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      demonstrate that 60% patients are at low risk (<1%) of transitioning to frailty 
      by the next annual assessment. Reducing screening frequency from annually to 
      every 2 years may be appropriate for these patients.

OAB - Frail older adults are at greater risk for illness, functional decline, increased 
      health service use and institutionalization. Adults 75 years of age and older 
      should be screened regularly for frailty to provide early treatment for 
      co-occurring conditions that may impact frailty but that may also be affected by 
      frailty. Walking (gait) speed and handgrip strength are feasible measures of 
      frailty to use on an annual basis in primary care. This study assesses the 
      transition to frailty over a 1-year time period for the purpose of streamlining 
      frailty screening in primary care for those patients who do not require annual 
      screening. We found that when patients’ grip strength and gait speed scores were 
      20% higher than the point at which people are identified as frail, they are at 
      low risk for becoming frail by their next annual assessment. Frailty screening 
      every 2 years may be appropriate for these patients. This streamlined screening 
      process may make it more feasible for busy family practices to implement this 
      type of frailty screening.

AB  - Frailty is considered to be a complex concept based mainly on physical 
      vulnerability, but also vulnerabilities in mental/psychological and social 
      aspects. Frailty can be reversible with appropriate intervention; however, 
      factors that are important in recovering from frailty have not been clarified. 
      The aim of the present study was to identify factors that help an individual 
      reverse frailty progression and characteristics of individuals that have 
      recovered from frailty. Community-dwelling people aged ≥75 years who responded to 
      the Kihon Checklist (KCL) were enrolled in the study. The KCL consists of 25 
      yes/no questions in 7 areas: daily-life related activities, motor functions, 
      nutritional status, oral functions, homebound, cognitive functions, and depressed 
      mood. The number of social activities, degree of trust in the community, degree 
      of interaction with neighbors, and subjective age were also evaluated. Frailty 
      was assessed based on the number of checked items: 0-3 for robust, 4-7 for 
      pre-frailty, and ≥8 for frailty. A total of 5050 participants were included for 
      statistical analysis. At the time of the baseline survey in 2016, 18.7% (n = 942) 
      of respondents had frailty, and the follow-up survey showed that the recovery 
      rate from frailty within 2 years (median 24 months) was 31.8% (n = 300). Multiple 
      logistic regression analysis showed that exercise-based social participation 
      (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.4; P<0.01) and 
      self-rated health (OR 1.2, CI 1.0-1.5; P = 0.02) were related to reversing 
      frailty progression. Principal component analysis indicated that the main factors 
      constituting the first principal component (contribution rate, 18.3%) included 
      items related to social capital, such as interaction with neighbors, trust in the 
      community, and number of social participation activities. Our results demonstrate 
      that exercise-based social participation and high self-rated health have 
      associations with reversing frailty progression. Individuals that recovered from 
      frailty are characterized by high individual-level social capital components 
      (i.e., trust in community, interaction with neighbors, and social participation).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Maintaining independence is a primary goal of community health and 
      care services for older people, but there is currently insufficient guidance 
      about which services to implement. Therefore, we aim to synthesise evidence on 
      the effectiveness of community-based complex interventions to sustain 
      independence for older people, including the effect of frailty, and group 
      interventions to identify the best configurations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). We will include randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs of community-based complex 
      interventions to sustain independence for older people living at home (mean age 
      ≥65 years), compared with usual care or another complex intervention. We will 
      search MEDLINE (1946 to September 2020), Embase (1947 to September 2020), CINAHL 
      (1981 to September 2020), PsycINFO (1806 to September 2020), CENTRAL and clinical 
      trial registries from inception to September 2020, without date/language 
      restrictions, and scan included papers' reference lists. Main outcomes were: 
      living at home, activities of daily living (basic/instrumental), home-care 
      services usage, hospitalisation, care home admission, costs and cost 
      effectiveness. Additional outcomes were: health status, depression, loneliness, 
      falls and mortality. Interventions will be coded, summarised and grouped. An NMA 
      using a multivariate random-effects model for each outcome separately will 
      determine the relative effects of different complex interventions. For each 
      outcome, we will produce summary effect estimates for each pair of treatments in 
      the network, with 95% CI, ranking plots and measures, and the borrowing of 
      strength statistic. Inconsistency will be examined using a 'design-by-treatment 
      interaction' model. We will assess risk of bias (Cochrane tool V.2) and certainty 
      of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
      Evaluation for NMA approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research will use 
      aggregated, anonymised, published data. Findings will be reported according to 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance. They 
      will be disseminated to policy-makers, commissioners and providers, and via 
      conferences and scientific journals. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Lower 1-Year Postoperative Mortality After Acetabular Versus Proximal Femoral 
      Fractures in Elderly Patients.
PG  - 1807-1816
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.20.01805 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Geriatric acetabular fractures are becoming more common due to 
      demographic changes. Compared with proximal femoral fractures, surgical treatment 
      is more complex and often does not allow full-weight-bearing. The aims of this 
      study were to compare operatively treated acetabular and proximal femoral 
      fractures with regard to (1) cumulative 1-year mortality, (2) perioperative 
      complications, and (3) predictive factors associated with a higher 1-year 
      mortality. METHODS: This institutional review board-approved comparative study 
      included 486 consecutive surgically treated elderly patients (136 acetabular and 
      350 proximal femoral fractures). After matching, 2 comparable groups of 129 
      acetabular and 129 proximal femoral fractures were analyzed. Cumulative 1-year 
      mortality was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis, and 
      perioperative complications were documented and graded. After confirming that the 
      proportionality assumption was met, Cox proportional hazard modeling was 
      conducted to identify factors associated with increased 1-year mortality. 
      RESULTS: The acetabular fracture group had a significantly lower cumulative 
      1-year mortality before matching (18% compared with 33% for proximal femoral 
      fractures, log-rank p = 0.001) and after matching (18% compared with 36%, 
      log-rank p = 0.005). Nevertheless, it had a significantly higher overall 
      perioperative complication rate (68% compared with 48%, p < 0.001). In our 
      multivariable Cox regression analysis, older age, perioperative blood loss of >1 
      L, and wheelchair mobilization were associated with lower survival rates after 
      acetabular fracture surgery. Older age and a higher 5-item modified frailty index 
      were associated with a higher 1-year mortality rate after proximal femoral 
      fractures, whereas postoperative full weight-bearing was protective. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite the complexity of operative treatment and a higher complication rate 
      after acetabular fractures in the elderly, the 1-year mortality rate is lower 
      than that after operative treatment of proximal femoral fractures, even after 
      adjustment for comorbidities. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See 
      Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

      the Development of a Personalized Digital Health Hub Model of Care for Hip 
      Fractures: Mixed Methods Exploratory Study.
PG  - e26886

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most older people after a hip fracture injury never return to their 
      prefracture status, and some are admitted to residential aged care facilities. 
      Advancement of digital technology has helped in optimizing health care including 
      self-management and telerehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand 
      the perspectives of older patients with hip fracture and their family members and 
      residential aged caregivers on the feasibility of developing a model of care 
      using a personalized digital health hub. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods 
      study in South Australia involving patients aged 50 years and older, their family 
      members, and residential aged caregivers. Quantitative data analysis included 
      basic demographic characteristics, and access to digital devices was analyzed 
      using descriptive statistics. Spearman rank-order correlation was used to examine 
      correlations between the perceived role of a personalized digital health hub in 
      improving health and the likelihood of subsequent use. Findings from qualitative 
      analysis were interpreted using constructs of capability, opportunity, and 
      motivation to help understand the factors influencing the likelihood of potential 
      personalized digital health hub use. RESULTS: This study recruited 100 
      participants-55 patients, 13 family members, and 32 residential aged caregivers. 
      The mean age of the patients was 76.4 (SD 8.4, range 54-88) years, and 60% 
      (33/55) of the patients were female. Approximately 50% (34/68) of the patients 
      and their family members had access to digital devices, despite less than 
      one-third using computers as part of their occupation. Approximately 72% (72/100) 
      of the respondents thought that personalized digital health hub could improve 
      health outcomes in patients. However, a moderate negative correlation existed 
      with increasing age and likelihood of personalized digital health hub use 
      (Spearman ρ=-0.50; P<.001), and the perceived role of the personalized digital 
      health hub in improving health had a strong positive correlation with the 
      likelihood of personalized digital health hub use by self (Spearman ρ=0.71; 
      P<.001) and by society, including friends and family members (Spearman ρ=0.75; 
      P<.001). Most patients (54/55, 98%) believed they had a family member, friend, or 
      caregiver who would be able to help them use a personalized digital health hub. 
      Qualitative analysis explored capability by understanding aspects of existing 
      knowledge, including willingness to advance digital navigation skills. Access 
      could be improved through supporting opportunities, and factors influencing 
      intrinsic motivation were considered crucial for designing a personalized digital 
      health hub-enabled model of care. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasized the complex 
      relationship between capabilities, motivation, and opportunities for patients, 
      their family members, and formal caregivers as a patient networked unit. The next 
      stage of research will continue to involve a cocreation approach followed by 
      iterative processes and understand the factors influencing the development and 
      successful integration of complex digital health care interventions in real-world 
      scenarios.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of preoperative frailty on short-term outcomes 
      following complex head and neck surgeries (HNSs). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      database analysis. SETTING: American College of Surgeons National Surgical 
      Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. METHODS: The 2005 to 2017 
      ACS-NSQIP was queried for patients undergoing complex HNS. Five-item modified 
      frailty index (mFI) was calculated based on functional status and history of 
      diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and 
      chronic hypertension. RESULTS: A total of 2786 patients (73.1% male) with a mean 
      age of 62.0 ± 11.6 years were included. Compared to nonfrail patients (41.2%), 
      patients with mFI ≥1 (58.8%) had shorter length of operation (P = .021), longer 
      length of stay (LOS) (P < .001), and higher rates of 30-day reoperation (P = 
      .009), medical complications (P < .001), discharge to nonhome facility (DNHF) (P 
      < .001), and mortality (P = .047). These parameters remained statistically 
      significant when compared across all individual mFI scores (all P < .05). After 
      adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, and American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists score via multivariate logistic regression, patients with mFI 
      ≥1 were significantly more likely to undergo reoperation (odds ratio [OR], 1.39), 
      surgical complications (OR, 1.19), medical complications (OR, 1.55), prolonged 
      LOS (OR, 1.29), and DNHF (OR, 1.56) (all P < .05). Multivariate logistic 
      regression also demonstrated that after adjusting for confounders, compared to 
      patients with mFI = 1, patients with mFI = 2-5 (18.7%) were more likely to 
      undergo shorter operations (OR, 0.74), have medical (OR, 1.46) or any 
      complications (OR, 1.27), and have DNHF (OR, 1.62) (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: The 
      5-point mFI can independently predict short-term surgical outcomes following 
      complex HNS. This simple and reliable metric can potentially lead to improved 
      preoperative counseling and postoperative planning for complex HNS patients.

TI  - Projecting prevalence of frailty and dementia and the economic cost of care in 
      Japan from 2016 to 2043: a microsimulation modelling study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia and frailty often accompany one another in older age, 
      requiring complex care and resources. Available projections provide little 
      information on their joint impact on future health-care need from different 
      segments of society and the associated costs. Using a newly developed 
      microsimulation model, we forecast this situation in Japan as its population ages 
      and decreases in size. METHODS: In this microsimulation modelling study, we built 
      a model that simulates an individual's status transition across 11 chronic 
      diseases (including diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke) as well as 
      depression, functional status, and self-reported health, by age, sex, and 
      educational strata (less than high school, high school, and college and higher), 
      on the basis of nationally representative health surveys and existing cohort 
      studies. Using the simulation results, we projected the prevalence of dementia 
      and frailty, life expectancy with these conditions, and the economic cost for 
      formal and informal care over the period 2016-43 in the population of Japan aged 
      60 years and older. FINDINGS: Between 2016 and 2043, life expectancy at age 65 
      years will increase from 23·7 years to 24·9 years in women and from 18·7 years to 
      19·9 years in men. Years spent with dementia will decrease from 4·7 to 3·9 years 
      in women and 2·2 to 1·4 years in men. By contrast, years spent with frailty will 
      increase from 3·7 to 4·0 years for women and 1·9 to 2·1 for men, and across all 
      educational groups. By 2043, approximately 29% of women aged 75 years and older 
      with a less than high school education are estimated to have both dementia and 
      frailty, and so will require complex care. The expected need for health care and 
      formal long-term care is anticipated to reach costs of US$125 billion for 
      dementia and $97 billion for frailty per annum in 2043 for the country. 
      INTERPRETATION: Japan's Government and policy makers should consider the 
      potential social challenges in caring for a sizable population of older people 
      with frailty and dementia, and a widening disparity in the burden of those 
      conditions by sex and by educational status. The future burden of dementia and 
      frailty should be countered not only by curative and preventive technology 
      innovation, but also by social policies to mitigate the health gap. FUNDING:

TI  - Adherence Is More Than Just Being Present: Example of a Lay-Led Home-Based 
      Programme with Physical Exercise, Nutritional Improvement and Social Support, in 
      Prefrail and Frail Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18084192 [doi]
LID - 4192
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the implementation of lifestyle interventions 
      in frail, community-dwelling people. This study highlights different domains of 
      adherence to explain an effectively delivered home-based intervention. METHODS: 
      Eighty prefrail and frail persons (≥65 years) participated in a physical 
      training, nutritional, and social support intervention over 24 weeks. A detailed 
      log book was kept for comprehensive documentation in order to assess adherence 
      and further organizational, exercise, and nutritional parameters. RESULTS: 
      Participants reached an adherence rate (performed home visits/number of planned 
      visits) of 84.0/80.5% from week 1-12/13-24. Out of those, 59% carried out ≥75% of 
      the offered visits. Older age was associated with a higher adherence rate. A mean 
      of 1.5 (0.6) visits/week (2 were planned) were realized lasting for a mean of 1.5 
      (0.9) hours (154% of the planned duration). Per visit, 1.2 (0.6) circuits of 
      strength training were performed (60.5% of the planned value) and 0.5 (0.3) 
      nutritional interventions (47%). After twelve months, 4.2% still carried out the 
      home visits regularly and 25.0% occasionally. CONCLUSION: Adherence is much more 
      than "being there". Adherence rate and category are limited parameters to 
      describe the implementation of a complex lifestyle intervention, therefore a 
      comprehensive documentation is needed.

AB  - In this scoping review, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated 
      multidisciplinary team discharge planning and identify common outcomes among 
      older adults with complex needs, focusing on a safe transition from the hospital 
      to the community. We performed a literature search for relevant articles using 
      seven electronic databases and agreed search terms. Only articles published in 
      English were included. In total, 23,772 articles were identified, with 27 
      articles meeting the inclusion criteria. A preponderance of patients aged ≥65 
      years and women was inferred based on population demographics. Initiatives on 
      complex discharge planning were noted across most Western countries. Common 
      outcomes of complex discharge planning were functionality (n = 11) including 
      frailty (n = 4), quality of life (n = 11), and patient-centered factors including 
      psychosocial needs (n = 9). Various outcomes from complex discharge planning 
      initiatives and pathways were explored in this scoping review. None of the 
      selected studies covered all nine domains of outcome assessment. Further research 
      is needed involving follow-up studies after complex discharge planning 
      interventions to assess their true effectiveness or value.

TI  - Rationale and Design of the TARGET-EFT Trial: Multicomponent Intervention for 
      Frail and Pre-frail Patients Hospitalized with Acute Cardiac Conditions.
PG  - 282-289
LID - 10.1007/s12603-022-1759-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the aging population and rising rates of cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD), cardiologists and cardiac surgeons are encountering a growing number of 
      frail older patients that have complex cardiac and non-cardiac issues. Measuring 
      frailty provides valuable prognostic information to help personalize treatment 
      decisions. However, there is minimal evidence on multicomponent frailty 
      interventions in this setting. The TARGET-EFT (The MulTicomponent Acute 
      Intervention in FRail GEriatric PaTients with cardiovascular disease using the 
      Essential Frailty Toolset) trial aims to target physical and non-physical frailty 
      deficits to improve health-related quality of life and hospital-acquired 
      disability in frail patients hospitalized with CVD. METHODS: The TARGET-EFT trial 
      is a single-center parallel-group randomized clinical trial in frail and 
      pre-frail older adults ≥65 years admitted to the cardiovascular unit (CVU) at the 
      Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec. The trial will compare usual inpatient 
      care to a multicomponent intervention targeting physical weakness, cognitive 
      impairment, malnutrition, and anemia. Outcomes of interest in both groups will be 
      assessed at three time points: (1) study enrollment, (2) discharge from the CVU, 
      and (3) 30 days after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The overarching goal is to 
      treat patients' frailty in parallel with their CVD, and in doing so, optimize 
      patient functional losses while in-hospital and shortly thereafter. The results 
      of this trial will inform best practices for patient-centered care in this 
      vulnerable patient group.

TI  - Bifurcated bypass in severe chronic limb threatening ischaemia.
PG  - 63-71
LID - 10.1177/1708538121999856 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Revascularization according to the angiosome concept is of proven 
      importance for limb salvage in chronic limb threatening ischaemia but it is not 
      always practicable. Bifurcated bypasses could be considered as an option when an 
      endovascular approach is not feasible or has already failed and a single bypass 
      would not allow direct revascularization of the ischaemic area. Bifurcated 
      bypasses are characterized by landing on two different arteries, the main artery 
      (in direct continuity with the foot vessels) and the secondary one (perfusing the 
      angiosome district). The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and 
      effectiveness of bifurcated bypass in chronic limb threatening ischaemia. 
      METHODS: Thirty-five patients were consecutively treated with a bifurcated bypass 
      for chronic limb threatening ischaemia from January 2014 to December 2019 in a 
      single vascular surgery centre. Data from clinical records and operative 
      registers were collected prospectively in an electronic database and 
      retrospectively analysed. Primary and primary assisted bypass patency, 
      amputation-free survival, morbidity and mortality rates at 12 and 24 months were 
      analysed. RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 25.1 months (range 2-72 months). 
      Thirty-six bifurcated bypasses were performed on 35 patients (age 
      75.3 ± 7.2 years; 69.4% were male). According to Wound, Ischemia, foot Infection 
      classification 22.2% belonged to stage 3 and 77.8% to stage 4 and the mean 
      Rutherford's class was 5.1 ± 0.7. Immediate technical success was 100%. Early 
      mortality and morbidity rates were respectively 5.5%, and 33.3%; foot surgery was 
      performed in 50% of cases with wound healing in all patients. Primary patency and 
      primary assisted bypass patency were 96.7% and 100% at 6 months; 85.2% and 92% at 
      12 months, 59.9% and 73.4% at 24 months, respectively. Amputation-free survival 
      at 12 and 24 months was, respectively, 95.6% and 78.8%. Overall survival rates at 
      12 and 24 months were respectively 94.4% and 91.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Bifurcates 
      bypass can provide good results in patients with chronic limb threatening 
      ischaemia without endovascular option, especially in diabetic ones. Bifurcated 
      bypass is a complex surgical solution, both to be planned and performed, and it 
      is quite invasive for frail patients that should be accurately selected.

TI  - Nursing, frailty, functional decline and models of care in relation to older 
      people receiving long-term care: a scoping review protocol.
PG  - e061303
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061303 [doi]
LID - e061303
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older people receiving healthcare in long-term care contexts (eg, 
      home healthcare, sheltered housing and nursing home contexts) are especially 
      vulnerable to developing frailty and functional decline. Considering the negative 
      effects associated with these conditions and the possibility of preventing them 
      from progressing, it is vital that nurses possess a broad knowledge base related 
      to them. Particularly as prevention related to these conditions lies well within 
      their remit. Such knowledge could guide the development of effective models of 
      care, ensuring continuity and, hence, quality of care. Our objective will be to 
      review published literature on existing models of care targeting frailty and/or 
      functional decline and how these conditions are described by older people 
      themselves, significant others and nurses in relation to long-term care. METHODS 
      AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review will be conducted in accordance with Arksey and 
      O'Malley's methodological framework. Recent methodological developments will be 
      considered. PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO will be searched. Eligibility criteria 
      will be peer-reviewed papers and written in English. All types of study designs 
      will be eligible and included papers will be quality and ethically assessed. The 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      (PRISMA)-Protocol checklist for protocols and the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews 
      checklist were followed in this paper. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As the study 
      outlined in this protocol is a scoping review, no ethics approval was needed for 
      this protocol nor for the upcoming study. The findings will be published in an 
      open-access, peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, the findings will guide a 
      research project following the Medical Research Council's framework for 
      developing and evaluating complex interventions. Thus, supporting us in 
      developing a model of care related to the detection and prevention of frailty 
      and/or functional decline among older people in a long-term care context.

TI  - Clinical Considerations for Insulin Therapy in Older Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.
PG  - 23-37
LID - 10.1007/s40266-021-00900-3 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes represents an autoimmune condition with a strong inherited 
      background, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. About 25% of such cases 
      are diagnosed in adulthood, some even as late as the ninth decade of life. The 
      number of older adults with type 1 diabetes is increasing due to improvements in 
      care and decreased mortality rate. However, there is a lack of clinical trials in 
      people older than 70 years of age with type 1 diabetes complicated with 
      comorbidities, frailty, and dependency. The management of type 1 diabetes and the 
      goals of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's health status 
      and life expectancy. In healthier older adults, insulin treatment regimens 
      (multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy) that approximate the 
      normal physiology of insulin secretion should be used to achieve lower glycemic 
      goals, while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia with frequent glucose monitoring 
      (preferably using continuous glucose monitoring systems). For frail individuals 
      with poor health, simpler insulin regimens and less stringent glycemic targets 
      would be more appropriate. Poor cognition, vision and hearing, impaired mobility, 
      depression, and chronic pain can interfere with complex insulin regimens. In 
      these individuals, the principal goals of therapy are to reduce the acute effects 
      of hyperglycemia, minimize hypoglycemia risk, and optimize quality of life. The 
      newer insulin preparations and technological advances in insulin delivery and 
      blood glucose monitoring have enhanced the management of type 1 diabetes in all 
      age groups.

TI  - Community health worker interventions for older adults with complex health needs: 
      A systematic review.
PG  - 1670-1682
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The number of older adults with complex health needs is 
      growing, and this population experiences disproportionate morbidity and 
      mortality. Interventions led by community health workers (CHWs) can improve 
      clinical outcomes in the general adult population with multimorbidity, but few 
      studies have investigated CHW-delivered interventions in older adults. DESIGN: We 
      systematically reviewed the impact of CHW interventions on health outcomes among 
      older adults with complex health needs. We searched for English-language articles 
      from database inception through April 2020 using seven databases. PROSPERO 
      protocol registration CRD42019118761. SETTING: Any U.S. or international setting, 
      including clinical and community-based settings. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 
      60 years or older with complex health needs, defined in this review as 
      multimorbidity, frailty, disability, or high-utilization. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Interventions led by a CHW or similar role consistent with the American Public 
      Health Association's definition of CHWs. MEASUREMENTS: Pre-defined health 
      outcomes (chronic disease measures, general health measures, treatment adherence, 
      quality of life, or functional measures) as well as qualitative findings. 
      RESULTS: Of 5671 unique records, nine studies met eligibility criteria, including 
      four randomized controlled trials, three quasi-experimental studies, and two 
      qualitative studies. Target population and intervention characteristics were 
      variable, and studies were generally of low-to-moderate methodological quality. 
      Outcomes included mood, functional status and disability, social support, 
      well-being and quality of life, medication knowledge, and certain health 
      conditions (e.g., falls, cognition). Results were mixed with several studies 
      demonstrating significant effects on mood and function, including one 
      high-quality RCT, while others noted no significant intervention effects on 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: CHW-led interventions may have benefit for older adults 
      with complex health needs, but additional high-quality studies are needed to 
      definitively determine the effectiveness of CHW interventions in this population. 
      Integration of CHWs into geriatric clinical settings may be a strategy to deliver 
      evidence-based interventions and improve clinical outcomes in complex older 
      adults.

TI  - Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix Reconstruction of Complex Perineal Burn Wound: A 
      Case Report.
PG  - 1038-1042
LID - 10.1093/jbcr/irab073 [doi]
AB  - This case report details our experience using a two-stage Biodegradable 
      Temporizing Matrix (NovoSorb® PolyNovo Ltd) and autograft for acute 
      reconstruction of a complex perineal burn wound in an elderly comorbid patient. A 
      77-year-old man sustained 42% full-thickness burns extending circumferentially 
      from bilateral thighs and buttocks, across the entire perineal and genital 
      regions up to his mid-trunk, following self-immolation using an accelerant. Early 
      total burn wound excision was carried out with acute application of Biodegradable 
      Temporizing Matrix to all affected sites. Excellent integration and 
      vascularization of Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix took place despite the 
      challenge of intermittent fecal contamination affecting the perineal and buttock 
      burn sites and matrix colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms. 
      Delamination and serial split-thickness skin autografting were carried out 42 
      days after the first matrix application with complete and robust graft take. 
      Perineal burns present a reconstructive challenge due to the proximity of 
      specialized structures such as the genitalia, urethral, and anal orifices. 
      Restoration of complex anatomy and function may be required after debridement 
      with increased risks of infection, contracture formation, and mortality compared 
      with burns affecting other anatomical sites. Two-stage Biodegradable Temporizing 
      Matrix represents a reliable reconstruction option for complex extensive perineal 
      wounds in frail elderly patients, despite an unfavorable local microbial 
      environment.

TI  - Modern Lower Extremity Bypass Outcomes by Anesthesia Type in the Veteran 
      Population.
PG  - 187-195
LID - S0890-5096(21)00736-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.avsg.2021.08.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower extremity bypass (LEB) revascularization can be performed under 
      general (GA) or neuraxial anesthesia (NA). Studies show that the use of NA may 
      decrease morbidity, 30-day mortality, and hospital length-of-stay (LOS). The goal 
      of our analysis is to examine the differences in postsurgical outcomes following 
      LEB between patients who undergo GA compared to NA in the Veteran Affairs 
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database. METHODS: After IRB 
      approval, the VASQIP database was assessed for patients who underwent LEB between 
      1998-2018. Only infrainguinal bypass procedures and anesthesia type classified as 
      "general," "epidural," or "spinal" were included. The neuraxial cohort includes 
      both spinal and epidural anesthesia patients. The Risk Analysis Index (RAI), a 
      validated measure of frailty, was additionally calculated for each patient. Chi 
      squared, paired t-test, and binary logistic regression were used to compare the 
      cohorts. RESULTS: During this period, 22,960 veterans underwent LEB recorded in 
      VASQIP. Compared to those who underwent surgery under GA, patients with 
      procedures performed using NA were older (66.4 ± 9.6 years vs. 65.3 ± 9 years 
      respectively; P <0.001) and more frail (average RAI score 25.7 ± 7.0 vs. 24.9 ± 
      6.7; P < 0.001). Operative time was shorter in the NA group (4.1 ± 1.7 hrs vs. 
      4.7 ± 3.0 hrs; P < 0.001) and fewer cases were emergent (1.55% vs. 4.13%; P 
      <0.001). Patients in the GA group had higher rates of postoperative prolonged 
      ileus (0.31% vs. 0.00%; P = 0.03), pneumonia (1.60% vs. 1.06%; P = 0.025), deep 
      wound infection (2.67% vs. 2.61%; P = 0.01), sepsis (1.68% vs. 0.79%; P < 0.001), 
      reintubation (1.80% vs. 1.30%) (P = 0.04),and number of packed red blood cell 
      (pRBC) transfused intraoperatively (0.39 ± 1.21 units vs. 0.22 ± 0.79 units; P 
      <0.001). There was no significant difference in rate of graft failure, return to 
      the OR, myocardial infarction, death, or LOS. In regression analysis, those 
      undergoing NA were less likely to require pRBC transfusion intraoperatively (OR: 
      0.43; 95% CI: 0.31-0.61; P < 0.001), however no other outcomes reached 
      statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Although younger and less frail, veteran 
      patients undergoing GA for lower extremity revascularization had higher rates of 
      postoperative ileus, pneumonia, deep wound infection, sepsis, and need for 
      transfusion as compared to those undergoing NA. There was no significant 
      difference in the rate of other major complications, myocardial infarction, death 
      or LOS. After adjustment, only intraoperative transfusion remained statistically 
      significant, likely reflecting longer and more complex cases for those that 
      undergo general anesthesia rather than the effect of anesthetic choice itself.

AB  - Covid-19 clinical presentation is extremely heterogenous, especially in older 
      patients due to the possible presence of atypical symptoms, such as delirium, 
      hyporexia and falls. The clinical characteristics at onset are influenced by the 
      presence of common health-related conditions in older people, such as 
      comorbidity, disability and frailty, and not simply by chronological age. Few 
      studies investigated the tendency of Covid-19 symptoms to aggregate in cluster 
      and the use of cluster approach might better describe the clinical complexity of 
      the acute disease. Concerning the prognostic significance of Covid-19 clinical 
      presentation in older people, the available literature still provides discordant 
      results.

TI  - Clinical Decision Path for Identifying Recurrent Falls in Late Middle-Aged and 
      Older Patients With Chronic Schizophrenia.
PG  - e167
LID - 10.1097/JNR.0000000000000444 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls are a major hazard for elderly patients with schizophrenia. As 
      patients with schizophrenia may experience a more-accelerated rate of physical 
      aging than the overall elderly population, the risk of falls may emerge during 
      the late middle-age period in this population. Furthermore, the risk of falls is 
      affected by multiple, interrelated risk factors. PURPOSE: This study was 
      undertaken to capture the complexity of the risk of falls in patients with 
      schizophrenia. A cross-sectional approach was used to apply classification and 
      regression tree (CART) analysis to generate a clinical decision path to identify 
      the risk factors of recurrent falls in late middle-aged and older patients with 
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-one patients aged 55 years or older 
      were recruited from psychiatric halfway houses for assessment. Frailty, physical 
      functional performance, depressive severity, cognitive function, and level of 
      fatigue were measured, respectively, using the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures 
      Frailty Index, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Center for 
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Short Portable Mental Status 
      Questionnaire (SPMSQ), and Chinese version of the Fatigue Severity Scale. The 
      variables revealed by descriptive statistics to be statistically significant were 
      further analyzed using CART analysis. RESULTS: The overall proportion of 
      recurrent fallers in this study was 19.2%. CART analysis revealed eight end 
      groups and identified four predictors: frailty, physical functional performance, 
      cognitive function, and sex. The most prominent condition for recurrent fallers 
      was frailty, present in 57.1% of the frail participants. In the nonfrail group 
      (both prefrail and robust), participants with an SPPB score of less than 10 had a 
      29.7% chance of being a recurrent faller versus 13.6% for those with an SPPB 
      score of 10 or more. Furthermore, an SPMSQ score of 7 was the next-best split 
      among participants without frailty, with an SPPB score of 10 or more. Finally, 
      among participants without frailty and with an SPPB score of 10 or more and an 
      SPMSQ score of more than 7, the proportion of recurrent fallers was higher in 
      women than men. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that assessing 
      frailty status may be an effective, first-step approach to identifying 
      schizophrenic patients at an increased risk of recurrent falls. Among patients 
      with prefrailty or robust status, an SPPB score cutoff of 10, an SPMSQ score 
      cutoff of 7, and being female may be used sequentially to identify individuals at 
      a heightened risk of recurrent falls.

AB  - The concept of physical resilience may help geriatric medicine objectively assess 
      patients' ability to 'bounce back' from future health challenges. Indicators 
      putatively forecasting resilience have been developed under two paradigms with 
      different perspectives: Critical Slowing Down and Loss of Complexity. This study 
      explored whether these indicators validly reflect the construct of resilience in 
      geriatric inpatients. Geriatric patients (n = 121, 60% female) had their heart 
      rate and physical activity continuously monitored using a chest-worn sensor. 
      Indicators from both paradigms were extracted from both physiological signals. 
      Measures of health functioning, concomitant with low resilience, were obtained by 
      questionnaire at admission. The relationships among indicators and their 
      associations with health functioning were assessed by correlation and linear 
      regression analyses, respectively. Greater complexity and higher variance in 
      physical activity were associated with lower frailty (β = -0.28, p = .004 and 
      β = -0.37, p < .001, respectively) and better ADL function (β = 0.23, p = .022 
      and β = 0.38, p < .001). The associations of physical activity variance with 
      health functioning were not in the expected direction based on Critical Slowing 
      Down. In retrospect, these observations stress the importance of matching the

TI  - Optimal Staffing Models To Care For Frail Older Adults In Primary Care And 
      Geriatrics Practices In The US.
PG  - 1368-1376
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00401 [doi]
AB  - Different staffing configurations in primary and geriatric care practices could 
      have implications for how best to deliver services that are essential for a 
      growing population of older adults. Using data from a 2018 survey of physicians 
      (MDs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) working in primary and geriatric care, we 
      assessed whether different configurations were associated with better or worse 
      performance on a number of standard process measures indicative of comprehensive, 
      high-quality primary care. Practices with a large concentration of MDs had the 
      highest estimated labor costs. Practices high in NPs and physician assistants 
      (PAs) were most common in states that grant full scope of practice to NPs. The 
      high-NP/PA configuration was associated with a 17-percentage-point greater 
      probability of facilitating patient visits and a 26-percentage-point greater 
      probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services compared with 
      the high-MD model. Team-based configurations had a 27.7-percentage-point greater 
      probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services. The complex 
      needs of older adults may be best served by team-based practices with a broad 
      provider mix that can provide a range of services in the office and the 
      community.

TI  - Deciding about the use of a Personal Safety Alerting Device-The need for a 
      legitimation process: A qualitative study.
PG  - 331-342
LID - 10.1111/jan.14566 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore reasons, thoughts, motives, and influencing factors regarding 
      the use or non-use of Personal Safety Alerting Devices (PSADs) in the daily lives 
      of community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study 
      design was used. METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 
      older persons between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the 
      Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. RESULTS: The participants described the use 
      or non-use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a "legitimation process". This 
      process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then 
      determine the right moment at which to start using it. During this process, each 
      person weighs her or his "ageing self" and "perception of technology" then 
      decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use. "Critical events" 
      initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and 
      their possible need for assistance. CONCLUSION: The legitimation process suggests 
      that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life. Using a PSAD 
      is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex decision-making process 
      establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual 
      ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the device. IMPACT: Older 
      persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the 
      legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this process, such 
      that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and 
      feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their 
      independence.

TI  - A Multivariable Prediction Model to Select Colorectal Surgical Patients for 
      Co-Management.
PG  - 118-127
LID - 10.20344/amp.12996 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased life expectancy leads to older and frailer surgical 
      patients. Co-management between medical and surgical specialities has proven 
      favourable in complex situations. Selection of patients for co-management is full 
      of difficulties. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical decision support 
      tool to select surgical patients for co-management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Clinical data was collected from patient electronic health records with an ICD-9 
      code for colorectal surgery from January 2012 to December 2015 at a hospital in 
      Lisbon. The outcome variable consists in co-management signalling. A dataset from 
      344 patients was used to develop the prediction model and a second data set from 
      168 patients was used for external validation. RESULTS: Using logistic regression 
      modelling the authors built a five variable (age, burden of comorbidities, ASA-PS 
      status, surgical risk and recovery time) predictive referral model for 
      co-management. This model has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81 
      - 0.90), a predictive Brier score of 0.11, a sensitivity of 0.80, a specificity 
      of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.3%. DISCUSSION: Early referral of high-risk 
      patients may be valuable to guide the decision on the best level of 
      post-operative clinical care. We developed a simple bedside decision tool with a 
      good discriminatory and predictive performance in order to select patients for 
      comanagement. CONCLUSION: A simple bed-side clinical decision support tool of 
      patients for co-management is viable, leading to potential improvement in early 
      recognition and management of postoperative complications and reducing the 
      'failure to rescue'. Generalizability to other clinical settings requires 
      adequate customization and validation.

TI  - Goal planning in person-centred care supports older adults receiving case 
      management to attain their health-related goals.
PG  - 1682-1691
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2019.1672813 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Care for older adults should preferably be provided in a person-centred 
      way that includes goal planning. The aim of the present cohort study is to gain 
      an insight into the results of goal planning, in a person-centred care setting 
      for community-living older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within Embrace, a 
      person-centred and integrated care service, older adults set goals with the aim 
      to improve health-related problems. For every goal, they rated severity scores 
      ranging from 0 (no problem) to 10 (extremely severe): a baseline score, a target 
      score and, within one year, an end score to evaluate these goals. The differences 
      between baseline and end scores (goal progress) and target and end scores (goal 
      attainment), and the percentage of goals attained were calculated and compared 
      between health-related domains (i.e., mental health, physical health, mobility, 
      and support). RESULTS: Among 233 older adults, 836 goal plans were formulated of 
      which 74% (95% Confidence Interval: 71-77) were attained. Goals related to 
      physical health were the most likely to be attained and goals for mobility and 
      pain the least likely. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are able to attain 
      health-related goals through collaborative goal planning. We recommend future 
      integrated care programmes for older adults to incorporate goal-planning methods 
      to achieve person-centred care.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONOlder adults 
      experiencing frailty or complex care needs and receiving individual support 
      within an integrated care setting are able to formulate and attain goals using 
      goal planning with severity scores.Goal plans of community-living older adults 
      mostly aim at improving health-related problems concerning physical health, 
      mobility, or support.Goals related to physical health are the most likely to be 
      attained, while goals for mobility and pain are the least likely to be attained.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection disproportionally affects frail, elderly patients and those with 
      multiple chronic comorbidities. Whether patients on RRT have an additional risk 
      because of their specific exposure and complex immune dysregulation is 
      controversial. METHODS: To describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, region-wide 
      registry study in adult patients on RRT versus the general population from March 
      2 to May 25, 2020. This study comprised all patients undergoing RRT in the 
      Flanders region of Belgium, a country that has been severely affected by 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: At the end of the epidemic wave, 
      crude and age-standardized cumulative incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      were 5.3% versus 2.5%, respectively, among 4297 patients on hemodialysis, and 
      1.4% versus 1.6%, respectively, among 3293 patients with kidney transplants 
      (compared with 0.6% in the general population). Crude and age-standardized 
      cumulative mortality rates were 29.6% versus 19.9%, respectively, among patients 
      on hemodialysis, and 14.0% versus 23.0%, respectively, among patients with 
      transplants (compared with 15.3% in the general population). We found no excess 
      mortality in the hemodialysis population when compared with mean mortality rates 
      during the same 12-week period in 2015-2019 because COVID-19 mortality was 
      balanced by lower than expected mortality among uninfected patients. Only 0.18% 
      of the kidney transplant population died of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is high in patients on RRT. 
      Nevertheless, the epidemic's overall effect on the RRT population remained 
      remarkably limited in Flanders. Calculation of excess mortality and age 
      standardization provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden of 
      COVID-19 among patients on RRT.

TI  - Describing people with cognitive impairment and their complex treatment needs 
      during routine care in the hospital - cross-sectional results of the intersec-CM 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is an important determinant in health care. In 
      the acute hospital setting cognition has a strong impact on treatment and care. 
      Cognitive impairment can negatively affect diagnostics and treatment success. 
      However, little is known about the individual situation and specific risks of 
      people with cognitive impairments during hospital stays. The aim of the present 
      research is to describe and analyze the treatment needs of people with cognitive 
      impairments in acute hospital care. METHODS: The analyses use baseline data of 
      the ongoing multisite, longitudinal, randomized controlled intervention trial 
      intersec-CM (Supporting elderly people with cognitive impairment during and after 
      hospital stays with Intersectoral Care Management), which recruited 402 
      participants at baseline. We assessed sociodemographic aspects, cognitive status, 
      functional status, frailty, comorbidities, level of impairment, formal diagnosis 
      of dementia, geriatric diagnoses, delirium, depression, pharmacological 
      treatment, utilization of health care services and health care related needs. 
      RESULTS: The sample under examination had been on average mildly cognitively 
      impaired (MMSE M = 22.3) and had a mild to moderate functional impairment 
      (Barthel Index M = 50.4; HABAM M = 19.1). The Edmonton Frail Scale showed a mean 
      of 7.4 and half of the patients (52.3%) had been assigned a care level. About 
      46.9% had a geriatric diagnosis, 3.0% had a diagnosis of dementia. According to 
      DSM-V 19.2% of the patients had at least one main symptom of depression. The mean 
      number of regularly taken drugs per patient was 8.2. Utilization of health care 
      services prior to the hospital stay was rather low. On average, the sample showed 
      4.38 care related needs in general, of which 0.60 needs were unaddressed at the 
      time of assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Descriptive analyses highlight an in-depth 
      insight into impairments and different care needs of people with cognitive 
      impairments. The results emphasize the need for gender-specific analyses as well 
      as an increased attention to the heterogeneity of needs of people with cognitive 
      impairments related to specific wards, settings and regions where they are 
      admitted. Our results indicate also that people with cognitive impairments 
      represent a high proportion of older patients in acute hospital care. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: The intersec-CM trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( 
      NCT03359408 ).

AB  - Frailty in old age has become synonymous with medication use. As people age, the 
      risk of disease burden increases. Older age is often linked with complex 
      healthcare needs, with a rise in the number of comorbidities. This often results 
      in the need to use multiple medications. Frailty is a global concern and requires 
      early interventions to help people maintain their health as they age. Advanced 
      clinical practitioners have an important role in supporting frail people living 
      in the community. This article will review the literature and explore strategies 
      that advanced practitioners can implement to optimise wellbeing and reduce 
      medicines-related harm for this vulnerable population.

TI  - Clinicians' Perceptions of the Appropriateness of Neurocritical Care for Patients 
      with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): A Qualitative Study.
PG  - 162-171
LID - 10.1007/s12028-020-01145-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinicians working in intensive care frequently report 
      perceptions of inappropriate care (PIC) situations. Intracerebral haemorrhage 
      (ICH) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Prognosticating 
      after ICH is complex and may be influenced by clinicians' subjective impressions 
      and biases, which may, in turn, influence decision making regarding the level of 
      care provided. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore perceptions of 
      neurocritical care in relation to the expected functional outcome for ICH 
      patients. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 
      neurocritical care doctors and nurses. SETTING: Neurocritical care (NCC) 
      department in a UK neuroscience tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS: Eleven 
      neurocritical care nurses, five consultant neurointensivists, two stroke 
      physicians, three neurosurgeons. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews and identified five key 
      themes: (1) prognostic uncertainty (2) subjectivity of good versus poor outcome 
      (3) perceived inappropriate care (PIC) situations (including for frail elderly 
      patients) (4) challenging nature of decision-making (5) clinician distress. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Caring for severely affected ICH patients in need of neurocritical 
      care is challenging, particularly with frail elderly patients. Awareness of the 
      challenges could facilitate interventions to improve decision-making for this 
      group of stroke patients and their families, as well as measures to reduce the 
      distress on clinicians who care for this patient group. Our findings highlight 
      the need for effective interdisciplinary shared decision making involving the 
      family, taking into account patients' previously expressed values and preferences 
      and incorporating these into bespoke care planning.

TI  - Depressive symptoms and malnutrition are associated with other geriatric 
      syndromes and increase risk for 30-Day readmission in hospitalized older adults: 
      a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 634
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03343-6 [doi]
LID - 634
AB  - BACKGROUND: Readmission in older adults is typically complex with multiple 
      contributing factors. We aim to examine how two prevalent and potentially 
      modifiable geriatric conditions - depressive symptoms and malnutrition - relate 
      to other geriatric syndromes and 30-day readmission in hospitalized older adults. 
      METHODS: Consecutive admissions of patients ≥ 65 years to a general medical 
      department were recruited over 16 months. Patients were screened for depression, 
      malnutrition, delirium, cognitive impairment, and frailty at admission. Medical 
      records were reviewed for poor oral intake and functional decline during 
      hospitalization. Unplanned readmission within 30-days of discharge was tracked 
      through the hospital's electronic health records and follow-up telephone 
      interviews. We use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict the relationship of 
      depressive symptoms and malnutrition with geriatric syndromes that constitute 
      covariates of interest and 30-day readmission outcome. Multiple logistic 
      regression was performed for the independent associations of depressive symptoms 
      and malnutrition with 30-day readmission, adjusting for variables based on 
      DAG-identified minimal adjustment set. RESULTS: We recruited 1619 consecutive 
      admissions, with mean age 76.4 (7.9) years and 51.3% females. 30-day readmission 
      occurred in 331 (22.0%) of 1,507 patients with follow-up data. Depressive 
      symptoms, malnutrition, higher comorbidity burden, hospitalization in the 
      one-year preceding index admission, frailty, delirium, as well as functional 
      decline and poor oral intake during the index admission, were more commonly 
      observed among patients who were readmitted within 30 days of discharge 
      (P < 0.05). Patients with active depressive symptoms were significantly more 
      likely to be frail (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.22-2.16), had poor oral intake 
      (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.02-1.79) and functional decline during admission (OR = 1.58, 
      95% CI 1.11-2.23). Malnutrition at admission was significantly associated with 
      frailty (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.19), delirium (OR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.60-3.39) 
      cognitive impairment (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.39-2.54) and poor oral intake during 
      hospitalization (OR = 2.70, 95% CI 2.01-3.64). In minimal adjustment set 
      identified by DAG, depressive symptoms (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.86) remained 
      significantly associated with 30-day readmission. The association of malnutrition 
      with 30-day readmission was no longer statistically significant after adjusting 
      for age, ethnicity and depressive symptoms in the minimal adjustment set 
      (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.99-1.98). CONCLUSION: The observed causal associations 
      support screening and targeted interventions for depressive symptoms and 
      malnutrition during admission and in the post-acute period.

TI  - Social care costs for community-dwelling older people living with frailty.
PG  - e804-e811
LID - 10.1111/hsc.13450 [doi]
AB  - International evidence indicates that older people with frailty are more likely 
      to access social care services, compared to nonfrail older people. There is, 
      however, no robust evidence on costs of social care provided for 
      community-dwelling older people living with frailty in their own homes. The main 
      objective of this study was to examine the relationship between 
      community-dwelling older people living with frailty, defined using the cumulative 
      deficit model, and annual formal social care costs for the 2012-2018 period. A 
      secondary objective was to estimate formal social care spending for every 1% 
      reduction in the number of older people who develop frailty over 1 year. 
      Secondary analysis of prospective cohort data from two large nationally 
      representative community-based cohort studies in England was performed. 
      Respondents aged ≥75 were used in the main analysis and respondents aged 65-74 in 
      sensitivity testing. We used regression tree modelling for formal social care 
      cost analysis including frailty, age, gender, age at completing education and 
      living with partner as key covariates. We employed a minimum node size stopping 
      criteria to limit tree complexity and overfitting and applied 'bootstrap 
      aggregating' to improve robustness. We assessed the impact of an intervention for 
      every 1% decrease in the number of individuals who become frail over 1 year in 
      England. Results show that frailty is the strongest predictor of formal social 
      care costs. Mean social care costs for people who are not frail are £321, 
      compared with £2,895 for individuals with frailty. For every 1% of nonfrail 
      people not transitioning to frailty savings of £4.4 million in annual 
      expenditures on formal social care in England are expected, not including 
      expenditure on care homes. Given considerably higher costs for individuals 
      classed as frail compared to nonfrail, a successful intervention avoiding or 
      postponing the onset of frailty has the potential to considerably reduce social 
      care costs.

TI  - New horizons in cardiogeriatrics: geriatricians and heart failure care-the 
      custard in the tart, not the icing on the cake.
PG  - 1064-1068
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afab057 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure (HF) can be considered a disease of older people. It is a leading 
      cause of hospitalisation and is associated with high rates of morbidity and 
      mortality in the over-65s. In 2012, an editorial in this journal detailed the 
      latest HF research and guidelines, calling for greater integration of 
      geriatricians in HF care. This current article reflects upon what has been 
      achieved in this field in recent years, highlighting some future challenges and 
      promising areas. It is written from the perspective of one such integrated team 
      and explores the new role of cardiogeriatrician, working in a multidisciplinary 
      team to deliver and improve care to increasingly complex, older, frail patients 
      with multiple comorbidities who present with primary cardiology problems, 
      especially decompensated HF. Geriatric liaison has improved the care of frail 
      patients in orthopaedics, cancer services, stroke, acute medicine and numerous 
      community settings. We propose that this vital role should now be extended to 
      cardiology teams in general and to HF in particular.

TI  - Encouraging older adults with pre-frailty and frailty to "MoveStrong": an 
      analysis of secondary outcomes for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 238-251
LID - 10.24095/hpcdp.42.6.02 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This 8-week pilot stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial evaluated 
      the MoveStrong program for teaching adults who have frailty/pre-frailty about 
      balance and functional strength training and sufficient protein intake to prevent 
      falls and improve mobility. METHODS: We recruited individuals aged 60 years and 
      over, with a FRAIL scale score of 1 or higher and at least one chronic condition, 
      who were not currently strength training. The program included 16 exercise 
      physiologist-led hour-long group sessions and two dietitian-led hour-long 
      nutrition sessions. We analyzed secondary outcomes-weight, gait speed, grip 
      strength, physical capacity (fatigue levels), sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic 
      balance, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical activity levels and 
      protein intake-using a paired t test and a generalized estimating equation (GEE). 
      RESULTS: Of 44 participants (mean [SD] age 79 [9.82] years), 35 were pre-frail 
      and 9 were frail. At follow-up, participants had significantly improved grip 
      strength (1.63 kg, 95% CI: 0.62 to 2.63); sit-to-stand functioning (2 
      sit-to-stands, 95% CI: 1 to 3); and dynamic balance (1.68 s, 95% CI: 0.47 to 
      2.89). There were no significant improvements in gait speed, HRQoL index scores, 
      self-rated health, physical activity levels (aerobic activity and strength 
      training) or protein intake. GEE analysis revealed an interaction between 
      exposure to MoveStrong and gait speed, sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance 
      and HRQoL index scores. The total cost to administer the program and purchase 
      equipment was CAD 14 700, equivalent to CAD 377 per participant. CONCLUSION: 
      Exploratory analyses suggest MoveStrong exercises may improve gait speed, 
      sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance and HRQoL index scores in older 
      individuals who are frail and pre-frail.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Frailty is a relatively new concept for intensivists, and is defined 
      as a status of increased vulnerability to stressors associated with reduced 
      reserve and function of different physiological systems. Supporting the 
      hypothesis that frailty may be an important predictor of poor prognosis among 
      older patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), this study seeks to 
      evaluate the association between frailty at ICU admission and short and long-term 
      mortality. DESIGN: An unmatched case-control study was carried out. SETTING: 
      Intensive Care Unit. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Patients≥80 years of age admitted 
      to the ICU for medical reasons. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: 
      The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, while secondary outcomes were ICU 
      mortality and mortality at one year. RESULTS: Most of the patients were 
      classified as frail at ICU admission (55.3%). The prevalence of frailty was 
      higher among those who died than in those who were alive within 30 days from ICU 
      admission (62.3% vs 48.3%, p=0.01). One-year mortality was higher in frail 
      (84.4%) than in non-frail patients (65.2%, p<0.001). In the logistic regression 
      analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders such as chronic diseases, 
      clinical complexity, cause of ICU admission and use of advanced procedures, 
      frailty was seen to be significantly associated to one-year mortality, but not 
      with ICU mortality or 30-day mortality. DISCUSSION: The admission of geriatric 
      patients to the ICU is increasing. Frailty assessment may play an important role 
      in the clinical evaluation of such individuals for triage, but should not be 
      considered a priori as an exclusion criterion for admission.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frailty, a multifaceted geriatric condition, is an emerging global 
      health problem. Integrated care models designed to meet the complex needs of the 
      older people with frailty are required. Early identification of innovative models 
      may inform policymakers and other stakeholders of service delivery alternatives 
      they can introduce and locally adapt so as to tackle system fragmentation and 
      lack of coordination. This study used horizon scanning methodologies to 
      systematically search for, prioritise and assess new integrated care models for 
      older people with frailty and investigated experts' views on barriers and 
      facilitators to the adoption of horizon scanning in health services research. 
      METHODS: A four-step horizon scanning review was performed. Frailty-specific 
      integrated care models and interventions were identified through a review of 
      published literature supplemented with grey literature searches. Results were 
      filtered and prioritised according to preset criteria. An expert panel focus 
      group session assessed the prioritised models and interventions on 
      innovativeness, impact and potential for implementation. The experts further 
      evaluated horizon scanning for its perceived fruitfulness in aiding 
      decision-making. RESULTS: Nine integrated care models and interventions at system 
      level (n=5) and community level (n=4) were summarised and assessed by the expert 
      panel (n=7). Test scores were highest for the Walcheren integrated care model 
      (system-based model) and EuFrailSafe (community-based intervention). The 
      participants stated that horizon scanning as a decision-making tool could aid in 
      assessing knowledge gaps, criticising the status quo and developing new insights. 
      Barriers to adoption of horizon scanning on individual, organisational and wider 
      institutional level were also identified. CONCLUSION: Study findings demonstrated 
      that horizon scanning is a potentially valuable tool in the search for innovative 
      service delivery models. Further studies should evaluate how horizon scanning can 
      be institutionalised and effectively used for serving this purpose.

TI  - Impact of childhood trauma on multidimensional frailty in older patients with a 
      unipolar depressive-, anxiety- or somatic symptom disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frailty marks an increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Since 
      childhood trauma is associated with the onset of physical and mental health 
      diseases during the lifespan, we examined the link between childhood trauma and 
      multidimensional frailty. METHOD: A cross-sectional study embedded in a clinical 
      cohort study (ROM-GPS) of older (≥60 years) patients (n=182) with a unipolar 
      depressive-, anxiety- and/or somatic symptom disorder according to DSM-criteria 
      referred to specialized geriatric mental health care. Frailty was assessed with 
      the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), comprising a physical, psychological, and 
      social dimension. Physical, sexual and psychological abuse and emotional neglect 
      before the age of 16 years was measured with a structured interview. RESULTS: Of 
      182 patients, 103 (56.6%) had experienced any childhood trauma and 154 (84.6%) 
      were frail (TFI sum score ≥5). Linear regression analyses, adjusted for 
      lifestyle, psychological and physical-health factors, showed that the presence of 
      any type of childhood trauma was not associated with the TFI sum score, however 
      when considered separately, physical abuse was (ß=0.16, p=.037). Regarding the 
      specific frailty dimensions, any childhood trauma was associated with social 
      frailty (ß=0.18, p=.019), with emotional neglect as main contributor. CONCLUSION: 
      These findings demonstrate a complex link between different types of childhood 
      trauma and multidimensional frailty among older psychiatric patients. Regarding 
      the three dimensions of frailty, social frailty seems most affected by childhood 
      trauma. This may have been underestimated until now and should receive more 
      attention in clinical care and future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex 
      intervention, was conducted to examine its effectiveness as a 
      technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for frail older 
      persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where formal long-term care 
      has recently been introduced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
      implementation fidelity of the SPEC intervention and to identify moderating 
      factors that influence the implementation fidelity. METHODS: This study was a 
      process evaluation based on an evidence-based framework for implementation 
      fidelity using a mixed-methods design. Quantitative data from consultant 
      logbooks, NH documentations, an information and communications technology (ICT) 
      system, and a standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to 
      December 2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics. 
      Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary teams 
      from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a semi-structured questionnaire 
      and the focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The 
      SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and adherence to the SPEC 
      program was strong in all aspects, such as content, coverage, frequency, and 
      duration. Of the participating on-site coordinators, 60% reported that the SPEC 
      model positively impacted needs assessment and the reporting system for resident 
      care. The important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies, 
      assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies. CONCLUSION: The 
      effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good implementation fidelity. The 
      key factors of good implementation fidelity were tailored delivery of 
      evidence-based interventions over process evaluation work, facilitating 
      strategies, and ICT support. Larger implementation studies with a more 
      user-friendly ICT system are recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry,

TI  - Changes in home care clients' characteristics and home care in five European 
      countries from 2001 to 2014: comparison based on InterRAI - Home Care data.
PG  - 1177

AB  - BACKGROUND: Policymakers advocate extended residence in private homes as people 
      age, rather than relocation to long-term care facilities. Consequently, it is 
      expected that older people living in their own homes will be frailer and have 
      more complex health problems over time. Therefore, community care for aging 
      people is becoming increasingly important to facilitate prevention of decline in 
      physical and cognitive abilities and unnecessary hospital admission and transfer 
      to a nursing home. The aim of this study was to examine changes in the 
      characteristic of home care clients and home care provided in five European 
      countries between 2001 and 2014 and to explore whether home care clients who are 
      most in need of care receive the care required. METHODS: This descriptive study 
      used data from two European research projects, Aged in Home Care (AdHOC; 
      2001-2002) and Identifying best practices for care-dependent elderly by 
      Benchmarking Costs and outcomes of Community Care (IBenC; 2014-2016). In both 
      projects, the InterRAI-Home Care assessment tool was used to assess a random 
      sample of home care clients 65 years and older in five European countries. These 
      data facilitate a comparison of physical and cognitive health and the provided 
      home care between countries and study periods. RESULTS: In most participating 
      countries, both cognitive (measured on the Cognitive Performance Scale) and 
      functional ability (measured on the Activities of Daily Living Hierarchy scale) 
      of home care clients deteriorated over a 10-year period. Home care provided 
      increased between the studies. Home care clients who scored high on the physical 
      and cognitive scales also received home care for a significantly higher duration 
      than those who scored low. CONCLUSION: Older people in several European countries 
      remain living in their own homes despite deteriorating physical and cognitive 
      skills. Home care services to this group have increased. This indicates that the 
      government policy of long-term residence at own home among older people, even in 
      increased frailty, has been realised.

TI  - Tissue remodelling and increased DNA damage in patients with incompetent valves 
      in chronic venous insufficiency.
PG  - 7878-7889
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.16711 [doi]
AB  - Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), in which blood return to the heart is 
      impaired, is a prevalent condition worldwide. Valve incompetence is a 
      complication of CVI that results in blood reflux, thereby aggravating venous 
      hypertension. While CVI has a complex course and is known to produce alterations 
      in the vein wall, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unclear. This 
      study examined the presence of DNA damage, pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
      extracellular matrix remodelling in CVI-related valve incompetence. One hundred 
      and ten patients with CVI were reviewed and divided into four groups according to 
      age (<50 and ≥50 years) and a clinical diagnosis of venous reflux indicating 
      venous system valve incompetence (R) (n = 81) or no reflux (NR) (n = 29). In vein 
      specimens (greater saphenous vein) from each group, PARP, IL-17, COL-I, COL-III, 
      MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR and 
      immunohistochemistry. The younger patients with valve incompetence showed 
      significantly higher PARP, IL-17, COL-I, COL-III, MMP-2 and reduced TIMP-2 
      expression levels and a higher COL-I/III ratio. Young CVI patients with venous 
      reflux suffer chronic DNA damage, with consequences at both the local tissue and 
      systemic levels, possibly associated with ageing.

TI  - Kidney transplantation or dialysis in older adults-an interview study on the 
      decision-making process.
LID - afac111 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afac111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In older patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the choice 
      between kidney transplantation (KT) and dialysis may be more complex than in 
      younger patients because of a higher prevalence of comorbidities and frailty. 
      This study aims to provide greater insight into the current decision-making 
      process by exploring the expectations, experiences and health outcome priorities 
      of all stakeholders. METHODS: We performed semi-structured interviews with 
      patients ≥65 years with ESKD (eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73m2, KT recipient or treated 
      with dialysis), patients' relatives and healthcare professionals (nephrologists, 
      nurses and medical social workers). Interviews were conducted until data 
      saturation and thematically analysed. RESULTS: We performed 36 interviews 
      (patients n = 18, relatives n = 5, healthcare professionals n = 13). Thematic 
      analysis revealed five themes. Older patients' health outcome priorities were 
      mostly related to quality of life (QOL). Individual older patients showed marked 
      differences in the preferred level of engagement during the decision-making 
      process (varying from 'wants to be in the lead' to 'follows the nephrologist') 
      and in informational needs (varying from evidence-based to experience-based). On 
      the contrary, healthcare professionals were quite unanimous on all aspects. They 
      focused on determining eligibility for KT as start of the decision-making 
      process, on clear and extensive information provision and on classical, medical 
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The decision-making process could benefit from early 
      identification of older patients' values, needs and health outcome priorities, in 
      parallel with assessment of KT eligibility and before discussing the treatment 
      options, and the explicit use of this information in further steps of the 
      decision-making process.

TI  - Age, Not Sex, Modifies the Effect of Frailty on Long-term Outcomes After Cardiac 
      Surgery.

LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000004060 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of frailty in surgical patients and 
      determine whether age and sex modify the relationship between frailty and 
      long-term mortality. BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex and prevalent clinical 
      syndrome. The cardiac surgery literature consists mostly of small, single-center 
      studies, and the epidemiology of frailty remains to be fully elucidated in a 
      real-world surgical population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 
      patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and/or aortic, mitral or 
      tricuspid valve surgery in Ontario, Canada, between 2008 and 2016. The primary 
      outcome was all-cause mortality. Survival probabilities were calculated using the 
      Kaplan-Meier method, and the association of covariates with the hazard of death 
      was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Frailty was 
      assessed using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining 
      diagnoses indicator. RESULTS: Of 72,824 patients, 11,685 (16%) were frail. At 
      median 5 ± 2 years of follow-up, 2921 (25.0%) frail patients and 8637 (14.1%) 
      non-frail patients had died [adjusted hazard ratio 1.60; 95% confidence interval 
      (CI), 1.53-1.68]. The adjusted hazard ratio was highest in patients who underwent 
      isolated mitral (2.18; 95% CI, 1.71-2.77) and mitral + aortic valve surgery 
      (1.85; 95% CI, 1.33-2.58) and lowest after coronary artery bypass grafting + 
      mitral valve surgery (1.38; 95% CI, 1.11-1.70). Age, but not sex, modified the 
      effect of frailty on mortality; such that the rate of death decreased linearly 
      with increasing patient age. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high prevalence of 
      frailty in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and a statistically significant 
      association between frailty and long-term mortality after cardiac procedures. 
      Importantly, the rate of death was inversely proportional to age, such that 
      frailty had a stronger adverse impact on younger patients. Our findings highlight 
      the need to incorporate frailty into the preoperative risk stratification and 
      investigate strategies to support younger patients who are frail.

PG  - 244

LID - 244
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is accompanied by limitations of activities of daily living 
      (ADL) and frequently associated with reduced quality of life, 
      institutionalization, and higher health care costs. Despite the importance of ADL 
      performance for the consequence of frailty, movement analyses based on kinematic 
      markers during the performance of complex upper extremity-based manual ADL tasks 
      in frail elderly is still pending. The main objective of this study was to 
      evaluate if ADL task performance of two different tasks in frail elderlies can be 
      assessed by an activity measurement based on an acceleration sensor integrated 
      into a smartwatch, and further to what degree kinematic parameters would be task 
      independent. METHODS: ADL data was obtained from twenty-seven elderly 
      participants (mean age 81.6 ± 7.0 years) who performed two ADL tasks. 
      Acceleration data of the dominant hand was collected using a smartwatch. 
      Participants were split up in three groups, F (frail, n = 6), P (pre-frail, 
      n = 13) and R (robust, n = 8) according to a frailty screening. A variety of 
      kinematic measures were calculated from the vector product reflecting activity, 
      agility, smoothness, energy, and intensity. RESULTS: Measures of agility, 
      smoothness, and intensity revealed significant differences between the groups 
      (effect sizes combined over tasks η(2)(p) = 0.18 - 0.26). Smoothness was 
      particularly affected by frailty in the tea making task, while activity, agility, 
      a different smoothness parameter and two intensity measures were related to 
      frailty in the gardening task. Four of nine parameters revealed good reliability 
      over both tasks (r = 0.44 - 0.69). Multiple linear regression for the data 
      combined across tasks showed that only the variability of the magnitude of 
      acceleration peaks (agility) contributed to the prediction of the frailty score 
      (R(2) = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that ADL task performance can 
      be assessed by smartwatch-based measures and further shows task-independent 
      differences between the three levels of frailty. From the pattern of impaired and 
      preserved performance parameters across the tested tasks, we concluded that in 
      persons with frailty ADL performance was more impaired by physiological 
      deficiencies, i.e., physical power and endurance, than by cognitive functioning 
      or sensorimotor control.

TI  - External Prospective Validation of the Modified CriSTAL Score for 30- and 90-day 
      Mortality in Geriatric Urgent Surgical Patients.
PG  - 2083-2090
LID - 10.1007/s11605-020-04822-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the predictive accuracy of the modified 
      clinical prognostic tool Criteria for Screening and Triaging to Appropriate 
      aLternative care (CriSTAL) to predict 30-day and 90-day mortality in older 
      patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery. BACKGROUND: Anticipating the 
      mid-term mortality of older patients undergoing urgent surgery is complex and 
      flawed with uncertainty. METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive ≥ 65 years 
      old presenting at the emergency department who subsequently underwent urgent 
      abdominal surgery. The modified CriSTAL score was calculated in the sample using 
      the FRAIL scale instead of the Clinical Frailty Scale. Discrimination (area under 
      the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC)) and model calibration were used to 
      test the predictive accuracy of the modified CriSTAL score for death within 
      30-day mortality as the primary outcome. RESULTS: A total of 500 patients (median 
      age 78 years) were enrolled. The observed 30-day and 90-day mortality rate were 
      11.6% and 13.6%. The modified CriSTAL tool AUROC curve to predict 30-day and 
      90-day mortality was 0.78 and 0.77. The model was well calibrated according to 
      the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p: 0.302) and the calibration plots to predict 30-day 
      and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The modified CriSTAL tool (with FRAIL scale as 
      frailty instrument) had good discriminant power and was well calibrated to 
      predict 30-day and 90-day mortality in elderly patients undergoing urgent 
      abdominal surgery. The modified CriSTAL tool is an easy preoperative tool that 
      could assist in the prognosis of postoperative outcomes and decision-making 
      discussions with patients before for urgent abdominal surgery.

TI  - Factors related to complex care needs of older adults in community-based 
      integrated care centers in Japan: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - e12440
LID - 10.1111/jjns.12440 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to identify the factors related to complex care needs of 
      older adults in community-based integrated care centers. METHODS: We sent 936 
      self-reported questionnaires to community-based integrated care center directors 
      in the Kinki region of Japan. These questionnaires included questions not only 
      about the directors' demographic data, but also regarding the sociodemographic, 
      psychosocial, and family-related dimensions of the older adults in the community 
      centers. The directors divided their cases into two categories: "Complex cases" 
      and "Straightforward cases." We compared the intergroup differences and examined 
      the factors related to complex care needs in older adults. RESULTS: A total of 
      232 directors responded. Complex cases were significantly associated with younger 
      age, poor health conditions, and having a family member who needs care, as 
      compared to straightforward cases where these associations were not present. 
      Logistic regression showed that in older adults, factors of refusing support or 
      social services, social isolation, and trouble with neighbors were associated 
      with their complexities. Additionally, family members with a high likelihood of 
      refusing social services, older adults without a key family member, and 
      difficulties in forming their consensus regarding care were associated with older 
      adults' complexities. CONCLUSION: Older adults with complex care needs could have 
      the risk of self-neglect, and their families faced difficulties in supporting 
      them as family members. Healthcare professions should carefully assess these 
      factors and develop needs-oriented services for them without their family support 
      as an upstream intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults with multiple complex care needs tend to receive 
      fragmented care that may jeopardize their quality of life (QoL) and health 
      outcomes. This study evaluated the determinants of improved QoL among integrated 
      outpatient service recipients with multimorbidity. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study of integrated geriatric outpatient services (IGOS) at 
      a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. Data from 2018 to 2019 were retrieved. All 
      patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment, which included demographic 
      information, serial functional assessments, and assessment for QoL. QoL was 
      reassessed through a telephone survey 6 months after the patients' first visit to 
      IGOS. Factors associated with the interval changes in QoL were identified using 
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Data from 995 patients receiving IGOS 
      (mean age: 82.21 ± 7.96 years, 54.5% males) were analyzed. An overall mean 
      improvement in QoL was noted (EQ-5D index: +0.055±0.26, p <0.001) while 747 
      recipients reported maintained or improved QoL. The results of the multivariate 
      logistic regression showed that poorer nutritional status (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 
      1.07-2.28), depressive symptoms (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.38-2.86), and frailty 
      (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.10-2.52) were independent risk factors for poorer QoL after 
      adjustment for baseline QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated outpatient services improved 
      the quality of life of older adults with multimorbidity. Those with poorer 
      nutritional status, depressive symptoms and frailty were less likely to show 
      improvement in their QoL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) care of older patients is often complex. 
      Geriatric ED guidelines can help to meet this challenge. However, training 
      requirements, the use of time-consuming tools for comprehensive geriatric 
      assessment (CGA), a lack of golden standard to identify the frail patients, and 
      the weak evidence of positive outcomes of using CGA in EDs pose barriers to 
      introduce the guidelines. Dedicating an interprofessional team of regular ED 
      medical and nursing staff and an older-friendly ED area can be another approach. 
      Previous studies of geriatrician-led CGA in EDs have reported a reduced hospital 
      admission rate. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a dedicated 
      interprofessional emergency team also can reduce the hospital admission rate 
      without the resources required by the formal use of CGA. METHODS: An 
      observational pre-post study at a large adult ED, where all patients 80 years or 
      older arriving on weekdays in the intervention period from 2016.09.26 to 
      2016.11.28 and the corresponding weekdays in the previous year from 2015.09.28 to 
      2015.11.30 were included. In the intervention period, older patients either 
      received care in the geriatric module by the dedicated team or in the regular 
      team modules for patients of mixed ages. In 2015, all patients received care in 
      regular team modules. The primary outcome measure was the total hospital 
      admission rate and the ED length of stay was the secondary outcome measure. 
      RESULTS: We included 2377 arrivals in the intervention period, when 26.7% 
      (N = 634) received care in the geriatric module, and 2207 arrivals in the 2015 
      period. The total hospital admission rate was 61.7% (N = 1466/2377) in the 
      intervention period compared to 64.8% (N = 1431/2207) in 2015 (p = 0.03). The 
      difference was larger for patients treated in the geriatric module, 51.1% 
      compared to 62.1% (95% CI: 56.3 to 68.0%) for patients who would have been 
      eligible in 2015. The ED length of stay was longer in the intervention period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An interprofessional team and area dedicated to older patients was 
      associated to a lower hospital admission rate. Further studies are needed to 
      confirm the results.

AB  - AIM: To compare the geriatric dentistry curricula between Advanced Education in 
      General Dentistry (AEGD) and General Practice Residency (GPR) programs. METHODS: 
      A 108-item survey was developed to assess residents' didactic and clinical 
      experiences pertaining to geriatric patients. Surveys were mailed in 2018 to all 
      AEGD (N = 89) and GPR (N = 180) program directors. Statistical analysis consisted 
      of descriptive and bivariate analyses with the chi-square test, Fisher's exact 
      test, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test (alpha = .05). RESULTS: Twenty-four AEGD and 
      fifty-eight GPR directors completed surveys (response rate = 30%). Seventy-one 
      percent of responding programs reported mandatory didactic training pertaining to 
      frail and functionally dependent geriatric adults. Ninety-nine percent of 
      respondents reported that residents provided treatment to geriatric patients; 
      however, they were less likely to perform procedures on frail and functionally 
      dependent patients. Only 15% of respondents provided nursing home care. 
      Considering all patient encounters, responding GPR programs were more likely than 
      AEGD programs to treat patients using IV bisphosphonates (63% vs 25%; P < .01), 
      undergoing chemotherapy (48% vs 16%; P = .02), and undergoing head and neck 
      radiation therapy (55% vs 25%; P = .02). CONCLUSION: A majority of responding 
      AEGD and GPR programs reported providing educational experiences pertaining to 
      geriatric patients; however, GPR programs reported treating more medically 
      complex patients than AEGD programs.

AB  - Feasibility and efficacy of complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 
      the elderly, a more frail population due to more comorbidities is incompletely 
      understood. We therefore set out to compare success and complication rate of PCI 
      for chronic total occlusion (CTO) in octogenarians, in comparison to 
      non-octogenarians. Data from 267 patients (58 patients over 80 years of age and 
      209 under 80 years of age) who had undergone CTO PCI were analyzed. To compare 
      the results we calculated the propensity score and used inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting. We evaluated demographic, clinical, angiographic, and 
      periprocedural information. The median age of the total collective was 68 (31-90) 
      years (octogenarian collective 82 (80-90) years vs non-octogenarians 65 (31-79) 
      years). We observed a high success rate in both collectives (82.8% vs 90.4%, 
      p = 0.10) and no difference in periprocedural complications or complications in 
      the follow-up period. In our collective restenosis rate at follow-up was 
      comparable to the propensity sore weighted population (11.3% vs 16.3%, p = 0.9). 
      Our results show that CTO PCI in older patients is safe and feasible with 
      comparable in-hospital and follow-up complication rates compared to a younger 
      patient population.

AB  - The effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) complex administration and 
      the significance of titin, a biomarker of muscle injury, in elderly minor trauma 
      patients in acute phase has not been established. In this single-center, 
      randomized controlled study, trauma patients aged ≥ 70 years with an injury 
      severity score < 16 were included. Titin values on days 1 and 3 were measured and 
      the intervention group received HMB complex (2.4 g of HMB + 14 g of glutamine + 
      14 g of arginine) and the control group received glutamine complex (7.2 g of 
      protein including 6 g of glutamine). The cross-sectional area of the rectus 
      femoris (RFCSA) on ultrasound, grip strength, and the Barthel Index were assessed 
      on the first day of rehabilitation and after 2 weeks. We analyzed 24 HMB and 25 
      control participants. Titin values on day 3 correlated with grip strength (r = 
      -0.34, p = 0.03) and the Barthel Index (r = -0.39, p = 0.01) at follow-up. HMB 
      complex supplementation had no effect on the RFCSA (2.41 vs. 2.45 cm(2), p = 
      0.887), grip strength (13.3 vs. 13.1 kg, p = 0.946), or the Barthel Index (20.0 
      vs. 50.0, p = 0.404) at follow-up. Titin values might associate with subsequent 
      physical function. Short-term HMB complex supplementation from acute phase did 
      not ameliorate muscle injury.

TI  - Managing the risk of toxicity in the treatment of elderly patients with soft 
      tissue sarcomas.
PG  - 903-913
LID - 10.1080/14740338.2021.1915985 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nearly half of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) occur after the age of 
      65 years. Treating these patients is a complex issue in the absence of specific 
      guidelines. AREAS COVERED: This is a narrative review that summarizes current 
      data on the efficacy and the safety of different treatment strategies in this 
      subpopulation. EXPERT OPINION: Age per se should not be a limiting factor to 
      treatment. Surgery remains the treatment of choice offering the only chance of 
      cure. The potential for benefit from adjuvant therapies must be discussed in the 
      context of expected treatment-related toxicities and impairment of quality of 
      life. Efficacy of systemic treatment in advanced disease did not differ from that 
      in younger patients. However, safety must be considered when selecting 
      treatments. Managing the risk of toxicity requires an assessment of 
      vulnerabilities with validated tools. The Comprehensive geriatric assessment has 
      become increasingly accepted but need to be validated in STS patients. Frailty 
      should not exclude patients from potentially life-saving therapy. The correction 
      of reversible conditions and active supportive care may make the treatment safer. 
      Future studies are warranted to define better the patterns, benefits, risks of 
      existing treatments. New options remain to be identified to reduce toxicity.

TI  - Problems in care and avoidability of death after discharge from intensive care: a 
      multi-centre retrospective case record review study.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s13054-020-03420-5 [doi]
LID - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 138,000 patients are discharged to hospital wards from intensive 
      care units (ICUs) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland annually. More than 8000 
      die before leaving hospital. In hospital-wide populations, 6.7-18% of deaths have 
      some degree of avoidability. For patients discharged from ICU, neither the 
      proportion of avoidable deaths nor the reasons underlying avoidability have been 
      determined. We undertook a retrospective case record review within the REFLECT 
      study, examining how post-ICU ward care might be improved. METHODS: A 
      multi-centre retrospective case record review of 300 consecutive post-ICU 
      in-hospital deaths, between January 2015 and March 2018, in 3 English hospitals. 
      Trained multi-professional researchers assessed the degree to which each death 
      was avoidable and determined care problems using the established Structured 
      Judgement Review method. RESULTS: Agreement between reviewers was good (weighted 
      Kappa 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.88). Discharge from an ICU for end-of-life care 
      occurred in 50/300 patients. Of the remaining 250 patients, death was probably 
      avoidable in 20 (8%, 95% CI 5.0-12.1) and had some degree of avoidability in 65 
      (26%, 95% CI 20.7-31.9). Common problems included out-of-hours discharge from ICU 
      (168/250, 67.2%), suboptimal rehabilitation (167/241, 69.3%), absent nutritional 
      planning (76/185, 41.1%) and incomplete sepsis management (50/150, 33.3%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of deaths in hospital with some degree of 
      avoidability is higher in patients discharged from an ICU than reported in 
      hospital-wide populations. Extrapolating our findings suggests around 550 
      probably avoidable deaths occur annually in hospital following ICU discharge in 
      England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This avoidability occurs in an elderly frail 
      population with complex needs that current strategies struggle to meet. Problems 
      in post-ICU care are rectifiable but multi-disciplinary. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ISRCTN14658054.

TI  - Design Considerations for the Development and Implementation of a Medical Respite 
      for Older Adults Experiencing Homelessness in Metro Vancouver.
PG  - S146-S153
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0000000000001335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older persons with lived or living experience of homelessness (PWLEs) 
      often live with complex physical and/or mental health conditions which are 
      challenged by poor access to health services, especially primary care. To fill 
      the gap in the continuum of care following hospital discharge for PWLEs, medical 
      respite provides health and shelter support for PWLEs who do not have acute care 
      needs that qualify for a stay in a hospital bed, yet are too sick or frail to 
      recover on the streets or in a traditional shelter. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      examines how a medical respite could be designed for older PWLEs in Metro 
      Vancouver, BC. RESEARCH DESIGN: Using a community-based participatory research 
      approach, in-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with PWLE (n=15) 
      and service provider (n=11) participants. RESULTS: Participants offered rich 
      suggestions about (a) the culture of the medical respite, (b) the physical design 
      of a medical respite, (c) individuals who should be involved in medical respite 
      delivery, (d) services a medical respite should provide, and (e) who the medical 
      respite should serve. CONCLUSIONS: When designing a medical respite for older 
      PWLEs, considerations include providing an environment where patients can rest, 
      but also feel safe and be surrounded by persons who they trust and who care for 
      them. Developing a medical respite that adheres to the tenets of trauma-informed 
      and patient-centered care acknowledges the mistrust and traumatization that often 
      accompanies homeless patients presenting to health care.

TI  - Should Percutaneous Coronary Intervention be the Standard Treatment Strategy for 
      Significant Coronary Artery Disease in all Octogenarians?
PG  - 244-259
LID - 10.2174/1573403X16666200903153823 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of cardiovascular death 
      in octogenarians. This group of patients represents nearly a fifth of all 
      patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in real-world 
      practice. Octogenarians have multiple risk factors for CAD and often greater 
      myocardial ischemia than younger counterparts, with a potential of an increased 
      benefit from myocardial revascularization. Despite this, octogenarians are 
      routinely under- -treated and belittled in clinical trials. Age does make a 
      difference to PCI outcomes in older people, but it is never the sole arbiter of 
      any clinical decision, whether in relation to the heart or any other aspect of 
      health. The decision when to perform revascularization in elderly patients and 
      especially in octogenarians is complex and should consider the patient on an 
      individual basis, with clarification of the goals of the therapy and the relative 
      risks and benefits of performing the procedure. In ST-segment elevation 
      myocardial infarction (MI), there is no upper age limit regarding urgent 
      reperfusion and primary PCI must be the standard of care. In non-ST-segment 
      elevation acute coronary syndromes, a strict conservative strategy must be 
      avoided; whereas the use of a routine invasive strategy may reduce the occurrence 
      of MI and the need for revascularization at follow-up, with no established 
      benefit in terms of mortality. In stable CAD patients, invasive therapy on top of 
      optimal medical therapy seems better in symptom relief and quality of life. This 
      review summarizes the available data on percutaneous revascularization in the 
      elderly patients and particularly in octogenarians, including practical 
      considerations on PCI risk secondary to ageing physiology. We also analyse 
      technical difficulties met when considering PCI in this cohort and the ongoing 
      need for further studies to ameliorate risk stratification and eventually 
      outcomes in these challenging patients.

TI  - Multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention using a 
      participatory-action-research approach to improve antibiotic prescribing for 
      urinary tract infections in frail elderly (ImpresU): study protocol for a 
      European qualitative study followed by a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled 
      trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Almost 60% of antibiotics in frail elderly are prescribed for 
      alleged urinary tract infections (UTIs). A substantial part of this comprises 
      prescriptions in case of non-specific symptoms or asymptomatic bacteriuria, for 
      which the latest guidelines promote restrictiveness with antibiotics. We aim to 
      reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through an antibiotic stewardship 
      intervention (ASI) that encourages to prescribe according to these guidelines. To 
      develop an effective ASI, we first need a better understanding of the complex 
      decision-making process concerning suspected UTIs in frail elderly. Moreover, the 
      implementation approach requires tailoring to the heterogeneous elderly care 
      setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: First, we conduct a qualitative study to explore 
      factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for UTIs in frail elderly, using 
      semi-structured interviews with general practitioners, nursing staff, patients 
      and informal caregivers. Next, we perform a pragmatic cluster randomised 
      controlled trial in elderly care organisations. A multifaceted ASI is implemented 
      in the intervention group; the control group receives care as usual. The ASI is 
      centred around a decision tool that promotes restrictive antibiotic use, 
      supported by a toolbox with educational materials. For the implementation, we use 
      a modified participatory-action-research approach, guided by the results of the 
      qualitative study. The primary outcome is the number of antibiotic prescriptions 
      for suspected UTIs. We aim to recruit 34 clusters with in total 680 frail elderly 
      residents ≥70 years. Data collection takes place during a 5-month baseline period 
      and a 7-month follow-up period. Finally, we perform a process evaluation. The 
      study has been delayed for 6 months due to COVID-19 and is expected to end in 
      July 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approvals and/or waivers were 
      obtained from the ethical committees in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and 
      Sweden. The results will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed 
      journals and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03970356.

AB  - Predictions for the upcoming decades suggest an increase in the number of elderly 
      people in Europe; due to low fertility and the rise in average life expectancy, 
      societies age considerably faster. The nature of these changes signifies that a 
      complex demographic process is taking place. In consequence, one can notice an 
      increase in the demand for personal and nursing care activities provided in the 
      natural human environment, or in various institutions, by adequately prepared, 
      specialized medical staff. Creating the best possible procedures for assisting 
      elderly people is a multifaceted and dynamic problem. The constantly changing 
      expectations regarding healthcare providers, and the higher social and health 
      awareness are challenging medical sciences and social services to provide the 
      oldest generation with the best quality of life. The life satisfaction measure 
      for elderly people is their activity which determines an independent, 
      self-reliant, satisfactory, and long life. Int J Occup Med Environ Health.

      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial.
PG  - 120

LID - 120
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with 
      multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have 
      experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or 
      acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and 
      their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that 
      prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. METHODS: The study will test 
      the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care 
      intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their 
      caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following 
      discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial 
      design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard 
      discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute 
      data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the 
      standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a 
      two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of 
      Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation 
      RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A 
      key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff 
      to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The 
      primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver 
      preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided 
      test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in 
      the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed 
      models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to 
      assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of 
      life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden 
      and distress. DISCUSSION: Study results will determine the efficacy of an 
      intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for 
      seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of 
      acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and 
      (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative 
      care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol 
      was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was 
      revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, 
      and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing 
      these modifications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03810534 .

TI  - The prevalence and prognostic value of frailty screening measures in patients 
      undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer: observations from a systematic review.
PG  - 260

LID - 260
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a complex multifactorial syndrome characterised by a 
      significant increase in vulnerability and worsened health outcomes. Despite a 
      range of proposed frailty screening measures, the prevalence and prognostic value 
      of frailty in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer is not clear. 
      AIM: The aim of this present review was to examine the use of commonly employed 
      frailty screening measures in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. 
      METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Medline was carried out to identify 
      studies reporting the use of frailty screening tools or measures in patients 
      undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. The screening measure used and 
      prevalence of frailty within the population were recorded. Outcomes of interest 
      were the incidence of post-operative complications, 30-day mortality and overall 
      survival. RESULTS: Of the 15 studies included (n = 97, 898 patients), 9 studies 
      were retrospective and included patients aged 70 years or older (n = 96, 120 
      patients). 5 of 12 studies reported that frailty was independently associated 
      with the incidence of post-operative complications. There was also evidence that 
      frailty was independently associated with 30-day mortality (1 of 4 studies, 
      n = 9, 252 patients) and long-term survival (2 of 3 studies, n = 1, 420 
      patients). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was common in patients with colorectal cancer and 
      the assessment of frailty may have prognostic value in patients undergoing 
      surgery. However, the basis of the relationship between frailty and 
      post-operative outcomes is not clear and merits further study.

TI  - Can cognitive-motor training improve physical functioning and psychosocial 
      wellbeing in nursing home residents? A randomized controlled feasibility study as 
      part of the PROCARE project.
PG  - 943-956
LID - 10.1007/s40520-020-01615-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multi-component training program holds promises for the elderly, 
      but still has to be tested on its feasibility and effect in nursing homes. AIMS: 
      The aim of this study was (1) to design a multi-component training program which 
      improves physical functioning and psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to evaluate the 
      feasibility of this intervention in nursing home residents. METHODS: This study 
      is a two-arm, stratified-randomized controlled feasibility trail. Twenty-four 
      nursing home residents (aged 83.7 ± 6.4, 21 women) were divided into an 
      intervention and a waiting-list control group. The intervention group completed a 
      multi-component training (including dual-task, dynamic balance, endurance and 
      strength exercises) for 16 weeks (twice per week for 45-60 min). Primary outcomes 
      were lower extremity functionality (SPPB), gait performance (GAITRite), 
      health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as life satisfaction (SWLS). 
      RESULTS: Life satisfaction (SWLS) and physical functioning (SPPB) increased in 
      the intervention group after training whereas the control group showed a 
      decrease. Gait parameters could only be analyzed for n = 5 participants of the 
      intervention group and n = 2 of the control group and showed no time differences 
      for the intervention group. The mean number of participants was 12.5 ± 1.9 per 
      session (attendance ranged between 66% and 90%). CONCLUSION: A multi-component 
      training seems (1) to lead to clinically relevant improvements in physical 
      functioning as well as in psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to be feasible and well 
      accepted in nursing home residents. Nevertheless, the complexity and progression 
      of the program as well as the testing protocol have to be adapted. Further 
      research should test the effectiveness of this adapted program in a larger sample 
      size.

TI  - Effect of an osteoporotic fracture prevention program on fracture incidence in 
      routine care: a cluster-randomized trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fractures are a major health problem in aging societies. Preventive 
      approaches combining bone health and fall prevention are rare. The osteoporotic 
      fracture prevention program in rural areas (OFRA) is a health care fund-driven 
      program for older people in randomly selected districts in Germany. The 
      components of the program were falls prevention exercise classes, examination of 
      bone health by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and a consultation 
      about "safety in the living environment." The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      this complex preventive intervention in a routine health care setting. METHODS: 
      This cluster-randomized trial was performed from October 2015 to October 2018 and 
      took place in 186 administrative districts in five federal states, 47 districts 
      served as intervention districts, and 139, as controls. Within these districts, 
      we included (a) all community-living women and men aged 70-85 years with prior 
      fragility fractures and (b) all community-living women aged 75-80 years. The 
      analysis used routine data collected by a health insurance company. The primary 
      endpoint was all fragility fractures combined. Fracture types, mortality, and 
      nursing home admission were explorative endpoints. Cox frailty models were used 
      for comparative analyses with a median follow-up time of 365 days (interquartile 
      range: 0 days). RESULTS: Nine thousand four hundred eight individuals were 
      approached to participate in one of the program components, 27,318 individuals 
      served as controls. The mean age was 78.7 years. Of those approached to 
      participate, nearly 30% joined the exercise classes. DXA measurement was 
      reimbursed for 13.6%, and 51.8% received advice about measures to increase 
      "safety in the living environment." The incidence of fragility fractures did not 
      differ between the intervention and the control group (HR 0.94; 95% CI 
      0.80-1.11). However, femoral fractures, the most frequent fracture type, were 
      reduced in the intervention group (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.99). Mortality and 
      nursing home admission did not differ between the intervention and the control 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive fracture prevention program for older people 
      living in rural areas was implemented. The program did not affect the primary 
      endpoint of all fragility fractures combined. It has to be considered that we 
      used a modified intention to treat approach based on geographic randomization and 
      information about endpoints relied exclusively on routine data of the health care 
      insurance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS-ID: 00009000.

TI  - 'Fitting in the pharmacist' - a qualitative analysis of the perceived 
      relationship between community pharmacists and older adults with complex care 
      needs.
PG  - 428-434
LID - 10.1093/ijpp/riab034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the current perceived relationship between older adults 
      with varying levels of frailty and healthcare needs and community pharmacists. 
      METHODS: This qualitative study conducted a thematic analysis of focus groups 
      with older adults and older adult caregivers and community pharmacist 
      participants. Participants were recruited following a maximum variation sampling 
      technique. Verbatim transcripts were inductively coded using NVivo to develop key 
      findings. KEY FINDINGS: Four major themes emerged: (i) Pharmacy Landscape, (ii) 
      Prescription and Non-Prescription Drug Safety, (iii) Patient-Pharmacist 
      Relationship and (iv) Recommendations for Pharmacy Practice. Themes demonstrate 
      three key findings: (1) older adults approach drug information with a key focus 
      on safety and cost of both prescription and non-prescription drugs, (2) there is 
      a demonstrated opportunity, recognized by older adults and practitioners, for 
      community pharmacists to expand their role in the care of older adults, (3) 
      community pharmacists are able, interested and/or have already incorporated 
      frailty assessments into their practice to better support their care of the older 
      adult population with varying levels of frailty. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      demonstrate a reason for the community pharmacist role to shift. The unique 
      knowledge and skills of community pharmacists, coupled with their accessibility 
      and strong patient-clinician relationship, have the potential to better support 
      older adults with varying levels of frailty.

TI  - Transitions between degrees of multidimensional frailty among older people

PG  - 722
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03378-9 [doi]
LID - 722
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a dynamic condition that is clinically expected to change 
      in older individuals during and around admission to an intermediate care (IC) 
      facility. We aimed to characterize transitions between degrees of frailty before, 
      during, and after admission to IC and assess the impact of these transitions on 
      health outcomes. METHODS: Multicentre observational prospective study in IC 
      facilities in Catalonia (North-east Spain). The analysis included all individuals 
      aged ≥ 75 years (or younger with chronic complex or advanced diseases) admitted 
      to an IC facility. The primary outcome was frailty, measured by the Frail-VIG 
      index and categorized into four degrees: no frailty, and mild, moderate, and 
      advanced frailty. The Frail-VIG index was measured at baseline (i.e., 30 days 
      before IC admission) (Frail-VIG(0)), on IC admission (Frail-VIG(1)), at discharge 
      (Frail-VIG(2)), and 30 days post-discharge (Frail-VIG(3)). RESULTS: The study 
      included 483 patients with a mean (SD) age of 81.3 (10.2) years. At the time of 
      admission, 27 (5.6%) had no frailty, and 116 (24%), 161 (33.3%), and 179 (37.1%) 
      mild, moderate, and severe frailty, respectively. Most frailty transitions 
      occurred within the 30 days following admission to IC, particularly among 
      patients with moderate frailty on admission. Most patients maintained their 
      frailty status after discharge. Overall, 135 (28%) patients died during IC stay. 
      Frailty, measured either at baseline or admission, was significantly associated 
      with mortality, although it showed a stronger contribution when measured on 
      admission (HR 1.16; 95%CI 1.10-1.22; p < 0.001) compared to baseline (HR 1.10; 
      1.05-1.15; p < 0.001). When including frailty measurements at the two time points 
      (i.e., baseline and IC admission) in a multivariate model, frailty measured on IC 
      admission but not at baseline significantly contributed to explaining mortality 
      during IC stay. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty status varied before and during admission to 
      IC. Of the serial frailty measures we collected, frailty on IC admission was the 
      strongest predictor of mortality. Results from this observational study suggest 
      that routine frailty measurement on IC admission could aid clinical management 
      decisions.

TI  - The Cardiac Care Bridge randomized trial in high-risk older cardiac patients: A 
      mixed-methods process evaluation.
PG  - 2498-2510
LID - 10.1111/jan.14786 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate healthcare professionals' performance and treatment fidelity in 
      the Cardiac Care Bridge (CCB) nurse-coordinated transitional care intervention in 
      older cardiac patients to understand and interpret the study results. DESIGN: A 
      mixed-methods process evaluation based on the Medical Research Council Process 
      Evaluation framework. METHODS: Quantitative data on intervention key elements 
      were collected from 153 logbooks of all intervention patients. Qualitative data 
      were collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 CCB professionals 
      (cardiac nurses, community nurses and primary care physical therapists), from 
      June 2017 until October 2018. Qualitative data-analysis is based on thematic 
      analysis and integrated with quantitative key element outcomes. The analysis was 
      blinded to trial outcomes. Fidelity was defined as the level of intervention 
      adherence. RESULTS: The overall intervention fidelity was 67%, ranging from 
      severely low fidelity in the consultation of in-hospital geriatric teams (17%) to 
      maximum fidelity in the comprehensive geriatric assessment (100%). Main themes of 
      influence in the intervention performance that emerged from the interviews are 
      interdisciplinary collaboration, organizational preconditions, confidence in the 
      programme, time management and patient characteristics. In addition to practical 
      issues, the patient's frailty status and limited motivation were barriers to the 
      intervention. CONCLUSION: Although involved healthcare professionals expressed 
      their confidence in the intervention, the fidelity rate was suboptimal. This 
      could have influenced the non-significant effect of the CCB intervention on the 
      primary composite outcome of readmission and mortality 6 months after 
      randomization. Feasibility of intervention key elements should be reconsidered in 
      relation to experienced barriers and the population. IMPACT: In addition to 
      insight in effectiveness, insight in intervention fidelity and performance is 
      necessary to understand the mechanism of impact. This study demonstrates that the 
      suboptimal fidelity was subject to a complex interplay of organizational, 
      professionals' and patients' issues. The results support intervention redesign 
      and inform future development of transitional care interventions in older cardiac 
      patients.

AB  - AIMS: Treatment decisions for older patients with breast cancer are complex and 
      evidence is largely extrapolated from younger populations. Frailty and 
      comorbidity need to be considered. We studied the baseline characteristics and 
      treatment decisions in older patients in Christchurch with breast cancer and 
      assessed survival outcomes and prognostic/discriminatory performance of several 
      tools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the Canterbury Breast Cancer Registry 
      and identified patients aged 70 years or older at diagnosis with invasive, 
      non-metastatic breast cancer between 1 June 2009 and 30 June 2015. We retrieved 
      demographics, treatment and outcome information. Overall survival and breast 
      cancer-specific survival were estimated. Tools analysing performance status and 
      comorbidity were assessed for their prognostic and discriminatory power. RESULTS: 
      In total, 440 patients were identified. Primary surgery was carried out for 362 
      patients (82.3%): breast-conserving surgery in 114 (of whom 88.6% received 
      radiation therapy); mastectomy in 248 (of whom 24.6% received radiation). Hormone 
      therapy was given for 265 (71.1%) patients with oestrogen receptor-positive 
      cancers. Two hundred and seventy-four (62.3%) patients received full standard 
      treatment, which was associated with significantly improved 5-year survival and 
      5-year breast cancer-specific survival. The median estimated overall survival was 
      8.2 years (95% confidence interval 7.3-9.1 years). Of those who died, 71.3% of 
      deaths were due to causes other than breast cancer or unknown causes. The 
      comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy (CALE) showed partial prognostic accuracy. 
      CALE, Charlson and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group tools all showed 
      discriminatory value. CONCLUSION: In this population-based series of older 
      patients with breast cancer, showing high levels of primary and adjuvant 
      treatment, patients were more likely to die of causes other than breast cancer. 
      Performance status and comorbidity tools showed prognostic and discriminatory 
      potential in this population supporting their use in treatment decision making. 
      CALE showed the most potential to improve treatment decisions but requires 
      validation in this population to improve prognostic accuracy.

TI  - Antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve 
      replacement: the complexity of the elderly.
PG  - 87-97
LID - 10.1093/eurjpc/zwaa053 [doi]
LID - zwaa053
AB  - Along with epidemiologic transitions of the global population, the burden of 
      aortic stenosis (AS) is rapidly increasing and transcatheter aortic valve 
      replacement (TAVR) has quickly spread; indeed, it is nowadays also employed in 
      treating patients with AS at intermediate operative risk. Nonetheless, the less 
      invasive interventional strategy still carries relevant issues concerning 
      post-procedural optimal antithrombotic strategy, given the current indications 
      provided by guidelines are not completely supported by evidence-based data. 
      Geriatric patients suffer from high bleeding and thromboembolic risks, whose 
      balance is particularly subtle due to the presence of concomitant conditions, 
      such as atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease, that make the post-TAVR 
      antithrombotic management particularly insidious. This scenario is further 
      complicated by the lack of specific evidence regarding the 'real-life' complex 
      conditions typical of the geriatric syndromes, thus, the management of such a 
      heterogeneous population, ranging from healthy ageing to frailty, is far from 
      being defined. The aim of the present review is to summarize the critical points 
      and the most updated evidence regarding the post-TAVR antithrombotic approach in 
      the geriatric population, with a specific focus on the most frequent clinical 
      settings.

TI  - Development of a theory-based intervention to increase cognitively able frail 
      elders' engagement with advance care planning using the behaviour change wheel.
PG  - 712
LID - 10.1186/s12913-021-06548-4 [doi]
LID - 712
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) conversations support people to think 
      about, discuss and document their beliefs, values and preferences regarding 
      future care. This process means that should the person loose capacity in the 
      future, care can be provided, consistent with their personal values and beliefs. 
      The ACP process is particularly relevant for older people living with frailty 
      (frail elders) as they are vulnerable to sudden deterioration. However, ACP is 
      rarely undertaken by frail elders. The aim of this study was to develop an 
      intervention to increase multidisciplinary health and social care professionals' 
      (H&SCPs) engagement of cognitively able, domestic-dwelling frail elders with ACP. 
      METHODS: Intervention development was guided by the Medical Research Council 
      framework for complex interventions and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Multiple 
      methods were used to understand ACP barriers and enablers: a systematic 
      integrative review, a survey (n = 73 H&SCPs), and semi-structured interviews 
      (n = 10 frail elders, n = 8 family members). A conceptual model, developed from 
      the integrative review, underpinned data collection for the survey and 
      interviews. Synthesis of this data, including patient and public involvement, was 
      then used to identify H&SCPs behaviours that needed to change for ACP to be 
      implemented and decide content and implementation for the intervention. RESULTS: 
      Following the Behaviour Change Wheel system, and based on the findings of the 
      review, survey and interviews, the prototype intervention, Conversations on 
      Living and Dying (CLaD), was developed. The CLaD prototype consisted of one 
      3.5-hour educational skills session for H&SCPs supported by a toolkit. Content 
      focussed on the relevance of ACP for frail elders, experience of ACP by frail 
      elders, and strategies H&SCPs could adopt to encourage frail elders' engagement 
      with ACP. Strategies include recognising the importance of relationships and 
      living well now, preparing frail elders for ACP conversations and starting ACP 
      early. Participants who took part in initial prototype refinement reported that 
      the intervention helped them think differently about ACP and encouraged them to 
      engage with frail elders. CONCLUSIONS: The use of behavioural theory enabled the 
      development of CLaD, an evidence-based, theory-driven, person-centred 
      intervention to support ACP engagement with frail elders. While feasibility 
      testing is required, initial prototype refinement demonstrated that H&SCPs found 
      the intervention to be acceptable, engaging, and clinically valuable in their 
      practice with frail elders and their families.

TI  - Modified frailty index predicts postoperative complications in women with 
      gynecologic cancer undergoing cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic 
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the impact of frailty on postoperative complications 
      following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intra-peritoneal 
      chemotherapy (HIPEC) in women with advanced or recurrent gynecologic cancer. 
      METHODS: An IRB-approved single-institution prospective registry was queried for 
      women who underwent CRS with HIPEC for advanced or recurrent gynecologic cancer 
      from 1/1/2014-12/31/2020. Frailty was defined as a modified Frailty Index (mFI) 
      score of ≥2. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of mFI upon the 
      rate of moderate or higher (≥ grade 2) Accordion postoperative complications. 
      RESULTS: Of 141 women, 81.6% (n = 115) were non-frail with mFI of 0-1 and 18.4% 
      (n = 26) were frail with mFI ≥2. The incidence of ≥ grade 2 complications was 
      21.2% (n = 14) for mFI = 0, 26.5% (n = 13) for mFI = 1, 64.7% (n = 11) for mFI = 
      2 and 100.0% (n = 9) for patients with mFI ≥3. The incidence of re-operation 
      (1.7% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.044), ICU admission (13.2% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.018), acute 
      kidney injury (6.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.001), and respiratory failure (0.9% vs. 
      19.2%, p < 0.001) were significantly lower amongst non-frail vs. frail women. On 
      multivariable analysis, mFI ≥2 was associated with significantly increased ≥ 
      grade 2 complications versus mFI of 0-1 (OR 9.4, 95% CI 3.3, 26.4, p < 0.001). 
      Age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 1.09, p = 0.07), surgical indication (recurrent vs. 
      primary) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.30, 1.7, p = 0.44) and Surgical Complexity Score of 
      Intermediate or High vs. Low (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.67, 3.5, p = 0.31) were not 
      associated with ≥grade 2 complications. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, defined by the 
      modified frailty index, is predictive of ≥grade 2 postoperative complications 
      following CRS with HIPEC in women with gynecologic cancer. Frailty screening 
      before CRS with HIPEC may assist patient selection and improve postoperative 
      outcomes.

TI  - Sexual harassment or disinhibition? Residential care staff responses to older 
      adults' unwanted behaviours.
PG  - e12433
LID - 10.1111/opn.12433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ethical complexity of residential care is especially apparent for 
      staff responding to residents' inappropriate sexual expression, particularly when 
      directed towards care workers as these residents are typically frail, often 
      cognitively impaired, and require ongoing care. OBJECTIVES: To explore staff 
      accounts of how they made meaning of and responded to residents' unwanted sexual 
      behaviours directed towards staff. This exploration includes whether staff 
      appeared to accept harassment as a workplace hazard to be managed, or an 
      unacceptable workplace violation, or something else. METHODS: These qualitative 
      data are drawn from a national two-arm mixed method study in Aotearoa New Zealand 
      undertaken in 35 residential care facilities. Semi-structured interviews were 
      conducted with 77 staff, residents and family members. Interpretive description 
      was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Staff had numerous ways they used to 
      respond to behaviours: (1) minimisation, deflection and de-escalation, where 
      staff used strategies to minimise behaviours without requiring any accountability 
      from residents; (2) holding residents accountable, where staff to some degree 
      addressed the behaviour directly with residents; (3) blurred boundaries and 
      complexities in intimate long-term care, where staff noted that in a context 
      where touch is common-place, cognitive function was diminished and relationships 
      were long-term, boundaries were easily breached; (4) dehumanising and 
      infantilising residents' behaviours, where staff appeared to assert control 
      through diminishing the residents' identity as an older person. It was evident 
      that staff had developed considerable practice wisdom focused on preserving the 
      care relationship although few referred to policy and education guiding practice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Staff appeared to be navigating a complex ethical terrain with 
      thoughtfulness and skill. Care workers seemed reluctant to label resident 
      behaviour as sexual harassment, and the term may not fit for staff where they 
      perceive residents are frail and cognitively impaired. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
      Policy, education and clinical leadership are recommended to augment practice 
      wisdom and ensure staff and resident safety and dignity and to determine how best 
      to intervene with residents' unwanted sexual behaviours.

TI  - Determinants of Discharge Disposition From Acute Care for Survivors of 
      Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury: Results From a Large Population-Based Cohort Data 
      Set.

LID - S0003-9993(21)00153-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.apmr.2021.01.083 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of discharge disposition from acute care 
      among survivors of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI), stratified by sex. 
      DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study using provincial data in 
      Ontario, Canada. The determinants were grouped into predisposing, need, and 
      enabling factors using the Anderson Behavioral Model. SETTING: Acute care. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Survivors of HIBI aged ≥20 years at the time of hospitalization and 
      discharged alive from acute care between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2017. There 
      were 7492 patients with HIBI, of whom 28% (N=2077) survived their acute care 
      episode. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discharge 
      disposition from acute care, categorized as complex continuing care (CCC), 
      long-term care (LTC), inpatient rehabilitation (IR), home with support, home 
      without support, and transferred to another acute care. RESULTS: The discharge 
      dispositions for the 2077 survivors were IR 23.4% (n=487), CCC 19.5% (n=404), LTC 
      6.2% (n=128), home without support 31.2% (n=647), home with support 15.1% 
      (n=314), and other 4.6%. Multinomial multivariable logistic regression analysis 
      using home without support as the reference category revealed that female 
      patients were significantly more likely than male patients to be discharged to 
      LTC/CCC. Those who were older, were frail, and had longer stay in acute care or 
      special care unit (SCU) were more likely to be discharged to LTC/CCC. The only 
      significant determinant for IR was longer stay in acute care. Survivors with 
      cardiac-related injury were less likely to be discharged to LTC/CCC. Income was a 
      significant factor for male patients but not for female patients in the 
      sex-stratified analysis. The following variables were investigated but were not 
      significant determinants in this study: need factors (comorbidity score, prior 
      psychiatric disorders, health care utilization) and enabling factors (income 
      quintile, rural area of residence). CONCLUSIONS: Predisposing (age, sex) and need 
      factors (frailty, acute care days, SCU days, type of injury) were significant 
      determinants of discharge disposition from acute care after HIBI. In spite of a 
      system with universal coverage, sex differences were found, with more female 
      patients being discharged to CCC/LTC rather than IR, controlling for age and 
      other confounders. These findings should be considered in appropriate discharge 
      planning from acute care for survivors of HIBI.

TI  - HDR brachytherapy with individual epithetic molds for facial skin cancer: 
      techniques and first clinical experience.
PG  - 717-723
LID - 10.1111/ijd.15492 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Facial skin cancer lesions in close proximity to critical organs 
      require further development of radiotherapeutic techniques for highly conformal 
      treatment, especially when treating elderly frail patients. We report on our 
      treatment technique and first clinical experience for patients with 
      perinasal/periorbital skin cancer treated with individualized epithetic mold 
      high-dose-rate brachytherapy (BRT). METHODS: From January 2019, patients with 
      complex shaped or unfavorably located skin cancer not eligible for surgery or 
      external beam radiotherapy (RT) were screened for mold-based BRT. Six patients 
      were identified. Toxicity and clinical response were documented during therapy 
      and posttreatment follow-up. RESULTS: Median patient age was 80 years 
      (74-92 years). Median prescription dose was 42 Gy (range, 33-44 Gy) delivered in 
      once-daily fractions of 3 or 4 Gy. Two patients had treatment interruptions 
      caused by acute conjunctivitis grade 2 and a nontreatment-related cardiac event, 
      respectively. At a median follow-up of 335 days (96-628 days), no ≥ grade 2 late 
      toxicity was documented with all patients showing complete clinical response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: High-dose-rate BRT with individualized epithetic molds for 
      perinasal/periorbital skin cancer is a well-tolerated and safe treatment option 
      for patients not eligible for primary surgery or definitive external beam RT 
      because of comorbidities or tumor location.

TI  - The Grief and Bereavement Experiences of Informal Caregivers: A Scoping Review of 
      the North American Literature.
PG  - 242-258
LID - 10.1177/08258597211052269 [doi]
AB  - Background: Informal caregivers are a significant part of the hospice and 
      palliative care landscape as members of the interdisciplinary care team. Despite 
      this, little is known about the impact this responsibility has on informal 
      caregivers' experiences of grief and bereavement. Objective: To address this, a 
      scoping review of the literature was conducted to explore the current state of 
      knowledge toward grief and bereavement of informal caregivers of adult/geriatric 
      patients in the hospice and palliative/end-of-life care realm within North 
      America. Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-step framework, key electronic 
      health care and social sciences databases (eg, CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest 
      Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO) alongside gray literature sources were searched 
      and screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thematic content 
      analysis was used to identify key themes. Results: 29 articles met the final 
      inclusion criteria with 3 central themes emerging: (1) mediators of grief, (2) 
      grief experiences, and (3) types of grief. Discussion: Informal caregivers 
      encounter unique grief and bereavement experiences: The range of psychosocial 
      outcomes, both negative and positive, can be affected by various mediators such 
      as caregiver burden, demographics, disease type of the patient being cared for, 
      etc. Bereavement interventions must be designed with the mediators of grief in 
      mind. Conclusions: Understanding the nuances of informal caregivers' experiences 
      with grief and bereavement will inform and advance practice, policy, and 
      research. Practitioners/clinicians should be further educated on how to properly 
      acknowledge the complexity of grief and bereavement for informal caregivers, 
      specifically paying attention to mediators. Further research needs to consider 
      the role of culture.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vascular surgery patients commonly have several comorbidities that 
      cumulatively lead to a frailty status. The cumulative comorbidities 
      disproportionately increase the risk of adverse events and are also associated 
      with worsened long-term prognosis. In recent years, several tools have been 
      elaborated with the objective of quantifying a patient's frailty. One of them is 
      the modified frailty index-5 (mFI-5), a simplified and easy to use index. There 
      is scarce data regarding its value as a prognostic factor in aortoiliac occlusive 
      disease. The aim of this work is to validate mFI-5 as a potential postoperative 
      prognostic indicator in this population. METHODS: From January 2013 to January 
      2020, 109 patients who underwent elective revascularizations, either endovascular 
      or open surgery, having Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II type D 
      aortoiliac lesions in a tertiary and a regional hospital were selected from a 
      prospective vascular registry. Demographic data was collected including diabetes 
      mellitus, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial 
      hypertension requiring medication and functional status. The 30-d and subsequent 
      long-term surveillance outcomes were also collected including major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE) and all-cause 
      mortality were assessed in the 30-d post-procedure and in the subsequent 
      long-term surveillance period. The mFI-5 was applied to this population to 
      evaluate the prognostic impact of this frailty marker on mortality and morbidity. 
      RESULTS: In the long-term follow-up, mFI-5 was significantly associated with MACE 
      (hazard ratio [HR] 2.469; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.267-4.811; P = .008) 
      and all-cause mortality (HR 2.585; 95% CI: 1.270-5.260; P = .009). However, there 
      was no significant association with 30-day outcomes. Along with the presence of 
      chronic kidney disease, mFI-5 was the prognostic factor better able of predicting 
      MACE. No prognostic value was found regarding short-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: 
      The mFI-5 index may have a role in predicting long term outcomes, namely MACE and 
      all-cause mortality, in the subset of patients with extensive aortoiliac 
      occlusive disease. Its ease of use can foster its application in risk 
      stratification and contribute for the decision-making process.

TI  - Older patients' perspectives on factors contributing to frequent visits to the 
      emergency department: a qualitative interview study.
PG  - 1709
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-11755-z [doi]
LID - 1709
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older patients are at high risk of unplanned revisits to the 
      emergency department (ED) because of their medical complexity. To reduce the 
      number of ED visits, we need more knowledge about the patient-level, 
      environmental, and healthcare factors involved. The aim of this study was to 
      describe older patients' perspectives and experiences before and after an ED 
      visit, and to identify factors that possibly contribute to frequent ED revisits. 
      METHODS: This was a qualitative description study. We performed semi-structured 
      individual interviews with older patients who frequently visited the ED and were 
      discharged home after an acute visit. Patients were enrolled in the ED of a 
      university medical centre using purposive sampling. Interviews were recorded, 
      transcribed, and coded independently by two researchers. Theoretical analysis was 
      used to identify recurring patterns and themes in the data. Interviews were 
      conducted until thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS: In-depth interviews 
      were completed with 13 older patients. Three main themes emerged: 1) medical 
      events leading to feelings of crisis, 2) patients' untreated health problems, and 
      3) persistent problems in health and daily functioning post discharge. 
      Participants identified problems before and after their ED visit that possibly 
      contributed to further ED visits. These problems included increasing symptoms 
      leading to feelings of crisis, the relationship with the general practitioner, 
      incomplete discharge information at the ED, and inadequate follow-up and lack of 
      recovery after an ED visit. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study identified 
      multiple factors that may contribute to frequent ED visits among older patients. 
      Older patients in need of acute care might benefit from hospital-at-home 
      interventions, or acute care provided by geriatric emergency teams in the primary 
      care setting. Identifying frailty in the ED is needed to improve discharge 
      communication and adequate follow-up is needed to improve recovery after an acute 
      ED visit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of frailty with age is becoming a public 
      health priority in countries with ageing populations. Pre-frailty presents a 
      window of opportunity to prevent the development of frailty in community-dwelling 
      older adults. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a complex 
      intervention that combined a nutrition-based intervention and a physical activity 
      intervention, along with the effectiveness of each intervention individually, to 
      reduce physical frailty in pre-frail older adults over 2 years. METHODS: In this 
      single-blind, 2 x 2 factorial, randomised, controlled trial, we recruited 
      pre-frail community-dwelling older adults in Aotearoa New Zealand via mail 
      through general medical practices. To be eligible, participants had to be 
      pre-frail according to self-reported FRAIL scores of 1 or 2, aged 75 years or 
      older (or 60 years or older for Māori and Pacific Peoples), not terminally ill or 
      with advanced dementia as judged by a general practitioner, able to stand, 
      medically safe to participate in low-intensity exercise, and able to use kitchen 
      utensils safely. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an 8-week Senior 
      Chef programme (SC group), a 10-week Steady As You Go programme (SAYGO group), a 
      10-week combined SC and SAYGO intervention (combined group), or a 10-week social 
      programme (control group), using computer-generated block randomisation 
      administered through an electronic data capture system by local study 
      coordinators. Assessors were masked to group allocation for all assessments. SC 
      is a group-based nutrition education and cooking class programme (3 h weekly), 
      SAYGO is a group-based strength and balance exercise programme (1 h weekly), and 
      the social control programme was a seated, group socialising activity (once a 
      week). Masked assessors ascertained Fried frailty scores at baseline, end of 
      intervention, and at 6, 12, and 24 months after the programme. The primary 
      outcome was change in Fried frailty score at 2 years. Intention-to-treat analyses 
      were completed for all randomised participants, and all participants who had a 
      high (≥75%) adherence were analysed per protocol. This study is registered at 
      ANZCTR, ACTRN12614000827639. FINDINGS: Between May 12, 2016 and April 9, 2018, we 
      assessed 2678 older adults for eligibility, of whom 468 (17%) consented and 
      completed baseline assessment, with a mean age of 80·3 years (SD 5·1) and a mean 
      Fried score of 1·9 (1·2); 59% were women. We randomly allocated these 
      participants into the four groups: 117 in the SC group, 118 in the SAYGO group, 
      118 in the combined group, and 115 in the control group; 318 participants 
      attended the 24-month follow-up: 89 in the SC group, 78 in the SAYGO group, 73 in 
      the combined group, and 78 in the control group. At the 24-month follow-up, there 
      were no differences in mean Fried scores between the intervention groups and the 
      control group. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: The study did not 
      find that the combined SC and SAYGO programme was effective in reducing frailty 
      in pre-frail older adults. Although some short-term benefits were observed in 
      each individual programme, there was no clear evidence of long-term impact. 
      Further research is needed to evaluate combinations of group-based programmes for 
      community-dwelling older adults to optimise their physical function. FUNDING:

AB  - Many older adults will spend their final days in a skilled nursing facility 
      because of multiple complex conditions. Patients with unclear goals of care are 
      at higher risk of rehospitalization and burdensome care at end of life. 
      Palliative care has been shown to improve outcomes for this patient population; 
      however, access is limited because of the small number of boarded specialists 
      nationwide. Telehealth offers the ability to expand the reach of palliative care 
      to both underserved geographies and community settings. This quality improvement 
      pilot project details the development and implementation of a telehealth 
      palliative care program available to nursing home residents. Eight nursing homes, 
      in the New England region of the United States, participated in the 4-month 
      pilot. The palliative telehealth program offered real-time access to a palliative 
      care specialist able to provide symptom management, goals-of-care discussions, 
      and Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment completion. The pilot shows 
      promising outcomes including code status change, Medical Order for 
      Life-Sustaining Treatment form completion, and reduced hospitalizations 
      supporting the benefit of comprehensive goals-of-care discussions for frail older 
      adults living in a nursing home. As health care moves into the digital age, 
      telemedicine plays a large role in the delivery of essential patient care. 
      Provision of palliative specialists by telehealth allows the opportunity to 
      address the unmet needs of this frail population.

TI  - Association between 9p21-23 Locus and Frailty in a Community-Dwelling Greek 
      Population: Results from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Ageing and 
      Diet.
PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome arising from a combination of 
      genetic and environmental factors and is associated with adverse health outcomes 
      and mortality. A recent study reported an association between variants of the 
      9p21-23 locus, associated with a number of age-related disorders, including 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frailty. Frailty has been associated with increased 
      risk of developing AD and it has been proposed that frailty burden may modify AD 
      clinical presentation. In view of the overlapping genetic architecture between 
      the two disorders, it is noteworthy to conduct studies to uncover risk variants 
      that contribute to both AD and frailty. The purpose of this study is to test the 
      reproducibility of the association of 9p21-23 locus with frailty in a population 
      that is ethnically different from previous work and in the context of 
      multidimensional definitions of frailty that will allow us to examine the 
      potential impact to domains pertaining to AD pathology. METHODS: We 
      operationalized frailty according two definitions and the corresponding 
      instruments, the Frailty Index (FI) and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) and 
      we determined genotypes of eight alleles previously identified as risk increasing 
      for frailty in 1172 community-dwelling older participants (57% females) from the 
      HELIAD study with a mean age of 74 years old. We cross-sectionally investigated 
      the association between risk alleles and frailty, as well as with specific 
      components of each definition using linear regression analyses adjusted for age, 
      sex and years of education. RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, carriers of 
      rs7038172 C risk allele, were associated with a higher FI Score (β=0.089, 
      p=0.002). Similarly, we found a positive association between the presence of at 
      least one rs7038172 C variant and TFI score (β=0.053, p=0.04). Moreover, the 
      rs7038172 variant was associated, irrespectively of dementia status, with the 
      memory and psychological domain of FI and TFI, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study confirms the association of the rs7038172 C allele with the frailty 
      syndrome in a Greek population and in the context of multidimensional definitions 
      of frailty. Furthermore, we report novel associations between this allele and the 
      memory domain of FI and the psychological domain of TFI, that includes memory 
      problems on its components. Given that frailty burden has been shown to modify 
      the AD clinical presentation, it is likely that rs7038172 C allele may accelerate 
      the transition of AD or frailty to dementia Overall, our study corroborates the 
      role of the 9p21-23 region in frailty development and draw potential links with 
      AD pathology.

      Frailty Index in Community-Dwelling Older Men and Women.

LID - 2237
AB  - Diet quality has been associated with slower rates of aging; however, the 
      mechanisms underlying the role of a healthy diet in aging are not fully 
      understood. To address this question, we aimed to identify plasma metabolomic 
      biomarkers of dietary patterns and explored whether these metabolites mediate the 
      relationship between diet and healthy aging, as assessed by the frailty index 
      (FI) in 806 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Adherence 
      to different dietary patterns was evaluated using the Mediterranean diet score 
      (MDS), Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) 
      score, and Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI). Associations between diet, 
      FI, and metabolites were assessed using linear regression models. Higher 
      adherence to these dietary patterns was associated with lower FI. We found 236, 
      218, and 278 metabolites associated with the MDS, MIND, and AHEI, respectively, 
      with 127 common metabolites, which included lipids, tri/di-glycerides, 
      lyso/phosphatidylcholine, amino acids, bile acids, ceramides, cholesterol esters, 
      fatty acids and acylcarnitines, indoles, and sphingomyelins. Metabolomic 
      signatures of diet explained 28%, 37%, and 38% of the variance of the MDS, MIND, 
      and AHEI, respectively. Signatures of MIND and AHEI mediated 55% and 61% of the 
      association between each dietary pattern with FI, while the mediating effect of 
      MDS signature was not statistically significant. The high number of metabolites 
      associated with the different dietary patterns supports the notion of common 
      mechanisms that underly the relationship between diet and frailty. The 
      identification of multiple metabolite classes suggests that the effect of diet is 
      complex and not mediated by any specific biomarkers. Furthermore, these 
      metabolites may serve as biomarkers for poor diet quality to identify individuals 
      for targeted dietary interventions.

TI  - Older Adults With Complex Chronic Conditions Who Receive Care at Home: The 
      Importance of Primary Care Assessment.
PG  - 31-38
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20211013-02 [doi]
AB  - The current study aimed to describe the characteristics of older adults with 
      complex chronic conditions cared for at home. One hundred thirty-eight 
      participants were recruited. Participants' average age was 85.9 years and 69.6% 
      were female. Poly-pharmacy was present in 89.9% of participants. Participants who 
      presented with polypharmacy had a worse self-perception of health (p = 0.002), 
      and the worst fall rate. A total of 22.5% had experienced a fall during the past 
      6 months. Approximately one half of participants rated their self-perceived 
      quality of life as bad or very bad. The percentage who used emergency services 
      (54.3%) was greater than the percentage who needed to be admitted (43.5%). A 
      worse self-perception of physical health was significantly associated with 
      hospital admissions (p = 0.01). Geriatric assessment by nurses can provide 
      information to improve care in situations in which frailty, dependency, and 
      chronic conditions occur together. Obtaining information on the needs of 
      individuals with frailty is important in designing successful nursing 
      interventions. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 47(11), 31-38.].

      respiratory insufficiency.
PG  - 945-949
LID - 10.1007/s40520-021-02070-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exploring the association between frailty and mortality in a cohort of 
      patients with COVID-19 respiratory insufficiency treated with continuous positive 
      airway pressure. METHODS: Frailty was measured using a Frailty Index (FI) created 
      by using the baseline assessment data on comorbidities and body mass index and 
      baseline blood test results (including pH, lactate dehydrogenase, renal and liver 
      function, inflammatory indexes and anemia). FI > 0.25 identified frail 
      individuals. RESULTS: Among the 159 included individuals (81% men, median age of 
      68) frailty was detected in 69% of the patients (median FI score 0.3 ± 0.08). 
      Frailty was associated to an increased mortality (adjusted HR 1.99, 95% CI 
      1.02-3.88, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is highly prevalent among patients 
      with COVID-19, predicts poorer outcomes independently of age. A personalization 
      of care balancing the risk and benefit of treatments (especially the invasive 
      ones) in such complex patients is pivotal.

TI  - Perspectives of older adults with a chronic condition on functioning, social 
      participation and health: a qualitative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Problems with mobility, functioning and social participation make 
      living independently difficult for frail older adults. To continue living 
      independently, therapy adherence is a prerequisite. The causes for non-adherence 
      among older adults are multiple and complex, which is why insight into older 
      adults' perspectives regarding their functioning is an essential factor to 
      increase therapy adherence. This study investigates the perspectives of older 
      adults on their functioning, social participation and health, and the factors 
      influencing these elements. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study on the 
      older adult's perceived functioning, social participation and health. Fourteen 
      home-dwelling older adults suffering from chronic health issues were purposively 
      selected. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with open-ended questions. 
      Data were analysed following the Basic Logical Model of Abduction and Creswell's 
      coding method. RESULTS: Assistive devices, the older adult's dwelling and living 
      environment, professional and informal support, and medication are perceived as 
      important determinants for retaining functioning and social participation. 
      Attitude, social influence and personal effectiveness were found to influence 
      whether a person performs or participates in an activity. A person's attitude is 
      related to the significance the activity has to that person, the activity's 
      importance, personal wellbeing, the person's values, and their desire for 
      autonomy. Peers and children have a social influence on the level of activity of 
      the older person. Traditions, in particular religious activities, along with 
      personal effectiveness are motivating factors determining whether a person 
      performs or participates in an activity. Personal effectiveness is linked to the 
      person's belief in their personal competencies and to the relationship between 
      effort and result. Finally, it appears that the type of coping strategy the older 
      adult adopts, has an influence on their behavior. The participating older adults 
      often used remarkable problem-focused strategies, which had a positive effect on 
      their level of autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults have identified barriers and 
      facilitators that influence their level of functioning and social participation. 
      These findings help to create a framework for maintaining and increasing therapy 
      adherence, which may be helpful in facilitating occupational therapists and other 
      healthcare professionals to detect determinants of therapy adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people are often admitted for rehabilitation to improve 
      walking, yet not everyone improves. The aim of this study was to determine key 
      factors associated with a positive response to hospital-based rehabilitation in 
      older people. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis from a multisite 
      randomized controlled trial. Older people (n= 198, median age 80.9 years, IQR 
      76.6- 87.2) who were admitted to geriatric rehabilitation wards with a goal to 
      improve walking were recruited. Participants were randomized to receive 
      additional daily physical therapy focused on mobility (n = 99), or additional 
      social activities (n = 99). Self-selected gait speed was measured on admission 
      and discharge. Four participants withdrew. People who changed gait speed ≥0.1 m/s 
      were classified as 'responders' (n = 130); those that changed <0.1m/s were 
      classified as 'non-responders' (n = 64). Multivariable logistic regression 
      explored the association of six pre-selected participant factors (age, baseline 
      ambulation status, frailty, co-morbidities, cognition, depression) and two 
      therapy factors (daily supervised upright activity time, rehabilitation days) and 
      response. RESULTS: Responding to rehabilitation was associated with the number of 
      days in rehabilitation (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08; p = .039) and higher Mini 
      Mental State Examination scores (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.14; p = .048). No other 
      factors were found to have association with responding to rehabilitation. 
      CONCLUSION: In older people with complex health problems or multi-morbidities, 
      better cognition and a longer stay in rehabilitation were associated with a 
      positive improvement in walking speed. Further research to explore who best 
      responds to hospital-based rehabilitation and what interventions improve 
      rehabilitation outcomes is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Older women have a worse prognosis with advanced epithelial ovarian 
      cancer (EOC) and comorbidities likely contribute to poor outcomes. We sought to 
      identify comorbid conditions and treatment-related factors in older women. 
      METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified 351 patients who underwent 
      cytoreductive surgery (CRS). 100/351 (28.5%) were ≥ 70 years old. Demographic and 
      clinicopathologic information was collected. Crude progression-free (PFS) and 
      overall survival (OS) estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox 
      proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios and 
      adjustments for confounders. RESULTS: Study subjects ≥70 years old had 
      significantly: higher Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) score 
      (5.9 vs 4.3; p = 0.0001), less completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (24% vs 15.1%; 
      p = 0.049), less intraperitoneal (IP) therapy (18.2% vs 35.5%; p = 0.002), less 
      clinical trial participation (16% vs 26.3%; p = 0.040), decreased platinum 
      sensitivity (60% vs 73.7%; p = 0.012) and lacked BRCA mutations (0% vs 12%; p = 
      0.0006). They were less likely to have optimal CRS (75% vs 86.9%; p = 0.007) with 
      same surgical complexity (p = 0.89). Patients ≥70 had significantly worse PFS and 
      OS. In a multivariate analysis, better OS was associated with younger age (<70 
      years old), any IP therapy, completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and platinum 
      sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The older cohort had worse CIRS-G scores (5.9 vs 4.3; p 
      = 0.0001), but no strong associations between comorbidities and treatment 
      characteristics, but less optimal CRS rates (75% vs 86.9%; p = 0.007) with 
      similar surgical complexity and less platinum sensitivity. Our results show 
      comorbid conditions in older patients with advanced EOC may have less impact than 
      tumor biology.

AB  - The growing elderly population worldwide represents a major challenge for 
      caregivers, healthcare providers, and society. Older patients have a higher 
      prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease, high rates of CV risk factors, and 
      multiple age-related comorbidities. Although prevention and management strategies 
      have been shown to be effective in older people, they continue to be under-used, 
      and under-studied. In addition to hard endpoints, frailty, cognitive impairments, 
      and patients' re-assessment of important outcomes (e.g. quality of life vs. 
      longevity) are important aspects for older patients and emphasize the need to 
      include a substantial proportion of older patients in CV clinical trials. To 
      complement the often skewed age distribution in clinical trials, greater emphasis 
      should be placed on real-world studies to assess longer-term outcomes, especially 
      safety and quality of life outcomes. In the complex environment of the older 
      patient, a multidisciplinary care team approach with the involvement of the 
      individual patient in the decision-making process can help optimize prevention 
      and management strategies. This article aims to demonstrate the growing burden of 
      ageing in real life and illustrates the need to continue primary prevention to 
      address CV risk factors. It summarizes factors to consider when choosing 
      pharmacological and interventional treatments for the elderly and the need to 
      consider quality of life and patient priorities when making decisions.

      for Older Patients in Emergency Settings.

LID - 12526
AB  - The provision of person-centered care (PCC) for older adults in emergency 
      settings is important. This short communication explores the complexity of 
      providing comprehensive PCC for older adults in emergency settings, based on a 
      synthesis of existing literature and empirical data from a small-scale case study 
      on the potential of improving patient engagement in a Danish emergency department 
      (ED). Our findings highlight overall positive attitudes towards PCC, as patient 
      engagement is perceived as important and feasible during the waiting hours that 
      older patients experience. However, the key challenges include barriers in 
      organizational structures and cross-sectoral care coordination. We conclude that 
      staff education, optimized care coordination across sectors, and increased 
      involvement of geriatric nurses may enhance the provision of PCC for older, 
      complex adults in EDs. We further conclude that future research into the 
      feasibility and effects of structured approaches for providing PCC in EDs is 
      needed, including exploration of organizational models for PCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD), in 2018 31.4% 
      of patients with displaced intracapsular neck of femur (NOF) fracture who, 
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) viewed eligible for 
      total hip replacement (THR), received this operation. We aimed to identify the 
      compliance of performing THR for those patients in our unit and identify the 
      reasons for proceeding with the alternative type of surgery. METHODS: A five-year 
      retrospective review of eligible patients was conducted between January 2014 and 
      Dec 2018. Statistical analysis was performed between groups who did or didn't 
      receive THR. Reasons for not performing THR were identified from pre-operative 
      ward rounds notes. RESULTS: In 2018 our unit performed THR for 44% of eligible 
      cases. This was the highest result over five-years and higher than the national 
      average. Out of the 348 eligible cases, pathological or undisplaced intracapsular 
      fractures were excluded. Reminder received THR (138), hip hemiarthroplasty (166) 
      or internal fixation (11). The average age was 77. Younger patients were more 
      likely to receive THR than 80 years or older (p<0.05). THR group scored 0.4 
      points higher on AMTS and 0.2 lower on ASA scale then non-THR group (9.8 vs. 9.4 
      and 2.7 vs. 2.5 respectively). Mean time to surgery was 1.24 days with no 
      significant difference between THR and non-THR group (1.6 vs. 1.1) but a slight 
      delay to surgery during the weekends was noted (1.3 vs 1.8 days). Reasons for not 
      performing THR were well documented as a combination of mobility restrictions and 
      serious medical comorbidities. Retrospectively we judged the surgical decision 
      making to be correct in 95% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Annual NHFD report comments on 
      poor national and individual hospital's compliance with NICE guidelines without 
      allowing surgeons to justify their choice of the procedure undertaken. Surgical 
      decisions are made in a highly specialised multi-disciplinary environment taking 
      into consideration individual patient's frailty and potential morbidity. Details 
      of those discussions should be collected in NHFD to allow further analysis of 
      reasons why surgeons decide not to offer THR to a patient NHFD views as eligible 
      for this procedure. This could help in understanding the complex factors 
      impacting on decision making in those cases. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

TI  - Leveraging survey and claims data to identify high-need Medicare beneficiaries in 
      the National Health and Aging Trends Study.
PG  - 522-530
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple algorithms have been developed to identify and characterize 
      the high-need (HN) Medicare population. However, they vary in components and 
      yield different populations, and were developed for varying purposes. We compared 
      the performance of existing survey and claims-based definitions in identifying HN 
      beneficiaries and predicting poor outcomes among a community-dwelling population. 
      METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using Round 5 (2015) of the National Health 
      and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked with Medicare claims. We applied HN 
      definitions from previous studies to our cohort of community-dwelling, 
      fee-for-service beneficiaries (n = 4201) using sampling weights to obtain 
      nationally representative estimates. The Bélanger et al. (2019) definition 
      defines HN as individuals with complex conditions, multi-morbidity, acute and 
      post-acute healthcare utilization, dependency in activities of daily living, and 
      frailty. The Hayes et al. (2016) definition defines HN as individuals with 3+ 
      chronic conditions and a functional limitation. We applied each definition to 
      survey and claims data. Outcomes were hospitalization or mortality in the 
      subsequent year. RESULTS: The proportion of NHATS respondents classified as HN 
      varied greatly across definitions, ranging from 3.1% using the claims-based Hayes 
      definition to 32.9% using the survey-based Bélanger definition. HN respondents 
      had significantly higher mortality and hospitalization rates in 2016. Although 
      all definitions had good specificity, none were able to predict outcomes in the 
      following year with good accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: While mortality and 
      hospitalization rates were significantly higher among respondents classified as 
      HN, existing claims and survey-based HN definitions were not able to accurately 
      predict future outcomes in a community-dwelling, nationally representative sample 
      measured by the area under the curve.

AB  - The edge-to-edge mitral valve repair technique, invented by Alfieri and 
      colleagues, introduced valve repair as a treatment option for patients with 
      complex diseases where standard annuloplasty and related repair techniques are 
      insufficient, due to annular calcification and patient frailty. We 
      retrospectively evaluated the results of a transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve 
      repair (Alfieri stitch) in high-risk patients who were undergoing aortic valve 
      replacement. From February, 2012 to December, 2017, 43 patients underwent 
      transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with concomitant aortic valve 
      replacement at a single institution. Preoperative and postoperative 
      echocardiograms were compared. Home telephone follow up was conducted and 
      postoperative morbidity was examined, including the need for reoperation, stroke 
      and cardiac arrhythmia. 30-day and long-term survival rates were also determined. 
      Mitral regurgitation (MR) was graded semi-quantitatively as 0 (trace and/or 
      none), mild (1), moderate (2) or moderate to severe (3-4). The patients were 74 ± 
      7.8 years old. 65% of the patients were male. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time 
      was 115 ± 37 minutes and mean cross-clamp time was 71 ± 23 minutes. There was a 
      significant improvement in preoperative vs postoperative median MR grade (2 (IQR 
      2-3) vs 0 (IQR 0-1); P = 0.05). Follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms in 29 
      patients obtained at a median of 9 months' (range 3 - 19 months') and in 16 
      patients at a median of 34 months' postoperatively (range 21 - 53 months') showed 
      mild (1 (IQR 1-2)) grade of mitral regurgitation. 30-day survival was 98%. Long 
      term survival at 12 and 24 months' were 88% and 81% respectively. Mitral valve 
      reoperation was conducted in 1 patient (2%), who was suffering of endocarditis. 
      Stroke occurred in 2 patients (7%). Cardiac arrhythmia was observed in 15 
      patients (35%). 8 patients (19%) suffered from atrial fibrillation and 7 patients 
      (16%) displayed atrioventricular blockage. 10 patients (23%) could be treated 
      conservatively and 5 patients (12%) needed implantation of a pacemaker. 
      Transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair can be safely performed during 
      aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients and improves even long-term MR 
      grade. Postoperative cardiac arrhythmia occurs frequently. 66% of them could be 
      treated successfully by conservative procedures.

TI  - Animal Naming Test Is Associated With Poor Patient-Reported Outcomes and Frailty 
      in People With and Without Cirrhosis: A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e00447

LID - e00447
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive dysfunction is a major driver of care complexity, poor 
      patient-reported outcomes, and frailty for people with cirrhosis. The performance 
      and clinical associations of the animal naming test (ANT) in the general 
      population are unknown. We evaluated ANT performance in a representative sample 
      of older Americans with and without chronic liver disease (CLD). METHODS: We 
      analyzed 6,661 subjects enrolled in the 2010-2016 Health and Retirement Survey, a 
      representative cohort of >30,000 US adults. Average age of participants was 75 
      years. We evaluated 3 subject subgroups: (i) without CLD, (ii) noncirrhosis CLD, 
      and (iii) cirrhosis. We determined the association between the ANT (overall) and 
      S-ANT1 <10 (adjusted for age and education) and health status, basic and 
      instrumental activities of daily living, healthcare utilization (care hours 
      received and hospitalizations), and frailty measures (hand grip and walk speed). 
      RESULTS: Overall, 8.2% of the sample had noncirrhotic CLD and 1.3% had cirrhosis. 
      CLD or cirrhosis was not independently associated with ANT. Poor ANT performance 
      was associated with poor health status and frailty overall. An S-ANT <10 was 
      associated with fair-poor self-reported health (odds ratio [OR] 1.37; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.56), care hours received (incidence rate ratio 
      [IRR] 2.39; 95% CI: 1.79-3.19), and hospitalizations (IRR 1.14; 95% CI: 
      1.03-1.26). S-ANT <10 was also associated with activities of daily living 
      disability (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51), instrumental activities of daily living 
      disability (OR 1.85; 95% CI: 1.59-2.14), weaker hand grip (IRR 0.94; 95% CI: 
      0.92-0.96), and time to walk 2.5 m (IRR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.17-1.29). DISCUSSION: ANT 
      performance is not specific to CLD/cirrhosis but is associated with 
      patient-reported outcomes and frailty in a nationally representative sample of 
      elderly subjects with and without CLD.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: An innovative care coordination program was developed to 
      enhance wellness among low-income older adults living in subsidized apartment 
      buildings and to provide rich interprofessional education experiences for health 
      professions students. METHODS: Program effectiveness for the residents was 
      measured through an evaluation of participation, services used, and healthcare 
      utilization. Educational effectiveness was measured through a change in health 
      concepts and perceptions of interprofessional practice. FINDINGS: Health care 
      utilization among participating residents showed an 8.6% reduction in emergency 
      department visits and 9.8% reduction in hospital admissions. Students 
      demonstrated improved knowledge in motivational interviewing (p = .02); diabetes 
      (p = .02); hypertension (p≤.01); and frailty (p≤.01). Changes in students 
      perception of interprofessional practice were significant in two areas; Teamwork 
      and Collaboration (p≥.00); and Person Centeredness (p = .00). DISCUSSION: This 
      care coordination model may be an effective approach to reduce care resource 
      utilization among medically complex lower income older adults and provides a rich 
      interprofessional learning experience for students.

TI  - Conditions associated with the initiation of domiciliary care following a 
      hospital admission: a cohort study in East London, England.
PG  - e061875

LID - e061875
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Older people and people with complex needs often require both health 
      and social care services, but there is limited insight into individual journeys 
      across these services. To help inform joint health and social care planning, we 
      aimed to assess the relationship between hospital admissions and domiciliary care 
      receipt. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study, using linked data on primary care 
      activity, hospital admissions and social care records. SETTING: London Borough of 
      Barking and Dagenham, England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 19 and over who lived in 
      the area on 1 April 2018 and who were registered at a general practice in East 
      London between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2020 (n=140 987). OUTCOME MEASURES: The 
      outcome was initiation of domiciliary care. We estimated the rate of 
      hospital-associated care package initiation, and of care packages unrelated to 
      hospital admission. We also described the characteristics of hospital admissions 
      that preceded domiciliary care, including primary diagnosis codes. RESULTS: 
      2041/140 987 (1.4%) participants had a domiciliary care package during a median 
      follow-up of 1.87 years. 32.6% of packages were initiated during a hospital stay 
      or within 7 days of discharge. The rate of new domiciliary care packages was 120 
      times greater (95% CI 110 to 130) during or after a hospital stay than at other 
      times, and this association was present for all age groups. Primary admission 
      reasons accounting for the largest number of domiciliary care packages were hip 
      fracture, pneumonia, stroke, urinary tract infection, septicaemia and 
      exacerbations of long-term conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 
      heart failure). Admission reasons with the greatest likelihood of a subsequent 
      domiciliary care package were fractures and strokes. CONCLUSION: Hospitals are a 
      major referral route into domiciliary care. While patients admitted due to new 
      and acute illnesses account for many domiciliary care packages, exacerbations of 
      long-term conditions and age-related and frailty-related conditions are also 
      important drivers.

TI  - Variability in Healthcare Expenditure According to the Stratification of Adjusted 
      Morbidity Groups in the Canary Islands (Spain).
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19074219 [doi]
LID - 4219
AB  - Morbidity is the main item in the distribution of expenditure on healthcare 
      services. The Adjusted Morbidity Group (AMG) measures comorbidity and complexity 
      and classifies the patient into mutually exclusive clinical categories. The aim 
      of this study is to analyse the variability of healthcare expenditure on users 
      with similar scores classified by the AMG. Observational analytical and 
      retrospective study. Population: 1,691,075 subjects, from Canary Islands (Spain), 
      aged over 15 years with data from health cards, clinical history, Basic Minimum 
      Specialised Healthcare Data Set, AMG, hospital agreements information system and 
      Electronic Prescriptions. A descriptive, bivariant (ANOVA coefficient η(2)) and 
      multivariant analysis was conducted. There is a correlation between the costs and 
      the weight of AMG (rho = 0.678) and the prescribed active ingredients (rho = 
      0.689), which is smaller with age and does not exist with the other variables. As 
      for the influence of the AMG morbidity group on the total costs of the patient, 
      the coefficient η(2) (0.09) obtains a median effect in terms of the variability 
      of expenditure, hence there is intra- and inter-group variability in the cost. In 
      a first model created with all the variables and the cost, an explanatory power 
      of 36.43% (R(2) = 0.3643) was obtained; a second model that uses solely active 
      ingredients, AMG weight, being female and a pensioner obtained an explanatory 
      power of 36.4%. There is room for improvement in terms of predicting the 
      expenditure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It seems that caregivers (CGs) may be a reliable source of 
      information for determining health condition of seniors. This might be important 
      for general practitioners (GPs) and facilitate them conducting comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment (CGA). The objectives of our study were to: compare 
      populations of older patients with and without CGs, characterise the group of 
      CGs, establish whether CGs are aware of patients' deficiencies in areas of CGA. 
      METHODS: Patients aged at least 65 years underwent CGA using eight tools in GPs' 
      practices in and around Krakow, Poland. Seniors were divided into two groups: 
      with and without CGs. CGs filled in an authors' questionnaire on their data and 
      assessed seniors in eight domains corresponding to the tests used in CGA. 
      Patients with and without CGs were also compared in terms of CGA results and 
      basic demographic and medical data. Subjective CGs' responses were compared with 
      objective CGA results. RESULTS: We conducted CGA on 438 senior patients. Two 
      hundred fifty eight (59%) of them were classified as patients with CGs. Patients 
      with CGs were older, less educated, more often lived in rural areas and were more 
      frequently in a relationship (as all p < 0.05). In seniors with CGs, the results 
      of frailty (p < 0.008) and insomnia scales (p = 0.049) were significantly worse. 
      Mostly, CGs could properly assess seniors in basic and complex living activities 
      and nutritional status. They were less precise in determining deficits like 
      depressive tendency and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: CGs' assessment of older patients 
      can be a valuable source of information about seniors and can be helpful in 
      diagnosing important health issues. CGs have difficulties when asked to properly 
      assess depression and insomnia in the older adults they care for and their 
      answers do not always correspond with the results of CGA. GPs should pay more 
      attention to the needs of CGs themselves and provide them with the necessary 
      knowledge about caring for older people.

TI  - Frailty index is useful for predicting postoperative morbidity in older patients 
      undergoing gastrointestinal surgery: a prospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many assessment tools have been used to identify frail surgical 
      patients. This study was designed to explore the prediction value of the frailty 
      index (FI) for postoperative morbidity in older patients undergoing elective 
      gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Between January 2019 and September 2020, we 
      conducted a prospective study in our hospital, and patients aged over 65 years 
      were enrolled. The FI assessment was conducted by two specialist nurses based on 
      the 38-item scale, and patients were considered frail if the FI score was ≥ 0.25. 
      The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative morbidity. Univariable and 
      multivariable analyses were used to find the risk factors related to 
      postoperative morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 246 consecutive patients were 
      enrolled, for whom the median age was 72.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 67.0-77.0] 
      years old, and 175 (71.1%) were male. Of these, 47 (19.1%) were frail. Patients 
      with frailty were associated with older age (p < 0.001), higher American Society 
      of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (p = 0.006), lower body mass index (p = 0.001), 
      lower albumin (p = 0.003) and haemoglobin (p < 0.001) levels, increased blood 
      loss (p = 0.034), increased risk of postoperative morbidity (p < 0.001), 
      increased median length of stay (p = 0.017), and increased median postoperative 
      hospital stay (p = 0.003). Multivariable analysis revealed that ASA grade [odds 
      ratio (OR): 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-5.64, p = 0.016], FI score 
      (OR 7.68, 95% CI 3.19-18.48, p < 0.001) and surgical complexity (OR 22.83, 95% CI 
      5.46-95.51, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of 30-day postoperative 
      morbidity. However, for patients with major surgery, FI score was the only 
      independent predictor (OR 8.67, 95% CI 3.23-23.25, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Frailty was associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, and the 38-item FI 
      scale was a useful frailty screening tool for older patients undergoing elective 
      gastrointestinal surgery. For patients with major surgery, frailty was a more 
      reliable predictor of postoperative 30-day morbidity than age and ASA grade.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frailty has been correlated with poor outcomes after major surgery 
      across multiple specialties, but has not been studied in patients undergoing open 
      or endovascular repair of suprarenal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. 
      Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) has emerged as a lower risk 
      alternative to open surgical repair (OSR) for patients with complex aortic 
      aneurysms involving the visceral artery branches. The objective of the current 
      study was to examine the relationship between frailty and peri-operative outcomes 
      for FEVAR and OSR in patients with suprarenal and thoracoabdominal aortic 
      aneurysms. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was used to identify patients who 
      underwent FEVAR or OSR for the years 2011 through 2017. Frailty was quantified 
      using a modified 5-factor frailty index (mFI-5) that was previously validated for 
      surgical patients. Frailty was correlated with the primary endpoint of 30-day 
      mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of 30-day 
      mortality. RESULTS: A total of 675 FEVAR and 1,779 OSR operations were included 
      in the analysis. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.0% for FEVAR and 7.1% for OSR 
      (P = 0.002). Increasing frailty was significantly associated with higher 30-day 
      mortality for both FEVAR (P = 0.018) and OSR (P = 0.0003). Independent predictors 
      of 30-day mortality were frailty score (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.22 [per 0.1-unit 
      increase]; P = 0.0005), type of repair (OSR versus FEVAR, OR 2.46; P = 0.0001), 
      age (OR 1.03; P = 0.0025), female sex (OR 1.61; P = 0.007), Hispanic ethnicity 
      (OR 2.68; P = 0.021), American Society of Anesthesiology [ASA] class (OR 1.57; 
      P = 0.035), preoperative dialysis (OR 3.45; P = 0.032), and history of bleeding 
      disorder (OR 2.60; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, as measured using a mFI-5 
      score, is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality, overall complications, 
      and length of stay after FEVAR or OSR. Frailty should be used to identify 
      patients at high risk of adverse postoperative outcomes to determine if this risk 
      is modifiable or whether nonoperative is the most appropriate option. FEVAR may 
      offer improved 30-day outcomes, compared to OSR, for the frailest patients.

AB  - Populations in Asian developed economies are rapidly ageing, such that, 
      currently, Hong Kong and Japan have the longest life expectancy at birth for both 
      men and women. However, extended lifespan is not necessarily accompanied by 
      prolongation of health span, such that there is increasing prevalence of frailty 
      and dependency, which translates into increase in complex health and social needs 
      as well as increase in absolute numbers of older adults that require such needs. 
      Consideration of social determinants of healthy ageing would be important in the 
      design of equitable health and social care systems. There is a trend towards 
      development of integrated medical social care in the community in Asian 
      countries. Long-term care insurance and also philanthropic support play a role in 
      the financing of such care models.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The complex care needs of frail older persons living at home is a 
      major challenge for health care systems worldwide. One possible solution is to 
      employ a primary care physician (PCP) with additional geriatric expertise. In the 
      Netherlands, elderly care physicians (ECPs), who traditionally work in nursing 
      homes, are increasingly encouraged to utilize their expertise within primary 
      care. However, little is known about how PCPs and ECPs collaborate. Therefore, we 
      aimed to unravel the nature of the current PCP-ECP collaboration in primary care 
      for frail older persons, and to identify key concepts for success. DESIGN: A 
      qualitative multiple case study with semistructured interviews. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: A selection of 22 participants from 7 "established collaboration 
      practices" within the primary care setting in the Netherlands, including at least 
      1 ECP, 1 PCP, and 1 other health care professional for every included established 
      collaboration practice. METHODS: Transcripts of individual interviews were 
      analyzed using largely double and independent open and axial coding, and 
      formulation of themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed 4 key 
      concepts for success: (1) clarification of roles and expectations (ie, 
      patient-centered care and embedding in existing care networks), (2) trust, 
      respect, and familiarity as drivers for collaboration (ie, mutual trust through 
      knowing each other and having shared goals); (3) framework for regular 
      communication (ie, structural meetings and a shared vision); and (4) government, 
      payer, and organization support (ie, financial support and emphasis on the 
      collaboration's urgency by organizations and national policy makers). CONCLUSIONS 
      AND IMPLICATIONS: For a successful generalist-specialist collaboration, health 
      care professionals need to invest in building relationships and mutual trust, and 
      incorporating their efforts in the existing care networks to guarantee 
      patient-centeredness. When provided with reimbursement and appreciation, this 
      collaboration is a promising change in general practice to improve the care and 
      outcomes of frail older persons.

TI  - Translation of the geriatric emergency department intervention into other 
      emergency departments: a post implementation evaluation of outcomes for older 
      adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of older adults with complex health deficits 
      presenting to emergency departments has prompted the development of innovative 
      models of care. One such model designed to reduce poor outcomes associated with 
      acute healthcare, is the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention. This 
      intervention is a nurse-led, physician-championed, Emergency Department 
      intervention that improves the health outcomes for frail older adults in the 
      emergency department. METHODS: This quantitative cohort study aimed to evaluate 
      the healthcare outcomes and costs associated with the implementation of the 
      Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention (GEDI) for adults aged 70 years and 
      over at two hospital sites that implemented the model using the 
      integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services 
      (i-PARHIS) framework. Hospital A was large teaching hospital located in the 
      tropical north of Australia. Hospital B was a medium sized teaching hospital near 
      Brisbane, Queensland Australia. The effect of the intervention was examined in 
      two ways. Outcomes were compared between: 1) all patients in the pre- and post- 
      implementation periods, and 2) patients seen or not seen by the Geriatric 
      Emergency Department Intervention team in the post-implementation period. The 
      outcomes measured were disposition (discharged home, admitted); emergency 
      department length of stay; hospital length of stay; all cause in-hospital 
      mortality within 28 days; time to re-presentation up to 28 days post-discharge; 
      emergency department and in-hospital costs. Survival analyses were used for the 
      primary and secondary outcome variables and a Cox survival model was used to 
      estimate the associations between variables and outcomes. Multiple regression 
      models were used to examine other secondary outcomes whilst controlling for a 
      range of confounders. RESULTS: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention 
      was successfully translated into two different emergency departments. Both 
      demonstrated an increased likelihood of discharge, decreased emergency department 
      length of stay, decreased hospital costs for those who were admitted, with an 
      associated reduction in risk of mortality, for adults aged 70 years and over. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention was successfully 
      translated into new sites that adapted the model design. Improvement in 
      healthcare outcomes for older adults presenting to the emergency department was 
      demonstrated, although this was more subtle than in the original model setting.

TI  - Temporal Patterns of High-Spend Subgroups Can Inform Service Strategy for 
      Medicare Advantage Enrollees.
PG  - 1853-1861
LID - 10.1007/s11606-021-06912-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most healthcare costs are concentrated in a small proportion of 
      individuals with complex social, medical, behavioral, and clinical needs that are 
      poorly met by a fee-for-service healthcare system. Efforts to reduce cost in the 
      top decile have shown limited effectiveness. Understanding patient subgroups 
      within the top decile is a first step toward designing more effective and 
      targeted interventions. OBJECTIVE: Segment the top decile based on spending and 
      clinical characteristics and examine the temporal movement of individuals in and 
      out of the top decile. DESIGN: Retrospective claims data analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 
      UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollees (N = 1,504,091) continuously 
      enrolled from 2016 to 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Medical (physician, inpatient, 
      outpatient) and pharmacy claims for services submitted for third-party 
      reimbursement under Medicare Advantage, available as International Classification 
      of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and National Drug 
      Codes (NDC) claims. KEY RESULTS: The top decile was segmented into three distinct 
      subgroups characterized by different drivers of cost: (1) Catastrophic: acute 
      events (acute myocardial infarction and hip/pelvic fracture), (2) persistent: 
      medications, and (3) semi-persistent chronic conditions and frailty indicators. 
      These groups show different patterns of spending across time. Each year, 79% of 
      the catastrophic group dropped out of the top decile. In contrast, 68-70% of the 
      persistent group and 36-37% of the semi-persistent group remained in the top 
      decile year over year. These groups also show different 1-year mortality rates, 
      which are highest among semi-persistent members at 17.5-18.5%, compared to 12% 
      and 13-14% for catastrophic and persistent members, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The top decile consists of subgroups with different needs and spending patterns. 
      Interventions to reduce utilization and expenditures may show more effectiveness 
      if they account for the different characteristics and care needs of these 
      subgroups.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize Cognitive Motor Dual Task (CMDT) 
      costs for a community-based sample of older adults with Motoric Cognitive Risk 
      Syndrome (MCR), as well as investigate associations between CMDT costs and 
      cognitive performance. Twenty-five community-dwelling older adults (ages 60-89 
      years) with MCR performed single and dual task complex walking scenarios, as well 
      as a computerized cognitive testing battery. Participants with lower CMDT costs 
      had higher scores on composite measures of Working Memory, Processing Speed, and 
      Shifting, as well as an overall cognitive composite measure. In addition, 
      participants with faster single task gait velocity had higher scores on composite 
      measures of Working Memory, Processing Speed, and overall cognition. Taken 
      together, these results suggest that CMDT paradigms can help to elucidate the 
      interplay between cognitive and motor abilities for older adults with MCR.

TI  - Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: challenges in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation, renal disease and in the elderly.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.31083/j.rcm2301016 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is an increasing global 
      pandemic affecting more than 30 million individuals worldwide. Importantly, HFrEF 
      is frequently accompanied by the presence of cardiac and non-cardiac 
      comorbidities that may greatly influence the management and prognosis of the 
      disease. In this review article, we will focus on three important comorbidities 
      in HFrEF; atrial fibrillation (AF), advanced renal disease, and elderly, which 
      all have a paramount impact on progression of the disease, management strategies, 
      and response to therapy. AF is very common in HFrEF and shares many risk factors. 
      AF aggravates heart failure and contributes to HF-related adverse clinical 
      outcomes; hence it requires special consideration in HFrEF management. The kidney 
      function is largely affected by the reduced cardiac output developed in the 
      setting of HFrEF, and the neurohormonal feedback effects create a complex 
      interplay that pose challenges in the management of HFrEF when renal function is 
      significantly impaired. Cardiorenal syndrome is a challenging sequela with 
      increased morbidity and mortality thereby reflecting the delicate and complex 
      balance between the heart and the kidney in HFrEF and renal failure conditions. 
      Furthermore, patients with advanced renal failure have poor prognosis in the 
      presence of HFrEF with limited treatment options. Finally, aging and frailty are 
      important factors that influence treatment strategies in HFrEF with greater 
      emphasis on tolerability and safety of the various HFrEF therapies in elderly 
      individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Master athletes (MAs) prove that preserving a high level of physical 
      function up to very late in life is possible, but the mechanisms responsible for 
      their high function remain unclear. METHODS: We performed muscle biopsies in 15 
      octogenarian world-class track and field MAs and 14 non-athlete age/sex-matched 
      controls (NA) to provide insights into mechanisms for preserving function in 
      advanced age. Muscle samples were assessed for respiratory compromised fibers, 
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, and proteomics by liquid-chromatography 
      mass spectrometry. RESULTS: MA exhibited markedly better performance on clinical 
      function tests and greater cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis muscle. 
      Proteomics analysis revealed marked differences, where most of the ~800 
      differentially represented proteins in MA versus NA pertained to mitochondria 
      structure/function such as electron transport capacity (ETC), cristae formation, 
      mitochondrial biogenesis, and mtDNA-encoded proteins. In contrast, proteins from 
      the spliceosome complex and nuclear pore were downregulated in MA. Consistent 
      with proteomics data, MA had fewer respiratory compromised fibers, higher mtDNA 
      copy number, and an increased protein ratio of the cristae-bound ETC subunits 
      relative to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-dependent anion 
      channel. There was a substantial overlap of proteins overrepresented in MA versus 
      NA with proteins that decline with aging and that are higher in physically active 
      than sedentary individuals. However, we also found 176 proteins related to 
      mitochondria that are uniquely differentially expressed in MA. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that high function in advanced age is associated with preserving 
      mitochondrial structure/function proteins, with underrepresentation of proteins 
      involved in the spliceosome and nuclear pore complex. Whereas many of these 
      differences in MA appear related to their physical activity habits, others may 
      reflect unique biological (e.g., gene, environment) mechanisms that preserve 
      muscle integrity and function with aging. FUNDING: Funding for this study was 
      provided by operating grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 
      84408 to TT and MOP 125986 to RTH). This work was supported in part by the

AB  - Despite advances in early reperfusion and a technologic renaissance in the space 
      of Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS), Cardiogenic Shock (CS) remains the 
      leading cause of in-hospital mortality following Acute Myocardial Infarction 
      (AMI). Given the challenges inherent to conducting adequately powered randomized 
      controlled trials in this time-sensitive, hemodynamically complex, and highly 
      lethal syndrome, treatment recommendations have been derived from AMI patients 
      without shock. In this review, we aimed to (1) examine the pathophysiology and 
      the new classification system for CS; (2) provide a comprehensive, evidence-based 
      review for best practices for interventional management of AMI-CS in the cardiac 
      catheterization laboratory; and (3) highlight the concept of how frailty and 
      geriatric syndromes can be integrated into the decision process and where medical 
      futility lies in the spectrum of AMI-CS care. Management strategies in the 
      cardiac catheterization laboratory for CS include optimal vascular access, 
      periprocedural antithrombotic therapy, culprit lesion versus multi-vessel 
      revascularization, selective utilization of hemodynamic MCS tailored to 
      individual shock hemometabolic profiles, and management of cardiac arrest. 
      Efforts to advance clinical evidence for patients with CS should be concentrated 
      on (1) the coordination of multi-center registries; (2) development of pragmatic 
      clinical trials designed to evaluate innovative therapies; (3) establishment of 
      multidisciplinary care models that will inform quality care and improve clinical 
      outcomes.

TI  - Transforming primary care for older Canadians living with frailty: mixed methods 
      study protocol for a complex primary care intervention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older Canadians living with frailty are high users of healthcare 
      services; however, the healthcare system is not well designed to meet the complex 
      needs of many older adults. Older persons look to their primary care 
      practitioners to assess their needs and coordinate their care. They may need care 
      from a variety of providers and services, but often this care is not well 
      coordinated. Older adults and their family caregivers are the experts in their 
      own needs and preferences, but often do not have a chance to participate fully in 
      treatment decisions or care planning. As a result, older adults may have health 
      problems that are not properly assessed, managed or treated, resulting in poorer 
      health outcomes and higher economic and social costs. We will be implementing 
      enhanced primary healthcare approaches for older patients, including risk 
      screening, patient engagement and shared decision making and care coordination. 
      These interventions will be tailored to the needs and circumstances of the 
      primary care study sites. In this article, we describe our study protocol for 
      implementing and testing these approaches. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Nine primary 
      care sites in three Canadian provinces will participate in a multi-phase mixed 
      methods study. In phase 1, baseline information will be collected through 
      questionnaires and interviews with patients and healthcare providers (HCPs). In 
      phase 2, HCPs and patients will be consulted to tailor the evidence-based 
      interventions to site-specific needs and circumstances. In phase 3, sites will 
      implement the tailored care model. Evaluation of the care model will include 
      measures of patient and provider experience, a quality of life measure, 
      qualitative interviews and economic evaluation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This 
      study has received ethics clearance from the host academic institutions: 
      University of Calgary (REB17-0617), University of Waterloo (ORE#22446) and 
      Université Laval (#MP-13-2019-1500 and 2017-2018-12-MP). Results will be 
      disseminated through traditional means, including peer-reviewed publications and 
      conferences and through an extensive network of knowledge user partners. TRIAL

AB  - AIMS: Ageing and comorbidities are increasing frailty/complexity of heart failure 
      (HF) patients globally. We assessed evolving trends over two decades according to 
      patients' age and time of recruitment in a nationwide cardiology setting in 
      Italy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chronic HF outpatients recruited between 1999 and 
      2018 (N = 14,823) were divided into 3 cohorts: 1999-2005 (N = 5404); 2006-2011 
      (N = 3971); 2012-2018 (N = 5448). We analyzed temporal changes in clinical 
      characteristics, therapies, and outcome (1-year all-cause 
      mortality/cardiovascular hospitalization), overall and by age group: <65 
      (n = 5465); 65-79 (n = 6838); ≥80 (n = 2520) years old. Across enrolment epochs, 
      comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, obesity) increased by both 
      epoch/age groups (p < 0.001), whereas the prevalence of ischemic etiology 
      declined among patients ≥65 years (p = 0.05). Accordingly, the preserved LVEF 
      phenotype (HFpEF) increased in all age categories (p < 0.001) over time. 
      Moreover, the use of betablockers, mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists and 
      loop-diuretics rose by enrolment epoch in all age groups (p < 0.05). In parallel 
      with these epidemiologic/treatment changes, age-adjusted survival free from 
      cardiovascular hospitalization improved over time (p < 0.0001). However, 
      divergent trends in the end-point components were apparent according to age 
      groups: mortality decreased in patients<80 years, although hospitalizations 
      remained stable in the youngest group, while subjects ≥65 years were less likely 
      to be admitted for cardiovascular causes (all p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Over two 
      decades in a cardiology outpatient setting, the prevalence of comorbid HFpEF 
      increased in all age categories. Mortality improved among patients<80 years and 
      cardiovascular hospitalizations decreased in patients≥65 years. These findings 
      point to the value of cardiologist' input in the management of adult chronic HF 
      patients at all ages.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surgery in older adults with cancer is complex due to multiple age 
      related confounding factors. There are many scoring systems available for 
      preoperative risk stratifications of older patients. Currently very few 
      prospective studies comparing the various commonly used scales are available. 
      This is the first study which compares the established preoperative risk 
      assessment tools of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale (ECOG) 
      and American Society of Anaesthesiologists Physical Status Scale (ASA) with 
      frailty scores of Modified Frailty Index (MFI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of older patients 
      with cancer who underwent oncosurgery in a tertiary cancer centre during the 
      one-year study period. Patients were scored on the CFS, MFI, ASA and ECOG scales. 
      All patients were followed up for 30 days immediately following surgery and their 
      post operative complications were documented. Univariate and multivariate 
      analyses were done and a p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: Of the 820 patients studied, 15.6% had prolonged hospital 
      stay, 9.1% had 30-day morbidity, 0.7% had readmission, and mortality was 1.1%. 
      High-risk scores on the ASA and CFS were significantly associated with prolonged 
      postoperative stay, readmission, morbidity, and mortality (p < 0.05). High-risk 
      scores on the ECOG was significantly associated with prolonged hospital stay 
      (p = 0.027), 30-day morbidity (p = 0.003), and mortality (p = 0.001), but not 
      with readmission. There was no significant association between MFI score and the 
      postoperative variables studied (p > 0.05). On multivariate analysis, morbidity 
      was significantly associated only with male gender (p = 0.015), higher cancer 
      stage (p = 0.005), higher ASA score (p = 0.029), and prolonged hospital stay 
      (p = 0.001). Mortality was significantly associated only with emergency surgery 
      (p = 0.012) and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.004), and prolonged hospital stay 
      was significantly associated with advanced cancer stage (p = 0.001) and emergency 
      surgery (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In older patients undergoing cancer surgery, ASA 
      and CFS are predictors of prolonged postoperative stay, morbidity, mortality, and 
      readmission. A high-risk ECOG score is predictive of prolonged post operative 
      stay, 30-day morbidity, and mortality, but not of readmission. Score on MFI is 
      not a predictor of postoperative outcomes. Newer predictive tools which include 
      cancer- specific factors are required for better management of these patients.

TI  - From research to bedside: Incorporation of a CGA-based frailty index among 
      multiple comanagement services.
PG  - 90-98
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17446 [doi]
AB  - The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the core tool used by 
      geriatricians across diverse clinical settings to identify vulnerabilities and 
      estimate physiologic reserve in older adults. In this paper, we demonstrate the 
      iterative process at our institution to identify and develop a feasible, 
      acceptable, and sustainable bedside CGA-based frailty index tool (FI-CGA) that 
      not only quantifies and grades frailty but also provides a uniform way to 
      efficiently communicate complex geriatric concepts such as reserve and 
      vulnerability with other teams. We describe our incorporation of the FI-CGA into 
      the electronic health record (EHR) and dissemination among clinical services. We 
      demonstrate that an increasing number of patients have documented FI-CGA in their 
      initial assessment from 2018 to 2020, while additional comanagement services were 
      established (Figure 2). The acceptability and sustainability of the FI-CGA, and 
      its routine use by geriatricians in our division, were demonstrated by a survey 
      where the majority of clinicians report using the FI-CGA when assessing a new 
      patient and that the FI-CGA informs their clinical management. Finally, we 
      demonstrate how we refined and updated the FI-CGA, we provide examples of 
      applications of the FI-CGA across the institution and describe areas of ongoing 
      process improvement and challenges for the use of this tailored yet standardized 
      tool across diverse inpatient and outpatient services. The process outlined can 
      be used by other geriatric departments to introduce and incorporate an FI-CGA.

TI  - Implementation of the frailty assessment to improve liver transplant outcomes.
PG  - 1919-1923

AB  - The majority of patients undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) have 
      increased in age, therefore chronological age may have become an unreliable 
      parameter for supporting clinical decisions. The age-related deficit accumulation 
      model measuring frailty proposed by Rockwood et al., may propose an alternative 
      in providing an estimate of an individual's biological age. No Frailty Index (FI) 
      tailored specifically for OLT patients exists to date. Forty-three consecutive 
      OLT patients with ≥ 20 years of survival with a functioning graft were included 
      in our study. The FI was computed taking to account 39 items (FI-39), meeting the 
      standard criteria for internal validation. Endpoints were polypharmacy, and 
      recent Emergency Room admission. The mean age of our population was 69 (sd 9) 
      years. The mean FI-39 was 0.23 (sd 0.1). The FI-39 was associated with 
      polypharmacy [odds ratio (OR) 1.13; Confidence interval (95%CI) 1.03-1.24; 
      p = 0.01], and recent Emergency Room admission [beta coefficient + 1.98; 
      95%CI + 0.26, + 3.70; p = 0.03], independent for age and sex. This study 
      demonstrates that an FI can be derived from data collected during routine 
      clinical follow-up and allows for improved differentiation related to the OLT 
      clinical complexity in OLT patients, independent of chronological age. This may 
      lead to the adoption of FI-39 to improve personalized OLT patient care.

TI  - Closing the Gap between Inpatient and Outpatient Settings: Integrating Pulmonary 
      Rehabilitation and Technological Advances in the Comprehensive Management of 
      Frail Patients.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159150 [doi]

AB  - Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a well-established intervention supported by 
      strong evidence that is used to treat patients affected by chronic respiratory 
      diseases. However, several barriers still affect its spreading in rehabilitation 
      clinical practices. Although chronic respiratory diseases are common age-related 
      disorders, there is still a gap of knowledge regarding the implementation of 
      sustainable strategies integrating PR in the rehabilitation management of frail 
      patients at high risk of respiratory complications. Therefore, in the present 
      study, we characterized the effects of PR in frail patients, highlighting the 
      evidence supporting its role in improving the complex rehabilitative management 
      of these patients. Moreover, we propose a novel organizational model promoting PR 
      programs for frail patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Our model 
      emphasizes the role of interdisciplinary care, specifically tailored to patients 
      and environmental characteristics. In this scenario, cutting-edge technology and 
      telemedicine solutions might be implemented as safe and sustainable strategies 
      filling the gap between inpatient and outpatient settings. Future research should 
      focus on large-scale sustainable interventions to improve the quality of life and 
      global health of frail patients. Moreover, evidence-based therapeutic paths 
      should be promoted and taught in training courses promoting multiprofessional PR 
      knowledge to increase awareness and better address its delivery in frail 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research into oral health care for older people has shown that dental 
      care in general decreases with increasing age and frailty and, therefore, oral 
      health care provision may be complex. The aim of this study is to identify the 
      oral health care dentists provide to community-dwelling older people and which 
      barriers they experience in doing this. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a 
      representative sample of dentists in the Netherlands was asked to prospectively 
      select one older patient and describe this patient using a specially developed 
      registration form; the patient was requested to fill out a questionnaire. The 
      relationship between experienced barriers in providing oral health care to older 
      patients and characteristics of the dentists and the patients was studied by 
      means univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In 
      total, 923 dentists were asked to participate in the study. Data were available 
      for 39.4% dentist-patient pairs. In most cases (87.4%), oral health care was 
      focussed on conservation of the dentition. In all, 14.0% of the dentists 
      experienced barriers in providing oral health care for older people. Some patient 
      factors increase the risk of experiencing barriers, eg, the more difficult 
      behaviour of older patients and the greater disease burden. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 
      health care was mostly focussed on conservation of the dentition, and dentists 
      especially experience barriers in oral health provision to older patients if they 
      are already frail.

AB  - The aims of the present study were to estimate the frequency of change in 
      self-rated health (SRH) among community-dwelling older adults, between two 
      measures taken at a 9-year interval; and determine factors associated with a 
      decline and an improvement in SRH, in relation to aspects of physical/emotional 
      health and subjective wellbeing. Data were derived from a community-based study 
      on frailty among Brazilian elderly. Associations were investigated using 
      Pearson's chi-square test and relative risk ratios were estimated using 
      multinomial logistic regression analysis. 39.3% of participants did not change 
      their SRH at both assessment times, 21.7% rated it as worse and 39.0% rated it as 
      better. The relative risk ratio of an improvement in SRH for individuals with 
      disability in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) was lower than for 
      individuals with independence in basic ADLs (IRR=0.22; IC95%: 0.08-0.63). 
      Understanding the complex interactions between self-rated health and the 
      dimensions that influence the improvement of health perception may shed light on 
      key determinants of the wellbeing among older adults.

TI  - Is dental education meeting the oral health needs of older adults?
PG  - 1233-1241
LID - 10.1002/jdd.13026 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this article is to highlight the importance of promoting oral health 
      for the geriatric population and implementing change to address their complex 
      oral and systemic health needs. Oral healthcare providers are unequipped to meet 
      the demanding oral health needs of the aging population, resulting in a geriatric 
      oral health crisis that needs immediate attention and action. Despite the 
      advancements in geriatric education over the last two decades, the geriatric 
      curriculum in 2022 is still inadequate, and varies greatly among different US 
      dental schools for both pre- and postdoctoral programs. Predoctoral students are 
      graduating without being sufficiently trained to identify and treat the dental 
      issues of older adults due to lack of a purposely planned curriculum with 
      balanced didactic and clinical exposure. It is critical to have a trained and 
      competent workforce that meets the oral health needs of current and future older 
      adults. To change the present environment, there is a need for curriculum 
      redesign, faculty development, and training. In addition, more research to 
      evaluate pre- and postdoctoral geriatric dentistry curricula, their impact on 
      increasing access to care, and the likelihood of graduating dentists competent to 
      treat functionally dependent and frail older adults is needed. Furthermore, 
      decision-makers in dental education, national dental organizations, and 
      government institutions must support policies that integrate oral health into 
      overall health through robust reimbursement mechanisms, including a dental 
      benefit in Medicare, and recognition of geriatric dentistry as a specialty.

TI  - New horizons in evidence-based care for older people: individual participant data 
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afac090 [doi]
LID - afac090
AB  - Evidence-based decisions on clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions are 
      ideally informed by meta-analyses of intervention trial data. However, when 
      undertaken, such meta-analyses in ageing research have typically been conducted 
      using standard methods whereby summary (aggregate) data are extracted from 
      published trial reports. Although meta-analysis of aggregate data can provide 
      useful insights into the average effect of interventions within a selected trial 
      population, it has limitations regarding robust conclusions on which subgroups of 
      people stand to gain the greatest benefit from an intervention or are at risk of 
      experiencing harm. Future evidence synthesis using individual participant data 
      from ageing research trials for meta-analysis could transform understanding of 
      the effectiveness of interventions for older people, supporting evidence-based 
      and sustainable commissioning. A major advantage of individual participant data 
      meta-analysis (IPDMA) is that it enables examination of characteristics that 
      predict treatment effects, such as frailty, disability, cognitive impairment, 
      ethnicity, gender and other wider determinants of health. Key challenges of IPDMA 
      relate to the complexity and resources needed for obtaining, managing and 
      preparing datasets, requiring a meticulous approach involving experienced 
      researchers, frequently with expertise in designing and analysing clinical 
      trials. In anticipation of future IPDMA work in ageing research, we are 
      establishing an international Ageing Research Trialists collective, to bring 
      together trialists with a common focus on transforming care for older people as a 
      shared ambition across nations.

TI  - Do Interventions Reducing Social Vulnerability Improve Health in Community 
      Dwelling Older Adults? A Systematic Review.
PG  - 447-465
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S349836 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social vulnerability occurs when individuals have been relatively 
      disadvantaged by the social determinants of health. Complex interventions that 
      reduce social vulnerability have the potential to improve health in older adults 
      but robust evidence is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify, appraise and synthesize 
      evidence on the effectiveness of complex interventions targeting reduction in 
      social vulnerability for improving health related outcomes (mortality, function, 
      cognition, subjective health and healthcare use) in older adults living in the 
      community. METHODS: A mixed methods systematic review was conducted. Five 
      databases and targeted grey literature were searched for primary studies of all 
      study types according to predetermined criteria. Data were extracted from each 
      distinct intervention and quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal 
      Tool. Effectiveness data were synthesized using vote counting by direction of 
      effect, combining p values and Albatross plots. RESULTS: Across 38 included 
      studies, there were 34 distinct interventions categorized as strengthening social 
      supports and communities, helping older adults and their caregivers navigate 
      health and social services, enhancing neighbourhood and built environments, 
      promoting education and providing economic stability. There was evidence to 
      support positive influences on function, cognition, subjective health, and 
      reduced hospital utilization. The evidence was mixed for non-hospital healthcare 
      utilization and insufficient to determine effect on mortality. CONCLUSION: 
      Despite high heterogeneity and varying quality of studies, attention to reducing 
      an older adult's social vulnerability assists in improving older adults' health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of sarcopenia is complex and multifactorial; 
      however, it has not yet been fully elucidated. Identifying metabolomic profiles 
      may help clarify the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia. OBJECTIVE: This pilot 
      study explored potential noninvasive biomarkers of severe sarcopenia through 
      metabolomic analysis in community-dwelling older men. METHODS: Twenty older men 
      (mean age: 81.9 ± 2.8 years) were selected from the Korean Frailty and Aging 
      Cohort Study. Participants with severe sarcopenia (n = 10) were compared with 
      non-sarcopenic, age- and body mass index-matched controls (n = 10). Severe 
      sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass, low muscle strength, and low physical 
      performance using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. 
      Non-targeted metabolomic profiling of plasma metabolites was performed using 
      capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry and absolute 
      quantification was performed in target metabolites. RESULTS: Among 191 plasma 
      metabolic peaks, the concentrations of 10 metabolites significantly differed 
      between severe sarcopenia group and non-sarcopenic controls. The plasma 
      concentrations of L-alanine, homocitrulline, N-acetylserine, gluconic acid, 
      N-acetylalanine, proline, and sulfotyrosine were higher, while those of 
      4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and tryptophan were lower 
      in participants with severe sarcopenia than in non-sarcopenic controls (all, 
      p < 0.05). Among the 53 metabolites quantified as target metabolites, L-alanine 
      (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.760; 
      p = 0.049), gluconic acid (AUC = 0.800; p = 0.023), proline (AUC = 0.785; 
      p = 0.031), and tryptophan (AUC = 0.800; p = 0.023) determined the presence of 
      severe sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma metabolomic analysis demonstrated that 
      L-alanine, gluconic acid, proline, and tryptophan may be potential biomarkers of 
      severe sarcopenia. The identified metabolites can provide new insights into the 
      underlying pathophysiology of severe sarcopenia and serve as the basis for 
      preventive interventions.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of Luminor™ balloon and Angiolite™ stent on TASC C/D tibial 
      occlusive lesions in CLI patients: 12-month results. The MERLION trial.
PG  - 335-344
LID - 10.23736/S0392-9590.21.04690-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of MERLION (NCT04073121) was to evaluate the outcomes of the 
      mono or combination therapy of the iVascular Luminor™ drug-coated balloon (DCB) 
      and Angiolite™ drug-eluting stent for treatment of TASC II C/D tibial occlusive 
      lesions in Asian patients presenting with chronic limb threatening ischemia 
      (CLTI) from Singapore. METHODS: MERLION was a prospective, non-randomized, single 
      arm, observational, multicenter clinical study. Complication-free survival at one 
      month was the safety endpoint. Immediate technical success, 12-month primary 
      vessel patency, limb salvage, freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) 
      and amputation free survival (AFS) were the efficacy endpoints of interest. 
      RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. There were 32 males (64% males; mean age 
      66.4±8.9 years). Majority were Rutherford 5 severity (41/50; 82%). Co-morbidities 
      included diabetes mellitus (47/50; 94.0%), end-stage renal failure (25/50; 
      50.0%), and hypertension (44/50; 88%). 66 atherosclerotic lesions were treated 
      (47 de novo and 19 restenotic; 60.6% TASC C and 39.4% TASC D). Mean lesion length 
      treated was 13.7±9.5 cm. There was 100% technical success. There were 3/66 (4.5%) 
      bailout stenting for severe flow limiting dissections. Twelve-month primary 
      tibial patency was 34/49 (69.4%) and freedom from TLR was 40/49 (81.5%). AFS was 
      74.0% (37/50). At 12 months, mean Rutherford scores improved from 100% 
      (Rutherford score >3) at baseline to 31% at 12 months (P<0.05) and wound healing 
      rate was 65.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The iVascular Luminor™ DCB is safe and efficacious 
      in treating highly complex infra-popliteal atherosclerotic lesions in an 
      otherwise challenging frail population of CLTI patients from Singapore.

TI  - Barriers to and facilitators of ethical encounters at the end of life in a 
      nursing home: an ethnographic study.
PG  - 134
LID - 10.1186/s12904-022-01024-0 [doi]
LID - 134
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among a growing population of older persons, many affected by 
      multiple diseases and complex needs, are cared for in nursing homes. Previous 
      studies of nursing homes have highlighted the importance of personalised 
      palliative care. Nevertheless, we know little about whether everyday care 
      practice involving assistant nurses and frail older persons accomplishes ethical 
      encounters, especially in assisted bodily care. Therefore, the aim of this study 
      was to understand and conceptualize the encounter between residents and assistant 
      nurses in bodily care-situations at the end of life in a nursing home. METHODS: 
      Focused ethnographic design was used. Residents and assistant nurses from one 
      nursing home in an urban Swedish area participated in this study. Data were 
      collected for 6 months and consisted of 170 h of fieldwork, including participant 
      observation and interviews. Observations and digitally recorded interviews were 
      analysed thematically. Five public community stakeholders contributed to the 
      analysis by discussing preliminary results and clinical implications in a focus 
      group. RESULTS: Four themes, each encompassing both barriers to and facilitators 
      of ethical encounters in assisted bodily care, were identified: Coping with the 
      impact of workplace demands; Interacting in dialogue and communication; 
      Experiencing involvement in the provision of assisted bodily care; and Adapting 
      to good care and comfort. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that accomplishing 
      ethical encounters in assisted bodily care practice in a nursing home context has 
      many barriers that are related to communication, relationships, and quality of 
      care. Barriers included lack of resources, ineffective communication, and work 
      values, which hinder ethical encounters. Nevertheless, moral sensitivity, genuine 
      interest in resident engagement, and collaborative practices facilitated ethical 
      encounters and are thus central to person-centred care. Uniquely, assistant 
      nurses must be aware of their responsibility for performing their tasks in 
      response to residents' vulnerability. We therefore suggest that moral 
      deliberation over issues of communication, compassion, decision-making, and 
      behavior, with particular consideration for the care relationship. To further 
      improve the quality of care, organisations must provide resources for the 
      building of relationships, as well as time for assistant nurses to recover after 
      long shifts. Additional research is warranted, including implementation of 
      ethically grounded palliative care.

TI  - World's First Experience Treating TASC II C and D Tibial Occlusive Disease Using 
      the Selution SLR Sirolimus-Eluting Balloon: Six-Month Results From the PRESTIGE 
      Study.
PG  - 555-566
LID - 10.1177/15266028211007457 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The performance of sirolimus-coated devices has not been studied in 
      patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia patients. PRESTIGE aims to 
      investigate the 6-month efficacy and safety profile of the Selution Sustained 
      Limus Release (SLR) sirolimus-eluting balloon for treatment of TASC II C and D 
      tibial occlusive lesions in patients with CLTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRESTIGE 
      is a pilot prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm, multi-investigator, 
      single-center clinical study. Endpoints were adverse event-free survival at 1 
      month, technical success rate, primary tibial patency at 6 months, limb salvage 
      success, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and amputation free survival 
      (AFS). RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were included. There were 17 (68.0%) 
      males; mean age, 63.7±9.73 years. CLTI severity was based on the Rutherford scale 
      (R5=25/25; 100.0%). Significant comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (n=22; 
      88.0%) and end-stage renal failure (n=11; 44.0%). A total of 33 atherosclerotic 
      lesions were treated (TASC II D=15 (45.5%)). Mean lesion length treated was 
      191±111 mm. Technical success was 100%. Primary tibial patency at 6 months was 
      22/27 (81.5%) and freedom from clinically driven TLR was 25/30 (83.3%). AFS was 
      21/25 (84.0%; 3 deaths and 1 major lower extremity amputation). Mean Rutherford 
      score improved from 5.00 at baseline to 1.14±2.10 (p<0.05) at 6 months. There was 
      a wound healing rate of 13/22 (59.1%) and 17/21 (81.0%) at 3 and 6 months 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Selution SLR drug-eluting balloon is a safe and 
      efficacious modality in treating complex tibial arterial occlusive lesions in 
      what is an otherwise frail cohort of CLTI patients, with a high prevalence of 
      diabetes and end-stage renal failure. Technical and clinical success rates are 
      high and 6-month target lesion patency and AFS are more than satisfactory.

TI  - The Hospital Frailty Risk Score is Not an Accurate Predictor of Treatment Costs 
      for Total Joint Replacement Patients in a Medicare Bundled Payment Population.
PG  - 2658-2664.e2
LID - S0883-5403(21)00332-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arth.2021.03.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medically complex patients require more resources and experience 
      higher costs within total joint arthroplasty (TJA) bundled payment models. While 
      risk adjustment would be beneficial for such patients, no tool currently exists 
      which can reliably identify these patients preoperatively. The purpose of this 
      study is to determine if the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a valid 
      predictor of high-TJA treatment costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was 
      performed on patients who underwent primary TJA between 2015 and 2020 from a 
      single large orthopedic practice. ICD-10 codes from an institutional database 
      were used to calculate HFRS. Cost data including inpatient, postacute, and 
      episode of care (EOC) costs were collected. Charlson comorbidity index, 
      demographics, readmissions, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: 4936 
      patients had a calculable HFRS and those with intermediate and high scores 
      experienced more frequent readmissions/complications after TJA, as well as higher 
      EOC costs. However, HFRS did not reliably predict EOC costs, yielding a 
      sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 66%. Multivariate analysis revealed that 
      both patient age and sex are superior individual cost predictors when compared 
      with HFRS. Secondary analyses indicated that HFRS more effectively predicts TJA 
      complications and readmissions but is still nonideal for clinical applications. 
      CONCLUSION: HFRS has poor sensitivity as a predictor of high-EOC costs for TJA 
      patients but has adequate specificity for predicting postoperative readmissions 
      and complications. Further research is needed to develop a scale that can 
      appropriately predict orthopedic cost outcomes.

TI  - Refocusing dental care: A risk-based preventative oral health programme for 
      dentate older people in UK care homes.
PG  - 131-138
LID - 10.1111/ger.12543 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence for managing the risk of dental caries, 
      notably dose-dependent use of fluoride based on risk. Specific guidance is 
      lacking on higher fluoride use in older people in care homes and prevention is 
      often omitted from dental care plans. OBJECTIVES: To introduce a risk-based 
      preventative approach to existing routine dental care for older people in care 
      homes. METHODS: Three mixed residential and nursing care homes for the frail and 
      elder (>65 years) were selected to participate. All residents were risk assessed 
      based on dependency, dentition status and self-care abilities and consequently 
      placed on the appropriate evidence-based intervention (2800 ppm high dose 
      fluoride toothpaste and/or quarterly fluoride varnish placement). Full mouth 
      ICDAS dental examinations were completed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. 
      RESULTS: At baseline, 127 risk assessments were completed in which most dentate 
      residents (58.2%, n = 74) were assessed as Risk Level 2/3 (mod/high) whilst 
      edentulous residents were all Risk Level 1 (low) (41.7%, n = 53). Only 13 (26.5%) 
      of the 49 eligible residents completed the 12-month preventative programme. There 
      was a significant difference in root caries (P < .0001), with 17 (51.5%) root 
      lesions changing from active at baseline to arrested at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The findings provide early indication of fluoride efficacy, especially on root 
      caries in this vulnerable group, and highlight the challenges of delivering 
      programme's in these complex, changing environments.

TI  - Gap in Willingness and Access to Video Visit Use Among Older High-risk Veterans: 
      Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e32570
LID - 10.2196/32570 [doi]
LID - e32570
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent shift to video care has exacerbated disparities in health 
      care access, especially among high-need, high-risk (HNHR) adults. Developing 
      data-driven approaches to improve access to care necessitates a deeper 
      understanding of HNHR adults' attitudes toward telemedicine and technology 
      access. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the willingness, access, and 
      ability of HNHR veterans to use telemedicine for health care. METHODS: WWe 
      designed a questionnaire conducted via mail or telephone or in person. Among HNHR 
      veterans who were identified using predictive modeling with national Veterans 
      Affairs data, we assessed willingness to use video visits for health care, access 
      to necessary equipment, and comfort with using technology. We evaluated physical 
      health, including frailty, physical function, performance of activities of daily 
      living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL); mental health; and social needs, 
      including Area Deprivation Index, transportation, social support, and social 
      isolation. RESULTS: The average age of the 602 HNHR veteran respondents was 70.6 
      (SD 9.2; range 39-100) years; 99.7% (600/602) of the respondents were male, 61% 
      (367/602) were White, 36% (217/602) were African American, 17.3% (104/602) were 
      Hispanic, 31.2% (188/602) held at least an associate degree, and 48.2% (290/602) 
      were confident filling medical forms. Of the 602 respondents, 327 (54.3%) 
      reported willingness for video visits, whereas 275 (45.7%) were unwilling. 
      Willing veterans were younger (P<.001) and more likely to have an associate 
      degree (P=.002), be health literate (P<.001), live in socioeconomically 
      advantaged neighborhoods (P=.048), be independent in IADLs (P=.02), and be in 
      better physical health (P=.04). A higher number of those willing were able to use 
      the internet and email (P<.001). Of the willing veterans, 75.8% (248/327) had a 
      video-capable device. Those with video-capable technology were younger (P=.004), 
      had higher health literacy (P=.01), were less likely to be African American 
      (P=.007), were more independent in ADLs (P=.005) and IADLs (P=.04), and were more 
      adept at using the internet and email than those without the needed technology 
      (P<.001). Age, confidence in filling forms, general health, and internet use were 
      significantly associated with willingness to use video visits. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Approximately half of the HNHR respondents were unwilling for video visits and a 
      quarter of those willing lacked requisite technology. The gap between those 
      willing and without requisite technology is greater among older, less health 
      literate, African American veterans; those with worse physical health; and those 
      living in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our study 
      highlights that HNHR veterans have complex needs, which risk being exacerbated by 
      the video care shift. Although technology holds vast potential to improve health 
      care access, certain vulnerable populations are less likely to engage, or have 
      access to, technology. Therefore, targeted interventions are needed to address 
      this inequity, especially among HNHR older adults.

TI  - Patients' Perceptions of Integrated Care Among Medicare Beneficiaries by Level of 
      Need for Health Services.
PG  - 640-649
LID - 10.1177/10775587211067897 [doi]
AB  - Requirements for integrating care across providers, settings, and over time 
      increase with patients' needs. Health care providers' ability to offer care that 
      patients experience as integrated may vary among patients with different levels 
      of need. We explore the variation in patients' perceptions of integrated care 
      among Medicare beneficiaries based on the beneficiary's level of need using 
      ordinary least square regression for each of four high-need groups: beneficiaries 
      (a) with complex chronic conditions, (b) with frailties, (c) below 65 with 
      disability, and (d) with any (of the first three) high needs. We control for 
      beneficiary demographics and other factors affecting integrated care, and we 
      conduct sensitivity analyses controlling for multiple individual chronic 
      conditions. We find significant positive associations with level of need for 
      provider support for self-directed care and medication and home health 
      management. Controlling for multiple individual chronic conditions reduces effect 
      sizes and number of significant relationships.

TI  - Individualized Medication Review in Older People with Multimorbidity: A 
      Comparative Analysis between Patients Living at Home and in a Nursing Home.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19063423 [doi]
LID - 3423
AB  - (1) Background: aging is associated with complex and dynamic changes leading to 
      multimorbidity and, therefore, polypharmacy. A periodic medication review (MR) in 
      frail older people leads to optimizing medication use. The aims of the study were 
      to perform a comparative analysis of the impact of place of residence (own home 
      versus nursing home) in a cohort of older patients on the characteristics of the 
      baseline therapeutic plan and characteristics of the therapeutic plan after an 
      MR; (2) Methods: Study with paired pre- and post-MR data based on person-centred 
      prescription, with a follow-up assessment at three months. Patients who lived 
      either in their own home or in a nursing home were recruited. We selected 
      patients of 65 years or more with multimorbidity whose General Practitioner 
      identified difficulties with the prescription management and the need for an MR. 
      Each patient's treatment was analysed by applying the Patient-Centred 
      Prescription (PCP) model; (3) Results: 428 patients. 90% presented at least one 
      inappropriate prescription (IP) in both settings. In nursing homes, a higher 
      number of implemented optimization proposals was detected (81.6% versus 65.7% (p 
      &lt; 0.001)). After the MR, nursing-home patients had a greater decrease in their 
      mean number of medications, polypharmacy prevalence, therapeutic complexity, and 
      monthly drug expenditure (p &lt; 0.001); (4) Conclusions: PCP model detected a 
      high number of IP in both settings. However, after an individualized MR, 
      nursing-home patients presented a greater decrease in some pharmacological 
      parameters related to adverse events, such as polypharmacy and therapeutic 
      complexity, compared to those living at home. Nursing homes may be regarded as a 
      highly suitable scenario to carry out a periodic MR, due to its high prevalence 
      of frail people and its feasibility to apply the recommendations of an MR. 
      Prospective studies with a robust design should be performed to demonstrate this 
      quasi-experimental study along with a longitudinal follow-up on clinical 
      outcomes.

TI  - The role of the Sunfrail tool in the screening of frailty and in integrated

PG  - 419-427
LID - 10.1007/s40520-021-01931-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most problematic expression of ageing is frailty, and an 
      approach based on its early identification is mandatory. The Sunfrail-tool (ST), 
      a 9-item questionnaire, is a promising instrument for screening frailty. AIMS: To 
      assess the diagnostic accuracy and the construct validity between the ST and a 
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), composed by six tests representative of 
      the bio-psycho-social model of frailty; To verify the discriminating power of 
      five key-questions of the ST; To investigate the role of the ST in a 
      clinical-pathway of falls' prevention. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we 
      enrolled 235 patients from the Frailty-Multimorbidity Lab of the 
      University-Hospital of Parma. The STs' answers were obtained from the patient's 
      clinical information. A patient was considered frail if at least one of the CGAs' 
      tests resulted positive. RESULTS: The ST was associated with the CGA's judgement 
      with an Area Under the Curve of 0.691 (CI 95%: 0.591-0.791). Each CGA's test was 
      associated with the ST total score. The five key-question showed a potential 
      discriminating power in the CGA's tests of the corresponding domains. The 
      fall-related question of the ST was significantly associated with the Short 
      Physical Performance Battery total score (OR: 0.839, CI 95%: 0.766-0.918), a 
      proxy of the risk of falling. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the ST can 
      capture the complexity of frailty. The ST showed a good discriminating power, and 
      it can guide a second-level assessment to key frailty domains and/or clinical 
      pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The ST is a valid and easy-to-use instrument for the 
      screening of frailty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frail elderly are at high risk of hospitalizations and have a complex 
      pattern of risk factors that makes it hard to foresee potential needs for 
      additional treatment and care. Machine learning algorithms are potentially 
      well-suited to discover hidden patterns in registrations that are routinely made 
      across sectors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors and performance of machine 
      learning algorithms designed to predict acute hospitalizations in elderly 
      recipients of home care services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A development study 
      based on a retrospective social sector cohort with 1,282 participants was 
      designed. Included subjects were aged 65 or older and received home care services 
      in Aalborg Municipality at least once a week from 1/1-2016 to 31/12-2017. Data 
      were collected from a newly developed triage tool in combination with 
      administrative and clinical data routinely collected in the Danish healthcare and 
      social care sector. 857 predictors were tested and evaluated based on the area 
      under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC). The data was divided into a 70/30 
      training and test split with 5-fold cross-validation. A sliding window approach 
      combining random under-sampling with a boosting algorithm (RUSBoost) was applied 
      with a standard logistic regression included for comparison. RESULTS: The 
      logistic regression achieved a PR-AUC of 0.01 (CI 0.00; 0.01) while the PR-AUC 
      was 0.71 (CI 0.56; 0.76) for the RUSBoost algorithm. Four of the five most 
      important citizen-level features used to accurately predict an acute 
      hospitalization was the total number of services provided by the municipality to 
      the citizen, the number of personal care registrations as well as number of 
      medication handlings and nutritional registrations. A final important predictor 
      was the number of physical complaints derived from the triage tool. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Municipalities routinely collect valuable administrative and clinical data that 
      can be used for early prediction of acute hospitalizations. However, future 
      studies are needed to validate the results.

TI  - Dignity in bodily care at the end of life in a nursing home: an ethnographic 
      study.
PG  - 593

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nursing homes (NHs) are populated by the frailest older people who 
      have multiple physical or mental conditions and palliative care needs that may 
      convey the violation of dignity. Although dignity is a commonly used concept and 
      a core value of end-of-life care, it is assumed to be complex, ambiguous, and 
      multivalent. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore aspects of dignity in 
      older persons' everyday lives in a NH. DESIGN: A focused ethnographic study 
      design. METHODS: Data consisted of 170 h of fieldwork, including observations 
      (n = 39) with residents (n = 19) and assistant nurses (n = 22) in a Swedish NH. 
      Interviews were undertaken with residents several times (in total, n = 35, mean 
      70 min/resident). To study dignity and dignity-related concerns, we used the 
      Chochinov model of dignity to direct the deductive analysis. RESULTS: The study 
      showed that residents suffered from illness-related concerns that inhibited their 
      possibilities to live a dignified life at the NH. Their failing bodies were the 
      most significant threat to their dignity, as loss of abilities was constantly 
      progressing. Together with a fear of becoming more dependent, this caused 
      feelings of agony, loneliness, and meaninglessness. The most dignity-conserving 
      repertoire came from within themselves. Their self-knowledge had provided them 
      with tools to distinguish what was still possible from what they just had to 
      accept. Socially, the residents' dignity depended on assistant nurses' routines 
      and behaviour. Their dignity was violated by long waiting times, lack of 
      integrity in care, deteriorating routines, and also by distanced and sometimes 
      harsh encounters with assistant nurses. Because the residents cherished autonomy 
      and self-determination, while still needing much help, these circumstances placed 
      them in a vulnerable situation. CONCLUSIONS: According to residents' narratives, 
      important dignity-conserving abilities came from within themselves. 
      Dignity-conserving interventions did occur, such as emphatic listening and bodily 
      care, performed in respect for residents' preferences. However, no strategies for 
      future crises or preparing for death were observed. To protect residents' 
      dignity, NHs must apply a palliative care approach to provide holistic care that 
      comprises attention to personal, bodily, social, spiritual, and psychological 
      needs to increase well-being and prevent suffering.

      people-often frail and subject to multimorbidity-are at the highest risk for the 
      severe and fatal disease. Despite strict infection control and social distancing 
      measures, frail adults in long-term care facilities may be at particular risk of 
      transmission of respiratory illness. Treatment decisions are often complex 
      attributed to the heterogeneity of this population with regards to different 
      geriatric domains such as functional status, comorbidity, and poly-pharmacy. 
      While measures must be taken to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading 
      through these facilities, it is also essential that residents with coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) have access to the symptom management and support they 
      want and deserve. What most nursing home residents want during the course of 
      their illness is to be able to stay in their facilities, to be surrounded by the 
      people they love most, and to feel relief from their physical and emotional pain. 
      By addressing the limited access to hospice and palliative care delivery in 
      nursing homes, we can prevent unnecessary suffering and pain from COVID-19 as 
      well as lay the groundwork for improving care for all residents moving forward.

TI  - The Syncope-Falls Index: a tool for predicting risk of syncope and complex falls 
      in the older adult based on cumulative health deficits.
PG  - 367-373
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcab141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Syncope is aetiologically diverse and associated with adverse 
      outcomes; in older people, there is clinical overlap with complex falls 
      presentations (i.e. recurrent, unexplained and/or injurious). AIM: To formulate 
      an index to predict future risk of syncope and falls in the Irish longitudinal 
      study on ageing (TILDA). DESIGN/METHODS: Using the frailty index methodology, we 
      selected, from TILDA Wave 1 (2010), 40 deficits that might increase risk of 
      syncope and falls. This syncope-falls index (SYFI) was applied to TILDA Wave 1 
      participants aged 65 and over, who were divided into three risk groups (low, 
      intermediate and high) based on SYFI tertiles. Multivariate logistic regression 
      models were used to investigate, controlling for age and sex, how SYFI groups 
      predicted incident syncope, complex falls and simple falls occurring up to Wave 4 
      of the study (2016). RESULTS: At Wave 1, there were 3499 participants (mean age 
      73, 53% women). By Wave 4, of the remaining 2907 participants, 185 (6.4%) had 
      reported new syncope, 1077 (37.0%) complex falls and 218 (7.5%) simple falls. The 
      risk of both syncope and complex falls increased along the SYFI groups (high risk 
      group: odds ratio 1.88 [1.26-2.80], P = 0.002 for syncope; 2.22 [1.82-2.72], 
      P < 0.001 for complex falls). No significant relationship was identified between 
      SYFI and simple falls. CONCLUSION: The 6-year incidences of falls and syncope 
      were high in this cohort. SYFI could help identify older adults at risk of 
      syncope and complex falls, and thus facilitate early referral to specialist 
      clinics to improve outcomes.

TI  - Revision rate is higher in patients with periprosthetic femur fractures following 
      revision arthroplasty in comparison with ORIF following our algorithm: a 
      two-center 1 analysis of 129 patients.
PG  - 1913-1918

AB  - PURPOSE: Effective therapy of periprosthetic femur fractures of the hip (PPF) are 
      challenging due to patients' frailty and complexity of fracture patterns. The aim 
      of this cohort study was to analyze the radiological and functional outcome 
      following PPF. METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter study in the period 
      2009-2019 of patients with PPF at two level I trauma centers in Germany was 
      performed. PPF were classified according to the Vancouver classification system. 
      Demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, 
      type of surgery, complications, and reoperation rate were obtained from patient 
      records. The functional outcome was assessed by the modified Harris-Hip Score 
      (mHHS), general health using the EQ-5D, and radiological outcome by Beals & Tower 
      (B&T) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients with a mean age of 79 years 
      (range 43-102) were included. 70% of all patients were female and 68% of the 
      patients had an ASA score ≥ 3. 20 patients suffered from a Vancouver A, 90 from a 
      Vancouver B and 19 from a Vancouver C fracture. 14% of the patients died within 
      the first 2 years after surgery. The reoperation rate after open reduction and 
      internal fixation (ORIF) (n = 60) was 8% and after revision arthroplasty (RA) 
      (n = 47) 30% (OR 3.4, 95% CI [1.21-10.2]). Mean mHHS (n = 32) was 53 ± 19.4 and 
      EQ-VAS was 50 ± 24.6. According to B&T criteria, 82% of patients treated with 
      ORIF (n = 17) and 62% after RA (n = 13) showed an excellent outcome. CONCLUSION: 
      Patients with a PPF of the hip are elderly and at increased operative risk. In 
      cases with a stable prosthesis, ORIF provides good radiological outcome with low 
      reoperation rates. In case of RA, the risk for revision surgery is higher.

TI  - Effect of physical frailty on elder mistreatment in a national survey: examining 
      psychological vulnerability, housework involvement, and financial independence as 
      mediators.
PG  - 743-753
LID - 10.1017/S1041610221000739 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence of EM in an older Chinese population and 
      examine the mediating role of three psychosocial variables - psychological 
      vulnerability, housework involvement, and financial independence - in the 
      relationship between physical frailty and EM. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. 
      SETTING: The data source was the Third Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status 
      (SCSSW), which is a nationwide decennial survey conducted in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older who participated in SCSSW (N = 3516). 
      MEASUREMENTS: The past-year prevalence of EM and its seven subtypes, physical 
      frailty, psychological vulnerability, housework involvement, financial 
      independence, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The past-year prevalence 
      of EM was 4% among Chinese older adults, with psychological abuse being the most 
      common subtype (3.9%). A higher level of physical frailty had a direct influence 
      on EM. Older adults with higher levels of physical frailty were more likely to 
      have higher levels of psychological vulnerability (anxiety, loneliness, and 
      uselessness) and lower levels of housework involvement, which further correlated 
      with increased risk of EM. Frail Chinese older adults were less likely to have 
      financial independence, which in turn, surprisingly predicted a lower probability 
      of EM. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative sample, we provided the 
      first evidence of the prevalence of EM among Chinese older adults and expanded 
      the global understanding of EM by examining the mediating role of three 
      psychosocial variables. Future studies are warranted to corroborate our findings 
      and identify factors contributing to the complex mechanism of EM.

TI  - Health Information Systems for Older Persons in Select Government Tertiary 
      Hospitals and Health Centers in the Philippines: Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e29541
LID - 10.2196/29541 [doi]
LID - e29541
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid aging of the world's population requires systems that 
      support health facilities' provision of integrated care at multiple levels of the 
      health care system. The use of health information systems (HISs) at the point of 
      care has shown positive effects on clinical processes and patient health in 
      several settings of care. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe HISs for older persons 
      (OPs) in select government tertiary hospitals and health centers in the 
      Philippines. Specifically, we aimed to review the existing policies and 
      guidelines related to HISs for OPs in the country, determine the proportion of 
      select government hospitals and health centers with existing health information 
      specific for OPs, and describe the challenges related to HISs in select health 
      facilities. METHODS: We utilized the data derived from the findings of the 
      Focused Interventions for Frail Older Adults Research and Development Project 
      (FITforFrail), a cross-sectional and ethics committee-approved study. A 
      facility-based listing of services and human resources specific to geriatric 
      patients was conducted in purposively sampled 27 tertiary government hospitals 
      identified as geriatric centers and 16 health centers across all regions in the 
      Philippines. We also reviewed the existing policies and guidelines related to 
      HISs for OPs in the country. RESULTS: Based on the existing guidelines, multiple 
      agencies were involved in the provision of services for OPs, with several records 
      containing health information of OPs. However, there is no existing HIS specific 
      for OPs in the country. Only 14 (52%) of the 27 hospitals and 4 (25%) of the 16 
      health centers conduct comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). All tertiary 
      hospitals and health centers are able to maintain medical records of their 
      patients, and almost all (26/27, 96%) hospitals and all (16/16, 100%) health 
      centers have data on top causes of morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, the 
      presence of specific disease registries varied per hospitals and health centers. 
      Challenges to HISs include the inability to update databases due to inadequately 
      trained personnel, use of an offline facility-based HIS, an unstable internet 
      connection, and technical issues and nonuniform reporting of categories for age 
      group classification. CONCLUSIONS: Current HISs for OPs are characterized by 
      fragmentation, multiple sources, and inaccessibility. Barriers to achieving 
      appropriate HISs for OPs include the inability to update HISs in hospitals and 
      health centers and a lack of standardization by age group and disease 
      classification. Thus, we recommend a 1-person, 1-record electronic medical record 
      system for OPs and the disaggregation and analysis across demographic and 
      socioeconomic parameters to inform policies and programs that address the complex 
      needs of OPs. CGA as a required routine procedure for all OPs and its integration 
      with the existing HISs in the country are also recommended.

      frail older adults: a qualitative study in four European countries.
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afac134 [doi]
LID - afac134
AB  - BACKGROUND: a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common reason 
      to prescribe antibiotics in a frail older patient. Frequently, antibiotics are 
      prescribed unnecessarily. To increase appropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through 
      antibiotic stewardship interventions, we need to thoroughly understand the 
      factors that contribute to these prescribing decisions. OBJECTIVES: (1) to obtain 
      insight into factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for suspected UTIs in 
      frail older adults. (2) To develop an overarching model integrating these factors 
      to guide the development of antibiotic stewardship interventions for UTIs in 
      frail older adults. METHODS: we conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 
      61 semi-structured interviews in older adult care settings in Poland, the 
      Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. We interviewed physicians, nursing staff, 
      patients and informal caregivers. RESULTS: participants described a chain of 
      decisions by patients, caregivers and/or nursing staff preceding the ultimate 
      decision to prescribe antibiotics by the physician. We identified five themes of 
      influence: (1) the clinical situation and its complexity within the frail older 
      patient, (2) diagnostic factors, such as asymptomatic bacteriuria, (3) knowledge 
      (gaps) and attitude, (4) communication: interprofessional, and with patients and 
      relatives and (5) context and organisation of care, including factors such as 
      availability of antibiotics (over the counter), antibiotic stewardship efforts 
      and factors concerning out-of-hours care. CONCLUSIONS: decision-making on 
      suspected UTIs in frail older adults is a complex, multifactorial process. Due to 
      the diverse international setting and stakeholder variety, we were able to 
      provide a comprehensive overview of factors to guide the development of 
      antibiotic stewardship interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Today's acute hospital care is poorly adapted to the complex needs of 
      frail older people. This exposes them to avoidable risks, such as loss of 
      functional capacities, leading to unnecessary health and social care needs. Being 
      frail and in need of acute hospital care often leads to higher dependence in 
      Activities of Daily Living (ADL), especially if one's needs are not acknowledged. 
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is one way to meet frail older people's 
      complex needs. The study's aim was to investigate the effects on frail older 
      people's ADL 12 months after receiving CGA. METHODS: This is a two-armed 
      randomised controlled intervention study. Participants were frail older people 
      (75+) who sought the emergency department and needed admission to a medical ward. 
      The intervention was CGA performed at a geriatric management unit during the 
      hospital stay. The CGA included comprehensive assessment of medical, functional, 
      psychological, social, and environmental status as well as treatment, 
      rehabilitation, discharge planning, and follow-up. Multidisciplinary teamwork and 
      a person-centred approach were used. The control was care at an ordinary medical 
      hospital ward. The primary outcome was change in dependence in ADL from 2 weeks 
      before admission to the 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: At admission, 155 people 
      participated (77 in the control, 78 in the intervention). At the 12-month 
      follow-up, 78 participated (40 in the control, 38 in the intervention). Attrition 
      was mainly due to mortality. Four participants in the control (5.2%) and twelve 
      in the intervention group (15.4%) had improved in their ADL 1 year after 
      discharge (OR = 3.32; 95% CI = 1.02-10.79). CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital CGA 
      performed at a geriatric management unit improves frail older people's ADL. Being 
      less dependent in ADL increases frail older people's ability to remain in their 
      own housing, which is important for both the individual and society. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: Demographic changes alongside medical advances have 
      resulted in older adults accounting for an increasing proportion of emergency 
      hospital admissions. Current measures of illness severity, limited to 
      physiological parameters, have shortcomings in this cohort, partly due to patient 
      complexity. This study aimed to derive and validate a risk score for acutely 
      unwell older adults which may enhance risk stratification and support clinical 
      decision-making. METHODS: Data was collected from emergency admissions in 
      patients ≥65 years from two UK general hospitals (April 2017- April 2018). 
      Variables underwent regression analysis for in-hospital mortality and independent 
      predictors were used to create a risk score. Performance was assessed on external 
      validation. Secondary outcomes included seven-day mortality and extended hospital 
      stay. RESULTS: Derivation (n = 8,974) and validation (n = 8,391) cohorts were 
      analysed. The model included the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), clinical 
      frailty scale (CFS), acute kidney injury, age, sex, and Malnutrition Universal 
      Screening Tool. For mortality, area under the curve for the model was 0.79 (95% 
      CI 0.78-0.80), superior to NEWS2 0.65 (0.62-0.67) and CFS 0.76 (0.74-0.77) 
      (P<0.0001). Risk groups predicted prolonged hospital stay: the highest risk group 
      had an odds ratio of 9.7 (5.8-16.1) to stay >30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple 
      validated model (Older Persons' Emergency Risk Assessment [OPERA] score) predicts 
      in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay and could be easily integrated 
      into electronic hospital systems, enabling automatic digital generation of risk 
      stratification within hours of admission. Future studies may validate the OPERA 
      score in external populations and consider an impact analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: In an era of rapid expansion of FDA approvals for oral anticancer agents 
      (OAAs), it is important to understand the factors associated with survival among 
      real-world populations, which include groups not well-represented in pivotal 
      clinical trials of OAAs, such as the elderly, racial minorities, and medically 
      complex patients. Our objective was to evaluate patient- and provider-level 
      characteristics' associations with mortality among a multi-payer cohort of 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients who initiated OAAs. METHODS: This 
      retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the North Carolina state 
      cancer registry linked to multi-payer claims data for the years 2004 to 2015. 
      Provider data were obtained from North Carolina Health Professions Data System 
      and the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System. Included patients were 
      individuals with mRCC who initiated an OAA and survived ≥90 days after beginning 
      treatment. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence 
      limits (CL) using Cox hazard models for associations between patient 
      demographics, patient clinical characteristics, provider-level factors, and 
      2-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The cohort included 207 patients with mRCC 
      who received OAAs. In multivariable models, clinical variables such as frailty 
      (HR: 1.36, 95% CL: 1.11-1.67) and de novo metastatic diagnosis (HR: 2.63, 95%CL: 
      1.67-4.16) were associated with higher all-cause mortality. Additionally, 
      patients solely on Medicare had higher adjusted all-cause mortality compared with 
      patients with any private insurance (HR: 2.35, 95% CL: 1.32-4.18). No 
      provider-level covariates investigated were associated with all-cause mortality. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Within a real-world population of mRCC patients taking OAAs, 
      survival differed based on patient characteristics. In an era of rapid expansion 
      of FDA approvals for OAAs, these real-world data underscore the continued 
      importance of access to high-quality care, particularly for medically complex 
      patients with limited resources.

TI  - Prevention of pulmonary complications in sedated patients undergoing 
      interventional procedures in the nonoperating room anesthesia setting.
PG  - 493-501
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000001158 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) procedures have expanded 
      in number, variety, and complexity. NORA involves all age groups, including frail 
      older adults and patients often considered too sick to tolerate traditional 
      surgical interventions. Postoperative pulmonary complications are a significant 
      source of adverse events in the perioperative setting. We present a review 
      focused on preventing pulmonary complications in the interventional NORA setting. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: NORA locations should function as independent, autonomous 
      ambulatory units. We discuss a strategic plan involving a thorough preoperative 
      evaluation of patients, including recognizing high-risk patients and their 
      anesthetic management. Finally, we offer guidance on the challenges of conducting 
      sedation and anesthesia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or a 
      history of COVID-19. SUMMARY: The demands on the interventional NORA anesthesia 
      team are increasing. Strategic planning, checklists, consistent staffing 
      assignments, and scheduled safety drills are valuable tools to improve patient 
      safety. In addition, through quality improvement initiatives and reporting, NORA 
      anesthetists can achieve reductions in periprocedural pulmonary complications.

TI  - Identifying Research Priorities in Adult Day Centers to Support Evidence-Based 
      Care of Vulnerable Older Adults.
PG  - 127-131
LID - 10.1353/cpr.2021.0012 [doi]
AB  - Adult day centers (ADCs) are essential community resources that allow frail older 
      adults to remain in their communities. Research demonstrates that ADC staff have 
      the capacity to leverage their culturally and socially congruent relationships 
      with clients and caregivers, to deliver evidence-based interventions that improve 
      health outcomes. Yet, they remain a largely overlooked neighborhood resource for 
      older adults with complex health care needs. The National Adult Day Services 
      Association (NADSA) created a multistakeholder work group to identify priority 
      areas for research to enhance the quality of services offered in ADCs and the 
      delivery of evidence-based practices to clients. This perspective piece, which 
      presents the workgroup's findings in the form of key research priorities, is 
      intended as practical guide for researchers seeking to align their research 
      questions with the needs of ADCs and those they serve. In addition to identifying 
      areas of further exploration, we discuss current studies being undertaken within 
      the ADC setting.

TI  - The changing role of Advanced Clinical Practitioners working with older people 
      during the COVID- 19 pandemic: A qualitative research study.
PG  - 104235
LID - S0020-7489(22)00064-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2022.104235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was identified as a pandemic by the World Health 
      Organisation (WHO) in December 2020. Advanced Clinical Practitioners (ACPs) in 
      England working with older people with frailty, experienced their clinical role 
      changing in response to the emergency health needs of this complex population 
      group. In contrast to other countries, in England Advanced Clinical Practitioners 
      are drawn from both nursing and allied health professions. Whilst much of the 
      literature emphasises the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the 
      Advanced Clinical Practitioners' role, the pandemic threw further light on its 
      potential and challenges. However, an initial review of the literature 
      highlighted a lack of research of Advanced Clinical Practitioners' capabilities 
      working with uncertainty in disaster response situations. AIM: To capture the 
      lived experience of how English Advanced Clinical Practitioners working with 
      older people adapted their roles in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (October 
      2020-January 2021). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative research 
      design was used. Following ethical approval, 23 Advanced Clinical Practitioner 
      volunteer participants from across England with varied health professional 
      backgrounds were recruited from Advanced Clinical Practitioners' professional and 
      social media networks on Twitter using a snowballing technique. METHODS: 
      Depending on preference or availability, 23 participants (nurses (18), 
      physiotherapists (2), paramedics (2) and a pharmacist (1)) were interviewed 
      singularly (n = 9) or as part of 3 focus groups (n = 14) using Zoom video 
      communication. Audio recordings were transcribed and using qualitative data 
      analysis software, NVivo 12 pro, coded for an essentialist thematic analysis of 
      Advanced Clinical Practitioners' responses using an inductive approach. 27 codes 
      were identified and collated into five themes. For the purposes of this paper, 
      four themes are discussed: experiencing different work, developing attributes, 
      negotiating barriers and changing future provision. FINDINGS: Advanced Clinical 
      Practitioners successfully transferred their advanced practice skills into areas 
      of clinical need during the pandemic. Their autonomous and generic, high level of 
      expertise equipped them for management and leadership positions where speed of 
      change, and the dissolution of traditional professional boundaries, were 
      prioritised. Barriers to progress included a lack of knowledge of the Advanced 
      Clinical Practitioner role and friction between Advanced Clinical Practitioners 
      and physicians. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the successful 
      adaption of the Advanced Clinical Practitioner role to enable more creative, 
      personalised and sustainable solutions in the care of older people living with 
      frailty during the pandemic. The potential of Advanced Clinical Practitioner 
      development is in a juxtaposition to the threat of pandemic services being 
      dismantled once the emergency nature of care has passed. Healthcare organisations 
      have a vital part to play in considering the enablers and barriers of Advanced 
      Clinical Practitioner capability-based practice when responding to uncertainty.

AB  - Biliary disease is common in the older population, and gallbladder dysfunction 
      and increased bile lithogenicity predispose to calculi formation. This case 
      demonstrates an unusual presentation of gallbladder empyema. A 90-year-old male 
      with metastatic prostate cancer presented with hypoactive delirium. With no 
      localising features, normal liver function tests but persistently raised 
      inflammatory markers, he was initially managed as a urinary tract infection. 
      Chest wall discomfort and swelling over the right costal margin later developed. 
      Abdominal imaging demonstrated a massive gallbladder empyema invaginating through 
      the lower right rib cage, causing the superficial swelling. Pre-morbid status 
      prevented cholecystectomy and he was managed conservatively with percutaneous 
      cholecystostomy and antibiotics. He was discharged to 24-h care 2 weeks after 
      diagnosis with a long-term drain.

TI  - The feasibility of conducting acute sarcopenia research in hospitalised older

PG  - 463-473
LID - 10.1007/s41999-021-00565-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess feasibility of conducting acute sarcopenia research in complex 
      populations of hospitalised older adults. METHODS: Patients ≥ 70 years old were 
      recruited to three cohorts: elective colorectal surgery, emergency (abdominal) 
      surgery, medical patients with infections. Participants were recruited to the 
      elective cohort in preoperative assessment clinic, and acutely admitted 
      participants from surgical and medical wards at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital 
      Birmingham. Serial measures of muscle quantity (ultrasound quadriceps, 
      bioelectrical impedance analysis), muscle function (hand grip strength, physical 
      performance), and questionnaires (mini-nutritional assessment, physical function) 
      were performed at baseline, within 7 (± 2) days of admission/surgery, and 13 
      (± 1) weeks post-admission/surgery. Feasibility outcomes were assessed across 
      timepoints including recruitment and drop-out rates, and procedure completion 
      rates. RESULTS: Eighty-one participants were recruited (mean age 79, 38.3% 
      females). Recruitment rates were higher in elective (75%, 24/32) compared to 
      emergency surgery (37.2%, 16/43), and medical participants (45.1%, 41/91; 
      p = 0.003). Drop-out rates varied from 8.3 to 19.5% at 7 days, and 12.5-43.9% at 
      13 weeks. Age and gender did not differ between patients assessed for 
      eligibility, approached, or recruited. Completion rates were highest for 
      ultrasound quadriceps (98.8%, 80/81 across all groups at baseline). Gait speed 
      completion rates were lower in medical (70.7%, 29/41) compared to elective 
      participants (100%, 24/24) at baseline. CONCLUSION: Higher participation refusal 
      and drop-out rates should be expected for research involving recruitment of 
      participants from the acute setting. Assessment of muscle quantity/quality 
      through ultrasound is recommended in early-stage trials in the acute setting, 
      where completion rates of physical performance testing are expected to be lower.

AB  - During earliest years, new drug-therapies and novel interventional therapies have 
      been tested to modify the detrimental effect of secondary valve diseases, adverse 
      ventricular remodelling and persistent fluid overload in HF patients. However, 
      the increased prevalence of older or very old patients with HF has made their 
      widespread implementation more problematic due to complex comorbidity, frailty, 
      or overt disability. This growing older population, often excluded by randomized 
      trials, but with elevated risk of hospitalization, required a different clinical 
      and management approach that allows clinicians to take full advantage in reducing 
      mortality and morbidity from these new pharmacological and instrumental 
      therapies. In this perspective, the role of multidisciplinary Heart Team is 
      mandatory for better define a correct decision-making process and tailoring the 
      best pharmacological therapy in each patient and to program a continuum care in a 
      post-acute phase of treatment. In addition, the possibility to plan multicentre 
      registries of several complex cases evaluated by Heart Team could become a very 
      important source of real world data to further refine indications and 
      contraindications of different highly technological therapeutic approach, today 
      based often on randomized clinical trials that do not represent faithfully the 
      current clinical practice population.

TI  - Sex disparities in the prevalence of physical function disabilities: a 
      population-based study in a low-income community.
PG  - 419
LID - 10.1186/s12877-021-02362-z [doi]
LID - 419
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional disability continues to be a significant public health 
      problem that increases older adults' vulnerability to experience a diminished 
      quality of life, loss of independence, higher healthcare costs and health 
      services utilization, and increased risks of mortality. Thus, we aimed to study 
      the prevalence of functional disabilities by sex according to the types of daily 
      living activities, controlling for specific sociodemographic variables among 
      older Hispanics from low-income communities. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional 
      epidemiological research design, considering a complex sampling design of 
      households to interview adults ≥65 years living in low-income communities in 
      Puerto Rico. Functional disability was measured by the PROMIS® Physical Function 
      Short Form-20 T-score. The selected community was reported to have 5980 adult 
      residents ≥65 years, according to the USA Census. The prevalence of functional 
      disability was estimated using the logistic regression model, weighting by the 
      effect of the sampling. Our estimated prevalence was compared between sexes using 
      the prevalence ratio (PR), which was estimated with logistic regression models, 
      controlling for age, income, number of chronic conditions, high and low impact of 
      chronic conditions in functional disabilities, marital status, and sampling 
      design. RESULTS: We recruited 211 older Hispanics from a randomly selected 
      sample. Their mean age was 74.4 ± 7.1 years, with female predominance (57.3%). 
      The overall estimated prevalence of physical function disability using T-score 
      among females was 2.70 (95% CI: 1.4, 5.1) times the estimated prevalence of 
      physical function disability among males. Women were more likely to report 
      functional disabilities in instrumental activities of daily living, self-care 
      activities, and functional mobility compared to males. However, sex differences 
      were largely explained by the presence of musculoskeletal conditions of high 
      impact in functional disability. CONCLUSIONS: The females in our study bear the 
      greater burden of physical function disability in their adult age. Health 
      policies, as well as future studies, should be targeted at reducing the burden of 
      physical function disabilities in different types of daily activities through 
      gender-sensitive disability self-management programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the known association between frailty and postoperative 
      morbidity, the use of preoperative frailty in surgical practice remains limited. 
      We sought to develop a risk tool to predict postoperative increase in functional 
      dependence. METHODS: Patients of ≥65 years in the National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Project database who had a primary hepatopancreatic surgery between 
      2015 and 2019 were used to identify predictors of increased dependence and 
      development of a simplified tool to calculate the risk stratification score for 
      increased discharge care level (https://ktsahara.shinyapps.io/care_discharge/). 
      RESULTS: Among 31,338 patients who underwent primary hepatopancreatic surgery, 
      4,259 (13.6%) had an increased level of care at discharge compared to their 
      preadmission care. Patients with increased discharge care had a higher proportion 
      of patients with a modified frailty index of at least 2 (n = 1496; 35.1%) 
      compared with individuals with unchanged care (n = 6,760; 25.0%). In addition, 
      12.3% (n = 3,858) were discharged to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation 
      facility. Of note, the odds of increased care at discharge were increased by 1.41 
      (95% confidence interval: 1.32-1.50), 1.11 (95% confidence interval :1.11-1.12), 
      and 1.95 (95% confidence interval:1.86-2.04) times with every unit increase in 
      modified frailty index, age beyond 65 years, and the number of in-hospital 
      complications, respectively. Area under receiver operative curve for the 
      parsimonious model used to develop the risk calculator was 0.7486 (95% confidence 
      interval: 0.7405-0.7566) (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Approximately, 1 in 7 
      patients required an increased level of care at the time of discharge compared 
      with their preadmission status. A simplified web-based risk tool can be used in 
      clinical practice as a surgical decision aid in post-discharge planning after 
      complex elective surgery.

TI  - Interdisciplinary staff perceptions of advance care planning in long-term care 
      homes: a qualitative study.
PG  - 127
LID - 10.1186/s12904-022-01014-2 [doi]
LID - 127
AB  - BACKGROUND: Residents living in long-term care homes (LTCH) have complex care 
      needs, multiple chronic conditions, increasing frailty and cognitive impairment. 
      A palliative approach that incorporates advance care planning (ACP) should be 
      integrated with chronic disease management, yet it is not a norm in most LTCHs. 
      Despite its growing need, there remains a lack of staff engagement in the ACP 
      process. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and 
      experiences of interdisciplinary staff related to the practice of ACP in LTCHs. 
      METHODS: This study is part of a larger Canadian project, iCAN ACP, that aims to 
      increase uptake, and access to ACP for older Canadians living with frailty. An 
      exploratory qualitative design using an interpretive descriptive approach was 
      employed utilizing focus groups and semi-structured interviews with staff from 
      four LTCHs in Ontario, Canada. FINDINGS: There were 98 participants, including 
      nurses (n = 36), physicians (n = 4), personal support workers (n = 34), support 
      staff (n = 23), and a public guardian (n = 1). Three common themes and nine 
      subthemes were derived: a) ongoing nature of ACP; b) complexities around ACP 
      conversations; and c) aspirations for ACP becoming a standard of care in LTCHs. 
      DISCUSSION: The findings of this study provide important contributions to our 
      understanding of the complexities surrounding ACP implementation as a standard of 
      practice in LTCHs. One of the critical findings relates to a lack of ACP 
      conversations prior to admission in the LTCHs, by which time many residents may 
      have already lost cognitive abilities to engage in these discussions. The 
      hierarchical nature of LTCH staffing also serves as a barrier to the 
      interdisciplinary collaboration required for a successful implementation of ACP 
      initiatives. Participants within our study expressed support for ACP 
      communication and the need for open lines of formal and informal 
      interdisciplinary communication. There is a need for revitalizing care in LTCHs 
      through interdisciplinary care practices, clarification of role descriptions, 
      optimized staffing, capacity building of each category of staff and commitment 
      from the LTCH leadership for such care. CONCLUSION: The findings build on a 
      growing body of research illustrating the need to improve staff engagement in ACP 
      communication in LTCHs.

TI  - Oral Bisphosphonates Are Associated With Increased Risk of Severe Acute Kidney

      Series in the United Kingdom.
PG  - 1270-1278
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.4573 [doi]
AB  - Although oral bisphosphonates (BP) are commonly used, there is conflicting 
      evidence for their safety in the elderly. Safety concerns might trump BP use in 
      older patients with complex health needs. Our study evaluated the safety of BP, 
      focusing on severe acute kidney injury (AKI), gastrointestinal ulcer (GI ulcer), 
      osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and femur fractures. We used UK primary care data 
      (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD GOLD]), linked to hospital (Hospital 
      Episode Statistics [HES] inpatient) and ONS mortality data. We included all 
      patients aged >65 with complex health needs and no BP use in the year before 
      study start (January 1, 2010). Complex health needs were defined in three 
      cohorts: an electronic frailty index score ≥3 (frailty cohort), one or more 
      unplanned hospitalization/s (hospitalization cohort); and prescription of ≥10 
      different medicines in 2009 (polypharmacy cohort). Incidence rates were 
      calculated for all outcomes. Subsequently, all individuals who experienced AKI or 
      GI ulcer anytime during follow-up were included for Self-Controlled Case Series 
      (SCCS) analyses. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated separately for AKI 
      and GI ulcer, comparing event rates between BP-exposed and unexposed time 
      windows. No SCCS were conducted for ONJ and femur fractures. We identified 94,364 
      individuals in the frailty cohort, as well as 78,184 and 95,621 persons in the 
      hospitalization and polypharmacy cohorts. Of those, 3023, 1950, and 2992 
      individuals experienced AKI and 1403, 1019, and 1453 had GI ulcer/s during 
      follow-up, respectively. Age-adjusted SCCS models found evidence of increased 
      risk of AKI associated with BP use (frailty cohort: IRR 1.65; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 1.25-2.19), but no association with GI ulcers (frailty cohort: IRR 
      1.24; 95% CI, 0.86-1.78). Similar results were obtained for the hospitalization 
      and polypharmacy cohorts. Our study found a 50% to 65% increased risk of AKI 
      associated with BP use in elderly patients with complex health needs. Future 
      studies should further investigate the risk-benefit of BP use in these patients.

AB  - The assessment of care in homecare today is complex. Nurses have to decide on 
      care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise 
      solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, 
      however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, 
      in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud 
      interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary 
      in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for 
      the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like 
      the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes 
      clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a 
      person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised 
      in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to 
      focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a 
      person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that 
      training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently 
      seen health problems are recommended.

TI  - Is a tailored strategy using proton beam radiotherapy for reirradiation 
      advantageous for elderly women? A case report.
PG  - NP67-NP72
LID - 10.1177/03008916211007930 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of primary or recurrent vaginal tumours in an aging 
      population is challenging for gynecologic and radiation oncologists. In patients 
      unsuited for surgery and already irradiated on the pelvis, proton beam 
      radiotherapy may be worthwhile due to its ballistic advantages. CASE REPORT: We 
      report the case of an 80-year-old woman with a squamous cell carcinoma of the 
      vagina after a history of pelvic radiation and vaginal brachytherapy delivered 
      for a previous endometrial adenocarcinoma. She received proton beam radiotherapy 
      with a complete response after 12 months and mild toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      complexity of reirradiation management in the frail and elderly population 
      requires attention. Efforts should be focused on maintaining autonomy and quality 
      of life in order to improve adherence and clinical compliance to the treatment. 
      In the era of the tailored approach, hadrontherapy can play an important role to 
      minimize toxicity, obtain good local control, and reduce the overall treatment 
      time.

TI  - Effectiveness of a complex regional advance care planning intervention to improve 
      care consistency with care preferences: study protocol for a multi-center, 
      cluster-randomized controlled trial focusing on nursing home residents (BEVOR 
      trial).
PG  - 770
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06576-3 [doi]
LID - 770
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to recent legislation, facilitated advance care planning 
      (ACP) for nursing home (NH) residents is covered by German sickness funds. 
      However, the effects of ACP on patient-relevant outcomes have not been studied in 
      Germany yet. This study investigates whether implementing a complex regional ACP 
      intervention improves care consistency with care preferences in NH residents. 
      METHODS: This is a parallel-group cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) with 
      48 NHs (≈ 3840 resident beds) between 09/2019 and 02/2023. The intervention group 
      will receive a complex, regional ACP intervention aiming at sustainable systems 
      redesign at all levels (individual, institutional, regional). The intervention 
      comprises comprehensive training of ACP facilitators, implementation of reliable 
      ACP processes, organizational development in the NH and other relevant 
      institutions of the regional healthcare system, and education of health 
      professionals caring for the residents. Control group NHs will deliver care as 
      usual. Primary outcome is the hospitalization rate during the 12-months 
      observation period. Secondary outcomes include the rate of residents whose 
      preferences were known and honored in potentially life-threatening events, 
      hospital days, index treatments like resuscitation and artificial ventilation, 
      advance directives, quality of life, psychological burden on bereaved families, 
      and costs of care. The NHs will provide anonymous, aggregated data of all their 
      residents on the primary outcome and several secondary outcomes (data collection 
      1). For residents who have given informed consent, we will evaluate care 
      consistency with care preferences and further secondary outcomes, based on chart 
      reviews and short interviews with residents, surrogates, and carers (data 
      collection 2). Process evaluation will aim to explain barriers and facilitators, 
      economic evaluation the cost implications. DISCUSSION: This study has the 
      potential for high-quality evidence on the effects of a complex regional ACP 
      intervention on NH residents, their families and surrogates, NH staff, and health 
      care utilization in Germany. It is the first cRCT investigating a comprehensive 
      regional ACP intervention that aims at improving patient-relevant clinical 
      outcomes, addressing and educating multiple institutions and health care 
      providers, besides qualification of ACP facilitators. Thereby, it can generate 
      evidence on the potential of ACP to effectively promote patient-centered care in 
      the vulnerable population of frail and often chronically ill elderly. TRIAL

LID - 10.36740/WLek202206111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: The purpose of the study is to increase the efficacy of 
      сomprehensive treatment in elderly patients with COPD , who have suffered of 
      coronavirus disease-COVID-19 in the last 3-6 months, by using nebulizer therapy 
      with N-acetylcysteine and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution (Flu-Acyl 
      broncho) and the drug glycine, to correct psychosomatic disorders. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Materials and methods: Under our supervision there were 60 elderly 
      patients with COPD gr D, who underwent Covid 19 in the last 3-6 months, were 
      under observation. The average age was 66.3±2.1 years. Рatients of the main and 
      control groups were prescribed complex basic therapy. However, mucolytic therapy 
      was administered to patients in the main group using combined drug - 
      N-acetylcysteine and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution through a 5.0 №10 
      nebulizer. For the treatment of astheno-neurotic disorders of postcovidal 
      syndrome was prescribed glycine 100 mg 2 times a day for 10 days. Subsequently, 
      Flu-Acyl broncho through a nebulizer at 5.0 No.10, and glycised was used in 
      courses once a day for 10 days per month. Patients in the control group were 
      prescribed acetylcysteine 200 mg 3 times a day N10. RESULTS: Results: The results 
      of observation for 6 months showed that in patients of the main group, recurrence 
      of the disease was not observed. whereas in patients of the control group in 6 
      patients (20%). CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Comprehensive treatment of elderly 
      patients with comorbid pathology - COPD group D and postcovidal syndrome, with 
      the additional use of nebulizer delivery of the combined drug - N-acetylcysteine 
      and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution in combination with the sedative drug 
      glycine, promotes improving the quality of life in patients, reducing the 
      duration of treatment, prevents recurrence and progression of COPD.

TI  - Percutaneous Treatment of Concomitant Severe Aortic Stenosis and Thoracoabdominal 
      Aortic Aneurysm.
PG  - 156-159
LID - 10.1177/15266028211038592 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although rare in occurrence, symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and 
      large thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) found in combination pose a real 
      therapeutic challenge, especially in elderly frail patients. Surgical approaches 
      for combined treatment are complex and at high risk of complications while staged 
      procedures carry the risk of an unfavorable evolution of the condition 
      temporarily left untreated. Minimally invasive approaches may therefore prove a 
      more suitable strategy for these patients. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 
      78-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) and a TAAA of 
      7.8 cm in diameter. Transcatheter treatment of both conditions was successfully 
      performed in a staged manner. The first intervention consisted of combined 
      transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) immediately followed 
      by a zone 3 thoracic endovascular aortic endoprosthesis deployment. In order to 
      reduce the extent of intercostal arteries coverage and mitigate the risk of 
      medullar ischemia, a second-stage percutaneous endovascular treatment of the TAAA 
      was performed with a customized 4-fenestration prosthesis. Early and 12-month 
      clinical and radiologic follow-up were favorable. CONCLUSION: This case 
      demonstrates how a strong multidisciplinary collaboration allows for successful 
      resolution of complex clinical scenarios.

TI  - Improving medication adherence and effective prescribing through a 
      patient-centered prescription model in patients with multimorbidity.
PG  - 127-137
LID - 10.1007/s00228-021-03207-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the impact of the patient-centered 
      prescription (PCP) model in medication adherence and effective prescribing in 
      patients with multimorbidity. METHODS: Uncontrolled before-after study in an 
      intermediate care facility in a mixed urban-rural district. Inpatients 
      aged ≥ 65 years with multimorbidity exposed to polypharmacy before hospital 
      admission were consecutively enrolled. Every patient's treatment plan was 
      analyzed through the PCP model, which includes interventions aimed at improving 
      medication adherence. The primary endpoint was the change in the proportion of 
      adherent patients between pre-admission and after discharge for all regularly 
      scheduled long-term medications, using the proportion of days covered (PDC). 
      Secondary endpoints included the change on mean PDC for all long-term 
      medications, number of long-term medications, proportion of patients with 
      hyperpolypharmacy, medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) score, drug burden 
      index (DBI) score, number of potential inappropriate prescribing (PIP), and 
      proportion of patients with ≥ 2 PIPs. RESULTS: Ninety-three non-institutionalized 
      patients were included (mean age 83.0 ± SD 6.1 years). The proportion of adherent 
      patients increased from 22.1 to 51.9% (P < 0.001). Intervention also improved 
      mean PDC [mean difference (95% CI) 10.6 (7.7, 13.5)] and effective prescribing 
      through a reduction on the number of long-term medications [- 1.3 
      (- 1.7, - 0.9)], proportion of patients exposed to hyperpolypharmacy (- 16.1%, 
      P < 0.001), MRCI score [- 2.2 (- 3.4, - 1.0)], DBI score [- 0.16 (- 1.8, - 1.3)], 
      number of PIPs [- 1.6 (- 1.8, - 1.3)], and proportion of patients with ≥ 2 PIPs 
      (- 53.7%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Studied intervention provides significant 
      effective prescribing and medication adherence enhancements in 
      non-institutionalized older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.

TI  - A comprehensive urban programme to reduce energy poverty and its effects on 
      health and wellbeing of citizens in six European countries: study protocol of a 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1578

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly 11% of the European population is affected by energy poverty. 
      Energy poverty is defined by the European Commission (2016) as the inability to 
      afford basic energy services to guarantee a decent standard of living. Energy 
      poverty is considered a complex, multidimensional problem that affects 
      environment, housing, urban development, and health. Living in energy poverty 
      conditions is associated with poorer human health and wellbeing. Hence, the 
      WELLBASED intervention programme aims to design, implement and evaluate a 
      comprehensive urban programme, based on the social-ecological model, to reduce 
      energy poverty and its effects on the citizens' health and wellbeing in six 
      European urban study sites: Valencia, Spain; Heerlen, The Netherlands; Leeds, 
      United Kingdom; Edirne, Turkey; Obuda, Hungary, and; Jelgava, Latvia. METHODS: A 
      controlled trial is performed. A total of 875 participants are recruited (125-177 
      per study site) to receive the WELLBASED intervention programme for 12 months 
      (intervention condition) and 875 participants act as controls (control 
      condition). Data will be collected with a baseline measurement at inclusion (T0), 
      and follow-up measurements after 6 months (T1), 12 months (T2), and 18 months 
      (T3). In both study arms, effects of the WELLBASED intervention programme are 
      measured: health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), mental health, frailty in 
      older adults, self-perceived health, chronic conditions, and care utilization. At 
      the same time points, household expenditure on energy and energy consumption are 
      obtained. In the intervention arm, health-monitoring data (i.e. peak flow, oxygen 
      saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate) are obtained monthly and sleep 
      quality with a three-month interval. Household data with regard to temperature, 
      humidity and air quality are collected near real-time by home sensors. 
      Qualitative interviews are conducted in each study site to evaluate the impacts 
      of the WELLBASED intervention programme and to help explain findings. DISCUSSION: 
      The WELLBASED intervention programme will provide new insights into the 
      effectiveness of a comprehensive urban programme to tackle energy poverty and its 
      effects on health and wellbeing across Europe. Hence, this study can contribute

TI  - Key Components for the Delivery of Palliative and End-of-Life Care in Care Homes 
      in Hong Kong: A Modified Delphi Study.

AB  - Integrating the palliative care approach into care home service to address the 
      complex care needs of older adults with frailty or advanced diseases has been 
      increasingly recognized. However, such a service is underdeveloped in Hong Kong 
      owing to socio-cultural and legal concerns. We adopted a modified Delphi study 
      design to identify the key components for the delivery of palliative and 
      end-of-life care in care home settings for the local context. It was an iterative 
      staged method to assimilate views of experts in aged care, palliative care, and 
      care home management. A multidisciplinary expert panel of 18 members consented to 
      participate in the study. They rated their level of agreement with 61 candidate 
      statements identified through a scoping review in two rounds of anonymous 
      surveys. The steering group revised the statements in light of the survey 
      findings. Eventually, the finalized list included 28 key statements concerning 
      structure and process of care in seven domains, namely policy and infrastructure, 
      education, assessment, symptom management, communication, care for dying 
      patients, and family support. The findings of this study underscored concerns 
      regarding the feasibility of statements devised at different levels of palliative 
      care development. This list would be instrumental for regions where the 
      development of palliative and end-of-life care services in care home setting is 
      at an initial stage.

TI  - Balancing standardisation and individualisation in transitional care pathways: a 
      meta-ethnography of the perspectives of older patients, informal caregivers and 
      healthcare professionals.
PG  - 430

LID - 430
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transitional care implies the transfer of patients within or across 
      care settings in a seamless and safe way. For frail, older patients with complex 
      health issues, high-quality transitions are especially important as these 
      patients typically move more frequently within healthcare settings, requiring 
      treatment from different providers. As transitions of care for frail people are 
      considered risky, securing the quality and safety of these transitions is of 
      great international interest. Nevertheless, despite efforts to improve quality in 
      transitional care, research indicates that there is a lack of clear guidance to 
      deal with practical challenges that may arise. The aim of this article is to 
      synthesise older patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals' 
      experiences of challenges to achieving high-quality transitional care. METHODS: 
      We used the seven-step method for meta-ethnography originally developed by Noblit 
      and Hare. In four different but connected qualitative projects, the authors 
      investigated the challenges to transitional care for older people in the 
      Norwegian healthcare system from the perspectives of older patients, informal 
      caregivers and healthcare professionals. In this paper, we highlight and discuss 
      the cruciality of these challenging issues by synthesising the results from 
      twelve articles. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four themes: i) balancing 
      person-centred versus efficient care, ii) balancing everyday patient life versus 
      the treatment of illness, iii) balancing user choice versus "What Matters to 
      You", and iv) balancing relational versus practical care. These expressed 
      challenges represent tensions at the system, organisation and individual levels 
      based on partial competing assumptions on person-centred-care-inspired 
      individualisation endeavours and standardisation requirements in transitional 
      care. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for a clearer understanding of the 
      tension between standardisation and individualisation in transitional care 
      pathways for older patients to ensure better healthcare quality for patients and 
      more realistic working environments for healthcare professionals. Incorporating a 
      certain professional flexibility within the wider boundary of standardisation may 
      give healthcare professionals room for negotiation to meet patients' individual 
      needs, while at the same time ensuring patient flow, equity and evidence-based 
      practice.

TI  - Shared decision-making for the treatment of proximal femoral fractures in frail 
      institutionalised older patients: healthcare providers' perceived barriers and 
      facilitators.
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afac174 [doi]
LID - afac174
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Proximal femoral fractures are common in frail institutionalised 
      older patients. No convincing evidence exists regarding the optimal treatment 
      strategy for those with a limited pre-fracture life expectancy, underpinning the 
      importance of shared decision-making (SDM). This study investigated healthcare 
      providers' barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of SDM. METHODS: 
      Dutch healthcare providers completed an adapted version of the Measurement 
      Instrument for Determinants of Innovations questionnaire to identify barriers and 
      facilitators. If ≥20% of participants responded with 'totally disagree/disagree', 
      items were considered barriers and, if ≥80% responded with 'agree/totally agree', 
      items were considered facilitators. RESULTS: A total of 271 healthcare providers 
      participated. Five barriers and 23 facilitators were identified. Barriers 
      included the time required to both prepare for and hold SDM conversations, in 
      addition to the reflective period required to allow patients/relatives to make 
      their final decision, and the number of parties required to ensure optimal SDM. 
      Facilitators were related to patients' values, wishes and satisfaction, the 
      importance of SDM for patients/relatives and the fact that SDM is not considered 
      complex by healthcare providers, is considered to be part of routine care and is 
      believed to be associated with positive patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: Awareness 
      of identified facilitators and barriers is an important step in expanding the use 
      of SDM. Implementation strategies should be aimed at managing time constraints. 
      High-quality evidence on outcomes of non-operative and operative management can 
      enhance implementation of SDM to address current concerns around the outcomes.

TI  - Hybrid revascularization of chronic limb-threatening ischemia using popliteal 
      below-knee and tibial trifurcation open endarterectomy distally plus inter-woven 
      nitinol stenting proximally.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is frequently due to 
      multilevel, heavily calcified lesions, and it is often associated with desert 
      foot. Effective revascularization currently presents an additional challenge due 
      to the increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty related to these patients. Pure 
      endovascular treatment often fails to achieve effective and durable 
      revascularization and it is associated with still high amputation rates. We 
      present a novel hybrid approach and discuss its usefulness for limb salvage in 
      complex infrainguinal lesions. METHODS: Two no-option patients for both 
      anatomical and medical-comorbidity reasons, were treated consecutively for CLTI. 
      Both of them had prior failed percutaneous endovascular treatment, and bypass 
      revascularization had been ruled out. We describe the technical details of an 
      aggressive, but still less invasive hybrid approach, consisting of open distal 
      popliteal artery (PA) and tibial trifurcation endarterectomy plus patch 
      angioplasty, associated with proximal endovascular treatment with inter-woven 
      nitinol stent from the superficial femoral artery (SFA) to the endarterectomized 
      area. RESULTS: Technical success and salvage of the affected limb were achieved 
      in both cases, presenting significant postoperative clinical and hemodynamic 
      improvement and allowing early discharge hospital at home. There was no surgical 
      wound infection or other complications. CONCLUSION: This hybrid approach through 
      a single incision is safe and effective in the short term and can be used with 
      excellent results for CLTI in high-risk and /or no-option patients.

TI  - Person-centred care provided by a multidisciplinary primary care team to improve 
      therapeutic adequacy in polymedicated elderly patients (PCMR): randomised 
      controlled trial protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increase in elderly population has led to an associated 
      increase in multiple pathologies, frailty, polypharmacy, healthcare costs, 
      decreased quality of life and mortality. We designed an intervention based on 
      person-centred care model. This article outlines a study protocol, which aims to 
      explore the effects of the intervention to improve therapeutic adequacy in 
      polymedicated elderly patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open, randomised, 
      multicentre, controlled clinical trial. The study population includes 
      polymedicated (≥8 prescription medications) patients ≥75 years old. In the 
      intervention group, the multidisciplinary team (primary care pharmacist, family 
      doctor and nurse) will meet to carry out multidimensional reviews (frailty, 
      clinical complexity, morbidity and therapeutic adequacy) of the study subjects. 
      If changes are proposed to the treatment plan, a clinical interview will be 
      conducted with the patient to agree on changes in accordance with their 
      preferences. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 6 and 12 months. In the 
      control group, where the usual clinical practice will be followed, the necessary 
      data will be collected to compare the results.The key variables are the variation 
      in the mean number of incidents (potentially inappropriate prescription) per 
      patient, the number of medications, the number of changes implemented to the 
      treatment plan and the variation in the number of hospital admissions. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the IDIAPJGol 
      and by the University of Barcelona's Bioethics Commission. The results are 
      expected to be published in peer reviewed open-access journals, and as part of a 
      doctoral thesis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04188470. Pre-results.

TI  - Old age is associated with worse treatment outcome and frequent adverse drug 
      reaction in Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary 
      disease (NTM-PD) is rapidly increasing globally, especially in the older 
      population. However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the impact of aging 
      on the treatment outcomes of NTM-PD. METHODS: We analyzed consecutive patients 
      who satisfied the diagnostic criteria for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-PD 
      and received antibiotic treatment between January 2009 and December 2020 at a 
      tertiary referral hospital in Korea. The main outcomes were (1) long-term 
      treatment success, defined by negative culture conversion for more than 
      12 months; and (2) adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Multivariable logistic 
      regression model was used to evaluate the association between age and main 
      outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 614 patients (median age, 65 years, interquartile 
      range [IQR] 57-73 years; men, 35.3%) were included. Median treatment duration 
      (530 days, IQR 290-678 days; P for trend < 0.001) and long-term treatment success 
      (P for trend = 0.026) decreased, whereas ADRs (P for trend < 0.001) increased 
      significantly with age. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that age ≥ 80 years 
      was an independent factor associated with ADRs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.29; 
      95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-10.28) and worse treatment outcome (aOR 0.42; 
      95% CI 0.19-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Aging is associated with worse treatment outcome 
      and frequent ADRs of patients with MAC-PD. Individualized treatment with 
      reduced-intensity may be a reasonable alternative for older adults.

LID - 10.1136/bcr-2021-246581 [doi]
LID - e246581
AB  - We present a case of an elderly and comorbid patient who was scheduled to undergo 
      a hip fracture fixation using an intramedullary nail. Unfortunately, this was 
      delayed by 3 weeks as the patient was unfit to undergo this procedure. She was 
      placed onto the traction table and intraoperatively sustained a superior and 
      inferior pubic rami fracture while attempting reduction on the traction table. 
      Closed-reduction techniques using traction tables and perineal posts are not 
      without morbidity. Risk factors such as osteoporosis and delayed-fixation should 
      be accounted for when managing this complex and often frail group of patients.

TI  - Total uncertainty: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of experiences of 
      uncertainty in older people with advanced multimorbidity, their informal carers 
      and health professionals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: uncertainty pervades the complex illness trajectories experienced by 
      older adults with multimorbidity. Uncertainty is experienced by older people, 
      their informal carers and professionals providing care, yet is incompletely 
      understood. We aimed to identify and synthesise systematically the experience of 
      uncertainty in advanced multimorbidity from patient, carer and professional 
      perspectives. DESIGN: systematic literature review of published and grey 
      qualitative literature from 9 databases (Prospero CRD 42021227480). PARTICIPANTS: 
      older people with advanced multimorbidity, and informal carers/professionals 
      providing care to this group. Exclusion criteria: early multimorbidity, 
      insufficient focus on uncertainty. ANALYSIS: weight-of-evidence assessment was 
      used to appraise included articles. We undertook thematic synthesis of 
      multi-perspective experiences and response to uncertainty. RESULTS: from 4,738 
      unique search results, we included 44 articles relating to 40 studies. 22 focused 
      on patient experiences of uncertainty (n = 460), 15 on carer experiences 
      (n = 197), and 19 on health professional experiences (n = 490), with 10 exploring 
      multiple perspectives. We identified a shared experience of 'Total Uncertainty' 
      across five domains: 'appraising and managing multiple illnesses'; 'fragmented 
      care and communication'; 'feeling overwhelmed'; 'uncertainty of others' and 
      'continual change'. Participants responded to uncertainty by either active 
      (addressing, avoiding) or passive (accepting) means. CONCLUSIONS: the novel 
      concept of 'Total Uncertainty' represents a step change in our understanding of 
      illness experience in advanced multimorbidity. Patients, carers and health 
      professionals experienced uncertainty in similar domains, suggesting a shared 
      understanding is feasible. The domains of total uncertainty form a useful 
      organising framework for health professionals caring for older adults with 
      multimorbidity.
