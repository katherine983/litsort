TI  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults: clinical considerations and management.
PG  - 534-548
LID - 10.1038/s41574-021-00512-2 [doi]
AB  - The past 50 years have seen a growing ageing population with an increasing 
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); now, nearly half of all 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus are older adults (aged ≥65 years). Older 
      adults with T2DM present particularly difficult challenges. For example, the 
      accentuated heterogeneity of these patients, the potential presence of multiple 
      comorbidities, the increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, the increased 
      dependence on care and the effect of frailty all add to the complexity of 
      managing diabetes mellitus in this age group. In this Review, we offer an update 
      on the key pathophysiological mechanisms associated with T2DM in older people. We 
      then evaluate new evidence relating particularly to the effects of frailty and 
      sarcopenia, the clinical difficulties of age-associated comorbidities, and the 
      implications for existing guidelines and therapeutic options. Our conclusions 
      will focus on the effect of T2DM on an ageing society.

AB  - Aging causes skeletal muscle atrophy, and myofiber loss can be a critical 
      component of this process. In 1989, Rosenberg emphasized the importance of the 
      loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with aging and coined the term 
      'sarcopenia'. Since then, sarcopenia has attracted considerable attention due to 
      the aging population in developed countries. The presence of sarcopenia is 
      closely related to staggering, falls and even frailty in the elderly, which in 
      turn leads to the need for nursing care. Sarcopenia is often associated with a 
      poor prognosis in the elderly. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the causes 
      and pathogenesis of sarcopenia, and to develop and introduce interventional 
      strategies in line with these causes and pathogenesis. Sarcopenia can be a 
      primary component of physical frailty. The association between sarcopenia, 
      frailty and locomotive syndrome is complex; however, sarcopenia is a 
      muscle‑specific concept that is relatively easy to approach in research. In the 
      elderly, a lack of exercise, malnutrition and hormonal changes lead to 
      neuromuscular junction insufficiency, impaired capillary blood flow, reduced 
      repair and regeneration capacity due to a decrease in the number of muscle 
      satellite cells, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and oxidative stress, 
      resulting in muscle protein degradation exceeding synthesis. In addition, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction causes metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin 
      resistance, which may lead to quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in 
      skeletal muscle, resulting in sarcopenia. The present review article focuses on 
      age‑related primary sarcopenia and outlines its pathogenesis and mechanisms.

TI  - Metabolic Syndrome and Sarcopenia.
LID - 10.3390/nu13103519 [doi]
LID - 3519
AB  - Skeletal muscle is a major organ of insulin-induced glucose metabolism. In 
      addition, loss of muscle mass is closely linked to insulin resistance (IR) and 
      metabolic syndrome (Met-S). Skeletal muscle loss and accumulation of 
      intramuscular fat are associated with a variety of pathologies through a 
      combination of factors, including oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction, IR, and inactivity. Sarcopenia, defined by a loss of 
      muscle mass and a decline in muscle quality and muscle function, is common in the 
      elderly and is also often seen in patients with acute or chronic muscle-wasting 
      diseases. The relationship between Met-S and sarcopenia has been attracting a 
      great deal of attention these days. Persistent inflammation, fat deposition, and 
      IR are thought to play a complex role in the association between Met-S and 
      sarcopenia. Met-S and sarcopenia adversely affect QOL and contribute to increased 
      frailty, weakness, dependence, and morbidity and mortality. Patients with Met-S 
      and sarcopenia at the same time have a higher risk of several adverse health 
      events than those with either Met-S or sarcopenia. Met-S can also be associated 
      with sarcopenic obesity. In this review, the relationship between Met-S and 
      sarcopenia will be outlined from the viewpoints of molecular mechanism and 
      clinical impact.

TI  - Sarcopenic Dysphagia, Malnutrition, and Oral Frailty in Elderly: A Comprehensive 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu14050982 [doi]
LID - 982
AB  - Frailty is a highly prevalent condition in the elderly that has been increasingly 
      considered as a crucial public health issue, due to the strict correlation with a 
      higher risk of fragility fractures, hospitalization, and mortality. Among the 
      age-related diseases, sarcopenia and dysphagia are two common pathological 
      conditions in frail older people and could coexist leading to dehydration and 
      malnutrition in these subjects. "Sarcopenic dysphagia" is a complex condition 
      characterized by deglutition impairment due to the loss of mass and strength of 
      swallowing muscles and might be also related to poor oral health status. 
      Moreover, the aging process is strictly related to poor oral health status due to 
      direct impairment of the immune system and wound healing and physical and 
      cognitive impairment might indirectly influence older people's ability to carry 
      out adequate oral hygiene. Therefore, poor oral health might affect nutrient 
      intake, leading to malnutrition and, consequently, to frailty. In this scenario, 
      sarcopenia, dysphagia, and oral health are closely linked sharing common 
      pathophysiological pathways, disabling sequelae, and frailty. Thus, the aim of 
      the present comprehensive review is to describe the correlation among sarcopenic 
      dysphagia, malnutrition, and oral frailty, characterizing their phenotypically 
      overlapping features, to propose a comprehensive and effective management of 
      elderly frail subjects.

      to therapeutics.
PG  - 5675-5685
LID - 10.7150/thno.46436 [doi]
AB  - Aging frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome that becomes more prevalent with 
      advancing age. It constitutes a major health problem due to frequent adverse 
      outcomes. Frailty is characterized by disruption of physiological homeostasis and 
      progressive decline of health status. Multiple factors contribute to development 
      of frailty with advancing age, including genome instability, DNA damage, 
      epigenetic alternations, stem cell exhaustion, among others. These interrelated 
      factors comprehensively result in loss of tissue homeostasis and diminished 
      reserve capacity in frailty. Therefore, the aged organism gradually represents 
      symptoms of frailty with decline in physiological functions of organs. Notably, 
      the brain, cardiovascular system, skeletal muscle, and endocrine system are 
      intrinsically interrelated to frailty. The patients with frailty may display the 
      diminished reserves capacity of organ systems. Due to the complex 
      pathophysiology, no specific treatments have been approved for prevention of this 
      syndrome. At such, effective strategies for intervening in pathogenic process to 
      improve health status of frail patients are highly needed. Recent progress in 
      cell-based therapy has greatly contributed to the amelioration of degenerative 
      diseases related to age. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can exert regenerative 
      effects and possess anti-inflammatory properties. Transplantation of MSCs 
      represents as a promising therapeutic strategy to address the pathophysiologic 
      problems of frail syndrome. Currently, MSC therapy have undergone the phase I and 
      II trials in human subjects that have endorsed the safety and efficacy of MSCs 
      for aging frailty. However, despite these positive results, caution is still 
      needed with regard to potential to form tumors, and further large-scale studies 
      are warranted to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of MSC therapy.

AB  - Rationale: Much is known about the acute infective process of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of the 
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The marked inflammatory response and 
      coagulopathic state in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may promote pulmonary fibrosis. 
      However, little is known about the incidence and seriousness of post-COVID-19 
      pulmonary pathology. Objectives: To describe the respiratory recovery and 
      self-reported health after infection at the time of outpatient attendance. 
      Methods: Infection severity was graded into three groups: 1) not requiring 
      admission, 2) requiring hospital admission, and 3) requiring intensive care unit 
      care. Participants underwent chest radiography and a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). 
      Fatigue and subjective return to health were assessed, and concentrations of CRP 
      (C-reactive protein), IL-6 (interleukin-6), sCD25 (soluble CD25), and D-dimer 
      were measured. The associations between initial illness and abnormal chest X-ray 
      findings, 6MWT distance, and perception of maximal exertion were investigated. 
      Results: A total of 487 patients were offered an outpatient appointment, of whom 
      153 (31%) attended for assessment at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. A total 
      of 74 (48%) had required hospital admission during acute infection. Persistently 
      abnormal chest X-ray findings were seen in 4%. The median 6MWT distance covered 
      was 460 m. A reduced distance covered was associated with frailty and length of 
      inpatient stay. A total of 95 (62%) patients believed that they had not returned 
      to full health, whereas 47% met the case definition for fatigue. Ongoing ill 
      health and fatigue were associated with an increased perception of exertion. None 
      of the measures of persistent respiratory disease were associated with initial 
      disease severity. Conclusions: This study highlights the rates of objective 
      respiratory disease and subjective respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 and the 
      complex multifactorial nature of post-COVID-19 ill health.

TI  - Physical Functional Assessment in Older Adults.

AB  - The evaluation of the physical domain represents a critical part of the 
      assessment of the older person, both in the clinical as well as the research 
      setting. To measure physical function, clinicians and researchers have 
      traditionally relied on instruments focusing on the capacity of the individual to 
      accomplish specific functional tasks (e.g., the Activities of Daily Living [ADL] 
      or the Instrumental ADL scales). However, a growing number of physical 
      performance and muscle strength tests has been developed in parallel over the 
      past three decades. These measures are specifically designed to: 1) provide 
      objective results (not surprisingly, they are frequently timed tests) taken in 
      standardized conditions, whereas the traditional physical function scales are 
      generally self- or proxy-reported measures; 2) be more sensitive to changes; 3) 
      capture the real biology of the function through the assessment of standardized 
      tasks mirroring specific functional subdomains; and 4) mirror the quality of 
      specific mechanisms underlying more complex and multidomain functions. Among the 
      most commonly used instruments, the usual gait speed test, the Short Physical 
      Performance Battery, the handgrip strength, the Timed Up-and-Go test, the 
      6-minute walk test, and the 400-meter walk test are widely adopted by clinicians 
      and researchers. The clinical and research importance of all these instruments 
      has been demonstrated by their predictive capacity for negative health-related 
      outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, falls, institutionalization, disability, 
      mortality). Moreover, they have shown to be associated with subclinical and 
      clinical conditions that are also not directly related to the physical domain 
      (e.g., inflammation, oxidative stress, overall mortality). For this reason, they 
      have been repeatedly indicated as markers of wellbeing linked to the burden of 
      multiple chronic conditions rather than mere parameters of mobility or strength. 
      In this work protocols of the main tests for the objective assessment of physical 
      function in older adults are presented.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Social frailty is a complex concept and there is still no consensus 
      on the criteria that best define it, nor on the role that social dimensions play 
      in well-established frailty models. AIM: To analyse the predictive value of 
      social frailty dimensions on distinct frailty models. METHOD: A non-probabilistic 
      sample of 193 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and over was recruited in 
      2016 and followed for three years. Frailty was assessed by the Tilburg Frailty 
      Indicator, the Groningen Frailty Indicator, and the Fried Phenotype criteria. 
      Questions about living alone, social network, social support, loneliness, and 
      frequency of social activities engagement were used to assess social criteria. 
      Bivariate correlations and sequential multiple hierarchical logistic regression 
      analyses were performed. RESULTS: At baseline, 22.2% older adults lived alone, 
      47.2% reported missing people around them, 21.1% reported lack of social support, 
      26.1% reported having reduced their participation in social activities recently 
      and 52.2% reported loneliness. The percent of frail individuals varied across 
      frailty measures, and social criteria showed significant correlations and 
      increased the prediction of frailty status. Loneliness and social activities 
      engagement were associated with frailty as assessed by the Tilburg frailty 
      Indicator and by the Fried Phenotype criteria; the lack of social support is 
      associated with frailty as assessed by the Groningen Frailty Indicator. Living 
      alone and lack of social relationships did not predict frailty. CONCLUSION: 
      Including social dimensions in a frailty model needs a consensual theoretical 
      basis as they have different roles in predicting frailty, varying over time and 
      across assessment tools.

TI  - Interventions to Reduce Hospital Length of Stay in High-risk Populations: A 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - e2125846
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25846 [doi]
LID - e2125846
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Many strategies to reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) have been 
      implemented, but few studies have evaluated hospital-led interventions focused on 
      high-risk populations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 
      Learning Health System panel commissioned this study to further evaluate 
      system-level interventions for LOS reduction. OBJECTIVE: To identify and 
      synthesize evidence regarding potential systems-level strategies to reduce LOS 
      for patients at high risk for prolonged LOS. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Multiple databases, 
      including MEDLINE and Embase, were searched for English-language systematic 
      reviews from January 1, 2010, through September 30, 2020, with updated searches 
      through January 19, 2021. The scope of the protocol was determined with input 
      from AHRQ Key Informants. Systematic reviews were included if they reported on 
      hospital-led interventions intended to decrease LOS for high-risk populations, 
      defined as those with high-risk medical conditions or socioeconomically 
      vulnerable populations (eg, patients with high levels of socioeconomic risk, who 
      are medically uninsured or underinsured, with limited English proficiency, or who 
      are hospitalized at a safety-net, tertiary, or quaternary care institution). 
      Exclusion criteria included interventions that were conducted outside of the 
      hospital setting, including community health programs. Data extraction was 
      conducted independently, with extraction of strength of evidence (SOE) ratings 
      provided by systematic reviews; if unavailable, SOE was assessed using the AHRQ 
      Evidence-Based Practice Center methods guide. FINDINGS: Our searches yielded 4432 
      potential studies. We included 19 systematic reviews reported in 20 articles. The 
      reviews described 8 strategies for reducing LOS in high-risk populations: 
      discharge planning, geriatric assessment, medication management, clinical 
      pathways, interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary care, case management, 
      hospitalist services, and telehealth. Interventions were most frequently designed 
      for older patients, often those who were frail (9 studies), or patients with 
      heart failure. There were notable evidence gaps, as there were no systematic 
      reviews studying interventions for patients with socioeconomic risk. For patients 
      with medically complex conditions, discharge planning, medication management, and 
      interdisciplinary care teams were associated with inconsistent outcomes (LOS, 
      readmissions, mortality) across populations. For patients with heart failure, 
      clinical pathways and case management were associated with reduced length of stay 
      (clinical pathways: mean difference reduction, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.33 to 2.44] days; 
      case management: mean difference reduction, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.52 to 2.04] days). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review found inconsistent results 
      across all high-risk populations on the effectiveness associated with 
      interventions, such as discharge planning, that are often widely used by health 
      systems. This systematic review highlights important evidence gaps, such as the 
      lack of existing systematic reviews focused on patients with socioeconomic risk 
      factors, and the need for further research.

AB  - The management of frailty in older persons is not easy, implying interventions 
      beyond the simple prescription of medications. Biological complexity, 
      multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and social issues often hamper the possibility to 
      directly translate the evidence coming from research into clinical practice. 
      Frailty indeed represents the most relevant cause of the “evidence-based medicine 
      issue” influencing clinical decisions in geriatric care. Today, patients with 
      Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are much older and frailer than some decades ago. They 
      also tend to have more drugs prescribed. In parallel, research on AD has evolved 
      over the years, hypothesizing that anticipating the interventions to the earliest 
      stages of the disease may provide beneficial effects (to date, still lacking). In 
      this article, we argue that, by focusing exclusively on “the disease” and pushing 
      to anticipate its detection (sometimes even before the appareance of its clinical 
      manifestations) may overshadow the person’s values and priorities. Research

      the design of clinical trials in order to provide results that can be implemented 
      in real life. On the other hand, clinicians should be less prone to the easy (but 
      unsupported by evidence) pharmacological prescription.
