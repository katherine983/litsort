AB  - The interplay of frailty, multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the older person 
      results in complex care needs. Monitoring and proactive management of chronic 
      diseases in this context can be challenging. Early identification of 
      deterioration reduces the risk of hospitalisation in older people, particularly 
      in residential care, where the person can be particularly vulnerable. 
      Deterioration of a resident often results in an expectation of in-hospital care, 
      which especially where there are life-limiting conditions, may not align to the 
      wishes of the person and their family. However, links between tertiary hospital 
      services with the expertise to upskill and mentor those providing the more 
      complex care to residents of aged care facilities need to be developed. Current 
      models of care need to be adapted to incorporate the provision of specialist 
      nursing within residential facilities to support higher-level care delivered in 
      the person's familiar environment, improve the person and family experience, and 
      reduce the costs and potential for iatrogenic problems associated with 
      hospitalisation. Vascular dysfunction is common in aged care and results in 
      impaired healing and complex wounds. We developed a Vascular and Geriatric (VaG) 
      model of care to support specialist care for aged care residents with vascular 
      dysfunction. The VaG model enhances existing links between hospital and 
      residential care settings and builds workforce capacity in residential care 
      facilities by the use of clinical consultation, peer learning and networking to 
      increase the vascular skill set initially of the hospital outreach nurse and then 
      modelled to residential care clinicians. This paper reports the development and 
      implementation of the VaG model as part of the Aged Care Outreach Service.

TI  - Impact of Social Frailty on Relocation of Older Adults.
PG  - 254-258
LID - 10.14283/jfa.2021.3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between frailty and variables such as housing are 
      the least included in models of frailty and research on frailty or social frailty 
      and relocation is negligible. The decision to relocate is complex and demanding 
      for older adults with a loss of independence but little is known about what makes 
      older adults relocate to congregated housing designated for older adults, let 
      alone in combination with social frailty, and how they navigate this transition. 
      OBJECTIVES: This mixed method descriptive study aims to understand the influence 
      of social frailty for a population of French-speaking semi-independent older 
      adults relocating to a housing continuum community. DESIGN: Semi-structured 
      individual interviews including sociodemographic data and the PRISMA-7 Frailty 
      Scale were conducted with recently relocated older adults. SETTING: A newly 
      opened French-speaking housing continuum community in Eastern Canada that offers 
      luxury apartments for independent older adults, two assisted living facilities 
      for semi-independent older adults along with a long-term care facility. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine older adults with a mean age of 85 years, mostly 
      female, married or widowed and highly educated. MEASUREMENTS: Content analysis of 
      the transcribed recorded interviews and descriptive statistical analyses to 
      examine relationships between the frailty PRISMA-7 scale, answers to additional 
      questions and the sociodemographic data. RESULTS: There was not a significant 
      difference in the scores for socialization before and after relocation nor 
      between prior help and current help; however, there was a significant negative 
      correlation between help and socialization before and after relocation. Three 
      main themes included: imposed influences, push and pull factors and post 
      relocation. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that several social factors 
      contributed to relocation and that participants were experiencing social frailty. 
      Participants were at the crossover point of being vulnerable to experiencing 
      additional deficits which would potentially have led to higher frailty had they 
      not relocated.

TI  - Recognizing and responding to deterioration in care homes: a scoping review 
      protocol.
PG  - 447-453
LID - 10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00413 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the available published primary research and any relevant 
      policies, guidelines, or protocols regarding how care home staff recognize and 
      respond to an acutely deteriorating resident. INTRODUCTION: Older people living 
      in care homes have complex health care needs. Chronic illnesses, comorbidities, 
      frailty, cognitive impairment, and physical dependency can contribute to 
      unpredictable changes in their health status that can lead to residents becoming 
      unwell and acutely deteriorating. Exploring how care home staff recognize and 
      respond to acutely deteriorating health among residents is important to 
      understand whether opportunities exist to minimize these unpredictable changes in 
      health. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will consider studies that 
      feature the recognition and response to acute deterioration in care home 
      residents. This review will consider qualitative and quantitative primary 
      research. Non-indexed and gray literature such as policies, deterioration tools, 
      and reports from health policy organizations will also be included. METHODS: The 
      searches will be conducted using bibliographic databases, university 
      repositories, and non-indexed and gray literature, such as reports by health care 
      and health policy organizations. The studies will be independently selected from 
      the inclusion criteria by two researchers based on their title and abstract. In 
      case of disagreement, a third researcher will be consulted. An adapted version of 
      the JBI data extraction form will be used to extrapolate data from included 
      studies. The results will be presented in tabular form, accompanied by a 
      narrative summary related to the objectives of the scoping review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a common but complex problem in older adults. Frailty 
      assessment using routine clinical data has been suggested as a pragmatic approach 
      based on electronic health records from primary care center or hospital settings. 
      PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the tools and outcome variables used in the 
      published studies on frailty assessment using routine clinical data. METHODS: An 
      integrative literature review was conducted using the method of Whittemore and 
      Knafl. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from 
      January 2010 to October 2021. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies and thirteen frailty 
      assessment tools were analyzed. The assessment items were generally biased toward 
      frailty's risk factors rather than the mechanisms or phenotypes of frailty. 
      Similar to using conventional tools, routine clinical data-based frailty was 
      associated with adverse health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessment based on 
      routine clinical data could efficiently evaluate frailty using electronic health 
      records from primary care centers or hospitals. However, they need refinement to 
      consider the risk factors, mechanisms, and frailty phenotypes.

TI  - Relationship between Multimorbidity and Disability in Elderly Patients with 
      Coexisting Frailty Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19063461 [doi]
LID - 3461
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is a common problem worldwide. It carries the risk of 
      reduced quality of life, disability, frequent hospitalizations, and death. The 
      present study was designed to assess the relationships that exist between 
      multimorbidity and disability in elderly patients. METHODS: The study included 
      100 patients and was conducted between October 2020 and January 2021. Inclusion 
      criteria included age &gt;65 years, presence of a minimum of two comorbidities in 
      the subject, and consent to participate in the study. Standardized survey 
      instruments such as Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), Charlson Comorbidities Index 
      (CCI), Assessment of Basic Activities of Daily Living-Katz Scale (ADL), and 
      Assessment of Complex Activities of Daily Living-Lawton Scale (IADL) were used in 
      the study. RESULTS: The majority of the subjects (92) had a frailty syndrome 
      (TFI). A small group of respondents (8%) suffered from severe comorbidities 
      (CCI). Among the subjects surveyed, 71% maintained full function in performing 
      simple activities of daily living (ADL), while 29% demonstrated moderate 
      disability on the scale. Full independence in performing complex activities of 
      daily living (IADL) was present in 33% of the respondents, and 67% were partially 
      independent. Independence in complex activities of daily living (IADL) was 
      significantly higher in patients with fewer comorbidities. The severity of 
      comorbidities (CCI) had a significant effect on the decrease in the level of 
      independence (ADL and IADL). Independence in performing complex activities (IADL) 
      was worse among older patients. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the number of 
      comorbidities contributes to a decrease in the level of performance of complex 
      activities of daily living. The severity of comorbidities significantly reduces 
      the level of independence of the subjects in simple and complex activities of 
      daily living. In patients with a higher level of independence in performing 
      simple and complex activities, the co-occurrence of frailty syndrome was less 
      severe. As the age of the subjects increases, the frequency in which they show 
      moderate dependence on third parties in performing complex activities of daily 
      living increases.

TI  - Relatives' experiences with abuse and neglect in Norwegian nursing homes. A 
      qualitative study.
PG  - 684

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elder abuse in nursing homes (NH) is a widespread and complex 
      problem. Residents' ability to share their experiences are impeded, due to a high 
      degree of cognitive problems and frailty, and previous studies are thus mainly 
      based on reports from staff. Therefore, we aimed to give voice to the residents 
      by investigating their relatives' experiences with elder abuse in NH. METHODS: 
      Qualitative individual interviews were conducted with 16 relatives of residents 
      with experience of abuse and/or neglect in NH. Content analysis was used to 
      analyse the data. RESULTS: Relatives perceived neglect as most pervasive and 
      staff-to-resident psychological abuse as a key problem. Physical abuse was mostly 
      related to resident-to-resident aggression. Relatives perceived elder abuse in NH 
      to be related to low competence among staff, low staffing, poor NH leadership, 
      working cultures characterized by fear and loyalty to employer or co-workers, and 
      a lack of individualized care for the residents. Furthermore, relatives 
      themselves experienced maltreatment from NH, which caused them to suffer stress, 
      anxiety and distrust. Relatives also expressed a need to compensate for lack of 
      care. CONCLUSIONS: Relatives of NH residents who had experienced abuse reported 
      that neglect of basic care and individual rights was predominant and viewed 
      organizational explanations as most important. Relatives perceive themselves as 
      collaborators in care and are emotionally attached to their family member. 
      Therefore, if relatives experience resident abuse or neglect, it inflicts a 
      feeling of being mistreated themselves, particularly if they are not listened to 
      or their notice of abuse on the part of the resident is ignored or trivialized. 
      Including relatives in a committed partnership with NH in care practices is not 
      only a valuable path to reduce the risk of abuse, but it also leads to a more 
      sustainable healthcare with high standards of quality and safety.

TI  - Association between preoperative frailty and outcomes among adults undergoing 
      cardiac surgery: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - E777-E787
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20200034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of frailty before complex and invasive procedures 
      may have relevance for prognostic and recovery purposes, to optimally inform 
      patients, caregivers and clinicians about perioperative risk and postoperative 
      care needs. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of frailty and 
      describe the associated clinical course and outcomes of patients referred for 
      nonemergent cardiac surgery. METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients aged 50 
      years and older referred for nonemergent cardiac surgery in Alberta, Canada, from 
      November 2011 to March 2014 were screened preoperatively for frailty, defined as 
      a Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score of 5 or greater. Postoperatively, patients 
      were followed by telephone to assess CFS score, health services use and vital 
      status. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes 
      included health services use, hospital discharge disposition, 1-year 
      health-related quality of life and all-cause 5-year mortality. RESULTS: The 
      cohort (n = 529) had a mean age of 67 (standard deviation [SD] 9) years; 25.9% 
      were female, and the prevalence of frailty was 9.6% (n = 51; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 7.3%-12.5%). Frail patients were older (median age 75, 
      interquartile range [IQR] 65-80 v. 67, IQR 60-73, yr; p < 0.001), were more 
      likely to be female (51.0% v. 23.2%; p < 0.001), had a higher mean EuroSCORE II 
      (8, SD 3 v. 5, SD 3; p < 0.001) and received combined coronary artery bypass 
      grafting and valve procedures more frequently (29.4% v. 15.9%; p = 0.02) than 
      nonfrail patients. Postoperatively, frail patients had a longer median duration 
      of stay in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (median difference 2.2, 95% CI 
      1.60-2.79) and hospital (median difference 9.3, 95% CI 8.2-10.3). Hospital 
      mortality was 9.8% among frail patients and 1.0% among nonfrail patients 
      (adjusted hazard ratio 3.84, 95% CI 0.90-16.34). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative 
      frailty was present in 10% of patients and was associated with a higher risk of 
      morbidity and greater health services use. Preoperative frailty has important 
      implications for the postoperative clinical course and resource utilization of 
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

TI  - Integrated care for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium: Lessons

AB  - The corona pandemic challenges countries worldwide in many different ways. Due to 
      its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several 
      shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and 
      deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, 
      such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has 
      quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The 
      nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive 
      collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before 
      this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was 
      mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care 
      between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this 
      specific and complex care in their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
      This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital 
      and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, 
      resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge 
      exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more 
      efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.

TI  - The impact of frailty Screening of Older adults with muLtidisciplinary assessment 
      of those At Risk during emergency hospital attendance on the quality, safety and 
      cost-effectiveness of care (SOLAR): a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people account for 25% of all Emergency Department (ED) 
      admissions. This is expected to rise with an ageing demographic. Older people 
      often present to the ED with complex medical needs in the setting of multiple 
      comorbidities. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been shown to improve 
      outcomes in an inpatient setting but clear evidence of benefit in the ED setting 
      has not been established. It is not feasible to offer this resource-intensive 
      assessment to all older adults in a timely fashion. Screening tools for frailty 
      have been used to identify those at most risk for adverse outcomes following ED 
      visit. The overall aim of this study is to examine the impact of CGA on the 
      quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of care in an undifferentiated population 
      of frail older people with medical complaints who present to the ED and Acute 
      Medical Assessment Unit. METHODS: This will be a parallel 1:1 allocation 
      randomised control trial. All patients who are ≥ 75 years will be screened for 
      frailty using the Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) tool. Those with a 
      score of ≥ 2 on the ISAR will be randomised. The treatment arm will undergo 
      geriatric medicine team-led CGA in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit 
      whereas the non-treatment arm will undergo usual patient care. A dedicated 
      multidisciplinary team of a specialist geriatric medicine doctor, senior 
      physiotherapist, specialist nurse, pharmacist, senior occupational therapist and 
      senior medical social worker will carry out the assessment, as well as 
      interventions that arise from that assessment. Primary outcomes will be the 
      length of stay in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit. Secondary outcomes 
      will include ED re-attendance, re-hospitalisation, functional decline, quality of 
      life and mortality at 30 days and 180 days. These will be determined by telephone 
      consultation and electronic records by a research nurse blinded to group 
      allocation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the 
      Health Service Executive (HSE) Mid-Western Regional Hospital Research Ethics 
      Committee (088/2020). Our lay dissemination strategy will be developed in 
      collaboration with our Patient and Public Involvement stakeholder panel of older 
      people at the Ageing Research Centre and we will present our findings in 
      peer-reviewed journals and national and international conferences. TRIAL

TI  - Can an individualized adherence education program delivered by nurses improve 
      therapeutic adherence in elderly people with acute myocardial infarction?: A 
      randomized controlled study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ageing of the population is leading to an increase in the number 
      of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. These patients are at 
      higher risk for complications and poor medication adherence, which in turn are 
      associated with higher healthcare resource expenditures. Nursing programmes might 
      help to improve adherence in these complex patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of 
      this study was to assess the impact of a nursing intervention on therapeutic 
      adherence in elderly patients after myocardial infarction compared to a control 
      group. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS: Heart 
      disease institute of a tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥75 
      years with myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed during the admission 
      in all patients (N=143). Patients were randomly allocated to a nursing 
      intervention group (n=68) or a usual care group (n=75). In patients from the 
      intervention group, a nursing intervention programme was performed 3 months after 
      admission based on education support and patient monitoring to improve 
      therapeutic adherence. The main outcome measured was 12-months therapeutic 
      adherence, as defined by a combination of measurement tools (Morisky-Green and 
      Hayness-Sacket scales, attendance at visits and withdrawal of medication from the 
      pharmacy). Therapeutic adherence was assessed by nurses blinded to the assignment 
      group. RESULTS: The mean age was 82.2 years. The proportion of comorbidities was 
      significant (diabetes mellitus 51/143 (35.7%), hypertension 110/143 (76.9%), 
      prior stroke 22/143 (15.4%)). Likewise, the proportion of geriatric syndromes was 
      noticeable (frailty 26/143 (18.2%), risk of malnutrition 38/143 (26.6%), 
      cognitive impairment 28/143 (19.6%)). Most patients (92.3%) had a low educational 
      level. A total of 119 patients achieved 12-month assessment adherence. Among 
      these patients, the proportions of adherence were as follows: Morisky-Green test: 
      76/119 (63.9%), Haynes-Sackett test 99/119 (83.2%), medical visits compliance 
      95/119 (79.8%), and correct acquisition of drugs in the pharmacy 74/119 (62.2%). 
      A total of 42/119 patients (35.3%) were adherent as defined by the combination of 
      the 4 measures. Therapeutic adherence at 12 months was achieved in a 
      significantly higher proportion of patients from the nursing intervention group 
      (51.9% vs 21.5%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of elderly 
      patients with myocardial infarction were non-adherent at 12 months. The 
      proportion of adherent patients was highly variable according to the different 
      tools used. A structured nursing intervention was independently associated with a 
      higher adherence rate, as assessed by a multidimensional measurement, in this 
      subset of complex high-risk elderly patients with myocardial infarction. TRIAL

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The population is ageing, with increasing health and supportive 
      care needs. For older people, complex chronic health conditions and frailty can 
      lead to a cascade of repeated hospitalisations and further decline. Existing 
      solutions are fragmented and not person centred. The proposed Being Your Best 
      programme integrates care across hospital and community settings to address 
      symptoms of frailty. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre pragmatic mixed methods 
      study aiming to recruit 80 community-dwelling patients aged ≥65 years recently 
      discharged from hospital. Being Your Best is a codesigned 6-month programme that 
      provides referral and linkage with existing services comprising four modules to 
      prevent or mitigate symptoms of physical, nutritional, cognitive and social 
      frailty. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of recruitment, acceptability of 
      the intervention to participants and level of retention in the programme. Changes 
      in frailty (Modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State 
      Examination), functional ability (Barthel and Lawton), loneliness (University of 
      California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-3 items) and nutrition (Malnutrition 
      Screening Tool) will also be measured at 6 and 12 months. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from Monash Health Human Research 
      Ethics Committee (RES-19-0000904L). Results will be disseminated through 
      peer-reviewed journals, conference and seminar presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Blood pressure control and complex health conditions in older adults: impact of 
      recent hypertension management guidelines.
PG  - 280-289
LID - 10.1038/s41371-020-0334-4 [doi]
AB  - The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 
      2017 guidelines for hypertension management lowered blood pressure (BP) 
      thresholds to 130/80 mmHg to define hypertension while the European Society of 
      Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) 2018 guidelines 
      retained 140/90 mmHg. Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older 
      patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how 
      to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the 
      prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of 
      participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used 
      data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65+ aged between 67 and 80 
      years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were 
      self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants 
      reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. 
      Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% 
      percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using 
      ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four 
      out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, 
      i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA 
      guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a 
      serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex 
      health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how 
      to manage hypertension.

PG  - 555
LID - 10.1186/s12877-021-02524-z [doi]
LID - 555
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frail older adults who are hospitalized, are more likely to 
      experience missed nursing care (MNC) due to high care needs, communication 
      problems, and complexity of nursing care. We conducted a qualitative study to 
      examine the factors affecting MNC among hospitalized frail older adults in the 
      medical units. METHODS: This qualitative study was carried using the conventional 
      content analysis approach in three teaching hospitals. Semi-structured interviews 
      were conducted with 17 nurses through purposive and snowball sampling. The 
      inclusion criteria for the nurses were: at least two years of clinical work 
      experience on a medical ward, caring for frail older people in hospital and 
      willingness to participate. Data were analyzed in accordance with the process 
      described by Graneheim and Lundman. In addition, trustworthiness of the study was 
      assessed using the criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba. RESULTS: In general, 20 
      interviews were conducted with nurses. A total of 1320 primary codes were 
      extracted, which were classified into two main categories: MNC aggravating and 
      moderating factors. Factors such as "age-unfriendly structure," "inefficient 
      care," and "frailty of older adults" could increase the risk of MNC. In addition, 
      factors such as "support capabilities" and "ethical and legal requirements" will 
      moderate MNC. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized frail older adults are more at risk of 
      MNC due to high care needs, communication problems, and nursing care complexity. 
      Nursing managers can take practical steps to improve the quality of care by 
      addressing the aggravating and moderating factors of MNC. In addition, nurses 
      with a humanistic perspective who understand the multidimensional problems of 
      frail older adults and pay attention to their weakness in expressing needs, can 
      create a better experience for them in the hospital and improve patient safety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of health care interventions is co-determined by 
      contextual factors. Unknown is the extent of this impact on patient outcomes. 
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore which characteristics of general 
      practices are associated with patient outcomes in a proactive primary care 
      program, the U-PROFIT 2.0. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was 
      conducted from January 2016 till October 2017. Two questionnaires were send out, 
      one to collect characteristics of general practices such as practice 
      neighbourhood socio-economic status, general practice versus healthcare centre 
      (involving multiple primary care professionals), and professional- frail older 
      patient ratio per practice of general practitioners and practice nurses. 
      Regarding delivering the program, the practice or district nurse who delivered 
      the program, number of years since the start of the implementation, and choice of 
      age threshold for frailty screening were collected. Patient outcomes collected by 
      the second questionnaire and send to frail patients were daily functioning, 
      hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and general practice 
      out-of-hours consultations. Linear and generalized linear mixed models were used. 
      RESULTS: A total of 827 frail older people were included at baseline. Delivery of 
      the program by a district nurse compared to a practice nurse was significantly 
      associated with a decrease in daily functioning on patient-level (β = 2.19; 
      P = < 0.001). Duration since implementation of 3 years compared to 9 years was 
      significantly associated with less out-of-hours consultations to a general 
      practice (OR 0.11; P = 0.001). Applying frailty screening from the age of 75 
      compared to those targeted from the age of 60 showed a significant increase in 
      emergency visits (OR 5.26; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Three associations regarding 
      the organizational context 1) the nurse who delivered the program, 2) the number 
      of years the program was implemented and 3) the age threshold for defining a 
      frail patient are significant and clinically relevant for frail patients that 
      receive a proactive primary care program. In general, contextual factors need 
      more attention when implementing complex primary care programs which can result 
      in better balanced choices to enhance effective proactive care for older people 
      living in the community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To provide value-based care for patients with multi-morbidity, 
      innovative integrated care programmes and comprehensive evaluations of such 
      programmes are required. In Norway, a new programme called "Holistic Continuity 
      of Patient Care" (HCPC) addresses the issue of multi-morbidity by providing 
      integrated care within learning networks for frail elderly patients who receive 
      municipal home care services or a short-term stay in a nursing home. This study 
      conducts a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate whether the HCPC 
      programme performs better on a large set of outcomes corresponding to the 'triple 
      aim' compared to usual care. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal survey data were 
      collected at baseline and follow-up after 6-months. The assessment of HCPC was 
      implemented by a novel MCDA framework. The relative weights of importance of the 
      outcomes used in the MCDA were obtained from a discrete choice experiment among 
      five different groups of stakeholders. The performance score was estimated using 
      a quasi-experimental design and linear mixed methods. Performance scores were 
      standardized and multiplied by their weights of importance to obtain the overall 
      MCDA value by stakeholder group. RESULTS: At baseline in the HCPC and usual care 
      groups, respectively, 120 and 89 patients responded, of whom 87 and 41 responded 
      at follow-up. The average age at baseline was 80.0 years for HCPC and 83.6 for 
      usual care. Matching reduced the standardized differences between the groups for 
      patient background characteristics and outcome variables. The MCDA results 
      indicated that HCPC was preferred to usual care irrespective of stakeholders. The 
      better performance of HCPC was mostly driven by improvements in enjoyment of 
      life, psychological well-being, and social relationships and participation. 
      Results were consistent with sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation. 
      CONCLUSION: Frail elderly with multi-morbidity represent complex health problems 
      at large costs for society in terms of health- and social care. This study is a 
      novel contribution to assessing and understanding HCPC programme performance 
      respecting the multi-dimensionality of desired outcomes. Integrated care 
      programmes like HCPC may improve well-being of patients, be cost-saving, and 
      contribute to the pursuit of evidence based gradual reforms in the care of frail 
      elderly.

TI  - Implications of the Metabolic Control of Diabetes in Patients with Frailty 
      Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191610327 [doi]
LID - 10327
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Frailty syndrome occurs more frequently in patients with diabetes 
      than in the general population. The reasons for this more frequent occurrence and 
      the interdependence of the two conditions are not well understood. To date, there 
      is no fully effective method for the diagnosis, prevention, and monitoring of 
      frailty syndrome. This study aimed to assess the degree of metabolic control of 
      diabetes in patients with frailty syndrome and to determine the impact of frailty 
      on the course of diabetes using a retrospective analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 103 individuals aged 60+ with diabetes were studied. The study 
      population included 65 women (63.1%) and 38 men (36.9%). The mean age was 72.96 
      years (SD 7.55). The study was conducted in the practice of a general 
      practitioner in Wielkopolska in 2018-2019. The research instrument was the 
      authors' original medical history questionnaire. The questions of the 
      questionnaire were related to age, education, and sociodemographic situation of 
      the respondents, as well as their dietary habits, health status, and use of 
      stimulants. Other instruments used were: the Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE), Lawton Scale (IADL-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), Katz Scale 
      (ADL-Activities of Daily Living), Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS), and 
      SHARE-FI scale (Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe). 
      Anthropometric and biochemical tests were performed. RESULTS: In the study, 
      frailty syndrome was diagnosed using the SHARE-FI scale in 26 individuals (25%): 
      32 (31.1%) were pre-frailty and 45 (43.7%) represented a non-frailty group. 
      Statistical analysis revealed that elevated HbA1c levels were associated with a 
      statistically significant risk of developing frailty syndrome (p = 0.048). In 
      addition, the co-occurrence of diabetes and frailty syndrome was found to be a 
      risk factor for loss of functional capacity or limitation in older adults (p = 
      0.00) and was associated with the risk of developing depression (p &lt; 0.001) 
      and cognitive impairment (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Concerning metabolic 
      control of diabetes, higher HbA1c levels in the elderly are a predictive factor 
      for the development of frailty syndrome. No statistical significance was found 
      for the other parameters of metabolic control in diabetes. People with frailty 
      syndrome scored significantly higher on the Geriatric Depression Rating Scale and 
      lower on the MMSE cognitive rating scale than the comparison group. This suggests 
      that frailty is a predictive factor for depression and cognitive impairment. 
      Patients with frailty and diabetes have significantly lower scores on the Basic 
      Activities of Daily Living Rating Scale and the Complex Activities of Daily 
      Living Rating Scale, which are associated with loss or limitation of functioning. 
      Frailty syndrome is a predictive factor for loss of functional capacity in the 
      elderly.

AB  - Objective To clarify the hotspots and trends of multimorbidity research and to 
      provide evidence for further research in China. Methods Papers on multimorbidity 
      were retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science (from inception to August 
      11,2021).BICOMB and gCLUTO were used for bibliometric and clustering analysis,and 
      CiteSpace was employed for analysis of authors and citations,and burst detection 
      of keywords. Results The research on multimorbidity has been on the rise.Among 
      the authors,Mercer SW published the most papers on this topic and Fortin M was 
      the most cited author.Karolinska Institute topped the institutions in the number 
      of published papers,and the paper published in Lancet by Barnett K in 2012 was 
      the most cited.A total of 75 high-frequency keywords were extracted,on the basis 
      of which seven research hotspots were summarized:epidemiology (including the 
      prevalence and trend),medication (involving polypharmacy,medication 
      compliance,etc.),medical expenditure (including cost and medical services),aging 
      (such as elderly patients,frailty,and disability),psychology (involving mental 
      health,social support,etc.),multimorbidity management (such as the 
      treatment,primary health care,and integrated care),and comorbidity of 
      cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (involving obesity,stroke,diabetes,etc.). 
      Conclusions Multimorbidity is concerned as a major health threat and public 
      health problem worldwide.The management of multimorbidity is more complex than 
      that of one disease,which thus faces more challenges.Therefore,researchers,health 
      care providers,and policy-makers should underscore it.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome and serves as an indicator 
      for functional degradation in older adults. Regular exercise intervention could 
      reduce the level of frailty and improve general physical fitness. The aim of this 
      study was to test the effects of the Vitality Acupunch (VA) exercise on the 
      promotion of physical fitness and the improvement of frailty status among frail 
      older adults in long-term care facilities. METHOD: This study was a 
      cluster-randomized controlled trial adopted a pretest-posttest design. Using 
      convenience sampling, 81 frail adults older than 65 years of age from 10 
      long-term care facilities participated in this study. The older adults were 
      cluster-randomized by facility into an intervention group (5 long-term care 
      facilities, n = 40) and a control group (5 long-term care facilities, n = 41). 
      The intervention group engaged in the VA exercise 3 times a week, each lasting 
      40 min, for 24 weeks. The control group maintained regular activities of daily 
      living. The outcome measures for physical fitness were assessed before study 
      began (pretest), at the 12th week (posttest 1), and at the 24th week (posttest 2) 
      in the study. RESULTS: After a 24-week intervention, the frail older adults who 
      engaged in the VA exercise program showed significant improvements in handgrip 
      strength, upper-limb muscle endurance, lung function, shoulder flexibility, 
      forward flexion, shoulder joint flexion, and shoulder joint abduction (all 
      p < 0.05) but not in lower-limb muscle endurance (p = 0.502) compared against 
      their pretest data. The intervention group had significantly better physical 
      fitness and positive changes in frailty status than the control group (all 
      p < 0.001), except for the lower-limb muscle endurance (p = 0.557). CONCLUSION: 
      Regular engagement in the VA exercise program for 24 weeks significantly improved 
      the physical fitness and frailty status of frail older adults in long-term care 
      facilities.

LID - e061303
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older people receiving healthcare in long-term care contexts (eg, 
      home healthcare, sheltered housing and nursing home contexts) are especially 
      vulnerable to developing frailty and functional decline. Considering the negative 
      effects associated with these conditions and the possibility of preventing them 
      from progressing, it is vital that nurses possess a broad knowledge base related 
      to them. Particularly as prevention related to these conditions lies well within 
      their remit. Such knowledge could guide the development of effective models of 
      care, ensuring continuity and, hence, quality of care. Our objective will be to 
      review published literature on existing models of care targeting frailty and/or 
      functional decline and how these conditions are described by older people 
      themselves, significant others and nurses in relation to long-term care. METHODS 
      AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review will be conducted in accordance with Arksey and 
      O'Malley's methodological framework. Recent methodological developments will be 
      considered. PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO will be searched. Eligibility criteria 
      will be peer-reviewed papers and written in English. All types of study designs 
      will be eligible and included papers will be quality and ethically assessed. The 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      (PRISMA)-Protocol checklist for protocols and the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews 
      checklist were followed in this paper. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As the study 
      outlined in this protocol is a scoping review, no ethics approval was needed for 
      this protocol nor for the upcoming study. The findings will be published in an 
      open-access, peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, the findings will guide a 
      research project following the Medical Research Council's framework for 
      developing and evaluating complex interventions. Thus, supporting us in 
      developing a model of care related to the detection and prevention of frailty 
      and/or functional decline among older people in a long-term care context.

TI  - Clinical Decision Path for Identifying Recurrent Falls in Late Middle-Aged and 
      Older Patients With Chronic Schizophrenia.
PG  - e167
LID - 10.1097/JNR.0000000000000444 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls are a major hazard for elderly patients with schizophrenia. As 
      patients with schizophrenia may experience a more-accelerated rate of physical 
      aging than the overall elderly population, the risk of falls may emerge during 
      the late middle-age period in this population. Furthermore, the risk of falls is 
      affected by multiple, interrelated risk factors. PURPOSE: This study was 
      undertaken to capture the complexity of the risk of falls in patients with 
      schizophrenia. A cross-sectional approach was used to apply classification and 
      regression tree (CART) analysis to generate a clinical decision path to identify 
      the risk factors of recurrent falls in late middle-aged and older patients with 
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-one patients aged 55 years or older 
      were recruited from psychiatric halfway houses for assessment. Frailty, physical 
      functional performance, depressive severity, cognitive function, and level of 
      fatigue were measured, respectively, using the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures 
      Frailty Index, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Center for 
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Short Portable Mental Status 
      Questionnaire (SPMSQ), and Chinese version of the Fatigue Severity Scale. The 
      variables revealed by descriptive statistics to be statistically significant were 
      further analyzed using CART analysis. RESULTS: The overall proportion of 
      recurrent fallers in this study was 19.2%. CART analysis revealed eight end 
      groups and identified four predictors: frailty, physical functional performance, 
      cognitive function, and sex. The most prominent condition for recurrent fallers 
      was frailty, present in 57.1% of the frail participants. In the nonfrail group 
      (both prefrail and robust), participants with an SPPB score of less than 10 had a 
      29.7% chance of being a recurrent faller versus 13.6% for those with an SPPB 
      score of 10 or more. Furthermore, an SPMSQ score of 7 was the next-best split 
      among participants without frailty, with an SPPB score of 10 or more. Finally, 
      among participants without frailty and with an SPPB score of 10 or more and an 
      SPMSQ score of more than 7, the proportion of recurrent fallers was higher in 
      women than men. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that assessing 
      frailty status may be an effective, first-step approach to identifying 
      schizophrenic patients at an increased risk of recurrent falls. Among patients 
      with prefrailty or robust status, an SPPB score cutoff of 10, an SPMSQ score 
      cutoff of 7, and being female may be used sequentially to identify individuals at 
      a heightened risk of recurrent falls.

TI  - Optimal Staffing Models To Care For Frail Older Adults In Primary Care And 
      Geriatrics Practices In The US.
PG  - 1368-1376
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00401 [doi]
AB  - Different staffing configurations in primary and geriatric care practices could 
      have implications for how best to deliver services that are essential for a 
      growing population of older adults. Using data from a 2018 survey of physicians 
      (MDs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) working in primary and geriatric care, we 
      assessed whether different configurations were associated with better or worse 
      performance on a number of standard process measures indicative of comprehensive, 
      high-quality primary care. Practices with a large concentration of MDs had the 
      highest estimated labor costs. Practices high in NPs and physician assistants 
      (PAs) were most common in states that grant full scope of practice to NPs. The 
      high-NP/PA configuration was associated with a 17-percentage-point greater 
      probability of facilitating patient visits and a 26-percentage-point greater 
      probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services compared with 
      the high-MD model. Team-based configurations had a 27.7-percentage-point greater 
      probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services. The complex 
      needs of older adults may be best served by team-based practices with a broad 
      provider mix that can provide a range of services in the office and the 
      community.

TI  - Deciding about the use of a Personal Safety Alerting Device-The need for a 
      legitimation process: A qualitative study.
PG  - 331-342
LID - 10.1111/jan.14566 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore reasons, thoughts, motives, and influencing factors regarding 
      the use or non-use of Personal Safety Alerting Devices (PSADs) in the daily lives 
      of community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study 
      design was used. METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 
      older persons between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the 
      Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. RESULTS: The participants described the use 
      or non-use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a "legitimation process". This 
      process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then 
      determine the right moment at which to start using it. During this process, each 
      person weighs her or his "ageing self" and "perception of technology" then 
      decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use. "Critical events" 
      initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and 
      their possible need for assistance. CONCLUSION: The legitimation process suggests 
      that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life. Using a PSAD 
      is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex decision-making process 
      establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual 
      ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the device. IMPACT: Older 
      persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the 
      legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this process, such 
      that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and 
      feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their 
      independence.

AB  - Frailty in old age has become synonymous with medication use. As people age, the 
      risk of disease burden increases. Older age is often linked with complex 
      healthcare needs, with a rise in the number of comorbidities. This often results 
      in the need to use multiple medications. Frailty is a global concern and requires 
      early interventions to help people maintain their health as they age. Advanced 
      clinical practitioners have an important role in supporting frail people living 
      in the community. This article will review the literature and explore strategies 
      that advanced practitioners can implement to optimise wellbeing and reduce 
      medicines-related harm for this vulnerable population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex 
      intervention, was conducted to examine its effectiveness as a 
      technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for frail older 
      persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where formal long-term care 
      has recently been introduced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
      implementation fidelity of the SPEC intervention and to identify moderating 
      factors that influence the implementation fidelity. METHODS: This study was a 
      process evaluation based on an evidence-based framework for implementation 
      fidelity using a mixed-methods design. Quantitative data from consultant 
      logbooks, NH documentations, an information and communications technology (ICT) 
      system, and a standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to 
      December 2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics. 
      Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary teams 
      from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a semi-structured questionnaire 
      and the focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The 
      SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and adherence to the SPEC 
      program was strong in all aspects, such as content, coverage, frequency, and 
      duration. Of the participating on-site coordinators, 60% reported that the SPEC 
      model positively impacted needs assessment and the reporting system for resident 
      care. The important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies, 
      assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies. CONCLUSION: The 
      effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good implementation fidelity. The 
      key factors of good implementation fidelity were tailored delivery of 
      evidence-based interventions over process evaluation work, facilitating 
      strategies, and ICT support. Larger implementation studies with a more 
      user-friendly ICT system are recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry,

TI  - Changes in home care clients' characteristics and home care in five European 
      countries from 2001 to 2014: comparison based on InterRAI - Home Care data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Policymakers advocate extended residence in private homes as people 
      age, rather than relocation to long-term care facilities. Consequently, it is 
      expected that older people living in their own homes will be frailer and have 
      more complex health problems over time. Therefore, community care for aging 
      people is becoming increasingly important to facilitate prevention of decline in 
      physical and cognitive abilities and unnecessary hospital admission and transfer 
      to a nursing home. The aim of this study was to examine changes in the 
      characteristic of home care clients and home care provided in five European 
      countries between 2001 and 2014 and to explore whether home care clients who are 
      most in need of care receive the care required. METHODS: This descriptive study 
      used data from two European research projects, Aged in Home Care (AdHOC; 
      2001-2002) and Identifying best practices for care-dependent elderly by 
      Benchmarking Costs and outcomes of Community Care (IBenC; 2014-2016). In both 
      projects, the InterRAI-Home Care assessment tool was used to assess a random 
      sample of home care clients 65 years and older in five European countries. These 
      data facilitate a comparison of physical and cognitive health and the provided 
      home care between countries and study periods. RESULTS: In most participating 
      countries, both cognitive (measured on the Cognitive Performance Scale) and 
      functional ability (measured on the Activities of Daily Living Hierarchy scale) 
      of home care clients deteriorated over a 10-year period. Home care provided 
      increased between the studies. Home care clients who scored high on the physical 
      and cognitive scales also received home care for a significantly higher duration 
      than those who scored low. CONCLUSION: Older people in several European countries 
      remain living in their own homes despite deteriorating physical and cognitive 
      skills. Home care services to this group have increased. This indicates that the 
      government policy of long-term residence at own home among older people, even in 
      increased frailty, has been realised.

TI  - Factors related to complex care needs of older adults in community-based 
      integrated care centers in Japan: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - e12440
LID - 10.1111/jjns.12440 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to identify the factors related to complex care needs of 
      older adults in community-based integrated care centers. METHODS: We sent 936 
      self-reported questionnaires to community-based integrated care center directors 
      in the Kinki region of Japan. These questionnaires included questions not only 
      about the directors' demographic data, but also regarding the sociodemographic, 
      psychosocial, and family-related dimensions of the older adults in the community 
      centers. The directors divided their cases into two categories: "Complex cases" 
      and "Straightforward cases." We compared the intergroup differences and examined 
      the factors related to complex care needs in older adults. RESULTS: A total of 
      232 directors responded. Complex cases were significantly associated with younger 
      age, poor health conditions, and having a family member who needs care, as 
      compared to straightforward cases where these associations were not present. 
      Logistic regression showed that in older adults, factors of refusing support or 
      social services, social isolation, and trouble with neighbors were associated 
      with their complexities. Additionally, family members with a high likelihood of 
      refusing social services, older adults without a key family member, and 
      difficulties in forming their consensus regarding care were associated with older 
      adults' complexities. CONCLUSION: Older adults with complex care needs could have 
      the risk of self-neglect, and their families faced difficulties in supporting 
      them as family members. Healthcare professions should carefully assess these 
      factors and develop needs-oriented services for them without their family support 
      as an upstream intervention.

TI  - Transitional care from skilled nursing facilities to home: study protocol for a 
      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial.
PG  - 120

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with 
      multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have 
      experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or 
      acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and 
      their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that 
      prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. METHODS: The study will test 
      the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care 
      intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their 
      caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following 
      discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial 
      design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard 
      discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute 
      data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the 
      standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a 
      two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of 
      Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation 
      RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A 
      key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff 
      to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The 
      primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver 
      preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided 
      test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in 
      the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed 
      models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to 
      assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of 
      life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden 
      and distress. DISCUSSION: Study results will determine the efficacy of an 
      intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for 
      seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of 
      acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and 
      (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative 
      care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol 
      was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was 
      revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, 
      and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing 
      these modifications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03810534 .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) conversations support people to think 
      about, discuss and document their beliefs, values and preferences regarding 
      future care. This process means that should the person loose capacity in the 
      future, care can be provided, consistent with their personal values and beliefs. 
      The ACP process is particularly relevant for older people living with frailty 
      (frail elders) as they are vulnerable to sudden deterioration. However, ACP is 
      rarely undertaken by frail elders. The aim of this study was to develop an 
      intervention to increase multidisciplinary health and social care professionals' 
      (H&SCPs) engagement of cognitively able, domestic-dwelling frail elders with ACP. 
      METHODS: Intervention development was guided by the Medical Research Council 
      framework for complex interventions and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Multiple 
      methods were used to understand ACP barriers and enablers: a systematic 
      integrative review, a survey (n = 73 H&SCPs), and semi-structured interviews 
      (n = 10 frail elders, n = 8 family members). A conceptual model, developed from 
      the integrative review, underpinned data collection for the survey and 
      interviews. Synthesis of this data, including patient and public involvement, was 
      then used to identify H&SCPs behaviours that needed to change for ACP to be 
      implemented and decide content and implementation for the intervention. RESULTS: 
      Following the Behaviour Change Wheel system, and based on the findings of the 
      review, survey and interviews, the prototype intervention, Conversations on 
      Living and Dying (CLaD), was developed. The CLaD prototype consisted of one 
      3.5-hour educational skills session for H&SCPs supported by a toolkit. Content 
      focussed on the relevance of ACP for frail elders, experience of ACP by frail 
      elders, and strategies H&SCPs could adopt to encourage frail elders' engagement 
      with ACP. Strategies include recognising the importance of relationships and 
      living well now, preparing frail elders for ACP conversations and starting ACP 
      early. Participants who took part in initial prototype refinement reported that 
      the intervention helped them think differently about ACP and encouraged them to 
      engage with frail elders. CONCLUSIONS: The use of behavioural theory enabled the 
      development of CLaD, an evidence-based, theory-driven, person-centred 
      intervention to support ACP engagement with frail elders. While feasibility 
      testing is required, initial prototype refinement demonstrated that H&SCPs found 
      the intervention to be acceptable, engaging, and clinically valuable in their 
      practice with frail elders and their families.

TI  - Sexual harassment or disinhibition? Residential care staff responses to older 
      adults' unwanted behaviours.
PG  - e12433
LID - 10.1111/opn.12433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ethical complexity of residential care is especially apparent for 
      staff responding to residents' inappropriate sexual expression, particularly when 
      directed towards care workers as these residents are typically frail, often 
      cognitively impaired, and require ongoing care. OBJECTIVES: To explore staff 
      accounts of how they made meaning of and responded to residents' unwanted sexual 
      behaviours directed towards staff. This exploration includes whether staff 
      appeared to accept harassment as a workplace hazard to be managed, or an 
      unacceptable workplace violation, or something else. METHODS: These qualitative 
      data are drawn from a national two-arm mixed method study in Aotearoa New Zealand 
      undertaken in 35 residential care facilities. Semi-structured interviews were 
      conducted with 77 staff, residents and family members. Interpretive description 
      was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Staff had numerous ways they used to 
      respond to behaviours: (1) minimisation, deflection and de-escalation, where 
      staff used strategies to minimise behaviours without requiring any accountability 
      from residents; (2) holding residents accountable, where staff to some degree 
      addressed the behaviour directly with residents; (3) blurred boundaries and 
      complexities in intimate long-term care, where staff noted that in a context 
      where touch is common-place, cognitive function was diminished and relationships 
      were long-term, boundaries were easily breached; (4) dehumanising and 
      infantilising residents' behaviours, where staff appeared to assert control 
      through diminishing the residents' identity as an older person. It was evident 
      that staff had developed considerable practice wisdom focused on preserving the 
      care relationship although few referred to policy and education guiding practice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Staff appeared to be navigating a complex ethical terrain with 
      thoughtfulness and skill. Care workers seemed reluctant to label resident 
      behaviour as sexual harassment, and the term may not fit for staff where they 
      perceive residents are frail and cognitively impaired. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
      Policy, education and clinical leadership are recommended to augment practice 
      wisdom and ensure staff and resident safety and dignity and to determine how best 
      to intervene with residents' unwanted sexual behaviours.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: An innovative care coordination program was developed to 
      enhance wellness among low-income older adults living in subsidized apartment 
      buildings and to provide rich interprofessional education experiences for health 
      professions students. METHODS: Program effectiveness for the residents was 
      measured through an evaluation of participation, services used, and healthcare 
      utilization. Educational effectiveness was measured through a change in health 
      concepts and perceptions of interprofessional practice. FINDINGS: Health care 
      utilization among participating residents showed an 8.6% reduction in emergency 
      department visits and 9.8% reduction in hospital admissions. Students 
      demonstrated improved knowledge in motivational interviewing (p = .02); diabetes 
      (p = .02); hypertension (p≤.01); and frailty (p≤.01). Changes in students 
      perception of interprofessional practice were significant in two areas; Teamwork 
      and Collaboration (p≥.00); and Person Centeredness (p = .00). DISCUSSION: This 
      care coordination model may be an effective approach to reduce care resource 
      utilization among medically complex lower income older adults and provides a rich 
      interprofessional learning experience for students.

TI  - Variability in Healthcare Expenditure According to the Stratification of Adjusted 
      Morbidity Groups in the Canary Islands (Spain).
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19074219 [doi]
LID - 4219
AB  - Morbidity is the main item in the distribution of expenditure on healthcare 
      services. The Adjusted Morbidity Group (AMG) measures comorbidity and complexity 
      and classifies the patient into mutually exclusive clinical categories. The aim 
      of this study is to analyse the variability of healthcare expenditure on users 
      with similar scores classified by the AMG. Observational analytical and 
      retrospective study. Population: 1,691,075 subjects, from Canary Islands (Spain), 
      aged over 15 years with data from health cards, clinical history, Basic Minimum 
      Specialised Healthcare Data Set, AMG, hospital agreements information system and 
      Electronic Prescriptions. A descriptive, bivariant (ANOVA coefficient η(2)) and 
      multivariant analysis was conducted. There is a correlation between the costs and 
      the weight of AMG (rho = 0.678) and the prescribed active ingredients (rho = 
      0.689), which is smaller with age and does not exist with the other variables. As 
      for the influence of the AMG morbidity group on the total costs of the patient, 
      the coefficient η(2) (0.09) obtains a median effect in terms of the variability 
      of expenditure, hence there is intra- and inter-group variability in the cost. In 
      a first model created with all the variables and the cost, an explanatory power 
      of 36.43% (R(2) = 0.3643) was obtained; a second model that uses solely active 
      ingredients, AMG weight, being female and a pensioner obtained an explanatory 
      power of 36.4%. There is room for improvement in terms of predicting the 
      expenditure.

TI  - The changing role of Advanced Clinical Practitioners working with older people 
      during the COVID- 19 pandemic: A qualitative research study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was identified as a pandemic by the World Health 
      Organisation (WHO) in December 2020. Advanced Clinical Practitioners (ACPs) in 
      England working with older people with frailty, experienced their clinical role 
      changing in response to the emergency health needs of this complex population 
      group. In contrast to other countries, in England Advanced Clinical Practitioners 
      are drawn from both nursing and allied health professions. Whilst much of the 
      literature emphasises the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the 
      Advanced Clinical Practitioners' role, the pandemic threw further light on its 
      potential and challenges. However, an initial review of the literature 
      highlighted a lack of research of Advanced Clinical Practitioners' capabilities 
      working with uncertainty in disaster response situations. AIM: To capture the 
      lived experience of how English Advanced Clinical Practitioners working with 
      older people adapted their roles in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (October 
      2020-January 2021). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative research 
      design was used. Following ethical approval, 23 Advanced Clinical Practitioner 
      volunteer participants from across England with varied health professional 
      backgrounds were recruited from Advanced Clinical Practitioners' professional and 
      social media networks on Twitter using a snowballing technique. METHODS: 
      Depending on preference or availability, 23 participants (nurses (18), 
      physiotherapists (2), paramedics (2) and a pharmacist (1)) were interviewed 
      singularly (n = 9) or as part of 3 focus groups (n = 14) using Zoom video 
      communication. Audio recordings were transcribed and using qualitative data 
      analysis software, NVivo 12 pro, coded for an essentialist thematic analysis of 
      Advanced Clinical Practitioners' responses using an inductive approach. 27 codes 
      were identified and collated into five themes. For the purposes of this paper, 
      four themes are discussed: experiencing different work, developing attributes, 
      negotiating barriers and changing future provision. FINDINGS: Advanced Clinical 
      Practitioners successfully transferred their advanced practice skills into areas 
      of clinical need during the pandemic. Their autonomous and generic, high level of 
      expertise equipped them for management and leadership positions where speed of 
      change, and the dissolution of traditional professional boundaries, were 
      prioritised. Barriers to progress included a lack of knowledge of the Advanced 
      Clinical Practitioner role and friction between Advanced Clinical Practitioners 
      and physicians. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the successful 
      adaption of the Advanced Clinical Practitioner role to enable more creative, 
      personalised and sustainable solutions in the care of older people living with 
      frailty during the pandemic. The potential of Advanced Clinical Practitioner 
      development is in a juxtaposition to the threat of pandemic services being 
      dismantled once the emergency nature of care has passed. Healthcare organisations 
      have a vital part to play in considering the enablers and barriers of Advanced 
      Clinical Practitioner capability-based practice when responding to uncertainty.

TI  - Sex disparities in the prevalence of physical function disabilities: a 
      population-based study in a low-income community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional disability continues to be a significant public health 
      problem that increases older adults' vulnerability to experience a diminished 
      quality of life, loss of independence, higher healthcare costs and health 
      services utilization, and increased risks of mortality. Thus, we aimed to study 
      the prevalence of functional disabilities by sex according to the types of daily 
      living activities, controlling for specific sociodemographic variables among 
      older Hispanics from low-income communities. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional 
      epidemiological research design, considering a complex sampling design of 
      households to interview adults ≥65 years living in low-income communities in 
      Puerto Rico. Functional disability was measured by the PROMIS® Physical Function 
      Short Form-20 T-score. The selected community was reported to have 5980 adult 
      residents ≥65 years, according to the USA Census. The prevalence of functional 
      disability was estimated using the logistic regression model, weighting by the 
      effect of the sampling. Our estimated prevalence was compared between sexes using 
      the prevalence ratio (PR), which was estimated with logistic regression models, 
      controlling for age, income, number of chronic conditions, high and low impact of 
      chronic conditions in functional disabilities, marital status, and sampling 
      design. RESULTS: We recruited 211 older Hispanics from a randomly selected 
      sample. Their mean age was 74.4 ± 7.1 years, with female predominance (57.3%). 
      The overall estimated prevalence of physical function disability using T-score 
      among females was 2.70 (95% CI: 1.4, 5.1) times the estimated prevalence of 
      physical function disability among males. Women were more likely to report 
      functional disabilities in instrumental activities of daily living, self-care 
      activities, and functional mobility compared to males. However, sex differences 
      were largely explained by the presence of musculoskeletal conditions of high 
      impact in functional disability. CONCLUSIONS: The females in our study bear the 
      greater burden of physical function disability in their adult age. Health 
      policies, as well as future studies, should be targeted at reducing the burden of 
      physical function disabilities in different types of daily activities through 
      gender-sensitive disability self-management programs.

TI  - Interdisciplinary staff perceptions of advance care planning in long-term care 
      homes: a qualitative study.
PG  - 127

AB  - BACKGROUND: Residents living in long-term care homes (LTCH) have complex care 
      needs, multiple chronic conditions, increasing frailty and cognitive impairment. 
      A palliative approach that incorporates advance care planning (ACP) should be 
      integrated with chronic disease management, yet it is not a norm in most LTCHs. 
      Despite its growing need, there remains a lack of staff engagement in the ACP 
      process. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and 
      experiences of interdisciplinary staff related to the practice of ACP in LTCHs. 
      METHODS: This study is part of a larger Canadian project, iCAN ACP, that aims to 
      increase uptake, and access to ACP for older Canadians living with frailty. An 
      exploratory qualitative design using an interpretive descriptive approach was 
      employed utilizing focus groups and semi-structured interviews with staff from 
      four LTCHs in Ontario, Canada. FINDINGS: There were 98 participants, including 
      nurses (n = 36), physicians (n = 4), personal support workers (n = 34), support 
      staff (n = 23), and a public guardian (n = 1). Three common themes and nine 
      subthemes were derived: a) ongoing nature of ACP; b) complexities around ACP 
      conversations; and c) aspirations for ACP becoming a standard of care in LTCHs. 
      DISCUSSION: The findings of this study provide important contributions to our 
      understanding of the complexities surrounding ACP implementation as a standard of 
      practice in LTCHs. One of the critical findings relates to a lack of ACP 
      conversations prior to admission in the LTCHs, by which time many residents may 
      have already lost cognitive abilities to engage in these discussions. The 
      hierarchical nature of LTCH staffing also serves as a barrier to the 
      interdisciplinary collaboration required for a successful implementation of ACP 
      initiatives. Participants within our study expressed support for ACP 
      communication and the need for open lines of formal and informal 
      interdisciplinary communication. There is a need for revitalizing care in LTCHs 
      through interdisciplinary care practices, clarification of role descriptions, 
      optimized staffing, capacity building of each category of staff and commitment 
      from the LTCH leadership for such care. CONCLUSION: The findings build on a 
      growing body of research illustrating the need to improve staff engagement in ACP 
      communication in LTCHs.

AB  - The assessment of care in homecare today is complex. Nurses have to decide on 
      care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise 
      solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, 
      however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, 
      in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud 
      interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary 
      in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for 
      the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like 
      the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes 
      clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a 
      person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised 
      in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to 
      focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a 
      person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that 
      training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently 
      seen health problems are recommended.

TI  - Effectiveness of a complex regional advance care planning intervention to improve 
      care consistency with care preferences: study protocol for a multi-center, 
      cluster-randomized controlled trial focusing on nursing home residents (BEVOR 
      trial).

AB  - BACKGROUND: According to recent legislation, facilitated advance care planning 
      (ACP) for nursing home (NH) residents is covered by German sickness funds. 
      However, the effects of ACP on patient-relevant outcomes have not been studied in 
      Germany yet. This study investigates whether implementing a complex regional ACP 
      intervention improves care consistency with care preferences in NH residents. 
      METHODS: This is a parallel-group cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) with 
      48 NHs (≈ 3840 resident beds) between 09/2019 and 02/2023. The intervention group 
      will receive a complex, regional ACP intervention aiming at sustainable systems 
      redesign at all levels (individual, institutional, regional). The intervention 
      comprises comprehensive training of ACP facilitators, implementation of reliable 
      ACP processes, organizational development in the NH and other relevant 
      institutions of the regional healthcare system, and education of health 
      professionals caring for the residents. Control group NHs will deliver care as 
      usual. Primary outcome is the hospitalization rate during the 12-months 
      observation period. Secondary outcomes include the rate of residents whose 
      preferences were known and honored in potentially life-threatening events, 
      hospital days, index treatments like resuscitation and artificial ventilation, 
      advance directives, quality of life, psychological burden on bereaved families, 
      and costs of care. The NHs will provide anonymous, aggregated data of all their 
      residents on the primary outcome and several secondary outcomes (data collection 
      1). For residents who have given informed consent, we will evaluate care 
      consistency with care preferences and further secondary outcomes, based on chart 
      reviews and short interviews with residents, surrogates, and carers (data 
      collection 2). Process evaluation will aim to explain barriers and facilitators, 
      economic evaluation the cost implications. DISCUSSION: This study has the 
      potential for high-quality evidence on the effects of a complex regional ACP 
      intervention on NH residents, their families and surrogates, NH staff, and health 
      care utilization in Germany. It is the first cRCT investigating a comprehensive 
      regional ACP intervention that aims at improving patient-relevant clinical 
      outcomes, addressing and educating multiple institutions and health care 
      providers, besides qualification of ACP facilitators. Thereby, it can generate 
      evidence on the potential of ACP to effectively promote patient-centered care in 
      the vulnerable population of frail and often chronically ill elderly. TRIAL

TI  - Key Components for the Delivery of Palliative and End-of-Life Care in Care Homes 
      in Hong Kong: A Modified Delphi Study.

AB  - Integrating the palliative care approach into care home service to address the 
      complex care needs of older adults with frailty or advanced diseases has been 
      increasingly recognized. However, such a service is underdeveloped in Hong Kong 
      owing to socio-cultural and legal concerns. We adopted a modified Delphi study 
      design to identify the key components for the delivery of palliative and 
      end-of-life care in care home settings for the local context. It was an iterative 
      staged method to assimilate views of experts in aged care, palliative care, and 
      care home management. A multidisciplinary expert panel of 18 members consented to 
      participate in the study. They rated their level of agreement with 61 candidate 
      statements identified through a scoping review in two rounds of anonymous 
      surveys. The steering group revised the statements in light of the survey 
      findings. Eventually, the finalized list included 28 key statements concerning 
      structure and process of care in seven domains, namely policy and infrastructure, 
      education, assessment, symptom management, communication, care for dying 
      patients, and family support. The findings of this study underscored concerns 
      regarding the feasibility of statements devised at different levels of palliative 
      care development. This list would be instrumental for regions where the 
      development of palliative and end-of-life care services in care home setting is 
      at an initial stage.

TI  - Balancing standardisation and individualisation in transitional care pathways: a 
      meta-ethnography of the perspectives of older patients, informal caregivers and 
      healthcare professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transitional care implies the transfer of patients within or across 
      care settings in a seamless and safe way. For frail, older patients with complex 
      health issues, high-quality transitions are especially important as these 
      patients typically move more frequently within healthcare settings, requiring 
      treatment from different providers. As transitions of care for frail people are 
      considered risky, securing the quality and safety of these transitions is of 
      great international interest. Nevertheless, despite efforts to improve quality in 
      transitional care, research indicates that there is a lack of clear guidance to 
      deal with practical challenges that may arise. The aim of this article is to 
      synthesise older patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals' 
      experiences of challenges to achieving high-quality transitional care. METHODS: 
      We used the seven-step method for meta-ethnography originally developed by Noblit 
      and Hare. In four different but connected qualitative projects, the authors 
      investigated the challenges to transitional care for older people in the 
      Norwegian healthcare system from the perspectives of older patients, informal 
      caregivers and healthcare professionals. In this paper, we highlight and discuss 
      the cruciality of these challenging issues by synthesising the results from 
      twelve articles. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four themes: i) balancing 
      person-centred versus efficient care, ii) balancing everyday patient life versus 
      the treatment of illness, iii) balancing user choice versus "What Matters to 
      You", and iv) balancing relational versus practical care. These expressed 
      challenges represent tensions at the system, organisation and individual levels 
      based on partial competing assumptions on person-centred-care-inspired 
      individualisation endeavours and standardisation requirements in transitional 
      care. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for a clearer understanding of the 
      tension between standardisation and individualisation in transitional care 
      pathways for older patients to ensure better healthcare quality for patients and 
      more realistic working environments for healthcare professionals. Incorporating a 
      certain professional flexibility within the wider boundary of standardisation may 
      give healthcare professionals room for negotiation to meet patients' individual 
      needs, while at the same time ensuring patient flow, equity and evidence-based 
      practice.
