182	183	Defining Complex Patient Populations: Implications For Population Size, Composition, Utilization, And Costs.	2022.0	233	10.1007/s11606-021-06815-4	34080109.0		233	37	2	351	BACKGROUND: Interventions to support patients with complex needs have proliferated in recent years, but the question of how to identify patients with complex needs has received relatively little attention. There are innumerable ways to structure inclusion and exclusion criteria for complex care interventions, and little is known about the implications of choices made in designing patient selection criteria. OBJECTIVE: To provide insights into the design of patient selection criteria for interventions, by implementing criteria sets within a large health plan member population and comparing the characteristics of the resulting complex patient cohorts. DESIGN: Retrospective observational descriptive study. SUBJECTS: Patients identified as having complex needs, within the membership population of Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large, population-based health plan with more than 4 million members. We characterize five commonly used archetypes of complex needs: high-cost patients, patients with multiple chronic conditions, frail elders, emergency department high-utilizers, and inpatient high-utilizers. MEASURES: We selected an initial set of criteria for identifying patients in each of the archetypical complex populations, based on available administrative data. We then tested multiple variants of each definition. We compared the resulting patient cohorts using univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 32.7% of the 3,112,797 adults in our population-based sample were selected by at least one of the 25 definitions of complexity we tested. Across definitions the total number of patients identified as complex ranged from 622,560 to 1583 and complex patient cohorts varied widely in demographic characteristics, chronic conditions, healthcare utilization, spending, and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of patient population is critical to the design of complex care programs. Exploratory analyses of population criteria can provide useful information for program planning in the setting of limited resources for interventions. Data such as these should be generated as a key step in program design.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		233	Journal Of General Internal Medicine		233	davis,anna.c	Davis	Anna C	1.0	11.0	1.0	0.0
55	56	The Multiscale Dynamics Of Beat-To-Beat Blood Pressure Fluctuation Mediated The Relationship Between Frailty And Arterial Stiffness In Older Adults		77	10.1093/gerona/glac035	35143675.0	WOS:000784541900001	77				Background Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) is an important cardiovascular output and regulated by neurophysiological elements over multiple temporal scales. The multiscale dynamics of beat-to-beat BP fluctuation can be characterized by BP complexity and has been linked to age-related adverse health outcomes. We here aimed to examine whether BP complexity mediates the association between arterial stiffness and frailty. Method This cross-sectional study was completed between January and October 2021. A total of 350 older adults completed assessments for frailty, arterial stiffness (ie, average brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity), and beat-to-beat finger BP. The complexity of beat-to-beat systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) BP series was measured using multiscale entropy. The relationships between frailty, BP complexity, and arterial stiffness were examined using analysis of variance and linear regression models. The effects of BP complexity on the association between arterial stiffness and frailty were examined using mediation analyses. Results Compared with non-frail, prefrail, and frail groups had significantly elevated lower SBP and DBP complexity (F > 11, p < .001) and greater arterial stiffness (F = 16, p < .001). Greater arterial stiffness was associated with lower BP complexity (beta < -0.42, p < .001). Beat-to-beat SBP and DBP complexity mediated the association between arterial stiffness and frailty (indirect effects >0.28), accounting for at least 47% of its total effects on frailty (mediated proportion: SBP: 50%, DBP: 47%). Conclusion This study demonstrates the association between BP complexity and frailty in older adults, and BP complexity mediates the association between arterial stiffness and frailty, suggesting that this metric would serve as a marker to help characterize important functions in the older adults.		2023-01-03 03:41:46	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls	1.0	77	Journals Of Gerontology Series A-Biological Sciences And Medical Sciences		77	jiang,xin	jiang	xin	0.0	10.0	10.0	0.0
42	43	Improving Detection Of Client Complexity In The Community (Impact): A Study Protocol Of A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial	2021.0	50	10.3390/mps4040070	34698219.0	WOS:000735508100001	50	4	4		Background: Community-dwelling older clients are becoming increasingly complex. Detecting this complexity in clinical practice is limited, with greater reliance on community nurses' clinical judgment and skills. The lack of a consistent approach to complexity impacts the level of care and support for older clients to remain in their homes for longer. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of the Patient Complexity Instrument (PCI) in addition to nurses' clinical judgment to enhance detection of complexity, and subsequent older clients' resource allocation compared to usual nursing assessment. Design: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial will be conducted within a community nursing service in regional Victoria, Australia. Clients 65 years and over referred to the service who are eligible for Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP) funding will be randomized into Control group: usual nursing assessment or Intervention group: usual nursing assessment plus the PCI. Nurse participants are Registered Nurses currently employed in the community nursing service. Results: This study will explore whether introducing the PCI in a community nursing service enhances detection of complexity and client care resource allocation compared to nurses' clinical judgment based on usual nursing assessment. Conclusion: This protocol outlines the study to enhance the detection of complexity by nurses delivering care for community-dwelling older people in the regional Australian context. The findings will inform the use of a standardized tool to detect complexity among community-dwelling older Australians.		2023-01-03 03:41:46	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls	1.0	50	Methods And Protocols		50	boak,jennifer	boak	jennifer	1.0	8.0	7.0	1.0
146	147	Modified Fragility Index And Surgical Complexity Score Are Able To Predict Postoperative Morbidity And Mortality After Cytoreductive Surgery For Advanced Ovarian Cancer.	2021.0	189	10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.08.022	33223220.0		143	161	1	4	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of surgical complexity on postoperative complications and mortality, according to patient's frailty (mFI) following surgery for ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer from 2008 to 2018 were identified from our database. A surgical complexity score from 1 to 3 was used to assess the extent of surgery (simple to complex, respectively). mFI with 11 variables, based on mapping the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index to the NSQIP comorbidities was evaluated. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, independent sample t-test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 263 patients identified, 33% reported at least one postoperative complication and 6% had severe complications. BMIÂ â‰¥Â 30 (pÂ =Â 0.04) increased mFI (pÂ =Â 0.04) and high-complexity surgery (pÂ <Â 0.001) were independent predictors of severe complications (G3-G5). Patients with high frailty index score (mFIÂ â‰¥Â 3) who underwent intermediate or high-complexity surgery were at higher risk of severe complications ranging from 29.4% to 50. CONCLUSIONS: The combined evaluation of mFI and surgical complexity expected may identify patients at higher risk for severe morbidity allowing to stratify patients who are less likely to tolerate a surgical extensive treatment.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		143	Gynecologic Oncology		189	di donato,violante	Di Donato	Violante	1.0	6.0	5.0	1.0
120	121	Strategies To Simplify Complex Medication Regimens.	2021.0	156	10.31128/AJGP-04-20-5322	33543163.0		156	50	1-2	43	BACKGROUND: Older people use increasingly complex medication regimens. Complex regimens are challenging to administer, particularly for those with cognitive impairment, frailty, poor eyesight or limited dexterity. Complex regimens have been linked to non-adherence, medication errors and hospital admissions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe strategies to reduce the complexity of medication regimens in community and residential aged care settings. DISCUSSION: Medication regimen simplification is the process of reducing medication burden through strategies such as consolidating dosing times, standardising routes of administration, using long-acting rather than shorter-acting formulations, and switching to combination products in place of single-ingredient products. Obtaining a best possible medication history, ensuring appropriateness of current therapy, and deprescribing are important steps prior to implementing regimen simplification. Implementing such strategies should be based on a discussion and consideration of patient preferences, and include clinical judgement to limit the risk of unintended consequences for patients or carers.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		156	Australian Journal Of General Practice		156	bell,j.simon	Bell	J Simon	1.0	4.0	1.0	0.0
62	63	Assessing Multidimensional Complexity In Home Care: Congruencies And Discrepancies Between Patients And Nurses.	2022.0	89	10.1186/s12912-022-00942-x			87	21	1	1	Background: Person-centered care allows for the inclusion of the totality of a person's needs and preferences, beyond just the clinical or medical aspect. This approach requires the development of tools to allow for the integration of the patient in his/her healthcare. Based on a 30-item tool developed for nurses to evaluate the complexity of home care situations (COMID), this study proposed a version for the patients (i.e. COMID-P). Both instruments were used, independently by nurses and patients, to rate the complexity of individual situations, in order to compare ratings. Methods: The COMID-P and the COMID were completed during the fraXity study at the patients' homes, independently by patients (aged 65 and over) and nurses. Item-level and scale-level analyses were performed using, Kappa and McNemar tests, and intra-class correlation (ICC). Results: A total of 159 pairs of COMID and COMID-P ratings were retained for analyses. Results demonstrated a high degree of patient/nurse agreement for 12/30 items, a moderate agreement for 10/30 items, and a low degree of agreement for 7/30 items. The intra-class correlation between the COMID-P and the COMID was high (ICC=.826, 95%CI [.761-.873]). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that patients and nurses can assess complexity using tools that have comparable structural properties. They also reveal congruencies and discrepancies in scoring the components of complexity, highlighting the need of reaching consensus in designing care plans. Further work is needed to demonstrate the benefits of joint assessment in developing care plans that truly meet patients' needs. Trial registration: The fraXity study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03883425, on March 20, 2019.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=157630821&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:42:38	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0.0	87	BMC Nursing	1.0	89	busnel,catherine	busnel	catherine	1.0	4.0	4.0	1.0
170	171	Exploring Rehabilitation Potential In Older People Living With Frailty: A Qualitative Focus Group Study.	2021.0	220	10.1186/s12877-021-02107-y	33676401.0		16	21	1	165	"BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation interventions are frequently cited as key in supporting frail older people's recovery following periods of decompensation and acute ill-health. Clinicians are required to make decisions about a patient's potential to respond to rehabilitation. 'Rehabilitation potential' decisions can determine access to services. In acute settings clinicians have limited time to assess and work with patients, families and carers. The complexities of ageing, recovery, rehabilitation and frailty may not be fully appreciated. This study aimed to explore multiple perspectives of the concept of rehabilitation potential and how it is assessed in older people living with frailty in the acute healthcare setting. METHODS: Five focus groups with a purposive sample of 28 participants which included clinicians and members of the public were conducted. Analysis comprised a thematic approach using the Framework method. RESULTS: Rehabilitation potential was found to encapsulate a complex decision-making process where clinicians judged an individual's ability to benefit from and participate in targeted rehabilitation. They asked, ""Will it work?"", ""Is it wanted?"" and ""Is it available?"" In order to predict who would benefit from rehabilitation interventions, clinicians assessed a range of holistic clinical and non-clinical factors. An iterative approach to assessment delivered by a multi-disciplinary team, centred around patient and carer needs and wants was needed to accommodate complexity. Participants believed that everyone had some form of potential but this was dependent on availability of rehabilitation resources and conceptualisations of frailty and rehabilitation. Tensions between iterative approaches to rehabilitation potential assessment and the realities of rapid decision making in the acute hospital setting were found. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation potential decisions involve a complex process of multidisciplinary decision-making and prognostication on the likely outcome and benefit from rehabilitation programmes. These findings lay the foundation for developing structured approaches to rehabilitation potential decision making tools and guidance."		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		16	Bmc Geriatrics		220	cowley,a	Cowley	A	0.0	4.0	1.0	0.0
178	179	Improving Individualized Prescription In Patients With Multimorbidity Through Medication Review.	2022.0	186	10.1186/s12877-022-03107-2	35549672.0		16	22	1	417	BACKGROUND: Older patients tend to have multimorbidity, represented by multiple chronic diseases or geriatric conditions, which leads to a growing number of prescribed medications. As a result, pharmacological prescription has become a major concern because of the increased difficulties to ensure appropriate prescription in older adults. The study's main objectives were to characterize a cohort of older adults with multimorbidity, carry out a medication review and compare the pharmacological data before and after the medication review globally and according to the frailty index. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental (uncontrolled pre-post) study with a cohort of patientsâ€‰â‰¥â€‰65Â years old with multimorbidity. Data were collected from June 2019 to October 2020. Variables assessed included demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data, degree of frailty (Frail-VIG index), medication regimen complexity index, anticholinergic and or sedative burden index, and monthly drug expenditure. Finally, a medication review was carried out by an interdisciplinary team (primary care team and a consultant team with a geriatrician and a clinical pharmacist) by applying the Patient-CenteredÂ Prescription model to align the treatment with care goals. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-eight patients were recruited [66.6% women; mean age 85.5 (SD 7.67)]. The mean frail index was 0.39 (SD 0.13), corresponding with moderate frailty. Up to 90% of patients presented at least one inappropriate prescription, and the mean of inappropriate prescriptions per patient was 3.14 (SD 2.27). At the three-month follow-up [mortality of 17.7% (nâ€‰=â€‰76)], the mean chronic medications per patient decreased by 17.96%, varying from 8.13 (SD 3.87) to 6.67 (SD 3.72) (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The medication regimen complexity index decreased by 19.03%, from 31.0 (SD 16.2) to 25.1 (SD 15.1), and the drug burden index mean decreased by 8.40%, from 1.19 (SD 0.82) to 1.09 (SD 0.82) (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). A decrease in polypharmacy, medication regimen complexity index, and drug burden index was more frequent among frail patients, especially those with severe frailty (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An individualized medication review in frail older patients, applying the Patient-Centered Prescription model, decreases pharmacological parameters related to adverse drug effects, such as polypharmacy, therapeutical complexity, and anticholinergic and, or sedative burden. The benefits are for patients with frailty.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		16	Bmc Geriatrics		186	molist-brunet,nÃºria	Molist-Brunet	NÃºria	0.0	4.0	4.0	0.0
108	109	Frailty Index For Prediction Of Surgical Outcome In Ovarian Cancer: Results Of A Prospective Study.	2021.0	143	10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.02.012	33608143.0		143	161	2	396	BACKGROUND: Complete macroscopic tumor resection is the strongest prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer, which requires complex surgery for achievement. Based on the mostly advanced tumor stage and high symptom burden many patients are classified as frail which may limit optimal surgical outcome. Aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive ability of Frailty Index for surgical outcomes in patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled patients with ovarian cancer undergoing cytoreductive surgery. We classified frailty proposed by Mitnitski et al. regarding the cumulative deficit model of frailty. Utilizing Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression, we determined predictive clinical factors for severe postoperative complications. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for overall survival analysis. RESULTS: Out of f 144 enrolled patients, the overall prevalence of frailty based on a Frailty Index >0.26 and Frailty Index >0.15 was 33% and 74%, respectively. The logistic regression shows that frail patients with a Frailty Index >0.26 (Odds ratio (OR): 3.64, 95% CI: 1.34-9.85, pÂ =Â 0.01), ECOG PSÂ >Â 1 (OR 6.33, 95% CI:1.31-30.51, pÂ =Â 0.02) and high surgical complexity score (OR 8.86, 95% CI:1.88-41.76, pÂ =Â 0.006) had a significant higher risk for severe postoperative complications. According to multivariable cox regression Frailty Index >0.15 (hazard ratio (HR) (HR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.01-3.47, pÂ =Â 0.048), residual tumor <1Â cm (HR 2.75, 95%CI: 1.53-4.99, pÂ =Â 0.001), residual tumor >1Â cm (HR 5.00, 95% CI: 2.74-9.13, pÂ <Â 0.001) and albumin<35.5Â g/dl (HR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.08-3.43, pÂ =Â 0.03) resulted as significant parameters for poor overall survival. Resulted as significant parameters for poor overall survival. CONCLUSION: Next to surgical complexity score, ECOG PSÂ >Â 1 and recurrent surgery, Frailty Index >0.26 is associated with severe postoperative complications in patients with ovarian cancer. Besides tumor residuals and low albumin levels a Frailty Index >0.15 predicts poor survival.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		143	Gynecologic Oncology		143	inci,melisa.guelhan	Inci	Melisa Guelhan	0.0	3.0	2.0	0.0
30	31	Sexual Harassment Or Disinhibition? Residential Care Staff Responses To Older Adults' Unwanted Behaviours.	2022.0	32	10.1111/opn.12433	34708549.0		11	17	3	e12433	BACKGROUND: The ethical complexity of residential care is especially apparent for staff responding to residents' inappropriate sexual expression, particularly when directed towards care workers as these residents are typically frail, often cognitively impaired, and require ongoing care. OBJECTIVES: To explore staff accounts of how they made meaning of and responded to residents' unwanted sexual behaviours directed towards staff. This exploration includes whether staff appeared to accept harassment as a workplace hazard to be managed, or an unacceptable workplace violation, or something else. METHODS: These qualitative data are drawn from a national two-arm mixed method study in Aotearoa New Zealand undertaken in 35 residential care facilities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 77Â staff, residents and family members. Interpretive description was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Staff had numerous ways they used to respond to behaviours: (1) minimisation, deflection and de-escalation, where staff used strategies to minimise behaviours without requiring any accountability from residents; (2) holding residents accountable, where staff to some degree addressed the behaviour directly with residents; (3) blurred boundaries and complexities in intimate long-term care, where staff noted that in a context where touch is common-place, cognitive function was diminished and relationships were long-term, boundaries were easily breached; (4) dehumanising and infantilising residents' behaviours, where staff appeared to assert control through diminishing the residents' identity as an older person. It was evident that staff had developed considerable practice wisdom focused on preserving the care relationship although few referred to policy and education guiding practice. CONCLUSIONS: Staff appeared to be navigating a complex ethical terrain with thoughtfulness and skill. Care workers seemed reluctant to label resident behaviour as sexual harassment, and the term may not fit for staff where they perceive residents are frail and cognitively impaired. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Policy, education and clinical leadership are recommended to augment practice wisdom and ensure staff and resident safety and dignity and to determine how best to intervene with residents' unwanted sexual behaviours.		2023-01-03 03:39:18	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1.0	11	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1.0	32	cook,catherine.m	Cook	Catherine M	0.0	3.0	1.0	0.0
171	172	Va Home-Based Primary Care Interdisciplinary Team Structure Varies With Veterans' Needs, Aligns With Pace Regulation.	2021.0	221	10.1111/jgs.17174	33834504.0		157	69	7	1729	BACKGROUND: Interdisciplinary team (IDT) care is central to home-based primary care (HBPC) of frail elders. Traditionally, all HBPC disciplines managed a patient (Full IDT), a costly approach to maintain. The recent PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) regulation provides for a flexible approach of annual assessments from a core team with involvement of additional disciplines dependent upon patient needs (Core+). Current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) HBPC guidance specifies Full IDTs care for medically complex and functionally impaired Veterans similar to PACE participants. We evaluated whether VA HBPC has adopted the flexible structure of the PACE regulation, aligned to Veteran needs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: All 139 VA HBPC programs administered across 379 sites. PARTICIPANTS: About 55,173 Veterans enrolled in HBPC during fiscal year 2018. MEASUREMENTS: Patients' HBPC physician, nurse, psychologist/psychiatrist, social worker, therapist, dietitian, and pharmacist visits were grouped into interdisciplinary team types. Patient frailty was classified using VA HNHR v2 (High-Need High-Risk version 2, a measure of high, medium, and low risk of long-term institutionalization). Medical complexity was measured by clusters of impairment in the JEN frailty index (JFI). JFI clusters were validated by VA's Nosos measure to project cost and Care Assessment Need (CAN) measure of hospitalization and mortality risk. RESULTS: HBPC provided Full IDT care to 21%, Core+ care to 54%, and Home Health+ (HHA+) care (skilled home health services plus additional disciplines, without primary care) to 16% of Veterans. Team type was associated with medical complexity (X(2) 2863.5 [66 df], pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). High-risk Veterans (72% of sample) were more likely to receive Full IDT care (X(2) 62.9, 1 df), pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), while low-risk Veterans (28%) were more likely to receive HHA+ care (X(2) 314.8, 1 df, pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is a strong association between HBPC team patterns and patient frailty, indicating tailoring of care to match Veteran needs.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		157	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		221	chan,caitlin.s	Chan	Caitlin S	0.0	3.0	2.0	0.0
295	296	Individualized Medication Review In Older People With Multimorbidity: A Comparative Analysis Between Patients Living At Home And In A Nursing Home.	2022.0	186	10.3390/ijerph19063423	35329110.0		8	19	6	None	(1) Background: aging is associated with complex and dynamic changes leading to multimorbidity and, therefore, polypharmacy. A periodic medication review (MR) in frail older people leads to optimizing medication use. The aims of the study were to perform a comparative analysis of the impact of place of residence (own home versus nursing home) in a cohort of older patients on the characteristics of the baseline therapeutic plan and characteristics of the therapeutic plan after an MR; (2) Methods: Study with paired pre- and post-MR data based on person-centred prescription, with a follow-up assessment at three months. Patients who lived either in their own home or in a nursing home were recruited. We selected patients of 65 years or more with multimorbidity whose General Practitioner identified difficulties with the prescription management and the need for an MR. Each patient's treatment was analysed by applying the Patient-Centred Prescription (PCP) model; (3) Results: 428 patients. 90% presented at least one inappropriate prescription (IP) in both settings. In nursing homes, a higher number of implemented optimization proposals was detected (81.6% versus 65.7% (p &lt; 0.001)). After the MR, nursing-home patients had a greater decrease in their mean number of medications, polypharmacy prevalence, therapeutic complexity, and monthly drug expenditure (p &lt; 0.001); (4) Conclusions: PCP model detected a high number of IP in both settings. However, after an individualized MR, nursing-home patients presented a greater decrease in some pharmacological parameters related to adverse events, such as polypharmacy and therapeutic complexity, compared to those living at home. Nursing homes may be regarded as a highly suitable scenario to carry out a periodic MR, due to its high prevalence of frail people and its feasibility to apply the recommendations of an MR. Prospective studies with a robust design should be performed to demonstrate this quasi-experimental study along with a longitudinal follow-up on clinical outcomes.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		8	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		186	molist-brunet,nÃºria	Molist-Brunet	NÃºria	0.0	3.0	2.0	0.0
143	144	Factors Associated With The Detection Of Inappropriate Prescriptions In Older People: A Prospective Cohort.	2021.0	186	10.3390/ijerph182111310	34769827.0		8	18	21	None	(1) Background: Ageing is associated with complex and dynamic changes leading to multimorbidity and, therefore, polypharmacy. The main objectives were to study an older community-dwelling cohort, to detect inappropriate prescriptions (IP) applying the Patient-Centred Prescription model, and to evaluate the most associated factors. (2) Methods: This was a prospective, descriptive, and observational study conducted from June 2019 to October 2020 on patients â‰¥ 65 years with multimorbidity who lived in the community. Demographic, clinical and pharmacological data were assessed. Variables assessed were: degree of frailty, using the Frail-VIG index; therapeutical complexity and anticholinergic and sedative burden; and the number of chronic drugs to determine polypharmacy or excessive polypharmacy. Finally, a medication review was carried out through the application of the Patient-Centred Prescription model. We used univariate and multivariate regression to identify the factors associated with IP. (3) Results: We recruited 428 patients (66.6% women; mean age 85.5, SD 7.67). A total of 50.9% of them lived in a nursing home; the mean Barthel Index was 49.93 (SD 32.14), and 73.8% of patients suffered some degree of cognitive impairment. The prevalence of frailty was 92.5%. Up to 90% of patients had at least one IP. An increase in IP prevalence was detected when the Frail-VIG index increased (p < 0.05). With the multivariate model, the relationship of polypharmacy with IP detection stands out above all.

Factors with higher association with IP were frailty and polypharmacy.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		8	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		186	molist-brunet,nÃºria	Molist-Brunet	NÃºria	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
102	103	Considering Frailty In Sars-Cov-2 Vaccine Development: How Geriatricians Can Assist.	2021.0	137	10.2147/CIA.S295522	33953551.0		137	16		731	The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted frail older adults, especially residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. This has appropriately led to prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care for them, in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood through a lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not tested in Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. We argue that geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to the development, testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We discuss roles for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development process, covering vaccine design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment and interpretation of illness definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of relevant health measures such as frailty and function, analysis methods to account for frailty and differential vulnerability, contributions in regulatory and advisory roles, post-marketing surveillance, and program implementation and public health messaging. In presenting key recommendations pertinent to each stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on how to push the field of vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty. Making vaccines that can benefit frail older adults will benefit everyone in the fight against COVID-19.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		137	Clinical Interventions In Aging		137	andrew,melissa.k	Andrew	Melissa K	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0
257	258	Impact Of Age, Comorbidity, And Treatment Characteristics On Survival In Older Women With Advanced High Grade Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.	2021.0	324	10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.03.008	33812698.0		143	161	3	693	OBJECTIVES: Older women have a worse prognosis with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and comorbidities likely contribute to poor outcomes. We sought to identify comorbid conditions and treatment-related factors in older women. METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified 351 patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS). 100/351 (28.5%) were â‰¥ 70 years old. Demographic and clinicopathologic information was collected. Crude progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios and adjustments for confounders. RESULTS: Study subjects â‰¥70 years old had significantly: higher Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) score (5.9 vs 4.3; p = 0.0001), less completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (24% vs 15.1%; p = 0.049), less intraperitoneal (IP) therapy (18.2% vs 35.5%; p = 0.002), less clinical trial participation (16% vs 26.3%; p = 0.040), decreased platinum sensitivity (60% vs 73.7%; p = 0.012) and lacked BRCA mutations (0% vs 12%; p = 0.0006). They were less likely to have optimal CRS (75% vs 86.9%; p = 0.007) with same surgical complexity (p = 0.89). Patients â‰¥70 had significantly worse PFS and OS. In a multivariate analysis, better OS was associated with younger age (<70 years old), any IP therapy, completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and platinum sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The older cohort had worse CIRS-G scores (5.9 vs 4.3; p = 0.0001), but no strong associations between comorbidities and treatment characteristics, but less optimal CRS rates (75% vs 86.9%; p = 0.007) with similar surgical complexity and less platinum sensitivity. Our results show comorbid conditions in older patients with advanced EOC may have less impact than tumor biology.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		143	Gynecologic Oncology		324	mallen,adrianne	Mallen	Adrianne	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0
259	260	Short Communication: Opportunities And Challenges For Early Person-Centered Care For Older Patients In Emergency Settings.	2021.0	326	10.3390/ijerph182312526	34886252.0		8	18	23	None	The provision of person-centered care (PCC) for older adults in emergency settings is important. This short communication explores the complexity of providing comprehensive PCC for older adults in emergency settings, based on a synthesis of existing literature and empirical data from a small-scale case study on the potential of improving patient engagement in a Danish emergency department (ED). Our findings highlight overall positive attitudes towards PCC, as patient engagement is perceived as important and feasible during the waiting hours that older patients experience. However, the key challenges include barriers in organizational structures and cross-sectoral care coordination. We conclude that staff education, optimized care coordination across sectors, and increased involvement of geriatric nurses may enhance the provision of PCC for older, complex adults in EDs. We further conclude that future research into the feasibility and effects of structured approaches for providing PCC in EDs is needed, including exploration of organizational models for PCC.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		8	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		326	jensen,andrea.n	Jensen	Andrea N	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
160	161	Management Of Acute Coronary Syndromes In Older Adults.	2022.0	206	10.1093/eurheartj/ehab391	34347065.0		206	43	16	1542	Older patients are underrepresented in prospective studies and randomized clinical trials of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Over the last decade, a few specific trials have been conducted in this population, allowing more evidence-based management. Older adults are a heterogeneous, complex, and high-risk group whose management requires a multidimensional clinical approach beyond coronary anatomic variables. This review focuses on available data informing evidence-based interventional and pharmacological approaches for older adults with ACS, including guideline-directed management. Overall, an invasive approach appears to demonstrate a better benefit-risk ratio compared to a conservative one across the ACS spectrum, even considering patients' clinical complexity and multiple comorbidities. Conversely, more powerful strategies of antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention have been associated with increased bleeding events and no benefit in terms of mortality reduction. An interdisciplinary evaluation with geriatric assessment should always be considered to achieve a holistic approach and optimize any treatment on the basis of the underlying biological vulnerability.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		206	European Heart Journal		206	morici,nuccia	Morici	Nuccia	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgeon reimbursement is frequently apportioned by wRVU. These subjective, procedure-specific valuations generated by physician survey estimate the intensity and time for typical patient care services. We hypothesized wRVU would not adequately account for patient-specific factors, such as frailty, that modify the required physician work, regardless of procedural complexity. METHODS: Using National and Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Programs (2015-2018), we evaluated the correlation between case total wRVU, patient frailty (risk analysis index) and physiologic surgical stress (operative stress score). RESULTS: Of 4,111,371 (86%) cases, the correlation between total wRVU and operative stress was moderate [Ïs = 0.587 (95% confidence interval, 0.586-0.587)], but negligible with frailty Ï = 0.177 (95% confidence interval, 0.176-0.178)]. Very high operative stress procedures [n = 34,047 (1%)] generated a mean total wRVU of 55.1 (standard deviation, 12.9), comprising 7%, 2%, and 1% of thoracic, vascular, and general surgical cases, respectively. Very frail patients [n = 152,535 (4%)] accounted for 9% of thoracic, 9% of vascular, 4% of general, 5% of urologic, and 4% of neurologic surgical cases, generating 21.0 (standard deviation, 12.4) mean total wRVU. Some nonfrail patients undergoing low operative stress procedures [n = 60,128 (2%)] nonetheless generated the highest quintile wRVU; these comprised >15% of plastic, gynecologic, and urologic surgical cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon reimbursement correlates with operative stress but not patient frailty. The total wRVU does not adequately reflect patient-specific factors that increase the physician workload required to render optimal care to complex patients.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		190	Annals Of Surgery		190	reitz,katherine.m	Reitz	Katherine M	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
14	15	Factors Affecting Missed Nursing Care In Hospitalized Frail Older Adults In The Medical Wards: A Qualitative Study.	2021.0	16	10.1186/s12877-021-02524-z	34649518.0		16	21	1	555	"BACKGROUND: Frail older adults who are hospitalized, are more likely to experience missed nursing care (MNC) due to high care needs, communication problems, and complexity of nursing care. We conducted a qualitative study to examine the factors affecting MNC among hospitalized frail older adults in the medical units. METHODS: This qualitative study was carried using the conventional content analysis approach in three teaching hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 nurses through purposive and snowball sampling. The inclusion criteria for the nurses were: at least two years of clinical work experience on a medical ward, caring for frail older people in hospital and willingness to participate. Data were analyzed in accordance with the process described by Graneheim and Lundman. In addition, trustworthiness of the study was assessed using the criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba. RESULTS: In general, 20 interviews were conducted with nurses. A total of 1320 primary codes were extracted, which were classified into two main categories: MNC aggravating and moderating factors. Factors such as ""age-unfriendly structure,"" ""inefficient care,"" and ""frailty of older adults"" could increase the risk of MNC. In addition, factors such as ""support capabilities"" and ""ethical and legal requirements"" will moderate MNC. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized frail older adults are more at risk of MNC due to high care needs, communication problems, and nursing care complexity. Nursing managers can take practical steps to improve the quality of care by addressing the aggravating and moderating factors of MNC. In addition, nurses with a humanistic perspective who understand the multidimensional problems of frail older adults and pay attention to their weakness in expressing needs, can create a better experience for them in the hospital and improve patient safety."		2023-01-03 03:39:18	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1.0	16	Bmc Geriatrics		16	rezaei-shahsavarloo,zahra	Rezaei-Shahsavarloo	Zahra	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0

This study aimed to examine whether a computerised cognitive remediation programme would improve walking in adults aged 70 years and older. METHODS: This single-blind, randomised trial at one academic centre in the USA evaluated the efficacy of an 8-week computerised programme (also known as brain games) of progressive intensity and complexity to improve walking in older adults at high-risk for mobility disability. Inclusion criteria included being 70 years or older; ambulatory; and at high-risk for mobility disability, defined using a cutscore of nine or less (frail range) on the Short Physical Performance Battery and a walking speed of 100 cm/s or less. Individuals with dementia, acute or terminal medical illnesses, recent or planned surgery affecting mobility, mobility limitations solely due to musculoskeletal limitation or pain that prevented them from completing mobility tests, and those who were nursing home residents were excluded. Participants were block randomised (1:1; block size 12 and no stratification) to the intervention group or the control group (low complexity computer games and health education classes). Primary outcomes were change in walking speed at normal pace and walking while talking conditions assessed from baseline to 8 weeks post-intervention by investigators who were masked to group assignment. Groups were compared using the intention-to-treat principle with linear mixed models adjusted for confounders. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT02567227. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2016, and March 12, 2020, 383 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. After randomisation, 11 (3%) patients were diagnosed with dementia. 372 (97%; 271 [73%] women) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean age of participants was 77Â·0 years [SD 5Â·6]). 183 (49Â·2%) participants were Black and 62 (16Â·7%) were Hispanic. 314 (93%) of the target 338 completers had finished the intervention when the trial was terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there were significant within-group improvements in both groups after the 8-week intervention, there was no significant difference in normal walking speed (-1Â·03 cm/s [SD 1Â·30]; 95% CI -3Â·60 to 1Â·54) and walking while talking conditions (0Â·59 cm/s [SD 1Â·61]; 95% CI -2Â·59 to 3Â·76) between the intervention and control groups. Similarly, within-group, but no between-group, differences were seen on executive function tests and physical function. There were no severe adverse events related to interventions. INTERPRETATION: Computerised cognitive remediation improved walking in adults aged 70 years and older at high-risk for mobility disability, but improvements were not significantly greater compared with an active control. Although our findings corroborate the within-group improvements on cognition and mobility reported in previous pilot clinical trials, future studies are required to determine the optimal dose, frequency, intensity, and content of computerised cognitive remediation programmes.

174	175	Resilience Is Associated With Frailty And Older Age In Hospitalised Patients.	2022.0	224	10.1186/s12877-022-03251-9	35818046.0		16	22	1	569	BACKGROUND: Little is known about resilience in an internal medicine setting. We aimed to assess the relationship between resilience and frailty and other clinical and sociodemographic characteristics in a cohort of prospectively enrolled hospitalised patients. METHODS: In 2017-2019, we consecutively enrolled patients in our internal medicine wards. We selected all patients who filled in the 25-item Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC). Mean resilience was evaluated according to baseline demographic (i.e., age, sex, marital and socioeconomic status) and clinical (i.e., Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS], Edmonton Frail Scale [EFS], Barthel index, Short Blessed test, length of stay [LOS]) data. A multivariable analysis for assessing factors affecting resilience was fitted. RESULTS: Overall, 143 patients (median age 69Â years, interquartile range 52-79, 74 females) were included. Resilience was significantly lower in frail (pâ€‰=â€‰0.010), elderly (pâ€‰=â€‰0.021), dependent (pâ€‰=â€‰0.032), and more clinically (pâ€‰=â€‰0.028) and cognitively compromised patients (pâ€‰=â€‰0.028), and in those with a low educational status (pâ€‰=â€‰0.032). No relation between resilience and LOS was noticed (pâ€‰=â€‰0.597). Frail patients were significantly older (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), had a greater disease burden as measured by CIRS comorbidity (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and severity indexes (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), were more dependent (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), more cognitively impaired (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and displayed a lower educational level (pâ€‰=â€‰0.011) compared to non-frail patients. At multivariable analysis, frailty (pâ€‰=â€‰0.022) and dependency (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031; according to the Barthel index) were associated with lower resilience in the age groups 18-64 andâ€‰â‰¥â€‰65Â years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Low resilience was associated with frailty and dependency with an age-dependent fashion. Studies assessing the impact of this finding on important health outcomes are needed.

185	186	Identifying Frequent Health Care Users And Care Consumption Patterns: Process Mining Of Emergency Medical Services Data.	2021.0	236	10.2196/27499	34612834.0		236	23	10	e27499	"BACKGROUND: Tracing frequent users of health care services is highly relevant to policymakers and clinicians, enabling them to avoid wasting scarce resources. Data collection on frequent users from all possible health care providers may be cumbersome due to patient privacy, competition, incompatible information systems, and the efforts involved. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the use of a single key source, emergency medical services (EMS) records, to trace and reveal frequent users' health care consumption patterns. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed analyzing EMS calls from the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands between 2012 and 2017. Process mining was applied to identify the structure of patient routings (ie, their consecutive visits to hospitals, nursing homes, and EMS). Routings are used to identify and quantify frequent users, recognizing frail elderly users as a focal group. The structure of these routes was analyzed at the patient and group levels, aiming to gain insight into regional coordination issues and workload distributions among health care providers. RESULTS: Frail elderly users aged 70 years or more represented over 50% of frequent users, making 4 or more calls per year. Over the period of observation, their annual number and the number of calls increased from 395 to 628 and 2607 to 3615, respectively. Structural analysis based on process mining revealed two categories of frail elderly users: low-complexity patients who need dialysis, radiation therapy, or hyperbaric medicine, involving a few health care providers, and high-complexity patients for whom routings appear chaotic. CONCLUSIONS: This efficient approach exploits the role of EMS as the unique regional ""ferryman,"" while the combined use of EMS data and process mining allows for the effective and efficient tracing of frequent users' utilization of health care services. The approach informs regional policymakers and clinicians by quantifying and detailing frequent user consumption patterns to support subsequent policy adaptations."		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		236	Journal Of Medical Internet Research		236	maruster,laura	Maruster	Laura	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0
112	113	Epidemiology Of Hpb Malignancy In The Elderly.	2021.0	147	10.1016/j.ejso.2020.03.222	32360064.0		147	47	3 Pt A	503	The incidence of hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) cancers is increasing worldwide. Despite improvements in cancer surveillance and earlier access to therapy, these cancers still have poor survival rates, especially in elderly patients. There are several challenges in elucidating the epidemiology of these malignancies especially in view of the heterogeneous exposure to recognised risk factors and the coding systems used. Early diagnosis, crucial to improved survival, remains challenging as many patients present sporadically. Furthermore, the indolent nature of these tumours means they tend to present late, when curative treatments are no longer an option. Importantly, even when patients are diagnosed early and treated with curative intent, recurrence rates remain high. HPB cancers display a heterogenous molecular profile resulting in poorly effective systemic therapies in patients for whom curative treatments cannot be considered. Globally, people now live longer, and it is predicted that the population of individuals older than 85 will double by 2033. With increasing age comes increased cancer risk. There is a plethora of recognised challenges in elderly patients presenting with cancer and this is no different with HPB cancers. Complex co-morbidities including chronic disease, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and increasing psychosocial needs confer an extra layer of complexity in the management of this elderly sub population. The frailty that usually accompanies advancing age often means that patients take longer to recover and develop more complications after cancer therapies. In this article, we review the epidemiology of malignant HPB tumours with a focus on the elderly.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		147	European Journal Of Surgical Oncology: The Journal Of The European Society Of Surgical Oncology And The British Association Of Surgical Oncology		147	pericleous,marinos	Pericleous	Marinos	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
119	120	Frailty Predicts Outcome Of Partial Nephrectomy And Guides Treatment Decision Towards Active Surveillance And Tumor Ablation.	2021.0	155	10.1007/s00345-020-03556-7	33515329.0		155	39	8	2843	PURPOSE: To examine frailty and comorbidity as predictors of outcome of nephron sparing surgery (NSS) and as decision tools for identifying candidates for active surveillance (AS) or tumor ablation (TA). METHODS: Frailty and comorbidity were assessed using the modified frailty index of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (11-CSHA) and the age-adjusted Charlson-Comorbidity Index (aaCCI) as well as albumin and the radiological skeletal-muscle-index (SMI) in a cohort of nâ€‰=â€‰447 patients with localized renal masses. Renal tumor anatomy was classified according to the RENAL nephrometry system. Regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of surgical outcome of patients undergoing NSS as well as to identify possible influencing factors of patients undergoing alternative therapies (AS/TA). RESULTS: Overall 409 patient underwent NSS while 38 received AS or TA. Patients undergoing TA/AS were more likely to be frail or comorbid compared to patients undergoing NSS (aaCCI: pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, 11-CSHA: pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Gender and tumor complexity did not vary between patients of different treatment approach. 11-CSHA and aaCCI were identified as independent predictors of major postoperative complications (11-CSHAâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.27: ORâ€‰=â€‰3.6, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and hospital re-admission (aaCCIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰6: ORâ€‰=â€‰4.93, pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) in the NSS cohort. No impact was found for albumin levels and SMI. An aaCCIâ€‰>â€‰6 and/or 11-CSHAâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.27 (ORâ€‰=â€‰9.19, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), a solitary kidney (ORâ€‰=â€‰5.43, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005) and hypoalbuminemia (ORâ€‰=â€‰4.6, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009), but not tumor complexity, were decisive factors to undergo AS or TA rather than NSS. CONCLUSION: In patients with localized renal masses, frailty and comorbidity indices can be useful to predict surgical outcome and support decision-making towards AS or TA.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		155	World Journal Of Urology		155	walach,m.t	Walach	M T	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0
305	306	Decisions On Antibiotic Prescribing For Suspected Urinary Tract Infections In Frail Older Adults: A Qualitative Study In Four European Countries.	2022.0	296	10.1093/ageing/afac134	35697352.0		178	51	6	None	BACKGROUND: a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common reason to prescribe antibiotics in a frail older patient. Frequently, antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily. To increase appropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through antibiotic stewardship interventions, we need to thoroughly understand the factors that contribute to these prescribing decisions. OBJECTIVES: (1) to obtain insight into factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for suspected UTIs in frail older adults. (2) To develop an overarching model integrating these factors to guide the development of antibiotic stewardship interventions for UTIs in frail older adults. METHODS: we conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 61 semi-structured interviews in older adult care settings in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. We interviewed physicians, nursing staff, patients and informal caregivers. RESULTS: participants described a chain of decisions by patients, caregivers and/or nursing staff preceding the ultimate decision to prescribe antibiotics by the physician. We identified five themes of influence: (1) the clinical situation and its complexity within the frail older patient, (2) diagnostic factors, such as asymptomatic bacteriuria, (3) knowledge (gaps) and attitude, (4) communication: interprofessional, and with patients and relatives and (5) context and organisation of care, including factors such as availability of antibiotics (over the counter), antibiotic stewardship efforts and factors concerning out-of-hours care. CONCLUSIONS: decision-making on suspected UTIs in frail older adults is a complex, multifactorial process. Due to the diverse international setting and stakeholder variety, we were able to provide a comprehensive overview of factors to guide the development of antibiotic stewardship interventions.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		178	Age And Ageing		296	hartman,esther.a.r	Hartman	Esther A R	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
208	209	Dynamical Indicators Of Resilience From Physiological Time Series In Geriatric Inpatients: Lessons Learned.	2021.0	263	10.1016/j.exger.2021.111341	33838217.0		21	149		111341	The concept of physical resilience may help geriatric medicine objectively assess patients' ability to 'bounce back' from future health challenges. Indicators putatively forecasting resilience have been developed under two paradigms with different perspectives: Critical Slowing Down and Loss of Complexity. This study explored whether these indicators validly reflect the construct of resilience in geriatric inpatients. Geriatric patients (nÂ =Â 121, 60% female) had their heart rate and physical activity continuously monitored using a chest-worn sensor. Indicators from both paradigms were extracted from both physiological signals. Measures of health functioning, concomitant with low resilience, were obtained by questionnaire at admission. The relationships among indicators and their associations with health functioning were assessed by correlation and linear regression analyses, respectively. Greater complexity and higher variance in physical activity were associated with lower frailty (Î²Â =Â -0.28, pÂ =Â .004 and Î²Â =Â -0.37, pÂ <Â .001, respectively) and better ADL function (Î²Â =Â 0.23, pÂ =Â .022 and Î²Â =Â 0.38, pÂ <Â .001). The associations of physical activity variance with health functioning were not in the expected direction based on Critical Slowing Down. In retrospect, these observations stress the importance of matching the resilience paradigm's assumptions to the homeostatic role of the variable monitored. We present several lessons learned.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		21	Experimental Gerontology		263	rector,jerrald.l	Rector	Jerrald L	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0
195	196	Lower 1-Year Postoperative Mortality After Acetabular Versus Proximal Femoral Fractures In Elderly Patients.	2021.0	248	10.2106/JBJS.20.01805	34019495.0		230	103	19	1807	BACKGROUND: Geriatric acetabular fractures are becoming more common due to demographic changes. Compared with proximal femoral fractures, surgical treatment is more complex and often does not allow full-weight-bearing. The aims of this study were to compare operatively treated acetabular and proximal femoral fractures with regard to (1) cumulative 1-year mortality, (2) perioperative complications, and (3) predictive factors associated with a higher 1-year mortality. METHODS: This institutional review board-approved comparative study included 486 consecutive surgically treated elderly patients (136 acetabular and 350 proximal femoral fractures). After matching, 2 comparable groups of 129 acetabular and 129 proximal femoral fractures were analyzed. Cumulative 1-year mortality was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis, and perioperative complications were documented and graded. After confirming that the proportionality assumption was met, Cox proportional hazard modeling was conducted to identify factors associated with increased 1-year mortality. RESULTS: The acetabular fracture group had a significantly lower cumulative 1-year mortality before matching (18% compared with 33% for proximal femoral fractures, log-rank p = 0.001) and after matching (18% compared with 36%, log-rank p = 0.005). Nevertheless, it had a significantly higher overall perioperative complication rate (68% compared with 48%, p < 0.001). In our multivariable Cox regression analysis, older age, perioperative blood loss of >1 L, and wheelchair mobilization were associated with lower survival rates after acetabular fracture surgery. Older age and a higher 5-item modified frailty index were associated with a higher 1-year mortality rate after proximal femoral fractures, whereas postoperative full weight-bearing was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the complexity of operative treatment and a higher complication rate after acetabular fractures in the elderly, the 1-year mortality rate is lower than that after operative treatment of proximal femoral fractures, even after adjustment for comorbidities.

237	238	Can Cognitive-Motor Training Improve Physical Functioning And Psychosocial Wellbeing In Nursing Home Residents? A Randomized Controlled Feasibility Study As Part Of The Procare Project.	2021.0	300	10.1007/s40520-020-01615-y	32537707.0		201	33	4	943	BACKGROUND: A multi-component training program holds promises for the elderly, but still has to be tested on its feasibility and effect in nursing homes. AIMS: The aim of this study was (1) to design a multi-component training program which improves physical functioning and psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of this intervention in nursing home residents. METHODS: This study is a two-arm, stratified-randomized controlled feasibility trail. Twenty-four nursing home residents (aged 83.7â€‰Â±â€‰6.4, 21 women) were divided into an intervention and a waiting-list control group. The intervention group completed a multi-component training (including dual-task, dynamic balance, endurance and strength exercises) for 16Â weeks (twice per week for 45-60Â min). Primary outcomes were lower extremity functionality (SPPB), gait performance (GAITRite), health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as life satisfaction (SWLS). RESULTS: Life satisfaction (SWLS) and physical functioning (SPPB) increased in the intervention group after training whereas the control group showed a decrease. Gait parameters could only be analyzed for nâ€‰=â€‰5 participants of the intervention group and nâ€‰=â€‰2 of the control group and showed no time differences for the intervention group. The mean number of participants was 12.5â€‰Â±â€‰1.9 per session (attendance ranged between 66% and 90%). CONCLUSION: A multi-component training seems (1) to lead to clinically relevant improvements in physical functioning as well as in psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to be feasible and well accepted in nursing home residents. Nevertheless, the complexity and progression of the program as well as the testing protocol have to be adapted. Further research should test the effectiveness of this adapted program in a larger sample size.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		201	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		300	bischoff,laura.l	Bischoff	Laura L	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The clinical characteristics at onset are influenced by the presence of common health-related conditions in older people, such as comorbidity, disability and frailty, and not simply by chronological age. Few studies investigated the tendency of Covid-19 symptoms to aggregate in cluster and the use of cluster approach might better describe the clinical complexity of the acute disease. Concerning the prognostic significance of Covid-19 clinical presentation in older people, the available literature still provides discordant results.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		261	Clinics In Geriatric Medicine		261	remelli,francesca	Remelli	Francesca	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
244	245	Antithrombotic Therapy In Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The Complexity Of The Elderly.	2021.0	307	10.1093/eurjpc/zwaa053	33624104.0		307	28	1	87	Along with epidemiologic transitions of the global population, the burden of aortic stenosis (AS) is rapidly increasing and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has quickly spread; indeed, it is nowadays also employed in treating patients with AS at intermediate operative risk. Nonetheless, the less invasive interventional strategy still carries relevant issues concerning post-procedural optimal antithrombotic strategy, given the current indications provided by guidelines are not completely supported by evidence-based data. Geriatric patients suffer from high bleeding and thromboembolic risks, whose balance is particularly subtle due to the presence of concomitant conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease, that make the post-TAVR antithrombotic management particularly insidious. This scenario is further complicated by the lack of specific evidence regarding the 'real-life' complex conditions typical of the geriatric syndromes, thus, the management of such a heterogeneous population, ranging from healthy ageing to frailty, is far from being defined. The aim of the present review is to summarize the critical points and the most updated evidence regarding the post-TAVR antithrombotic approach in the geriatric population, with a specific focus on the most frequent clinical settings.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		307	European Journal Of Preventive Cardiology		307	bencivenga,leonardo	Bencivenga	Leonardo	1.0	1.0	0.0	1.0
217	218	The Impact Of Frailty On Mortality In Older Patients Admitted To An Intensive Care Unit.	2022.0	276	10.1016/j.medine.2020.05.015	34991871.0		276	46	1	23	OBJECTIVE: Frailty is a relatively new concept for intensivists, and is defined as a status of increased vulnerability to stressors associated with reduced reserve and function of different physiological systems. Supporting the hypothesis that frailty may be an important predictor of poor prognosis among older patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), this study seeks to evaluate the association between frailty at ICU admission and short and long-term mortality. DESIGN: An unmatched case-control study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive Care Unit. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Patientsâ‰¥80 years of age admitted to the ICU for medical reasons. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, while secondary outcomes were ICU mortality and mortality at one year. RESULTS: Most of the patients were classified as frail at ICU admission (55.3%). The prevalence of frailty was higher among those who died than in those who were alive within 30 days from ICU admission (62.3% vs 48.3%, p=0.01). One-year mortality was higher in frail (84.4%) than in non-frail patients (65.2%, p<0.001). In the logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders such as chronic diseases, clinical complexity, cause of ICU admission and use of advanced procedures, frailty was seen to be significantly associated to one-year mortality, but not with ICU mortality or 30-day mortality. DISCUSSION: The admission of geriatric patients to the ICU is increasing. Frailty assessment may play an important role in the clinical evaluation of such individuals for triage, but should not be considered a priori as an exclusion criterion for admission.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		276	Medicina Intensiva		276	pasin,l	Pasin	L	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

METHODS: An IRB-approved single-institution prospective registry was queried for women who underwent CRS with HIPEC for advanced or recurrent gynecologic cancer from 1/1/2014-12/31/2020. Frailty was defined as a modified Frailty Index (mFI) score of â‰¥2. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of mFI upon the rate of moderate or higher (â‰¥ grade 2) Accordion postoperative complications. RESULTS: Of 141 women, 81.6% (n = 115) were non-frail with mFI of 0-1 and 18.4% (n = 26) were frail with mFI â‰¥2. The incidence of â‰¥ grade 2 complications was 21.2% (n = 14) for mFI = 0, 26.5% (n = 13) for mFI = 1, 64.7% (n = 11) for mFI = 2 and 100.0% (n = 9) for patients with mFI â‰¥3. The incidence of re-operation (1.7% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.044), ICU admission (13.2% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.018), acute kidney injury (6.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.001), and respiratory failure (0.9% vs. 19.2%, p < 0.001) were significantly lower amongst non-frail vs. frail women. On multivariable analysis, mFI â‰¥2 was associated with significantly increased â‰¥ grade 2 complications versus mFI of 0-1 (OR 9.4, 95% CI 3.3, 26.4, p < 0.001). Age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 1.09, p = 0.07), surgical indication (recurrent vs. primary) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.30, 1.7, p = 0.44) and Surgical Complexity Score of Intermediate or High vs. Low (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.67, 3.5, p = 0.31) were not associated with â‰¥grade 2 complications. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, defined by the modified frailty index, is predictive of â‰¥grade 2 postoperative complications following CRS with HIPEC in women with gynecologic cancer. Frailty screening before CRS with HIPEC may assist patient selection and improve postoperative outcomes.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		143	Gynecologic Oncology		309	chambers,laura.m	Chambers	Laura M	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
309	310	Prevention Of Pulmonary Complications In Sedated Patients Undergoing Interventional Procedures In The Nonoperating Room Anesthesia Setting.	2022.0	379	10.1097/ACO.0000000000001158	35787534.0		379	35	4	493	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) procedures have expanded in number, variety, and complexity. NORA involves all age groups, including frail older adults and patients often considered too sick to tolerate traditional surgical interventions. Postoperative pulmonary complications are a significant source of adverse events in the perioperative setting. We present a review focused on preventing pulmonary complications in the interventional NORA setting. RECENT FINDINGS: NORA locations should function as independent, autonomous ambulatory units. We discuss a strategic plan involving a thorough preoperative evaluation of patients, including recognizing high-risk patients and their anesthetic management. Finally, we offer guidance on the challenges of conducting sedation and anesthesia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or a history of COVID-19. SUMMARY: The demands on the interventional NORA anesthesia team are increasing. Strategic planning, checklists, consistent staffing assignments, and scheduled safety drills are valuable tools to improve patient safety. In addition, through quality improvement initiatives and reporting, NORA anesthetists can achieve reductions in periprocedural pulmonary complications.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		379	Current Opinion In Anaesthesiology		379	urdaneta,felipe	Urdaneta	Felipe	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
307	308	Clinical Decision-Making In Older Adults Following Emergency Admission To Hospital. Derivation And Validation Of A Risk Stratification Score: Opera.	2021.0	377	10.1371/journal.pone.0248477	33735316.0		234	16	3	e0248477	OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: Demographic changes alongside medical advances have resulted in older adults accounting for an increasing proportion of emergency hospital admissions. Current measures of illness severity, limited to physiological parameters, have shortcomings in this cohort, partly due to patient complexity. This study aimed to derive and validate a risk score for acutely unwell older adults which may enhance risk stratification and support clinical decision-making. METHODS: Data was collected from emergency admissions in patients â‰¥65 years from two UK general hospitals (April 2017- April 2018). Variables underwent regression analysis for in-hospital mortality and independent predictors were used to create a risk score. Performance was assessed on external validation. Secondary outcomes included seven-day mortality and extended hospital stay. RESULTS: Derivation (n = 8,974) and validation (n = 8,391) cohorts were analysed. The model included the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), clinical frailty scale (CFS), acute kidney injury, age, sex, and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool. For mortality, area under the curve for the model was 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.80), superior to NEWS2 0.65 (0.62-0.67) and CFS 0.76 (0.74-0.77) (P<0.0001). Risk groups predicted prolonged hospital stay: the highest risk group had an odds ratio of 9.7 (5.8-16.1) to stay >30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple validated model (Older Persons' Emergency Risk Assessment [OPERA] score) predicts in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay and could be easily integrated into electronic hospital systems, enabling automatic digital generation of risk stratification within hours of admission. Future studies may validate the OPERA score in external populations and consider an impact analysis.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		234	Plos One		377	arjan,khushal	Arjan	Khushal	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The aim of this cohort study was to analyze the radiological and functional outcome following PPF. METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter study in the period 2009-2019 of patients with PPF at two level I trauma centers in Germany was performed. PPF were classified according to the Vancouver classification system. Demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, type of surgery, complications, and reoperation rate were obtained from patient records. The functional outcome was assessed by the modified Harris-Hip Score (mHHS), general health using the EQ-5D, and radiological outcome by Beals & Tower (B&T) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients with a mean age of 79Â years (range 43-102) were included. 70% of all patients were female and 68% of the patients had an ASA scoreâ€‰â‰¥â€‰3. 20 patients suffered from a Vancouver A, 90 from a Vancouver B and 19 from a Vancouver C fracture. 14% of the patients died within the first 2Â years after surgery. The reoperation rate after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) (nâ€‰=â€‰60) was 8% and after revision arthroplasty (RA) (nâ€‰=â€‰47) 30% (OR 3.4, 95% CI [1.21-10.2]). Mean mHHS (nâ€‰=â€‰32) was 53â€‰Â±â€‰19.4 and EQ-VAS was 50â€‰Â±â€‰24.6. According to B&T criteria, 82% of patients treated with ORIF (nâ€‰=â€‰17) and 62% after RA (nâ€‰=â€‰13) showed an excellent outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients with a PPF of the hip are elderly and at increased operative risk. In cases with a stable prosthesis, ORIF provides good radiological outcome with low reoperation rates. In case of RA, the risk for revision surgery is higher.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		372	European Journal Of Trauma And Emergency Surgery: Official Publication Of The European Trauma Society		372	pflÃ¼ger,patrick	PflÃ¼ger	Patrick	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
296	297	The Role Of The Sunfrail Tool In The Screening Of Frailty And In Integrated Community-Hospital Care Pathways: A Retrospective Observational Study.	2022.0	366	10.1007/s40520-021-01931-x	34302641.0		201	34	2	419	BACKGROUND: One of the most problematic expression of ageing is frailty, and an approach based on its early identification is mandatory. The Sunfrail-tool (ST), a 9-item questionnaire, is a promising instrument for screening frailty. AIMS: To assess the diagnostic accuracy and the construct validity between the ST and a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), composed by six tests representative of the bio-psycho-social model of frailty; To verify the discriminating power of five key-questions of the ST; To investigate the role of the ST in a clinical-pathway of falls' prevention. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 235 patients from the Frailty-Multimorbidity Lab of the University-Hospital of Parma. The STs' answers were obtained from the patient's clinical information. A patient was considered frail if at least one of the CGAs' tests resulted positive. RESULTS: The ST was associated with the CGA's judgement with an Area Under the Curve of 0.691 (CI 95%: 0.591-0.791). Each CGA's test was associated with the ST total score. The five key-question showed a potential discriminating power in the CGA's tests of the corresponding domains. The fall-related question of the ST was significantly associated with the Short Physical Performance Battery total score (OR: 0.839, CI 95%: 0.766-0.918), a proxy of the risk of falling. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the ST can capture the complexity of frailty. The ST showed a good discriminating power, and it can guide a second-level assessment to key frailty domains and/or clinical pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The ST is a valid and easy-to-use instrument for the screening of frailty.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		201	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		366	longobucco,yari	Longobucco	Yari	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

A Case Report.	2021.0	390	10.1177/03008916211007930	33896256.0		215	107	6	NP67	BACKGROUND: The management of primary or recurrent vaginal tumours in an aging population is challenging for gynecologic and radiation oncologists. In patients unsuited for surgery and already irradiated on the pelvis, proton beam radiotherapy may be worthwhile due to its ballistic advantages. CASE REPORT: We report the case of an 80-year-old woman with a squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina after a history of pelvic radiation and vaginal brachytherapy delivered for a previous endometrial adenocarcinoma. She received proton beam radiotherapy with a complete response after 12 months and mild toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of reirradiation management in the frail and elderly population requires attention. Efforts should be focused on maintaining autonomy and quality of life in order to improve adherence and clinical compliance to the treatment. In the era of the tailored approach, hadrontherapy can play an important role to minimize toxicity, obtain good local control, and reduce the overall treatment time.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		215	Tumori		390	barcellini,amelia	Barcellini	Amelia	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

336	337	Understanding Diversity In Later Life Through Images Of Old Age.	2021.0	426	10.1017/S0144686X20000379			426	41	10	2396	This article aims to enhance the conceptual debate on diversity in old age by exploring the interplay of diversity in later life and images of old age. We argue that the analysis of images of old age on the micro-level is a fruitful methodology in order to unravel the meaning of diversity in later life. Drawing on findings from qualitative research in Berlin, we explore how new and diverse imaginations, experiences and lifestyles of old age emerge. The conceptual focus on images of old age enables us to investigate further what diversity in later life comprises and how it simultaneously fosters the genesis of new images of old age. The manifold new images we found in our research suggest that prevalent societal discourses about old age on the macro-level are rather deceptive and represent mostly stereotypes such as 'active agers' or 'frail and dependent elders'. We offer three explanations why alternative images of old age are currently barely present in public discourse: (a) the actors transmitting images of age; (b) the institutionalisation of the images; and (c) the challenge to communicate complexity. We conclude by suggesting that images of old age are a promising starting point to explore and make visible both the diversity of social groups within the older generation as well as the heterogeneity of older individuals.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=152364571&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:45:18	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0.0	426	Ageing & Society		426	enÃŸle,friederike	enÃŸle	friederike	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
333	334	664 Exploring The Feasibility Of The Interrai Check-Up Form (Self-Reported) In Older People Living With Frailty In The Community.	2022.0	417	10.1093/ageing/afac037.664			406	51		1	Introduction Identifying the holistic needs of community dwelling older people is an essential component of clinical care. Current assessment instruments are limited by a narrow medical view and varied language use, referring to identical clinical concepts in different ways. The interRAI family of assessments have been designed to integrate health information across multiple settings. The interRAI Check-Up (Self-Reported) was designed to support the management of older adults with multi-morbidities in the community setting but has not yet been widely tested in clinical practice in the United Kingdom. Objectives To investigate the extent to which the self-reported interRAI Check-Up tool could be used to assess older patients within the NHS. Methods Patients attending two outpatient clinics were recruited to complete the interRAI Check-Up which comprised of 109 items. Time taken for tool completion and prompts needed were recorded. Patient and individual item completion rates were calculated and assessed for floor or ceiling effects. Patient views on completing the tool were collected as field notes. Clinic staff completed a questionnaire exploring their views of the tool. Thematic analysis was carried out on patient and staff data. Results From 43 patient participants, the median time for tool completion was 25Â minutes. The median patient completion rate was 96.6% and item completion rate was 97.1%. Of 105 analysed items, 55 items showed a ceiling or floor effect. The tool was found to comprehensively cover holistic needs but its length and complexity of structure was found to be a barrier during busy clinical practice. Conclusion The Self-reported interRAI Check-Up tool was found to be feasible for use in the outpatient setting. Further research into which patient groups and locations would benefit most is recommended as well as how to practically implement the assessment into clinical practice within the NHS.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=156110052&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:45:18	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0.0	406	Age & Ageing		417	rajpara,m.k	rajpara	m.k	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
320	321	Improving Medication Adherence And Effective Prescribing Through A Patient-Centered Prescription Model In Patients With Multimorbidity.	2022.0	395	10.1007/s00228-021-03207-9	34448906.0		395	78	1	127	PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the impact of the patient-centered prescription (PCP) model in medication adherence and effective prescribing in patients with multimorbidity. METHODS: Uncontrolled before-after study in an intermediate care facility in a mixed urban-rural district. Inpatients agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰65Â years with multimorbidity exposed to polypharmacy before hospital admission were consecutively enrolled. Every patient's treatment plan was analyzed through the PCP model, which includes interventions aimed at improving medication adherence. The primary endpoint was the change in the proportion of adherent patients between pre-admission and after discharge for all regularly scheduled long-term medications, using the proportion of days covered (PDC). Secondary endpoints included the change on mean PDC for all long-term medications, number of long-term medications, proportion of patients with hyperpolypharmacy, medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) score, drug burden index (DBI) score, number of potential inappropriate prescribing (PIP), and proportion of patients withâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2 PIPs. RESULTS: Ninety-three non-institutionalized patients were included (mean age 83.0â€‰Â±â€‰SD 6.1Â years). The proportion of adherent patients increased from 22.1 to 51.9% (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Intervention also improved mean PDC [mean difference (95% CI) 10.6 (7.7, 13.5)] and effective prescribing through a reduction on the number of long-term medications [-â€‰1.3 (-â€‰1.7,â€‰-â€‰0.9)], proportion of patients exposed to hyperpolypharmacy (-â€‰16.1%, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), MRCI score [-â€‰2.2 (-â€‰3.4,â€‰-â€‰1.0)], DBI score [-â€‰0.16 (-â€‰1.8,â€‰-â€‰1.3)], number of PIPs [-â€‰1.6 (-â€‰1.8,â€‰-â€‰1.3)], and proportion of patients withâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2 PIPs (-â€‰53.7%, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). CONCLUSION: Studied intervention provides significant effective prescribing and medication adherence enhancements in non-institutionalized older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		395	European Journal Of Clinical Pharmacology		395	gonzÃ¡lez-bueno,j	GonzÃ¡lez-Bueno	J	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

We designed an intervention based on person-centred care model. This article outlines a study protocol, which aims to explore the effects of the intervention to improve therapeutic adequacy in polymedicated elderly patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open, randomised, multicentre, controlled clinical trial. The study population includes polymedicated (â‰¥8 prescription medications) patients â‰¥75 years old. In the intervention group, the multidisciplinary team (primary care pharmacist, family doctor and nurse) will meet to carry out multidimensional reviews (frailty, clinical complexity, morbidity and therapeutic adequacy) of the study subjects. If changes are proposed to the treatment plan, a clinical interview will be conducted with the patient to agree on changes in accordance with their preferences. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 6 and 12 months. In the control group, where the usual clinical practice will be followed, the necessary data will be collected to compare the results.The key variables are the variation in the mean number of incidents (potentially inappropriate prescription) per patient, the number of medications, the number of changes implemented to the treatment plan and the variation in the number of hospital admissions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the IDIAPJGol and by the University of Barcelona's Bioethics Commission. The results are expected to be published in peer reviewed open-access journals, and as part of a doctoral thesis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04188470.

286	287	New Horizons In Evidence-Based Care For Older People: Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis.	2022.0	355	10.1093/ageing/afac090	35460409.0		178	51	4	None	Evidence-based decisions on clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions are ideally informed by meta-analyses of intervention trial data. However, when undertaken, such meta-analyses in ageing research have typically been conducted using standard methods whereby summary (aggregate) data are extracted from published trial reports. Although meta-analysis of aggregate data can provide useful insights into the average effect of interventions within a selected trial population, it has limitations regarding robust conclusions on which subgroups of people stand to gain the greatest benefit from an intervention or are at risk of experiencing harm. Future evidence synthesis using individual participant data from ageing research trials for meta-analysis could transform understanding of the effectiveness of interventions for older people, supporting evidence-based and sustainable commissioning. A major advantage of individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) is that it enables examination of characteristics that predict treatment effects, such as frailty, disability, cognitive impairment, ethnicity, gender and other wider determinants of health. Key challenges of IPDMA relate to the complexity and resources needed for obtaining, managing and preparing datasets, requiring a meticulous approach involving experienced researchers, frequently with expertise in designing and analysing clinical trials. In anticipation of future IPDMA work in ageing research, we are establishing an international Ageing Research Trialists collective, to bring together trialists with a common focus on transforming care for older people as a shared ambition across nations.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		178	Age And Ageing		355	clegg,andrew	Clegg	Andrew	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
263	264	Animal Naming Test Is Associated With Poor Patient-Reported Outcomes And Frailty In People With And Without Cirrhosis: A Prospective Cohort Study.	2022.0	330	10.14309/ctg.0000000000000447	35080516.0		330	13	1	e00447	INTRODUCTION: Cognitive dysfunction is a major driver of care complexity, poor patient-reported outcomes, and frailty for people with cirrhosis. The performance and clinical associations of the animal naming test (ANT) in the general population are unknown. We evaluated ANT performance in a representative sample of older Americans with and without chronic liver disease (CLD). METHODS: We analyzed 6,661 subjects enrolled in the 2010-2016 Health and Retirement Survey, a representative cohort of >30,000 US adults. Average age of participants was 75 years. We evaluated 3 subject subgroups: (i) without CLD, (ii) noncirrhosis CLD, and (iii) cirrhosis. We determined the association between the ANT (overall) and S-ANT1 <10 (adjusted for age and education) and health status, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, healthcare utilization (care hours received and hospitalizations), and frailty measures (hand grip and walk speed). RESULTS: Overall, 8.2% of the sample had noncirrhotic CLD and 1.3% had cirrhosis. CLD or cirrhosis was not independently associated with ANT. Poor ANT performance was associated with poor health status and frailty overall. An S-ANT <10 was associated with fair-poor self-reported health (odds ratio [OR] 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.56), care hours received (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.39; 95% CI: 1.79-3.19), and hospitalizations (IRR 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03-1.26). S-ANT <10 was also associated with activities of daily living disability (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51), instrumental activities of daily living disability (OR 1.85; 95% CI: 1.59-2.14), weaker hand grip (IRR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92-0.96), and time to walk 2.5 m (IRR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.17-1.29). DISCUSSION: ANT performance is not specific to CLD/cirrhosis but is associated with patient-reported outcomes and frailty in a nationally representative sample of elderly subjects with and without CLD.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		330	Clinical And Translational Gastroenterology		330	tapper,elliot.b	Tapper	Elliot B	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
250	251	Older Patients' Perspectives On Factors Contributing To Frequent Visits To The Emergency Department: A Qualitative Interview Study.	2021.0	315	10.1186/s12889-021-11755-z	34544405.0		315	21	1	1709	BACKGROUND: Older patients are at high risk of unplanned revisits to the emergency department (ED) because of their medical complexity. To reduce the number of ED visits, we need more knowledge about the patient-level, environmental, and healthcare factors involved. The aim of this study was to describe older patients' perspectives and experiences before and after an ED visit, and to identify factors that possibly contribute to frequent ED revisits. METHODS: This was a qualitative description study. We performed semi-structured individual interviews with older patients who frequently visited the ED and were discharged home after an acute visit. Patients were enrolled in the ED of a university medical centre using purposive sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded independently by two researchers. Theoretical analysis was used to identify recurring patterns and themes in the data. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS: In-depth interviews were completed with 13 older patients. Three main themes emerged: 1) medical events leading to feelings of crisis, 2) patients' untreated health problems, and 3) persistent problems in health and daily functioning post discharge. Participants identified problems before and after their ED visit that possibly contributed to further ED visits. These problems included increasing symptoms leading to feelings of crisis, the relationship with the general practitioner, incomplete discharge information at the ED, and inadequate follow-up and lack of recovery after an ED visit. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study identified multiple factors that may contribute to frequent ED visits among older patients. Older patients in need of acute care might benefit from hospital-at-home interventions, or acute care provided by geriatric emergency teams in the primary care setting. Identifying frailty in the ED is needed to improve discharge communication and adequate follow-up is needed to improve recovery after an acute ED visit.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		315	Bmc Public Health		315	kolk,daisy	Kolk	Daisy	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
248	249	The Grief And Bereavement Experiences Of Informal Caregivers: A Scoping Review Of The North American Literature.	2022.0	313	10.1177/08258597211052269	34860618.0		313	37	2	242	Background: Informal caregivers are a significant part of the hospice and palliative care landscape as members of the interdisciplinary care team. Despite this, little is known about the impact this responsibility has on informal caregivers' experiences of grief and bereavement. Objective: To address this, a scoping review of the literature was conducted to explore the current state of knowledge toward grief and bereavement of informal caregivers of adult/geriatric patients in the hospice and palliative/end-of-life care realm within North America. Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-step framework, key electronic health care and social sciences databases (eg, CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO) alongside gray literature sources were searched and screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thematic content analysis was used to identify key themes. Results: 29 articles met the final inclusion criteria with 3 central themes emerging: (1) mediators of grief, (2) grief experiences, and (3) types of grief. Discussion: Informal caregivers encounter unique grief and bereavement experiences: The range of psychosocial outcomes, both negative and positive, can be affected by various mediators such as caregiver burden, demographics, disease type of the patient being cared for, etc. Bereavement interventions must be designed with the mediators of grief in mind. Conclusions: Understanding the nuances of informal caregivers' experiences with grief and bereavement will inform and advance practice, policy, and research. Practitioners/clinicians should be further educated on how to properly acknowledge the complexity of grief and bereavement for informal caregivers, specifically paying attention to mediators. Further research needs to consider the role of culture.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		313	Journal Of Palliative Care		313	skantharajah,neerjah	Skantharajah	Neerjah	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
267	268	Frailty Index Is Useful For Predicting Postoperative Morbidity In Older Patients Undergoing Gastrointestinal Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study.	2022.0	336	10.1186/s12893-022-01471-9	35172806.0		336	22	1	57	BACKGROUND: Many assessment tools have been used to identify frail surgical patients. This study was designed to explore the prediction value of the frailty index (FI) for postoperative morbidity in older patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Between January 2019 and September 2020, we conducted a prospective study in our hospital, and patients aged over 65Â years were enrolled. The FI assessment was conducted by two specialist nurses based on the 38-item scale, and patients were considered frail if the FI score wasâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.25. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative morbidity. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to find the risk factors related to postoperative morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 246 consecutive patients were enrolled, for whom the median age was 72.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 67.0-77.0] years old, and 175 (71.1%) were male. Of these, 47 (19.1%) were frail. Patients with frailty were associated with older age (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), lower body mass index (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), lower albumin (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) and haemoglobin (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) levels, increased blood loss (pâ€‰=â€‰0.034), increased risk of postoperative morbidity (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), increased median length of stay (pâ€‰=â€‰0.017), and increased median postoperative hospital stay (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003). Multivariable analysis revealed that ASA grade [odds ratio (OR): 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-5.64, pâ€‰=â€‰0.016], FI score (OR 7.68, 95% CI 3.19-18.48, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and surgical complexity (OR 22.83, 95% CI 5.46-95.51, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) were independent predictors of 30-day postoperative morbidity. However, for patients with major surgery, FI score was the only independent predictor (OR 8.67, 95% CI 3.23-23.25, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, and the 38-item FI scale was a useful frailty screening tool for older patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. For patients with major surgery, frailty was a more reliable predictor of postoperative 30-day morbidity than age and ASA grade.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		336	Bmc Surgery		336	gu,chaoyang	Gu	Chaoyang	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
281	282	Implementation Of The Frailty Assessment To Improve Liver Transplant Outcomes.	2022.0	350	10.1007/s40520-022-02111-1	35380349.0		201	34	8	1919	The majority of patients undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) have increased in age, therefore chronological age may have become an unreliable parameter for supporting clinical decisions. The age-related deficit accumulation model measuring frailty proposed by Rockwood et al., may propose an alternative in providing an estimate of an individual's biological age. No Frailty Index (FI) tailored specifically for OLT patients exists to date. Forty-three consecutive OLT patients withâ€‰â‰¥â€‰20Â years of survival with a functioning graft were included in our study. The FI was computed taking to account 39 items (FI-39), meeting the standard criteria for internal validation. Endpoints were polypharmacy, and recent Emergency Room admission. The mean age of our population was 69 (sd 9) years. The mean FI-39 was 0.23 (sd 0.1). The FI-39 was associated with polypharmacy [odds ratio (OR) 1.13; Confidence interval (95%CI) 1.03-1.24; pâ€‰=â€‰0.01], and recent Emergency Room admission [beta coefficientâ€‰+â€‰1.98; 95%CIâ€‰+â€‰0.26,â€‰+â€‰3.70; pâ€‰=â€‰0.03], independent for age and sex. This study demonstrates that an FI can be derived from data collected during routine clinical follow-up and allows for improved differentiation related to the OLT clinical complexity in OLT patients, independent of chronological age. This may lead to the adoption of FI-39 to improve personalized OLT patient care.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		201	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		350	corradi,mattia	Corradi	Mattia	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
278	279	Age-Related Changes In Clinical Characteristics And Outcomes Of Chronic Heart Failure Outpatients In A Cardiology Setting. A Report From The Italian Network On Heart Failure.	2022.0	347	10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.11.014	34793855.0		347	346		36	AIMS: Ageing and comorbidities are increasing frailty/complexity of heart failure (HF) patients globally. We assessed evolving trends over two decades according to patients' age and time of recruitment in a nationwide cardiology setting in Italy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chronic HF outpatients recruited between 1999 and 2018 (NÂ =Â 14,823) were divided into 3 cohorts: 1999-2005 (NÂ =Â 5404); 2006-2011 (NÂ =Â 3971); 2012-2018 (NÂ =Â 5448). We analyzed temporal changes in clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcome (1-year all-cause mortality/cardiovascular hospitalization), overall and by age group: <65 (nÂ =Â 5465); 65-79 (nÂ =Â 6838); â‰¥80 (nÂ =Â 2520) years old. Across enrolment epochs, comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, obesity) increased by both epoch/age groups (pÂ <Â 0.001), whereas the prevalence of ischemic etiology declined among patients â‰¥65Â years (pÂ =Â 0.05). Accordingly, the preserved LVEF phenotype (HFpEF) increased in all age categories (pÂ <Â 0.001) over time. Moreover, the use of betablockers, mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists and loop-diuretics rose by enrolment epoch in all age groups (pÂ <Â 0.05). In parallel with these epidemiologic/treatment changes, age-adjusted survival free from cardiovascular hospitalization improved over time (pÂ <Â 0.0001). However, divergent trends in the end-point components were apparent according to age groups: mortality decreased in patients<80Â years, although hospitalizations remained stable in the youngest group, while subjects â‰¥65Â years were less likely to be admitted for cardiovascular causes (all pÂ <Â 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Over two decades in a cardiology outpatient setting, the prevalence of comorbid HFpEF increased in all age categories. Mortality improved among patients<80Â years and cardiovascular hospitalizations decreased in patientsâ‰¥65Â years. These findings point to the value of cardiologist' input in the management of adult chronic HF patients at all ages.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		347	International Journal Of Cardiology		347	gori,mauro	Gori	Mauro	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
65	66	Future Nursing Research Of Older Adults: Preserving Independence And Reducing Health Disparities.	2022.0	93				93	26	1	1	Nursing professionals are at the forefront of primary care and the largest segment of the health workforce, and nurse researchers can bring vital perspectives to aging research and clinical practice. Although healthcare systems are experiencing more work from the aging of populations, unfortunately there are limited nurse researchers trained in gerontological nursing. Future research in older adults needs to be based on the current needs of and for older adults. In this article, I identify potential future research of aspects for older adults by highlighting opportunities and examples to conduct culturally appropriate interventions that aim to reduce health disparities and preserve independence. Because there is a complexity of health issues in older adults, nurse researchers need to pursue the best ways to address their needs, investigate and disseminate technology-based assessments, provide culturally appropriate interventions to promote independence, prevent chronic conditions, and enhance health equality. Nurses and nurse researchers also need to monitor the changes in functional status and health of older adults, especially as the global burden and costs of diseases and disability of this population grows, and to save unnecessary health care expenditure. To create new knowledge and discover best practices in aging care, nurse researchers lead multidisciplinary teams, develop innovative ideas with the potential for significant clinical impact, and use appropriate research approaches that steer to successful grant applications to national funding agencies. It is essential to establish a program for training or mentoring nurse researchers dedicated to caring for older adults, advocating, and disseminating innovative care to maximize the independence of older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=154207049&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:42:38	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	1.0	93	Pacific Rim International Journal of Nursing Research	1.0	93	ladda,thiamwong	ladda	thiamwong	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
64	65	Social Care Costs For Communityâ€Dwelling Older People Living With Frailty.	2022.0	91	10.1111/hsc.13450			91	30	3	e804	International evidence indicates that older people with frailty are more likely to access social care services, compared to nonfrail older people. There is, however, no robust evidence on costs of social care provided for communityâ€dwelling older people living with frailty in their own homes. The main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between communityâ€dwelling older people living with frailty, defined using the cumulative deficit model, and annual formal social care costs for the 2012â€“2018 period. A secondary objective was to estimate formal social care spending for every 1% reduction in the number of older people who develop frailty over 1 year. Secondary analysis of prospective cohort data from two large nationally representative communityâ€based cohort studies in England was performed. Respondents aged â‰¥75 were used in the main analysis and respondents aged 65â€“74 in sensitivity testing. We used regression tree modelling for formal social care cost analysis including frailty, age, gender, age at completing education and living with partner as key covariates. We employed a minimum node size stopping criteria to limit tree complexity and overfitting and applied 'bootstrap aggregating' to improve robustness. We assessed the impact of an intervention for every 1% decrease in the number of individuals who become frail over 1 year in England. Results show that frailty is the strongest predictor of formal social care costs. Mean social care costs for people who are not frail are Â£321, compared with Â£2,895 for individuals with frailty. For every 1% of nonfrail people not transitioning to frailty savings of Â£4.4 million in annual expenditures on formal social care in England are expected, not including expenditure on care homes. Given considerably higher costs for individuals classed as frail compared to nonfrail, a successful intervention avoiding or postponing the onset of frailty has the potential to considerably reduce social care costs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=156251798&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:42:38	2	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0.0	91	Health & Social Care in the Community	1.0	91	nikolova,silviya	nikolova	silviya	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The Hospital in the Home (HitH) model of care ensures that this approach maximises patient safety and limits potential risk for patients. As HitH services have seen record numbers of patient referrals in the past 2 years, there is now a greater need to measure and understand the acuity and dependency levels of the caseload. Through an expert clinician development process at one NHS trust, aspects of procedural complexity, interdisciplinary working, risk stratification and comorbidities were used to quantify acuity and dependency. This paper uses a case study approach to present a new method of measuring this important concept.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=152928984&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:42:39	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	0.0	97	British Journal of Community Nursing	1.0	97	baker,edward	baker	edward	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Ageing alters BP homeostasis, resulting in postural hypotension and increased BP variability. Co-morbidity and frailty add complexity to understanding BP changes in later life. Longitudinal BP declines are likely driven by accumulating co-morbidity and are accelerated in both frailty and dementia. This narrative review summarises what is known about the association between BP and frailty, the clinical management of BP in frailty and the association between BP, cognitive decline and dementia.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		21	Experimental Gerontology		129	masoli,jane.a.h	Masoli	Jane A H	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Older adults with T2DM present particularly difficult challenges. For example, the accentuated heterogeneity of these patients, the potential presence of multiple comorbidities, the increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, the increased dependence on care and the effect of frailty all add to the complexity of managing diabetes mellitus in this age group. In this Review, we offer an update on the key pathophysiological mechanisms associated with T2DM in older people. We then evaluate new evidence relating particularly to the effects of frailty and sarcopenia, the clinical difficulties of age-associated comorbidities, and the implications for existing guidelines and therapeutic options. Our conclusions will focus on the effect of T2DM on an ageing society.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		118	Nature Reviews.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore function-focused clinical communication among nurses and providers based on the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) approach toward interdisciplinary collaboration to maintain function among nursing home residents and to identify the characteristics of SBAR flows in nursing homes. Methods: Detailed interviews with 28 interdisciplinary professionals working in four nursing homes were conducted. Directed qualitative content analysis was used to identify the internal attributes of SBAR-based communication. Case analysis was conducted to identify SBAR flows. Results: Four themes emerged as key factors for function-focused interdisciplinary staff communication in nursing homes. Effective nursing care to maintain function among nursing home residents requires accurate awareness of abnormal circumstances. Knowledge of assessment and resident background are needed to address situations requiring intervention and identify the problems underlying a resident's current state. The optimal therapeutic environment is created by sharing roles and tasks among practitioners through referrals. Twelve generalized situations requiring function-focused communication (i.e., dislocation of body line because of joint contracture, change in walking, difficulty of moving because of pain, difficulty in eating, fever, change in sleep pattern, change in excretion pattern, change in weight, change in condition, change in problematic behavior, decrease in cognitive function, and change in relationships) and the related nurse-centered SBAR pathways were identified. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: These results represent a first prototype for developing practical communication guidelines for nursing-home-specific function-focused care and provide new insights into the interdisciplinary approach.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=150250201&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:42:39	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2022.10.03.xml	1.0	99	Journal of Nursing Research (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)	1.0	107	park,min.sun	park	min.sun	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
47	48	A Study To Introduce National Early Warning Scores (News) In Care Homes: Influence On Decision-Making And Referral Processes	2022.0	61	10.1002/nop2.1091	34780677.0	WOS:000718463100001	61	9	1	519.0	Aim: Early warning scores are commonly used in hospital settings, but little is known about their use in care homes. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of National Early Warning Scores alongside other measures in this setting. Design: Convergent parallel design. Methods: Quantitative data from 276 care home residents from four care homes were used to analyse the relationship between National Early Warning Scores score, resident outcome and functional daily living (Barthel ADL (Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living)) and Rockwood (frailty). Interviews with care home staff (N = 13) and care practitioners (N = 4) were used to provide qualitative data. Results: A statistically significant link between National Early Warning Scores (p = .000) and Barthel ADL (p = .013) score and hospital admissions was found, while links with Rockwood were insignificant (p = .551). Care home staff reported many benefits of National Early Warning Scores, including improved communication, improved decision-making and role empowerment. Although useful, due to the complexity of the resident population's existing health conditions, National Early Warning Scores alone could not act as a diagnostic tool.		2023-01-03 03:41:46	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls	1.0	61	Nursing Open	1.0	61	hodgson,philip	hodgson	philip	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
21	22	Clinical Decision Path For Identifying Recurrent Falls In Late Middle-Aged And Older Patients With Chronic Schizophrenia.	2021.0	23	10.1097/JNR.0000000000000444	34183567.0		23	29	5	e167	BACKGROUND: Falls are a major hazard for elderly patients with schizophrenia. As patients with schizophrenia may experience a more-accelerated rate of physical aging than the overall elderly population, the risk of falls may emerge during the late middle-age period in this population. Furthermore, the risk of falls is affected by multiple, interrelated risk factors. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to capture the complexity of the risk of falls in patients with schizophrenia. A cross-sectional approach was used to apply classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to generate a clinical decision path to identify the risk factors of recurrent falls in late middle-aged and older patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-one patients aged 55 years or older were recruited from psychiatric halfway houses for assessment. Frailty, physical functional performance, depressive severity, cognitive function, and level of fatigue were measured, respectively, using the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Frailty Index, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), and Chinese version of the Fatigue Severity Scale. The variables revealed by descriptive statistics to be statistically significant were further analyzed using CART analysis. RESULTS: The overall proportion of recurrent fallers in this study was 19.2%. CART analysis revealed eight end groups and identified four predictors: frailty, physical functional performance, cognitive function, and sex. The most prominent condition for recurrent fallers was frailty, present in 57.1% of the frail participants. In the nonfrail group (both prefrail and robust), participants with an SPPB score of less than 10 had a 29.7% chance of being a recurrent faller versus 13.6% for those with an SPPB score of 10 or more. Furthermore, an SPMSQ score of 7 was the next-best split among participants without frailty, with an SPPB score of 10 or more. Finally, among participants without frailty and with an SPPB score of 10 or more and an SPMSQ score of more than 7, the proportion of recurrent fallers was higher in women than men. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that assessing frailty status may be an effective, first-step approach to identifying schizophrenic patients at an increased risk of recurrent falls. Among patients with prefrailty or robust status, an SPPB score cutoff of 10, an SPMSQ score cutoff of 7, and being female may be used sequentially to identify individuals at a heightened risk of recurrent falls.		2023-01-03 03:39:18	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1.0	23	The Journal Of Nursing Research: Jnr	1.0	23	wang,mei-yeh	Wang	Mei-Yeh	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
32	33	Variability In Healthcare Expenditure According To The Stratification Of Adjusted Morbidity Groups In The Canary Islands (Spain).	2022.0	34	10.3390/ijerph19074219	35409900.0		8	19	7	None	Morbidity is the main item in the distribution of expenditure on healthcare services. The Adjusted Morbidity Group (AMG) measures comorbidity and complexity and classifies the patient into mutually exclusive clinical categories. The aim of this study is to analyse the variability of healthcare expenditure on users with similar scores classified by the AMG. Observational analytical and retrospective study. Population: 1,691,075 subjects, from Canary Islands (Spain), aged over 15 years with data from health cards, clinical history, Basic Minimum Specialised Healthcare Data Set, AMG, hospital agreements information system and Electronic Prescriptions. A descriptive, bivariant (ANOVA coefficient Î·(2)) and multivariant analysis was conducted. There is a correlation between the costs and the weight of AMG (rho = 0.678) and the prescribed active ingredients (rho = 0.689), which is smaller with age and does not exist with the other variables. As for the influence of the AMG morbidity group on the total costs of the patient, the coefficient Î·(2) (0.09) obtains a median effect in terms of the variability of expenditure, hence there is intra- and inter-group variability in the cost. In a first model created with all the variables and the cost, an explanatory power of 36.43% (R(2) = 0.3643) was obtained; a second model that uses solely active ingredients, AMG weight, being female and a pensioner obtained an explanatory power of 36.4%. There is room for improvement in terms of predicting the expenditure.		2023-01-03 03:39:18	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2022.10.03.txt	1.0	8	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		34	company-sancho,maria.consuelo	Company-Sancho	Maria Consuelo	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Methods: It is a concept analysis, guided by the method proposed by Walker and Avant, made operational through an integrative literature review. The search in a scientific database was carried out using the descriptors: Frail elderly, syndrome, phenotype, geriatric assessment, and aging. The literary corpus comprised 66 studies. Results: The study found the antecedents and attributes (categorized as physical, sociodemographic, and behavioral/environmental) that integrate the signs and symptoms evidenced in the frailty syndrome, as well as the consequences of this concept. The variables were analyzed with emphasis on the conceptions that influence the frailty process of the elderly. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the complexity arising from the multifactorial genesis of the referred syndrome, emphasizing the specificities of the elderly's frailty. However, we recommend conducting further research involving the phenomenon in question to understand the construct better.		2023-01-03 03:41:46	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2022.10.03.xls	1.0	42	Revista Brasileira De Enfermagem	1.0	42	rodrigues lopes de oliveira,fabiana maria	rodrigues lopes de oliveira	fabiana maria	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Biological complexity, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and social issues often hamper the possibility to directly translate the evidence coming from research into clinical practice. Frailty indeed represents the most relevant cause of the â€œevidence-based medicine issueâ€ influencing clinical decisions in geriatric care. Today, patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) are much older and frailer than some decades ago. They also tend to have more drugs prescribed. In parallel, research on AD has evolved over the years, hypothesizing that anticipating the interventions to the earliest stages of the disease may provide beneficial effects (to date, still lacking). In this article, we argue that, by focusing exclusively on â€œthe diseaseâ€ and pushing to anticipate its detection (sometimes even before the appareance of its clinical manifestations) may overshadow the personâ€™s values and priorities. Research should be developed for better integrating the concept of aging and frailty in the design of clinical trials in order to provide results that can be implemented in real life. On the other hand, clinicians should be less prone to the easy (but unsupported by evidence) pharmacological prescription.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		127	The Journal Of Prevention Of Alzheimer'S Disease		127	canevelli,m	Canevelli	M	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
338	339	Widowhood And Loneliness Among Chinese Older Adults: The Role Of Education And Gender.	2021.0	431	10.1080/13607863.2020.1732293			431	25	7	1214	Widowhood is a significant predictor of loneliness in older adults and research on the underlying mechanisms of this link using longitudinal data is limited. This study examined whether education would moderate the effect of widowhood on loneliness, and whether such a relationship would differ by gender among Chinese older adults. A total of 2,704 older adults from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey were included. They were aged 65 years and above, were not lonely, and were married. Logistic regression models were applied to examine the interaction between widowhood, education, and gender on loneliness in the 2011 wave. Widowhood was a significant predictor of loneliness and could increase the odds of becoming lonely by 193%. The interaction between widowhood and education was significant only in older women, not in older men. Literate older women reported lower loneliness than did their illiterate counterparts when they remained married during the follow-up. However, when their spouse passed away, literate women did not differ from their illiterate counterparts in loneliness. This study revealed a gendered pattern in the interaction between widowhood and education on loneliness and demonstrated the complexity of the mechanisms. Furthermore, it highlighted the importance of considering the role of education and gender simultaneously in a Chinese context.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=151062479&site=ehost-live	2023-01-03 03:45:18	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2022.10.03.xml	0.0	431	Aging & Mental Health		431	yang,fang	yang	fang	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
180	181	Age Is Just A Number: Is Frailty Being Ignored In Vascular Access Planning For Dialysis?	2022.0	231	10.1177/1129729821989902	33522351.0		231	23	2	192	Current international guidelines advocate fistula creation as first choice for vascular access in haemodialysis patients, however, there have been suggestions that in certain groups of patients, in particular the elderly, a more tailored approach is needed. The prevalence of more senior individuals receiving renal replacement therapy has increased in recent years and therefore including patient age in decision making regarding choice of vascular access for dialysis has gained more relevance. However, it seems that age is being used as a surrogate for overall clinical condition and it can be proposed that frailty may be a better basis to considering when advising and counselling patients with regard to vascular access for dialysis. Frailty is a clinical condition in which the person is in a vulnerable state with reduced functional capacity and has a higher risk of adverse health outcomes when exposed to stress inducing events. Prevalence of frailty increases with age and has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, hospitalisation, disability and falls. Chronic kidney disease is associated with premature ageing and therefore patients with kidney disease are prone to be frailer irrespective of age and the risk increases further with declining kidney function. Limited data exists on the relationship between frailty and vascular access, but it appears that frailty may have an association with poorer outcomes from vascular access. However, further research is warranted. Due to complexity in decision making in dialysis access, frailty assessment could be a key element in providing patient-centred approach in planning and maintaining vascular access for dialysis.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		231	The Journal Of Vascular Access		231	kuningas,kulli	Kuningas	Kulli	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
134	135	Frailty Assessment In The Emergency Department For Risk Stratification Of Covid-19 Patients Aged â‰¥80Â Years.	2021.0	175	10.1016/j.jamda.2021.07.005	34364846.0		74	22	9	1845	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in a cohort of adults aged â‰¥80Â years, the overlapping effect of clinical severity, comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and frailty, for the in-hospital death risk stratification of COVID-19 older patients since emergency department (ED) admission. DESIGN: Single-center prospective observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in the ED of a teaching hospital that is a referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We enrolled all patients with aged â‰¥80Â years old consecutively admitted to the ED between April 2020 and MarchÂ 2021. METHODS: Clinical variables assessed in the ED were evaluated for the association with all-cause in-hospital death. Evaluated parameters were severity of disease, frailty, comorbidities, cognitive impairment, delirium, and dependency in daily life activities. Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for poor outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 729 patients aged â‰¥80Â years were enrolled [median age 85Â years (interquartile range 82-89); 346 were males (47.3%)]. According to the Clinical Frailty Scale, 61 (8.4%) were classified as fit, 417 (57.2%) as vulnerable, and 251 (34.4%) as frail. Severe disease [hazard ratio (HR) 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.59], â‰¥3 comorbidities (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.11-2.13), male sex (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.87), and frailty (HR 6.93, 95% CI 1.69-28.27) for vulnerable and an overall HR of 12.55 (95% CI 2.96-53.21) for frail were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The ED approach to older patients with COVID-19 should take into account the functional and clinical characteristics of patients being admitted. A sole evaluation based on the clinical severity and the presence of comorbidities does not reflect the complexity of this population. A comprehensive evaluation based on clinical severity, multimorbidity, and frailty could effectively predict the clinical risk of in-hospital death for patients with COVID-19 aged â‰¥80Â years at the time of ED presentation.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		74	Journal Of The American Medical Directors Association		175	covino,marcello	Covino	Marcello	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
96	97	Adverse Drug Reactions In Older Adults: A Narrative Review Of The Literature.	2021.0	130	10.1007/s41999-021-00481-9	33738772.0		130	12	3	463	PURPOSE: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a common and potentially preventable cause of unplanned hospitalization, increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. We aimed to review the classification and occurrence of ADRs in the older population, discuss the role of age as a risk factor, and identify interventions to prevent ADRs. METHODS: We performed a narrative scoping review of the literature to assess classification, occurrence, factors affecting ADRs, and possible strategies to identify and prevent ADRs. RESULTS: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are often classified as Type A and Type B reactions, based on dose and effect of the drugs and fatality of the reaction. More recently, other approaches have been proposed (i.e. Dose, Time and Susceptibility (DoTS) and EIDOS classifications). The frequency of ADRs varies depending on definitions, characteristics of the studied population, and settings. Their occurrence is often ascribed to commonly used drugs, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, digoxin, insulin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Age-related factors-changes in pharmacokinetics, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and frailty-have been related to ADRs. Different approaches (i.e. medication review, software identifying potentially inappropriate prescription and drug interactions) have been suggested to prevent ADRs and proven to improve the quality of prescribing. However, consistent evidence on their effectiveness is still lacking. Few studies suggest that a comprehensive geriatric assessment, aimed at identifying individual risk factors, patients' needs, treatment priorities, and strategies for therapy optimization, is key for reducing ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a relevant health burden. The medical complexity that characterizes older patients requires a holistic approach to reduce the burden of ADRs in this population.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		130	European Geriatric Medicine		130	zazzara,maria.beatrice	Zazzara	Maria Beatrice	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
141	142	Interventions To Reduce Polypharmacy And Optimize Medication Use In Older Adults With Cancer.	2021.0	183	10.1016/j.jgo.2020.12.007	33353854.0		183	12	6	863	The use of polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) is an increasingly common, concerning public health issue in older adults, and a concurrent cancer diagnosis only further escalates the prevalence and complexity. Polypharmacy and PIM use has been associated with negative patient outcomes, including falls, chemotherapy toxicities and other adverse events, postoperative complications, frailty, functional impairment, and shortened survival. Despite the recognition of the harms, the prevalence of polypharmacy and PIM use continues to rise due to a lack of standardized identification and intervention methods. Efforts to reduce the prevalence have included use of explicit PIM screening tools (e.g., Beers criteria), comprehensive medication reviews, and deprescribing algorithms. However, these efforts are not widespread and the research on the effectiveness of such interventions is limited. To better understand what is known, this paper summarized available studies evaluating the effect of interventions on reducing the burden of polypharmacy/PIMs and provided recommendations to guide further practice models to reduce the negative consequences associated with polypharmacy and PIM use. Furthermore, we aim to establish a framework for clinical practice and to highlight areas for future intervention-based research to improve outcomes for older adults with cancer.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		183	Journal Of Geriatric Oncology		183	barlow,ashley	Barlow	Ashley	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
149	150	Predictivity Of The Comorbidity Indices For Geriatric Syndromes.	2022.0	192	10.1186/s12877-022-03066-8	35590276.0		16	22	1	440	BACKGROUND: The aging population and increasing chronic diseases make a tremendous burden on the health care system. The study evaluated the relationship between comorbidity indices and common geriatric syndromes. METHODS: A total of 366 patients who were hospitalized in a university geriatric inpatient service were included in the study. Sociodemographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and comprehensive geriatric assessment(CGA) parameters were recorded. Malnutrition, urinary incontinence, frailty, polypharmacy, falls, orthostatic hypotension, depression, and cognitive performance were evaluated. Comorbidities were ranked using the Charlson Comorbidity Index(CCI), Elixhauser Comorbidity Index(ECM), Geriatric Index of Comorbidity(GIC), and Medicine Comorbidity Index(MCI). Because, the CCI is a valid and reliable tool used in different clinical settings and diseases, patients with CCI score higher than four was accepted as multimorbid. Additionally, the relationship between geriatric syndromes and comorbidity indices was assessed with regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 76.2â€‰Â±â€‰7.25Â years(67.8% female). The age and sex of multimorbid patients according to the CCI were not different compared to others. The multimorbid group had a higher rate of dementia and polypharmacy among geriatric syndromes. All four indices were associated with frailty and polypharmacy(pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). CCI and ECM scores were related to dementia, polypharmacy, and frailty. Moreover, CCI was also associated with separately slow walking speed and low muscle strength. On the other hand, unlike CCI, ECM was associated with malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: In the study comparing the four comorbidity indices, it is revealed that none of the indices is sufficient to use alone in geriatric practice. New indices should be developed considering the complexity of the geriatric cases and the limitations of the existing indices.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		16	Bmc Geriatrics		192	canaslan,kubra	Canaslan	Kubra	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
151	152	Frailty Is Associated With Impaired Diabetic Foot Ulcer Healing And All-Cause Re-Hospitalization.	2022.0	194	10.1007/s12603-022-1726-7	35166310.0		170	26	2	169	BACKGROUND: Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are a common and feared complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. People with DFUs often present a significant clinical complexity due to multimorbidity, frailty, polypharmacy, and disabling conditions. Frailty, defined using the accumulation of health deficits model, has shown to predict worsening health status, hospitalizations, and death in older persons. There are no clinical studies, to date, that have examined the prevalence and effect of frailty on DFUs outcomes. The aim of our study was to explore the impact of frailty on DFUs healing and re-hospitalization in a cohort of patients hospitalized with DFUs. DESIGN: prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The frailty status of 76 consecutive hospitalized patients with DFUs was assessed by using the Frailty Index (FI). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the non-healing of the DFU. Secondary outcome was re-hospitalization events (for any cause) within 6 months from hospital discharge. Frailty was defined as FI>0.25. RESULTS: Out of 76 patients (median age 65 years, range 31-84), 56 (74%) were frail. At six months, 81.5% of frail patients had non-healing of the DFU compared to 55% in non-frail patients (p=0.02). The rate of of re-hospitalization was also higher in frail compared to non-frail (90.3% vs 54%, respectively; p=0.01) patients. In multivariable analyses, frailty was significantly associated with a more than fivefold increased risk of DFU non-healing [odds ratio 5.54 (95% confidence interval 1.28-23.91), p=0.02]. Similarly, re-hospitalization was also significantly higher in frail patients compared to the non-frail ones. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with DFUs, frailty was highly prevalent. Frailty emerged as an independent risk factor for DFU non-healing and re-hospitalization events. Patients with DFUs require a comprehensive assessment of their frailty status which would enable personalization of their management and interventions.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		170	The Journal Of Nutrition, Health & Aging		194	maltese,g	Maltese	G	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
166	167	Magnetic Resonance-Guided Radiotherapy Feasibility In Elderly Cancer Patients: Proposal Of The Master Scoring System.	2021.0	215	10.1177/0300891620920709	32410505.0		215	107	1	26	BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are often excluded from advanced treatments owing to clinical complexity or frailty. Magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) represents a new frontier of radiotherapy delivery that can play an important role in the management of these patients. AIM: To assess MRgRT feasibility in elderly patients, describe their compliance with this treatment, and provide a scoring system for elderly patient selection. METHODS: Patients aged >75 years were enrolled. No restrictions on tumor site, staging, or treatment intent were applied. Patients underwent joint radiation oncology-geriatrics visits to assess the feasibility of MRgRT and to identify the most significant items (i.e. clinical variables) for the setup of a scoring system. The proposed scoring system was then internally validated on a prospectively enrolled cohort of elderly patients who were candidates for MRgRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between February and March 2018. Their mean age was 81.4 Â± 3.4 years (range 75-88). Radiotherapy intent was curative in 26 patients; 14 patients were considered frail at screening tests before radiotherapy. Twelve items were identified as clinically significant for the setup of the MASTER score (MRI-Guided Radiotherapy Selection Elderly Score) score. Validation of the score showed 100% reliability, with no patient discharged after selection. CONCLUSIONS: MRgRT appears to be feasible in elderly patients and the MASTER score is proposed to support clinical decision-making in recommending elderly patients for this technology.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		215	Tumori		215	boldrini,luca	Boldrini	Luca	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
169	170	Association Between Frailty Index, Lung Function, And Major Clinical Determinants In Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.	2021.0	219	10.1007/s40520-021-01878-z	34009526.0		201	33	8	2165	BACKGROUND: Airflow limitation alone is unable to capture the complexity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), better explained by comprehensive disease-specific indexes. Frailty is a clinical condition characterized by high vulnerability to internal and external stressors and represents a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. AIMS: Primary objective was to test the association between indexes of lung function and COPD severity with frailty index (FI), and secondary to evaluate the association between FI and comorbidities, cognitive and physical function, BODE index, and mortality. METHODS: 150 stable COPD outpatients were enrolled and followed up to 4Â years. At baseline, participants performed a geriatric multidimensional assessment, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, 6-min walking test, and bioimpedance analysis. BODE and FI were calculated. Spearman's Ï was used to assess correlations. Mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Participants were followed up for a median of 39Â months. Mean age was 73Â years and median frailty index 0.15 (IQR 0.11-0.19). FI was higher in frequent exacerbators (â‰¥â€‰2/year) (mean 0.18 vs 0.15, p 0.01) and dyspnoeic patients (mMRCâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2) (mean 0.21 vs 0.14, p <â€‰0.01) and correlated with lung volumes, expiratory flows, and pressure of arterial oxygen. FI was positively correlated with the number of comorbidities, depressive symptoms, cognitive decline, and BODE index. Mortality was higher in patients with BODE higher than 3 (HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.2-10.9), and not associated with FI. DISCUSSION: FI positively correlates with all clinical drivers orienting the choice of treatment in COPD. CONCLUSIONS: FI associates with lung function and COPD severity, but does not associate with mortality.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		201	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		219	scarlata,simone	Scarlata	Simone	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
97	98	Pre-Frailty And Frailty In Dialysis And Pre-Dialysis Patients: A Systematic Review Of Clinical And Biochemical Markers.	2021.0	131	10.3390/ijerph18189579	34574503.0		8	18	18	None	Patients under dialysis are known to be more vulnerable to frailty, a dynamic geriatric syndrome defined as a state of vulnerability to stressors, due to numerous metabolic changes. With rise of life expectancy globally, it is important to understand the complexity of the pathophysiology of frailty and identify possible markers that can help with the prognosis and diagnosis of frailty. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of the knowledge regarding clinical and biochemical markers associated with pre-frailty and frailty in dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. In November 2020, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched. Studies regarding biomarkers associated with (pre-)frailty in (pre-)dialysis patients were included. This systematic review identified clinical and biochemical markers in pre-frail and frail patients under dialysis or pre-dialysis published in the literature. This study shows that more investigation is necessary to identify markers that can differentiate these processes to be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in routine care and management of geriatric needs. Interventions that can improve health outcomes in pre-frail and frail older adults under dialysis or pre-dialysis are essential to improve not only the individual's quality of life but also to reduce the burden to the health systems.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		8	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		131	pereira,ana	Pereira	Ana	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
104	105	Prioritizing Movement To Address The Frailty Phenotype In Heart Failure.	2021.0	139	10.1016/j.pcad.2021.01.005	33556427.0		139	67		26	Frailty is a highly prevalent multisystem syndrome in older adults with heart failure (HF) and is associated with poor clinical prognosis and increased complexity of care. While frailty is neither disease nor age specific, it is a clinical manifestation of aging-related processes that reflects a reduced physiological ability to tolerate and recover from stress associated with aging, disease, or therapy. Within this context, physical frailty, which is distinctly oriented to physical functional domains (e.g., muscle weakness, slowness, and low activity), has been recognized as a critical vital sign in older persons with HF. Identification and routine assessment of physical frailty, using objective physical performance measures, may guide the course of patient-centered treatment plans that maximize the likelihood of improving clinical outcomes in older HF patients. Exercise-based rehabilitation is a primary therapy to improve cardiovascular health in patients with HF; however, the limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of exercise tailored to older and frail HF patients underscores the current gaps in management of their care. Interdisciplinary exercise interventions designed with consideration of physical frailty as a therapeutic target may be an important strategy to counteract functional deficits characteristic of frailty and HF, and to improve patient-centered outcomes in this population. The purpose of this current review is to provide a better understanding of physical frailty and its relation to management of care in older patients with HF. Implications of movement-based interventions, including exercise and physical rehabilitation, to prevent or reverse physical frailty and improve clinical outcomes will further be discussed.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		139	Progress In Cardiovascular Diseases		139	laddu,deepika.r	Laddu	Deepika R	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The optimal management of unruptured aneurysms in elderly patients remains controversial. Variability in life expectancy, comorbidities and rupture risk coupled with heterogenous endovascular and surgical treatments contribute to a paucity of clear guidelines, and current management is highly individualized. Elderly patients present unique considerations including frailty, cognitive dysfunction, vasculopathy, reduced life expectancy and overall worse prognosis in case of rupture which shape the risks and likelihood of success of endovascular and microsurgical treatment. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in the elderly, with a particular focus on the natural history, key challenges associated with advanced age, management and future innovations to further refine treatment.Key MessagesThe management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in elderly patients remains controversial.Key challenges including frailty, cognitive dysfunction, reduced life expectancy, vasculopathy and poor prognosis with aneurysm rupture add complexity to endovascular and surgical decision making not encountered with younger demographics.A thorough understanding of available treatment options, likelihood of treatment success and associated risks weighed against the risk of aneurysm rupture informs patient discussion and management.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		140	Annals Of Medicine		140	caffes,nicholas	Caffes	Nicholas	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
109	110	Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment In Older Adults With Cancer: Recommendations By The Italian Society Of Geriatrics And Gerontology (Sigg).	2021.0	144	10.1111/eci.13347	32648990.0		144	51	1	e13347	INTRODUCTION: Optimizing the approach to older adults with cancer is now a priority given the increasing frequency of new cancer diagnoses that are made in the older population. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the gold-standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of frail older persons, and (3) designing person-tailored interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach to older patients with cancer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A widespread use of this standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		144	European Journal Of Clinical Investigation		144	fusco,domenico	Fusco	Domenico	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
114	115	A Narrative Review Of Frailty Assessment In Older Patients At The Emergency Department.	2021.0	149	10.1097/MEJ.0000000000000811	33883392.0		149	28	4	266	Optimizing emergency care for the aging population is an important future challenge, as the proportion of older patients at the emergency department (ED) rapidly increases. Older patients, particularly those who are frail, have a high risk of adverse outcomes after an ED visit, such as functional decline, institutionalization, and death. The ED can have a key position in identifying frail older patients who benefit most from comprehensive geriatric care [including delirium preventive measures, early evaluation of after-discharge care, and a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)]. However, performing extensive frailty assessment is not suitable at the ED. Therefore, quick and easy-to-use instruments are needed to identify older patients at risk for adverse outcomes. This narrative review outlines the importance and complexity of frailty assessment at the ED. It aligns the available screening instruments, including clinical judgment as frailty assessment, and summarizes arguments for and against frailty assessment at the ED.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		149	European Journal Of Emergency Medicine: Official Journal Of The European Society For Emergency Medicine		149	van dam,carmen.s	van Dam	Carmen S	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
115	116	Biological Aspects Of Aging That Influence Response To Anticancer Treatments.	2021.0	151	10.1097/SPC.0000000000000536	33399393.0		85	15	1	29	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer is a disease of older adults, where fitness and frailty are a continuum. This aspect poses unique challenges to the management of cancer in this population. In this article, we review the biological aspects influencing the efficacy and safety of systemic anticancer treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: The organ function decline associated with the ageing process affects multiple systems, including liver, kidney, bone marrow, heart, muscles and central nervous system. These can have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of systemic anticancer agents. Comorbidities also represent a key aspect to consider in decision-making. Renal disease, liver conditions and cardiovascular risk factors are prevalent in this age group and may impact the risk of adverse outcomes in this setting. SUMMARY: The systematic integration of geriatrics principles in the routine management of older adults with cancer is a unique opportunity to address the complexity of this population and is standard of care based on a wide range of benefits. This approach should be multidisciplinary and involve careful discussion with hospital pharmacists.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		85	Current Opinion In Supportive And Palliative Care		151	crimmin,jane	Crimmin	Jane	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
125	126	Describing The Relationship Between Atrial Fibrillation And Frailty: Clinical Implications And Open Research Questions.	2021.0	161	10.1016/j.exger.2021.111455	34153440.0		21	152		111455	In the recent years a lot of attention has been gathered by the issue of frailty outside the boundaries of the geriatric medicine, for example in the field of cardiovascular medicine. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is known as a very common cardiological condition, often burdened by high level of clinical complexity. Aim of this narrative review is to examine the most relevant evidence about the relationship between frailty and AF, focusing also on its impact on clinical management and natural history of patients with this condition. Data reported underline how a relevant relationship exists between these two conditions, even though the burden of frailty among AF cohorts is still unclear. Frailty seems to affect the clinical management, even though no definitive data are yet available. Lastly, frailty significantly increases the risk of all-cause mortality but it's still unclear the impact on thromboembolic and bleeding events. Despite several data are already available, more research is still needed to fully elucidate the relationship between these two clinical entities.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		21	Experimental Gerontology		161	proietti,marco	Proietti	Marco	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
127	128	Ongoing Research Protocols For The Pharmacological Treatment Of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms In Dementia.	2021.0	127	10.14283/jfa.2020.36	33331618.0		5	10	1	22	The implementation of effective interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) is perceived as one of the most pressing research priorities in the field of dementia and one of the main unmet needs from the perspective of affected individuals and their caregivers and relatives. Nevertheless, to date, only a relatively marginal part of dementia research has focused on NPS. This study aimed to describe and discuss the state of the art concerning the identification and development of new pharmacological treatments for NPS in dementia. A review of 320 ongoing phase 1, 2, 3, and 4 protocols registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database was performed. All the trials enrolling patients with dementia were selected. Only studies adopting clinical measures of NPS frequency and/or severity as primary outcome were retained and analyzed. Overall, only a minority of ongoing phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 protocols on dementia (i.e., 9.0%) is primarily targeting NPS. Most of these studies are adopting a placebo-controlled parallel assignment design, testing oral compounds, and targeting specific NPS (mostly agitation and/or aggression). A total of 3,445 subjects with dementia will tentatively be recruited in these trials. The methodologies adopted in these studies, the characteristics of the tested interventions, the eligibility criteria, and the operational definitions of NPS are presented and discussed. The relevance of NPS is not yet matched by an adequate research effort. The current tendency at privileging disease-modifying approaches and other symptoms of dementia and the methodological complexity of studying NPS are still substantially contributing to the gap between research activities and clinical needs.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		5	The Journal Of Frailty & Aging		127	canevelli,m	Canevelli	M	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
128	129	Aspirin And Statin Therapy For Primary Prevention Of Cardiovascular Disease In Older Adults.	2022.0	164	10.1136/heartjnl-2021-320154	34764212.0		164	108	14	1090	The value of primary preventative therapies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults (age â‰¥75 years) is less certain than in younger patients. There is a lack of quality evidence in older adults due to underenrolment in pivotal trials. While aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in primary prevention of CVD in older adults, statins may be efficacious. However, it is unclear which patient subgroups may benefit most, and guidelines differ between expert panels. Three relevant geriatric conditions (cognitive impairment, functional impairment and polypharmacy) may influence therapeutic decision making; for example, baseline frailty may affect statin efficacy, and some have advocated for deprescription in this scenario. Evidence regarding statins and incident functional decline are mixed, and vigilance for adverse effects is important, especially in the setting of polypharmacy. However, aspirin has not been shown to affect incident cognitive or functional decline, and its lack of efficacy extends to patients with baseline cognitive impairment or frailty. Ultimately, the utility of primary preventative therapies for CVD in older adults depends on potential lifetime benefit. Rather than basing treatment decisions on absolute risk alone, consideration of comorbidities, polypharmacy and life expectancy should play a significant role in decision making. Coronary calcium score and new tools for risk stratification validated in older adults that account for the competing risk of death may aid in evaluating potential benefits. Given the complexity of therapeutic decisions in this context, shared decision making provides an important framework.		2023-01-03 03:44:56	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		164	Heart (British Cardiac Society)		164	montgomery,sophie	Montgomery	Sophie	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of gallbladder empyema. A 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer presented with hypoactive delirium. With no localising features, normal liver function tests but persistently raised inflammatory markers, he was initially managed as a urinary tract infection. Chest wall discomfort and swelling over the right costal margin later developed. Abdominal imaging demonstrated a massive gallbladder empyema invaginating through the lower right rib cage, causing the superficial swelling. Pre-morbid status prevented cholecystectomy and he was managed conservatively with percutaneous cholecystostomy and antibiotics. He was discharged to 24-h care 2Â weeks after diagnosis with a long-term drain.		2023-01-03 03:44:57	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-alljour-2022.10.03.txt		178	Age And Ageing		382	hosty,jennifer	Hosty	Jennifer	1.0	0.0	0.0	1.0
