        <ab>We describe the findings of a qualitative longitudinal interview study of a group of initially community-dwelling frail older people, and their informal and formal carers. We used a narrative approach to explore the role that narrative may have for people living with frailty. This has been less explored comparative to the experiences of those living with chronic illness. The frail older people told stories of their experiences that revealed three distinct shapes or typologies. These were either stable, unbalancing or overwhelmed, and related to how the person managed to adapt to increasing challenges and losses, and to reintegrate their sense of self into a cohesive narrative. Each is illustrated by an individual case story. Frailty is described as both biographically anticipated yet potentially biographically disruptive as older people may struggle to make sense of their circumstances without a clear single causative factor. Findings are discussed in relation to biographical disruption and reconstruction in chronic illness and the rhetoric around 'successful ageing'. We conclude by drawing attention to the complex individual and social factors that contribute to the experience of living with frailty in later life.</ab>

        <ab>An introduction to the journal is presented that focuses on diabetes management, including key considerations involved in setting glycemic goals and making decisions on diabetes treatment approaches for older adults during hospitalizations, the complex interplay between the needs of older adults with diabetes living in nursing homes and barriers to their care posed by the realities of life in a long-term care facility, and palliative and end-of-life care for older people with diabetes.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults who experience challenges related to mental health are unlikely to seek professional help. The voices of older adults who have navigated through mental health issues and systems of care to arrive at psychological treatment are less well understood. We conducted individual interviews with 15 adults aged 61 to 86 who sought psychological treatment. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using narrative methods. We identified several main storylines that describe the meaning-making and treatment-seeking journeys of older adults: resistance to being labeled with mental health problems (telling stories of resistance, defining mental health issues in mysterious and uncontrollable terms, and experiencing internal role conflict); muddling through the help-seeking process (manifestations of chaos and system-level barriers); and emotional reactions to psychological treatment (hope, fear, and mistrust). Findings add to the literature base in the area of narrative gerontology, and highlight the complex experiences that older adults face when seeking psychological treatment.</ab>

        <ab>• Frailty is closely associated with falls, and both with disability and death. • A proprioception training during one year in community older adults was carried out. • The mean number of falls in the frail and pre-frail individuals decreased. • The fear of falls and anthropometric parameters improved. • The participants improved their frail phenotype, decreasing frailty. Frailty and falls are closely associated with each other as well as with disability, hospitalization, and death. Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In order to optimize interventions and services in the community, it is important to identify the profile of persons who are able to stay at home and of those who are being admitted into residential care. Understanding their needs and their use of resources is essential. The main objective of the study is to identify persons who are likely to enter residential care based upon their needs and resource utilization, so that care providers can plan interventions effectively and optimize services and resources to meet the persons' needs.Methods: This is a longitudinal quasi-experimental study. The data consists of primary data from the community setting collected every six months during the period of 2010-2016. Interventions had the goal of keeping older people longer at home. Participants were at least 65 years old and were living in the community. The interRAI Resource Utilization Group system (RUG-III) was used to calculate the case-mix indexes (CMI) of all participants. Comparisons were made between the case-mix of those who were still living at home and those who were admitted into residential care at follow-up.Results: A total of 10,289 older persons participated in the study (81.2 ± 7.1 yrs., 69.1% female). From this population, 853 participants (8.3%) were admitted into residential care. The CMI of the persons receiving night care at home were the highest (1.6 at baseline and 1.7 at the entry point of residential care), followed by persons receiving occupational therapy (1.5 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care) and persons enrolled in case management interventions with rehabilitation (1.4 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care). The CMIs at follow-up were significantly higher than at baseline and the linear regression model showed that admission to residential care was a significant factor in the model.Conclusions: The study showed that the RUG-III system offers possibilities for identifying persons at risk of institutionalization. Interventions designed to avoid early nursing home admission can make use of the RUG-III system to optimize care planning and the allocation of services and resources. Based on the RUG-III case-mix, resources can be allocated to keep older persons at home longer, bearing in mind the complexity of care and the availability of services in the community.</ab>

        <ab>MPI_AGE is a European Union co-funded research project aimed to use the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), a validated Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)-based prognostic tool, to develop predictive rules that guide clinical and management decisions in older people in different European countries. A series of international studies performed in different settings have shown that the MPI is useful to predict mortality and risk of hospitalization in community-dwelling older subjects at population level. Furthermore, studies performed in older people who underwent a CGA before admission to a nursing home or receiving homecare services showed that the MPI successfully identified groups of persons who could benefit, in terms of reduced mortality, of specific therapies such as statins in diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation and antidementia drugs in cognitive decline. A prospective trial carried out in nine hospitals in Europe and Australia demonstrated that the MPI was able to predict not only in-hospital and long-term mortality, but also institutionalization, re-hospitalization and receiving homecare services during the one-year follow-up after hospital discharge. The project also explored the association between MPI and mortality in hospitalized older patients in need of complex procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve implantation or enteral tube feeding. Evidence from these studies has prompted the MPI_AGE Investigators to formulate recommendations for healthcare providers, policy makers and the general population which may help to improve the cost-effectiveness of appropriate health care interventions for older patients.</ab>

        <ab>Type 2 diabetes and its associated comorbidities are growing more prevalent, and the complexity of optimising glycaemic control is increasing, especially on the frontlines of patient care. In many countries, most patients with type 2 diabetes are managed in a primary care setting. However, primary healthcare professionals face the challenge of the growing plethora of available treatment options for managing hyperglycaemia, leading to difficultly in making treatment decisions and contributing to therapeutic inertia. This position statement offers a simple and patient-centred clinical decision-making model with practical treatment recommendations that can be widely implemented by primary care clinicians worldwide through shared-decision conversations with their patients. It highlights the importance of managing cardiovascular disease and elevated cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes and aims to provide innovative risk stratification and treatment strategies that connect patients with the most effective care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frailty in elderly patients is associated with an increased risk of poor health outcomes, including falls, delirium, malnutrition, hospitalisation, and mortality. Because polypharmacy is recognised as a possible major contributor to the pathogenesis of geriatric frailty, reducing inappropriate medication exposure is supposed to be a promising approach to improve health-related quality of life and prevent adverse outcomes. A major challenge for the process of deprescribing of inappropriate polypharmacy is to improve the communication between general practitioner (GPs), patient and family carer. This study investigates the effects of a complex intervention in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy living at home.Methods: This is a cluster randomised controlled trial including 136 GPs and 676 patients. Patients with a positive clinical screening for frailty are eligible if they are aged 70 years or older, receiving family or professional nursing care at home, and taking in five or more drugs per day. Exclusion criteria are higher grade of dementia and life expectancy of 6 months or less. The GPs of the intervention group receive an educational training promoting a deprescribing guideline and providing information on how to conduct a family conference focussing on prioritisation of treatment goals concerning drug therapy. During the 1-year intervention, GPs are expected to perform a total of three family conferences, each including a structured medication review with patients and their family carers. GPs of the control group will receive no training and will deliver care as usual. Geriatric assessment of all patients will be performed by study nurses during home visits at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is the hospitalisation rate during the observation period of 12 months. Secondary outcomes are number and appropriateness of medications, mobility, weakness, cognition, depressive disorder, health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, weight, and costs of health care use.Discussion: This study will provide evidence for a pragmatic co-operative and patient-centred educational intervention using family conferences to improve patient safety in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy.Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00015055 (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform [ICTRP]).

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze factors related to patient safety incidents by analyzing '2018 patient safety report data' for Korea, and to prepare a plan for preventing patient safety incidents. Methods: Analysis was done for 2018 patient safety report data published in 2019. In 2018, 9,250 patient safety incidents were reported, and for this study data (3,757) from hospitals with more than 500 beds were analyzed. SPSS 25.0 was used for the crosstabulation analysis and multinominal logistic regression. Results: There were no factors affecting the sentinel event. The main factors of adverse events were age, patient room, treatment room, day duty of nurses, falls, transfusions, and medication. Conclusion: In order to prevent patient safety incidents, elderly patients should receive verbal and nonverbal communication that will help them understand the complexity of the disease. Finding ways to reduce nurse overtime and reduce human error by computerizing patient monitoring systems, fall prevention activities, and patient safety regulations and procedures are necessary.</ab>

        <ab>Researchers propose that the convoy of care model should be used to study care networks of frail, older individuals. Care convoys are defined as the evolving collection of individuals who may or may not have close personal connections to the recipient or to one another, but who provide care, including help with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), socio-emotional care, skilled health care, monitoring, and advocacy. This study reports on community-dwelling older adults' experiences of their care convoy, how care convoys change over time, and perceived (positive) outcomes. A qualitative analysis among 65 semi-structured interviews with frail, community-dwelling older adults demonstrates a great variety in the composition of care convoys. Participants were often actively involved in their care convoy and valued the social/relational aspect of care. Care and support covered a wide range of activities, with some activities being provided by specific types of caregivers. Participants expressed the adequacy of their care convoy in terms of satisfaction and sufficiency. Noteworthy, participants who were satisfied with their care convoy did not necessarily receive sufficient help. Policies and practice should recognize the relational aspect of care, the complex interplay between all actors, and the dynamic character of care convoys.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Of people admitted to the acute surgical unit (ASU) only 23% of them are aged over 70. However the number of bed days they occupy are disproportionate to this; comprising 48% of the total bed days. The average number of bed days rises exponentially with age, with those aged under 70 averaging less than two days; those aged 80 averaging approximately 4.5 bed days and those aged over 90 approximately 7 bed days. This disparity was recognised and a Medicine for Older People (MOP) liaison team comprising consultant geriatrician and Advanced Clinical Practitioner in Frailty starting working with the acute surgical team in November 2018, initially providing support two days a week, increasing to 5 days in March 2019. Methods: The MOP liaison team meets with the acute surgical team each morning identifying and discussing relevant patients; those identified as living with frailty with associated complexity and uncertainty. This group of patients is then reviewed by the MOP liaison team utilising the principles of the comprehensive geriatric assessment to formulate a person-centred plan. Plans are discussed and coordinated with the surgical, nursing and therapy teams utilising a multi-disciplinary/ multi-professional approach. Results: Length of stay is the main outcome measure and readmissions are monitored. Data on admission length and readmissions was analysed from April 2018 and has continued following commencement of the liaison service. Primary results-Length of stay has reduced from 4.4 to 3.3 days on average for all over 70-year-olds admitted to the ASU team. Whilst admission rates have dropped across all age ranges the biggest reduction in readmissions is among the over 80-year-olds with an almost 50% reduction as opposed to a 33% reduction in the under 70 age group Conclusions: Proactively managing the admissions and discharges of patients with frailty allows them to receive the right care at the right time in their period of crisis and shortens their admissions by approximately 25%.</ab>

        <ab>workforce deficits, requiring a modernised service model for frail older people that moved from individual provider focus to system-wide perspective, with emphasis on proactive care. Methods: Electronic Frailty Index (eFI) in primary care system identified 3,200 out of 300,000 Hull residentsHull with severe frailty. Recruited 9 GPs with extended role in older people’s care and Advanced Nurse Practitioners to support 4 Community Geriatricians. Redesigned roles for pharmacy, social services and non-clinical care coordinator teams. New therapy roles created, multiple third sector organisations involved, including carer support, and purpose-built location with older people in mind. Interventions: Structured and anticipatory comprehensive geriatric assessment of all 3200 residents (either at home or in care homes) by the multidisciplinary multiagency team. Pre-assessment home visit by support worker to complete patient concern’s questionnaire. Dedicated patient transport and one-stop multi-disciplinary team assessment in one building. Proactive discussion of RESPECT and advance care planning, electronic personalised care plan delivered with system-wide record sharing across providers, Same day basic diagnostics available. Complex care coordinators ongoing support in community. Multidisciplinary outreach to care homes and truly housebound. Results: • 99.7% patients and carers extremely likely/likely to recommend the service • 21,000 interventions for 2,500 patients seen since June 2018 • Majority of patients moderately frail by Clinical Frailty Score • Average saving on drug costs - £110.17 /patient/year • 15% reduction in ED attendances, 29% reduction in emergency admissions • Patients’ survey: adequate time and opportunity to discuss health problems/concerns, felt informed and empowered during consultation and in future planning • Very high levels of staff satisfaction Conclusions and future: • Innovative high quality, cost-effective new model of care delivering improved patient care and experience with emphasis on proactive care and future planning • High levels of patient and staff satisfaction • Future expansion with disease specific teams including COPD, parkinsonism and diabetes and targeting moderately frail by eFI. • Redesign of community services with improved integration across teams and providers can be a blue-print for other services.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: There are over 400,000 people over 65 in UK care homes, three times the number than that in acute hospitals. They are amongst the frailest in our community, with average life expectancy of 15 months once in the home. Their needs are often complex and challenging, which when unmet, often result in unwanted and unnecessary hospital admissions. Imperial College Healthcare Trust (ICHT), along with funding from Health Education England (HEE), have introduced a care home liaison nurse. The aim is to bridge the boundaries, making a significant difference to cross organisation communication and support. Methods: The care home liaison nurse manages a frailty liaison service with the largest local nursing care home. This home has 140 residents with complex needs. The care home liaison nurse provides a point of contact for advice, guidance and support for individual patient pathways, she provides face to face assessment and treatment or verbal advice. In addition, the nurse supports discharge from the acute setting. This direct contact allows rapid access to specialist advice, and aims to build confidence both within the care home team and within the acute team, that the patients’ needs can be met in their own surroundings. Results: The preliminary data demonstrates a positive impact this role is having both to the acute trust and most importantly patient’s experience. Comparing ICHT data from April-May 2018 to April-May 2019 it showing that the number of avoidable admissions has decreased from 54.3% to 37.5%, length of stay when patients are admitted has decreased from 11.7 days to 6.5 days, and the number of patients with an advanced care plan has risen 14.9%. Feedback from nursing staff at the care centre as well as that from patients and families has been overwhelmingly positive. Conclusions: The role is still in the pilot phase. Given the already positive impact it is hoped that it will continue and expand into other care homes and extra sheltered accommodations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Acutely ill and frail older adults have complex social and health care needs. It is important to understand how this complexity affects acute outcomes for admission to hospital. We validated a frailty index using routine admission laboratory tests with outcomes after patients were admitted to hospital.Methods: In a prospective cohort of older adults admitted to a large tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom, we created a frailty index from routine admission laboratory investigations (FI-Laboratory) linked to data comprising hospital outcomes. We evaluated the association between the FI-Laboratory and total days spent in hospital, discharge to a higher level of care, readmission and mortality.Results: Of 2552 admissions among 1750 older adults, we were able to generate FI-Laboratory values for 2254 admissions (88.3% of the cohort). More than half of admitted patients were women (55.3%) and the mean age was 84.6 (SD 14.0) years. We found that the FI-Laboratory correlated weakly with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS; r2 = 0.09). An increase in the CFS and the equivalent of 3 additional abnormal laboratory test results in the FI-Laboratory, respectively, were associated with an increased proportion of inpatient days (rate ratios [RRs] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.52; and 1.47, 95% CI 1.41-1.54), discharge to a higher level of care (odd ratios [ORs] 1.39, 95% CI 1.27-1.52; and 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.47) and increased readmission rate (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.37; and 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.26). Increases in the CFS and FI-Laboratory were associated with increased mortality HRs of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28-1.51) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.37-1.54), respectively.Interpretation: We determined that FI-Laboratory, distinct from baseline frailty, could be used to predict risk of many adverse outcomes. The score is therefore a useful way to quantify the degree of acute illness in frail older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The Office of the Cook County (Illinois) Public Guardian provides guardianship services for some 700 individuals with cognitive disabilities, and manages more than $100 million in estate assets. About 40 percent of the people under its guardianship were financially abused. To address the problem, the office initiated an innovative and highly successful financial exploitation civil recovery program, staffed by three senior attorneys, which has litigated dozens of complex cases and recovered more than $50 million over the past ten years.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Person-centred care (PCC) focusing on personalised goals and care plans derived from "What matters to you?" has an impact on single disease outcomes, but studies on multi-morbid elderly are lacking. Furthermore, the combination of PCC, Integrated Care (IC) and Pro-active care are widely recognised as desirable for multi-morbid elderly, yet previous studies focus on single components only, leaving synergies unexplored. The effect of a synergistic intervention, which implements 1) Person-centred goal-oriented care driven by "What matters to you?" with 2) IC and 3) pro-active care is unknown.Methods: Inspired by theoretical foundations, complexity science, previous health service research and a patient-driven evaluation of care quality, we designed the Patient-Centred Team (PACT) intervention across primary and secondary care. The PACT team collaborate with the patient to make and deliver a person-centred, integrated and proactive multi-morbidity care-plan. The control group receives conventional care. The study design is a pragmatic six months prospective, controlled clinical trial based on hospital electronic health record data of 439 multi-morbid frail elderly at risk for emergency (re) admissions referred to PACT and 779 propensity score matched controls in Norway, 2014-2016. Outcomes are emergency admissions, the sum of emergency inpatient bed days, 30-day readmissions, planned and emergency outpatient visits and mortality at three and six months follow-up.Results: The Rate Ratios (RR) for emergency admissions was 0,9 (95%CI: 0,82-0,99), for sum of emergency bed days 0,68 (95%CI:0,52-0,79) and for 30-days emergency readmissions 0,72 (95%CI: 0,41-1,24). RRs were 2,3 (95%CI: 2,02-2,55) and 0,9 (95%CI: 0,68-1,20) for planned and emergency outpatient visits respectively. The RR for death at 3 months was 0,39 (95% CI: 0,22-0,70) and 0,57 (95% CI: 0,34-0,94) at 6 months.Conclusion: Compared with propensity score matched controls, the care process of frail multi-morbid elderly who received the PACT intervention had a reduced risk of high-level emergency care, increased use of low-level planned care, and substantially reduced mortality risk. Further study of process differences between groups is warranted to understand the genesis of these results better.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02541474 ), registered Sept 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background Community Health Organisation Area 1 has the highest age dependency in Ireland (37.5 vs 34.5) and the highest proportion of its population engaged in unpaid care (4.7%)1. Social prescribing is a novel tool used by the Integrated Care Team for the Older Person in Sligo to address social determinants of health such as social isolation and to minimise the impact of carer burden. The study aim is to quantify social needs and carer burden in this acutely frail group and describe interventions to address this. Methods A descriptive study compiled from Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment of patient care profile and social prescribing from June to December 2018. Results 50% of patients studied did not have a supportive, able person living with them. 1 in 4 had no local support while 1 in 5 were supported only by neighbours or friends. 53% were not receipt of home help while 24% paid for private care or cleaning services. Carer burden was reported in half of cases with a 2.2 times increased risk with a patient co-morbidity of cognitive decline and a 1.8 times increased risk with a complex medical needs patient. Intervention increased community service usage such as the public health nurse from 70% to 86% and home help applications by 26%. Social prescribing increased day centre use from 18% to 46% and Meals on Wheels usage by 50%. Dementia specific social prescribing was made in 26% of those with cognitive difficulties. 33% received information for carers while 11% were informed of respite options. Conclusion In this acutely decompensated and vulnerable group social isolation and carer burden are a significant issue. Our study indicates the potential for the use of a social prescribing model to address this at an earlier point in frailty development at a primary care level.</ab>

        <ab>Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant.Methods: The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant.Discussion: The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03883425 , registered on March 20, 2019.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: To assess the prevalence of overactive bladder (OAB) among medically complex vulnerable elderly (MCVE) patients in the United States and to compare health status measures, functional status, healthcare events, use of healthcare services and costs between MCVE patients with and without OAB.Methods: Using the 2001-2010 Medicare Current Beneficiary Surveys, we defined the MCVE as those respondents who were ≥65 years old with scores ≥3 on the Vulnerable Elders Survey-13. OAB diagnosis codes or self-reported use of antimuscarinic medications were used to identify MCVE individuals with OAB. Multiple regression analyses were used to estimate the adjusted relationship between OAB and the outcome measures.Results: The annual prevalence of OAB among the MCVE increased from 9.6% in 2001 to 13.5% in 2010. MCVE individuals with OAB were more likely to have experienced falls or fractures (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.0), urinary tract infections (OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 3.5-5.4), institutionalization (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.5), limitations in activity of daily living (ADL) (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7) and instrumental ADL (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2-2.0), hospital admission (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.0) and emergency department admissions (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.0) than those without OAB. MCVE individuals with OAB incurred, on average, $7188 (2013 dollars) more in healthcare costs than those without OAB.Discussion/conclusions: The prevalence of OAB in the MCVE population increased over time. OAB is associated with substantial clinical and economic burden. Further research is warranted to understand whether better management of the MCVE population with OAB may reduce healthcare resource use.</ab>

        <ab>This case describes a 103-year-old lady who presented from home with an incidental diagnosis of a left femoral fracture. She had no history of trauma and denied pain. She had a known diagnosis of osteoporosis, and sustained a fracture of the contralateral femur aged 93 which was managed conservatively. She was bed-bound with fixed contractures, poor oral intake and was non-compliant with prescribed calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Clinical biochemical measurements showed severe vitamin D deficiency and mild hypocalcaemia. Secondary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of an inappropriately normal phosphate suggested concurrent renal bone disease. Biomarkers of bone turnover were also consistent with bone remodelling. The history of prior fragility fractures, severe vitamin D deficiency and immobility supports a diagnosis of osteoporotic fracture, however other causes of spontaneous fracture were also considered. This case highlights the complexity of interpreting clinical biochemistry results in the setting of multi-morbidity and addresses the challenges of bone health management in the frail older person.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The objective of this study was to estimate the cross-sectional association of frailty status with overall and domain-specific quality of life (QoL) in rural community-dwelling older adults in Kegalle district of Sri Lanka.Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 746 community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 60 years living in the rural areas of Kegalle district of Sri Lanka in 2016. A three-stage probability sampling design was used to recruit participants. Frailty and QoL were assessed using the Fried phenotype and Older People's Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the association of frailty with QoL after accounting for the complex sampling design.Results: The median (IQR) age of the sample was 68 (64:75) years and comprised of 56.7% women. 15.2% (95% CI 12.4%, 18.7%) were frail and 48.5% (95% CI 43.9%, 53.2%) were pre-frail. The unadjusted means (SE) of the total QoL score for the robust, pre-frail and frail groups were 139.2 (0.64), 131.8 (1.04) and 119.2 (1.35), respectively. After adjusting for covariates in the final multivariable model, the estimated differences in mean QoL were lower for both frail and pre-frail groups versus robust. The estimated reduction in the total QoL score was 7.3% for those frail and 2.1% for those pre-frail. All QoL domains apart from 'social relationships and participation', 'home and neighbourhood' and 'financial circumstances' were associated with frailty.Conclusions: Frailty was associated with a small but significant lower quality of life in this rural Sri Lankan population, which appears largely explained by 'health' and 'independence, control over life and freedom' QoL domains. Interventions aiming to improve quality of life in frail older adults should consider targeting these aspects.</ab>

        <ab>This cross-sectional study uses data from the US National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations to assess the association between accountable care organization–reported care management and coordination activities and outcomes in older adults with complex needs. Key Points: Question: What is the association between care management and outcomes among patients with complex needs in Medicare accountable care organizations? Findings: In this cross-sectional analysis of 1 402 582 US Medicare beneficiaries who had frailty or multiple chronic conditions, beneficiaries attributed to accountable care organizations in the top vs bottom tertile of reported care management and coordination activities did not have statistically different quality, utilization, spending, or health care system interaction measures. Meaning: Accountable care organization–reported care management and coordination activities were not associated with improved outcomes among patients with complex needs. Importance: People with complex needs account for a disproportionate amount of Medicare spending, partially because of fragmented care delivered across multiple practitioners and settings. Accountable care organization (ACO) contracts give practitioners incentives to improve care coordination to the extent that coordination initiatives reduce total spending or improve quality. Objective: To assess the association between ACO-reported care management and coordination activities and quality, utilization, spending, and health care system interactions in older adults with complex needs. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, survey information on care management and coordination processes from 244 Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs in the 2017-2018 National Survey of ACOs (of 351 Medicare ACO respondents; response rate, 69%) conducted from July 20, 2017, to February 15, 2018, was linked to 2016 Medicare administrative claims data. Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who were defined as having complex needs because of frailty or 2 or more chronic conditions associated with high costs and clinical need were included. Exposures: Beneficiary attribution to ACO reporting comprehensive (top tertile) care management and coordination activities. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause prevention quality indicator admissions, 30-day all-cause readmissions, acute care and critical access hospital admissions, evaluation and management visits in ambulatory settings, inpatient days, emergency department visits, total spending, post–acute care spending, health care contact days, and continuity of care (from Medicare claims). Results: Among 1 402 582 Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions, the mean (SD) age was 78 (8.0) years and 55.1% were female. Compared with beneficiaries assigned to ACOs in the bottom tertile of care management and coordination activities, those assigned to ACOs in the top tertile had identical median prevention quality indicator admissions and 30-day all-cause readmissions (0 per beneficiary across all tertiles), hospitalization and emergency department visits (1.0 per beneficiary in bottom and top tertiles), evaluation and management visits in ambulatory settings (14.0 per beneficiary [interquartile range (IQR), 8.0-21.0] in both tertiles), longer median inpatient days (11.0 [IQR, 4.0-33.0] vs 10.0 [IQR, 4.0-32.0]), higher median annual spending ($14 350 [IQR, $4876-$36 119] vs $14 229 [IQR, $4805-$36 268]), lower median health care contact days (28.0 [IQR, 17.0-44.0] vs 29.0 [IQR, 18.0-45.0]), and lower continuity-of-care index (0.12 [IQR, 0.08-0.20] vs 0.13 [IQR, 0.08-0.21]). Accounting for within-patient correlation, quality, utilization, and spending outcomes among patients with complex needs attributed to ACOs were not statistically different comparing the top vs bottom tertile of care management and coordination activities. Conclusions and Relevance: The ACO self-reports of care management and coordination capacity were not associated with differences in spending or measured outcomes for patients with complex needs. Future efforts to care for patients with complex needs should assess whether strategies found to be effective in other settings are being used, and if so, why they fail to meet expectations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Optimizing the organization of care for community-dwelling frail older people is an important issue in many Western countries. In Belgium, a series of complex, innovative, bottom-up interventions was recently designed and implemented to help frail older people live at home longer. As the effectiveness of these interventions may vary between different population groups according to their long-term care needs, they must be evaluated by comparison with a control group that has similar needs.Methods: The goal was to identify target groups for these interventions and to establish control groups with similar needs and to explore, per group, the extent to which the utilization of long-term care is matched to needs. We merged two databases: a clinical prospective database and the routine administrative database for healthcare reimbursements. Through Principal Component Analysis followed by Clustering, the intervention group was first stratified into disability profiles. Per profile, comparable control groups for clinical variables were established, based on propensity scores. Using chi-squared tests and logistic regression analysis, long-term care utilization at baseline was then compared per profile and group studied.Results: Stratification highlighted five disability profiles: people with low-level limitations; people with limitations in instrumental activities of daily life and low-level of cognitive impairment; people with functional limitations; people with functional and cognitive impairments; and people with functional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These profiles made it possible to identify long-term care needs. For instance, at baseline, those who needed more assistance with hygiene tasks also received more personal nursing care (P &lt; 0.05). However, there were some important discrepancies between the need for long-term care and its utilization: while 21% of patients who were totally dependent for hygiene tasks received no personal nursing care, personal nursing care was received by 33% of patients who could perform hygiene tasks.Conclusions: The disability profiles provide information on long-term care needs but not on the extent to which those needs are met. To assess the effectiveness of interventions, controls at baseline should have similar disability profiles and comparable long-term care utilization. To allow for large comparative effectiveness studies, these dimensions should ideally be available in routine databases.</ab>

        <ab>Most older people experiencing chronic health problems, physical disabilities, and memory losses are still able to age in place in their own homes. However, they often need help from others to enjoy healthy, active, and independent lives. They turn mostly to family members, mainly women and usually their daughters, daughters-in-law or wives. But caring for frail elders has become more demanding and complex, and these family members often feel physically and emotionally overwhelmed and burnt out. They concede that they cannot do it alone. Others find it more difficult to hold full-or even part-time jobs. Hiring home (direct) care workers to assist their loved ones can be an effective solution to ease their caregiving responsibilities. However, these personal care aides, home health aides, and nursing assistants are already in short supply. Moreover, going forward the aging of the baby boomer population will result in an even greater demand for their services even as these jobs are often unattractive to American-born workers and turnover is high. This country's immigration policies will make it even more difficult for women caring for older persons to hire these workers. Over 25 percent of home care workers are low-skilled immigrants or foreign-born. However, the Trump administration's policies reduce the number of immigrants entering the U.S. and specifically choke off the various pathways that enable low-skilled persons to be hirable in the home care sector. Female caregivers seeking relief from their caregiving responsibilities will lose out unless we remove these immigration barriers.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to describe how EL was eased, as narrated by frail older people. Background: Existential loneliness (EL) is an unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older people, the experience of EL can be reduced. Design: In this qualitative study, we used an exploratory and descriptive design. Methods: The study was based on 22 narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were receiving long‐term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis. Results: Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the rear‐view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract themselves. Conclusion: Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person‐centred care and create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherness. Implications for practice: If frail older people's ongoing processes of adjusting and accepting their situation are understood and confirmed by people in their environment, for example, by nurses, family and friends, the experience of living a meaningful life can be supported, which, in turn, can ease EL.</ab>

        <ab>Background: A Community Wellness Team was implemented in North East England in 2014, in line with national policy directives to support frail older people in the community. The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. Design: A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Results: Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self‐management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. Discussion: The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team "works" is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live. Conclusion: Severely frail older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a complex and flexible person‐centred approach. Implications for Practice: This study paves the way for further research into the care networks surrounding severely frail older people living in the community, and how they can most effectively be implemented.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Especially patients older than 65 years undergoing surgery are prone to develop frailty-related complications that may go far beyond the index hospitalization (e.g., cognitive impairment following postoperative delirium). However, aging-relevant information are currently not fully integrated into hospitals' perioperative processes.Methods: We introduce a temporal perspective, which focuses on the social construction of time, to better understand existing barriers to the exchange of frailty-related data, targeting complexity research. Our chosen context is perioperative care provided by a tertiary hospital in Germany that has implemented a special track for patients over 65 years old undergoing elective surgery. The research followed a participatory modelling approach between domain and modelling experts with the goal of creating a feedback loop model of the relevant system relationships and dynamics.Results: The results of the study show how disparate temporal regimes, understood as frameworks for organizing actions in the light of time constraints, time pressure, and deadlines, across different clinical, ambulant, and geriatric care sectors create disincentives to cooperate in frailty-related data exchanges. Moreover, we find that shifting baselines, meaning continuous increases in cost and time pressure in individual sectors, may unintentionally reinforce - rather than discourage - disparate temporal regimes.Conclusions: Together, these results may (1) help to increase awareness of the importance of frailty-related data exchanges, and (2) impel efforts aiming to transform treatment processes to go beyond sectoral boundaries, taking into account the potential benefits for frail patients arising from integrated care processes using information technology.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Some people with substantial Alzheimer's disease pathology at autopsy had shown few characteristic clinical symptoms or signs of the disease, whereas others with little Alzheimer's disease pathology have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. We aimed to examine whether frailty, which is associated with both age and dementia, moderates the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia.Methods: We did a cross-sectional analysis of data from participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a clinical-pathological cohort study of older adults (older than 59 years) without known dementia at baseline, living in Illinois, USA. Participants in the cohort study underwent annual neuropsychological and clinical evaluations. In the present cross-sectional analysis, we included those participants who did not have any form of dementia or who had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of their last clinical assessment and who had died and for whom complete autopsy data were available. Alzheimer's disease pathology was quantified by a summary measure of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic and diffuse plaques. Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia was based on clinician consensus. Frailty was operationalised retrospectively using health variable information obtained at each clincial evaluation using the deficit accumulation approach (41-item frailty index). Logistic regression and moderation modelling were used to assess relationships between Alzheimer's disease pathology, frailty, and Alzheimer's dementia. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and education.Findings: Up to data cutoff (Jan 20, 2017), we included 456 participants (mean age at death 89·7 years [SD 6·1]; 316 [69%] women). 242 (53%) had a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia at their last clinical assessment. Frailty (odds ratio 1·76, 95% CI 1·54-2·02; p&lt;0·0001) and Alzheimer's disease pathology (4·81, 3·31-7·01; p&lt;0·0001) were independently associated with Alzheimer's dementia, after adjusting for age, sex, and education. When frailty was added to the model for the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia, model fit improved (p&lt;0·0001). There was a significant interaction between frailty and Alzheimer's disease pathology (odds ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·57-0·94; pinteraction=0·015). People with an increased frailty score had a weakened direct link between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia; that is, people with a low amount of frailty were better able to tolerate Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas those with higher amounts of frailty were more likely both to have more Alzheimer's disease pathology and for it to be expressed as dementia.Interpretation: The degree of frailty among people of the same age modifies the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. That frailty is related to both odds of Alzheimer's dementia and disease expression has implications for clinical management, since individuals with even a low level of Alzheimer's disease pathology might be at risk for dementia if they have high amounts of frailty. Further research should assess how frailty and cognition change over time to better elucidate this complex relationship.Funding: None.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is an advance care planning tool designed for seriously ill patients. The discussions needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not occur in the outpatient setting. Objective: We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. Setting/Participants: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. Measurements: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items about the intervention. Results: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers agreed or strongly agreed that "Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about what I really want." Conclusions: The POLST facilitation can be successfully delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Integrated care is increasingly promoted as an effective and cost‐effective way to organise care for community‐dwelling frail older people with complex problems but the question remains whether high expectations are justified. Our study aims to systematically review the empirical evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for community‐dwelling frail older people and close attention is paid to the elements and levels of integration of the interventions. We searched nine databases for eligible studies until May 2016 with a comparison group and reporting at least one outcome regarding effectiveness or cost‐effectiveness. We identified 2,998 unique records and, after exclusions, selected 46 studies on 29 interventions. We assessed the quality of the included studies with the Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk‐of‐bias tool. The interventions were described following Rainbow Model of Integrated Care framework by Valentijn. Our systematic review reveals that the majority of the reported outcomes in the studies on preventive, integrated care show no effects. In terms of health outcomes, effectiveness is demonstrated most often for seldom‐reported outcomes such as well‐being. Outcomes regarding informal caregivers and professionals are rarely considered and negligible. Most promising are the care process outcomes that did improve for preventive, integrated care interventions as compared to usual care. Healthcare utilisation was the most reported outcome but we found mixed results. Evidence for cost‐effectiveness is limited. High expectations should be tempered given this limited and fragmented evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for frail older people. Future research should focus on unravelling the heterogeneity of frailty and on exploring what outcomes among frail older people may realistically be expected.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with frailty among the young‐old elderly (YOE) and old–old elderly (OOE). METHODS: This longitudinal study with a 3‐year follow‐up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS: Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3‐year period. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent frailty, we suggest weight‐loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower‐limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. Implications for Nursing Practice: The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Heart disease is the most significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in older adults. Care decisions are complex because patients may have multiple comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Additionally, older adults often have vague symptomology, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and a reported delay of treatment. Although multiple clinical guidelines are available, the applicability of guidelines to the older population needs to be evaluated based on a holistic, individualized basis. Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes and priorities, incorporating risk-benefit assessment, quality of life, functional assessment, and frailty assessment when making treatment decisions. Highlights • Older adults are a heterogeneous group who require complex care decisions for coronary heart disease. • There are gaps in recommendations for care in many evidence-based guidelines. • Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes, incorporating analysis of risk benefit and quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

        <ab>Context: Identifying high-value health care delivery for patients with clinically complex and high-cost conditions is important for future reimbursement models.Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the Medicare reimbursement savings of an established palliative care homebound program.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving 50 participants enrolled in a palliative care homebound program and 95 propensity-matched control patients at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between September 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. Total Medicare reimbursement was compared in the year before enrollment with the year after enrollment for participants and controls.Results: No significant differences were observed in demographic characteristics or prognostic indices between the two groups. Total Medicare reimbursement per program participant the year before program enrollment was $16,429 compared with $14,427 per control patient, resulting in $2004 higher charges per program patient. In 12 months after program enrollment, mean annual payment was $5783 per patient among participants and $22,031 per patient among the matched controls. In the second year, the intervention group had a decrease of $10,646 per patient; the control group had an increase of $7604 per patient. The difference between the participant group and control group was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) and favored the palliative care homebound program enrollees by $18,251 (95% CI, $11,268-$25,234).Conclusion: The Mayo Clinic Palliative Care Homebound Program reduced annual Medicare expenditures by $18,251 per program participant compared with matched control patients. This supports the role of home-based palliative medicine in delivering high-value care to high-risk older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Emergency services are faced with people over the age of 75 whose frailty leads to states of agitation. Objective: To improve the quality of the care of this situation through the invention of an advanced practice nurse. Method: A phenomenological and monocentric study from interviews with professionals intervening in emergencies about the difficulties they encountered. A thematic tree was constructed once the interviews were transcribed and coded. Results: Five themes emerged from nine interviews, including: definition of agitation, its causes, and contributing factors. The consequences, the risks for the elderly, and the impact on care. The significance of this phenomenon. The link between agitation and frailty. Difficulties and possible measures to improve care. Discussion: The data collected correspond to the data featuring in the literature and allow advanced practice nurses to pinpoint their actions. Conclusion: Advanced practice nurses can contribute to improving the care of the agitated elderly through primary and secondary prevention.</ab>
        <ab>Introduction : les personnes âgées fragiles de plus de 75 ans ont de plus en plus recours aux services d'urgence ; leur état de fragilité conduit souvent à des situations d'agitation qui soulèvent des questions de prise en soins particulièrement complexes. Objectif : comprendre la situation des personnes âgées, fragiles et agitées dans les services d'urgence et examiner la possibilité d'améliorer la qualité des soins avec l'intervention d'une infirmière de pratique avancée. Méthode : étude exploratoire, descriptive qualitative, s'appuyant sur la réalisation de neuf entretiens semidirectifs auprès de professionnels intervenant aux urgences et sur l'observation de situations de soins dans ces services. L'analyse est fondée sur l'élaboration d'un arbre thématique et l'examen de la signification des phénomènes observés. Résultats : cinq thèmes émergent des entretiens : définition de l'agitation, causes et facteurs favorisants, conséquences, risques pour la personne âgée et impact sur les soins. Les contenus des entretiens permettent d'identifier la signification du phénomène, le lien entre agitation et fragilité, les difficultés et les mesures possibles permettant d'améliorer la prise en charge. Discussion : les résultats rejoignent ceux de la littérature et permettent à l'infirmière de pratique avancée d'identifier sa contribution à la gestion de ces situations complexes. Conclusion : la fragilité étant un processus réversible, la pratique infirmière avancée pourra améliorer la qualité des soins dispensés aux personnes âgées fragiles et agitées aux urgences.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The complex physiology underpinning the frailty syndrome is responsible for the absence of robust biomarkers that can be used for screening, diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes and has made clinical implementation difficult. Considering socially vulnerable populations, who have poor health status and increased morbidity and mortality, this scenario is even more complex. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies available to investigate frailty biomarkers in socially vulnerable populations. Thus, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify potential blood-based biomarkers of frailty in a socially vulnerable population.Methods: A sample consisting of 347 community-dwelling older people living in a context of high social vulnerability was divided into non-frail (robust), pre-frail and frail groups, according to modified Fried frailty phenotype criteria. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for basic metabolic parameters and for inflammatory cytokines.Results: Levels of Interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) were significantly higher in pre-frail subjects, compared to non-frail ones. Tumor Necrosis Factor β (TNF-β) levels presented higher values in the frail compared to non-frail individuals. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in pre-frail and frail subjects were significantly higher compared to the levels of non-frail subjects. Using an ordinal regression analysis, we observed that socially vulnerable older people at higher risk of developing frailty were subjects above 80 years old (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) and who presented higher levels of TNF-β (≥0.81 pg/mL, OR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.3-4.9).Conclusion: As vulnerable populations continue to age, it is imperative to have a greater understanding of the frailty condition, identifying novel potential blood-based biomarkers. The results presented here could help to implement preventive healthcare strategies by evaluating frailty and at the same time measuring a set of inflammatory biomarkers, paying special attention to TNF-β plasmatic levels.</ab>

        <ab>Therapeutic decision‐making for older patients with stage IV non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no identifiable activating mutation is complex. In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients ≥70 years of age were evaluated with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age was 76 (70–92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p &lt; 0.001) and GA group (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose to support older people with several healthcare needs in sustaining adequate functioning and independence, more proactive approaches are needed. This purpose of this study is to summarise the (cost-) effectiveness of proactive, multidisciplinary, integrated care programmes for older people in Dutch primary care. Methods design individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of eight clinically controlled trials. Setting primary care sector. Interventions combination of (i) identification of older people with complex problems by means of screening, followed by (ii) a multidisciplinary integrated care programme for those identified. Main outcome activities of daily living, i.e. a change on modified Katz-15 scale between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes quality of life (visual analogue scale 0–10), psychological (mental well-being scale Short Form Health Survey (SF)-36) and social well-being (single item, SF-36), quality-adjusted life years (Euroqol-5dimensions-3level (EQ-5D-3L)), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness. Analysis intention-to-treat analysis, two-stage IPD and subgroup analysis based on patient and intervention characteristics. Results included were 8,678 participants: median age of 80.5 (interquartile range 75.3; 85.7) years; 5,496 (63.3%) women. On the modified Katz-15 scale, the pooled difference in change between the intervention and control group was −0.01 (95% confidence interval −0.10 to 0.08). No significant differences were found in the other patient outcomes or subgroup analyses. Compared to usual care, the probability of the intervention group to be cost-effective was less than 5%. Conclusion compared to usual care at 1-year follow-up, strategies for identification of frail older people in primary care combined with a proactive integrated care intervention are probably not (cost-) effective.</ab>

        <ab>Interprofessional collaborative education and practice has become a cornerstone of optimal person-centered management in the current complex health care climate. This is especially important when working with older adults, many with multiple chronic conditions and challenging health care needs. This paper describes a feasibility study of the Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training 2.0 (GITT 2.0) program focused on providing interprofessional care to complex and frail older adults with multiple chronic conditions. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design facilitated program implementation and evaluation. Over three years (2013-2016), 65 graduate students from nursing, midwifery, social work, and pharmacy participated along with 25 preceptors. Participants were surveyed on their attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration pre and post-intervention and participated in focus groups. While attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration did not change quantitatively, focus groups revealed changes in language and enhanced perspectives of participants. Based on the evaluation data, the GITT 2.0 Toolkit was refined for use in interprofessional education and practice activities related to quality initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Providing care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is associated with a high risk of them developing complications. Aim: To survey the most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. Method: A retrospective descriptive survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. Findings: The persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. Conclusion: Frail older persons with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end‐of‐life care, should be prevented from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making house calls.</ab>

        <ab>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisymptom, neurodegenerative disease affecting primarily older adults. With progression, many individuals become homebound and removed from coordinated, expert care, resulting in excess morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures in acute care settings and institutions. Home visit care models have achieved the triple aim of improving individual and population health while reducing costs in many frail, community‐dwelling geriatric cohorts. This study details a novel, interdisciplinary home visit program specifically designed for individuals with PD and related disorders and their family caregivers built upon best practice principles in the care of multimorbid older adults. At each quarterly home visit, a movement disorders–trained neurologist, social worker, and nurse work in parallel with the individual and caregiver to complete a history, physical, detailed medication reconciliation, psychosocial needs assessment, and home safety assessment. A comprehensive, person‐centered plan is agreed upon, referrals to community resources are made, standardized documentation is shared, and follow‐up communication is instituted. In the first 2 years, 272 visits were conducted with 85 individuals who represent one of the oldest, most disabled PD populations reported. Satisfaction with and retention in the program were high. This study represents the first translation of the success of interdisciplinary and home‐based geriatric care models to a population with a specific neurological disease. Preliminary evidence supports the need for such programs in vulnerable populations. Future studies will prospectively assess person‐centered outcomes, the effect of using telemedicine on sustainability, and cost effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Drug treatment is often an essential part in treatment and prevention of diseases in older people, but there is much concern about inappropriate medication use. This paper aims to describe the complexity of medication safety issues and clinical judgments when optimizing prescribing in older individuals. It uses the case of Mrs. Hansen, an aged nursing home resident, to illustrate the facilitators and barriers of this process. With decreasing life expectancy, medication use should shift from cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment to increase the patient's well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of (potentially) dangerous medications were reduced, and non-pharmacological alternatives were considered. There were some medicines added, as underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. Deprescribing long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family as "giving up hope". More clinical evidence and practical communication tools are needed to guide deprescribing decisions, taking medical and patient-centered priorities into account. Studies evaluating such interventions should select outcome measures that are particularly relevant for frail old individuals.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community‐dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Background: checklists are increasingly proposed as a means to enhance safety and quality of care. However, their use has been met with variable levels of success. The Frailsafe project focused on introducing a checklist with the aim to increase completion of key clinical assessments and to facilitate communication for the care of older patients in acute admissions. Objectives: to examine the use of the Frailsafe checklist, including potential to contribute to improved safety, quality and reliability of care. Methods: 110 qualitative interviews and group discussions with healthcare professionals and other specialties, 172 h of ethnographic observation in 12 UK hospitals and reporting of high-level process data (completion of checklist and relevant frailty assessments). Qualitative analysis followed a thematic and theory-driven approach. Results: through use of the checklist, hospital teams identified limitations in their existing assessments (e.g. absence of delirium protocols) and practices (e.g. unnecessary catheter use). This contributed to hospitals reporting just 24.0% of sampled patients as having received all clinical assessments across key domains for this population for the duration of the project (1,687/7,021 checklists as fully completed). Staff perceptions and experiences of using the checklist varied significantly, primarily driven by the extent to which the aims of this quality improvement project aligned with local service priorities and pre-existing team communications styles. Conclusions: the Frailsafe checklist highlighted limitations with frailty assessment in acute care and motivated teams to review routine practices. Further work is needed to understand whether and how checklists can be embedded in complex, multidisciplinary care.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in their daily lives. Background: A better understanding of the personal experience of frailty in the context of fluctuating ill‐health has the potential to contribute to the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. Design: An ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a community matron service in a large city in the North of England. Methods: Up to six care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11 months. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4‐year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method. Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: &lt;italic&gt;Fluctuating ill‐health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living&lt;/italic&gt;. Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person‐centred care . Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.</ab>

        <ab>The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical problems. However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and researchers.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant symptom burden; however, our understanding of the relationship between symptoms and physical frailty in HF is limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. Methods: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. Results: The mean age of the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 T 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P &lt; .001), 75% worse wake disturbances (P &lt; .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. Conclusions: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The number of frail elderly people with complex nursing and medical care needs is increasing, and consequently, the healthcare burden. The implementation of Advanced Nurse Practitioners globally has been shown to make healthcare more effective and increase patient safety, continuity of care and access to care. In Sweden, research about Advanced Nurse Practitioners is limited. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the opinions of managers, doctors and nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare about the role of ANPs in municipal healthcare as a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of the frail elderly. Methods: Managers, doctors and specialist nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare adopted a qualitative, descriptive design through 12 semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using content analysis. Results: The participants expressed both opportunities as well as challenges with Advanced Nurse Practitioners in municipal healthcare. This role considered to satisfy frail elderly people's healthcare needs and making the healthcare more effective as the doctors would have more time for other patients. The challenges mainly consist of doubts from the managers whether the nurses would be motivated to pursue further education to become an Advanced Nurse Practitioner if the role becomes a reality. The doctors were unsure if the nurses would consider taking the responsibility the role would imply. Conclusions: Advanced Nurse Practitioner is considered to be a valuable resource not only for the frail elderly but also for the nurses in the municipal healthcare and for the doctors in primary care as they probably would make healthcare more effective. They might be a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of frail elderly, however there are also challenges to overcome before they can become a reality in a Swedish healthcare context. Consequently, this role deserves further investigation.</ab>

        <ab>Presently only about 9% of seniors over the age of 75 live in residential care facilities but the anticipated exponential growth of the senior population will put increasing pressure on the need for supportive, continuing care services in the years ahead (CIHI 2017a). They are on average 86 years of age with a diagnosis of dementia (67%) and some cognitive and/or functional impairment (98%) (CIHI 2017b). These compromised seniors are also more likely to use hospital services than others, and in many jurisdictions occupy acute care beds for extended periods because ongoing management of their complex conditions is often not possible within long-term care (LTC) homes. In addition, unnecessary and futile care at the end of life often leads to suffering for individuals and their families (Dobbins 2016), which might otherwise be avoided with the presence of institutionally based providers such as nurse practitioners (NPs). Christian and Barker (2009) identified NPs as a valuable resource to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations which often lead to complications and devastating results for seniors. Although evidence of the positive impact of NPs working in LTC facilities dates back to the 1970s, very few organizations have created and obtained funding support for these positions in LTC settings. This case study illustrates the impact of the NP role in a New Brunswick LTC facility; demonstrating the value of a model that includes an NP collaborating with physicians, nurses and allied health professionals. As shown in this case, the presence of an NP clearly impacted a reduction in emergency room visits and hospitalizations, events that more often than not accelerate further physical, mental and functional decline particularly among the frail elderly. Christian and Barker (2009) described the significant consequences of hospitalization for the elderly patient including irreversible decline in function, delirium and exposure to iatrogenic disease. Having an NP available within LTC affords the residents ongoing monitoring that allows for preemptive and proactive care. NPs providing oversight to the collaborative management of the care of LTC residents has the potential to not only realize cost-avoidance for the healthcare system but also enhance the quality of care for residents and their families.</ab>

        <ab>Background Standard risk screening and assessment forms are frequently used in strategies to prevent harm to older people in hospitals. Little is known about good practices for their use. Objective Scope the preventable harms addressed by standard forms used to screen and assess older people and how standard forms are operationalised in hospitals across Victoria, Australia. Methods Mixed methods study: (1) crosssectional audit of the standard risk screening and assessment forms used to assess older people at 11 health services in 2015; (2) nine focus groups with a purposive sample of 69 participants at 9 health services. Descriptive analysis examined the number of items on forms, preventable harms assessed and sources of duplication. Qualitative thematic analysis of focus group data identified themes explaining issues commonly affecting how health services used the forms. Results 152 standard assessment forms from 11 Victorian health services included over 3700 items with 17% duplicated across multiple forms. Assessments of skin integrity and mobility loss (including falls) were consistently included in forms; however, nutrition, cognitive state, pain and medication risks were inconsistent; and continence, venous thromboembolism risk and hospital acquired infection from invasive devices were infrequent. Qualitative analyses revealed five themes explaining issues associated with current use of assessment forms: (1) comprehensive assessment of preventable harms; (2) burden on staff and the older person, (3) interprofessional collaboration, (4) flexibility to individualise care and (5) information management. Examples of good practice were identified. Conclusions Current use of standard risk screening and assessment forms is associated with a high burden and gaps in assessment of several common preventable harms that can increase risk to older people in hospital. Improvement should focus on streamlining forms, increased guidance on interventions to prevent harm and facilitating front-line staff to manage complex decisions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pain management is a cornerstone of palliative care. The clinical issues encountered by physicians when managing pain in patients dying with advanced dementia, and how these may impact on prescribing and treatment, are unknown Aim: To explore physicians' experiences of pain management for patients nearing the end of life, the impact of these on prescribing and treatment approaches, and the methods employed to overcome these challenges Design: Qualitative, semi-structured interview study exploring barriers to and facilitators of pain management, prescribing and treatment decisions, and training needs. Thematic analysis was used to elicit key themes. Setting/participants: A total of 23 physicians, responsible for treating patients with advanced dementia approaching the end of life, were recruited from primary care (n = 9), psychiatry (n = 7) and hospice care (n = 7) Results: Six themes emerged: diagnosing pain, complex prescribing and treatment approaches, side effects and adverse events, route of administration, importance of sharing knowledge and training needs. Knowledge exchange was often practised through liaison with physicians from other specialities. Cross-speciality mentoring and the creation of knowledge networks were believed to improve pain management in this patient population Conclusion: Pain management in end-stage dementia is complex, requiring cross-population of knowledge between palliative care specialists and non-specialists, in addition to collateral information provided by other health professionals and patients' families. Regular, cost- and time-effective mentoring and ongoing professional development are perceived to be essential in empowering physicians to meet clinical challenges in this area.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Informal caregivers are deeply involved in the case management process. However, little is known about the consequences of such programs for informal caregivers. This systematic literature review, reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, addressed the consequences of clinical case management programs, whether positive or negative, for caregivers of frail older persons or persons with dementia.Methods: We systematically identified and analyzed published randomized trials and quasi-experimental studies comparing case management programs to usual care, which discussed outcomes concerning caregivers.Results: Sixteen studies were identified, and 12 were included after quality assessment. Seven identified at least one positive result for caregivers, and no negative effect of case management has been found. Characteristics associated with positive results for caregivers were a high intensity of case management and programs specifically addressed to dementia patients.Conclusions: Despite the numerous methodological challenges in the assessment of such complex social interventions, our results show that case management programs can be beneficial for caregivers of dementia patients and that positive results for patients are achieved without increasing caregivers' burden.

        <ab>Background Evidence indicates that care experiences for complex HF patients could be improved by simple organizational and process changes, rather than complex clinical mechanisms. This survey identifies care gaps and recommends simple changes. Methods The study utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods at The Ottawa Hospital, Geriatric Medical Unit (GMU) during a three-month period. Results Nineteen patients (average age 85,12 female) surveyed. Twelve participants lived alone. Fourteenlived in own home. Fourpatients had formal home-care services. Fifteen relied on family. Gaps were identified in in-patient practice, discharge plan, and discharge summary implementation feedback. Only five participants had seen a cardiologist or a specialist. Half of the patients did not know if they were on a special Heart Failure (HF) diet. Participants did not recall receiving information on life expectancy but were comfortable discussing EoL care and dying. HF-specific management recommendations were mentioned in only 37% of discharge summaries to primary care providers (PCP). Conclusion The results provide the starting point for a quality assurance and process re-engineering program in GMU. Organization change is needed to develop and integrate a cardiogeriatric clinical framework to allow the cardiologist, geriatrician, and PCP to actively work as a team with the patient/caregiver to develop the optimal care plan pre- and post-discharge.</ab>

        <ab>Background: General Practitioners (GPs) are responsible for primary prescribing decisions in most settings. Elderly patients living in Advanced Care Facilities (ACFs) often have significant co-morbidities to consider when selecting an appropriate drug therapy. Careful assessment is required when considering appropriate medication use in frail older patients as they have multiple diseases and thus multiple medication. Many physicians seem reluctant to discontinue other physicians' prescriptions, resulting in further polypharmacy. Therefore it is relevant to ascertain and synthesise the GP views from multiple settings to understand the processes that might promote appropriate deprescribing medications in the elderly. The aims of this study were to 1) compare and contrast behavioural factors influencing the deprescribing practices of GPs providing care for ACF residents in two separate countries, 2) review health policy and ACF systems in each setting for their potential impact on the prescribing of medications for an older person in residential care of the elderly, and 3) based on these findings, provide recommendations for future ACF deprescribing initiatives. Methods: A review and critical synthesis of qualitative data from two interview studies of knowledge, attitudes, and behavioural practices held by GPs towards medication management and deprescribing for residents of ACFs in Australia and Sweden was conducted. A review of policies and health care infrastructure was also carried out to describe the system of residential aged care in the both countries. Results: Our study has identified that deprescribing by GPs in ACFs is a complex process and that there are numerous barriers to medication reduction for aged care residents in both countries, both with similarities and differences. The factors affecting deprescribing behaviour were identified and divided into: intentions, skills and abilities and environmental factors. Conclusions: In this study we show that the GPs' behaviour of deprescribing in two different countries is much dependent on the larger health care system. There is a need for more education to both GPs and ACF staff as well as better cooperation between the different health care systems and appropriate monetary incentives for elderly care to achieve better conditions for deprescribing practice.</ab>

        <ab>Background: understanding how best to provide palliative care for frail older people with non-malignant conditions is an international priority. We aimed to develop a community-based episodic model of short-term integrated palliative and supportive care (SIPS) based on the views of service users and other key stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Method: transparent expert consultations with health professionals, voluntary sector and carer representatives including a consensus survey; and focus groups with older people and carers were used to generate recommendations for the SIPS model. Discussions focused on three key components of the model: potential benefit of SIPS, timing of delivery and processes of integrated working between specialist palliative care and generalist practitioners. Content and descriptive analysis was employed and findings were integrated across the data sources. Findings: we conducted two expert consultations (n = 63), a consensus survey (n = 42) and three focus groups (n = 17). Potential benefits of SIPS included holistic assessment, opportunity for end of life discussion, symptom management and carer reassurance. Older people and carers advocated early access to SIPS, while other stakeholders proposed delivery based on complex symptom burden. A priority for integrated working was the assignment of a key worker to co-ordinate care, but the assignment criteria remain uncertain. Interpretation: key stakeholders agree that a model of SIPS for frail older people with non-malignant conditions has potential benefits within community settings, but differ in opinion on the optimal timing and indications for this service. Our findings highlight the importance of consulting all key stakeholders in model development prior to feasibility evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>The question of exactly what frailty is and what that may mean for patients is extremely complex. This is a very conceptual problem requiring a broad and long-term solution. It is not a disease or a condition that can be treated in isolation. Frailty is a collection of contributing factors that culminate in an individual being susceptible to poorer outcomes following health-care interventions and minor illness. The solution to such a complex problem lies in engaging and empowering staff to understand and champion frailty. Once better understood, it will be possible to educate and enable this workforce to recognise the signs of frailty, poor prognosis and patients requiring more specialised palliative care. Informing staff working within a health-care economy of this issue must be the first step in a shift towards managing patients with frailty more appropriately, and streaming their care towards the correct care pathways sooner. This article discusses what frailty is, what it may mean for patients, and attempts to expand on why the construct of frailty is a prevalent issue for community nurses. The link between frailty and mortality is discussed and how targeted appropriate advanced care planning may be used to address this demographic challenge.</ab>

        <ab>Photography is a tool that has been used in research for many years. It allows people to create a record of an event, capture a complex phenomenon or to tell a story with pictures. Because it does not rely on language, it can be used with vulnerable populations who might not normally be included in research. This paper discusses the use of photography as one component of the evaluation strategy for a project that provided an opportunity for people with younger onset dementia to return to the workplace one day per week. Participants in the workplace project used photography to create a record of their experience of returning to the workplace. Based on the nature of the participant’s comments, photographs were grouped into four broad areas: impact of dementia, impact on family, the work experience and new friends. Issues related to the use of photography with people who have dementia are explored based on the experiences gained during this project.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To compare the ability of different frailty indexes based on a standardized comprehensive geriatric assessment (FI-CGAs) for predicting adverse outcomes. Design and Setting: Prospective cohort study. Geriatric wards of a general hospital. Participants: 307 hospitalized patients ≥ 65 years. Measurements: The FI-CGA-10D (potential health deficits in ten functional domains), the FI-CGA-10D+CM (aforementioned potential health deficits and co-morbidity burden) and the FI-CGA-MIHD (multiple, individual potential health deficits, including functional deficits, co-morbid diseases, amongst others) were assessed at baseline during the patients` hospital stay. The FI-CGAs were analyzed as categorical (according to a FI-CGA score &lt; and ≥ 0.25) and continuous variables. Patients were followed up over 6 months. Results: The FI-CGA-10D, FI-CGA-10+CM and the FI-CGA-MIHD predicted 6-month mortality when expressed as categorical (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): AUC = 0.611, AUC = 0.637, AUC = 0.616, all p &lt; 0.050, respectively) or continuous variables (AUC = 0.769, AUC = 0.837, AUC = 0.834, all p &lt; 0.001, respectively). AUC comparisons showed that all three FI-CGAs exhibited a comparable ability to predict 6-month mortality when the FI-CGAs were expressed as categorical variables (all p &gt; 0.200) and the FI-CGA-10D+CM and the FI-CGA-MIHD showed a better ability to predict 6-month mortality than the FI-CGA-10D, when the FI-CGAs were expressed as continuous variables (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). None of the FI-CGAs predicted any of the other outcomes, i.e., unplanned re-admission to hospital and a fall during follow-up, irrespective of whether the FI-CGAs were expressed as categorical or continuous variables (all p ≥ 0.050). Conclusions: The more complex FI-CGAs, i.e., the FI-CGA-10D+CM and the FI-CGA-MIHD, revealed better ability to predict 6 month mortality than the more simple FI-CGA, i.e., the FI-CGA-10D.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frail older people are an increasingly important group in primary care due to demographic change. For these patients, a palliative care approach may be useful to sustain the quality of life in the last phase of their lives. While general practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the primary care for older patients, general palliative care is still in its infancy and little is known in Germany about caring for frail older people towards the end of life. This study aims to explore the tasks and challenges regarding the care for frail older patients in the last phase of life from the GPs' point of view, and the latter's perception of their own role and responsibilities. Methods: Explorative qualitative study based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with 14 GPs from urban and rural regions in Lower Saxony, Germany. Analysis was carried out according to the principles of Grounded Theory. Results: The GPs' key commitment "caring for frail older patients until the end" as an integral part of primary care was worked out as a key category, flanked by central issues: "causal conditions and challenges," which include patients' preconditions and care needs as well as communication and cooperation aspects on the carers' level. "Barriers and facilitators within the health system" refers to prerequisites of the German healthcare system, such as high caseloads. Regarding "strategies to comply with this commitment", various self-developed strategies for the care of frail older people are presented, depending on the GPs' understanding of their professional role and individual circumstances. Conclusions: The GPs show a strong commitment to caring for the frail older patients until the end of life. However, it is a challenging and complex task that requires significant time, which can take GPs to their limits. There is a great need to improve patient--and family-centered proactive communication, as well as interprofessional cooperation. Strengthening the team approach in primary care could relieve the burden on GPs, especially in rural areas, while simultaneously improving end-of-life care for their patients.</ab>

        <ab>This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Shared decision-making (SDM) is widely recommended as a way to support patients in making healthcare choices. Due to an ageing population, the number of older patients will increase. Existing models for SDM are not sufficient for this patient group, due to their multi-morbidity, the lack of guidelines and evidence applicable to the numerous combinations of diseases. The aim of this study was to gain consensus on a model for SDM in frail older patients with multiple morbidities.Methods: We used a three-round Delphi study to reach consensus on a model for SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities. The expert panel consisted of 16 patients (round 1), and 59 professionals (rounds 1-3). In round 1, the SDM model was introduced, rounds 2 and 3 were used to validate the importance and feasibility of the SDM model.Results: Consensus for the proposed SDM model as a whole was achieved for both importance (91% panel agreement) and feasibility (76% panel agreement).Conclusions: SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities is a dynamic process. It requires a continuous counselling dialogue between professional and patient or proxy decision maker.Practice Implications: The developed model for SDM in clinical practice may help professionals to apply SDM in the complex situation of the care for older patients.</ab>

CGA is a holistic assessment model, which is designed to determine a frail older person's medical and mental health status, as well as functional, social and environmental issues. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised care planning. The case study presented explores the application of CGA with an 89-year-old patient with complex health and social care needs. It demonstrates how a hospital admission was avoided and the patient's health outcomes improved, by using a nurse-led systematic approach to assessment and by careful consideration of CGA domains.</ab>

        <ab>Background Frail older adults present to the Emergency Department (ED) with complex medical, functional, and social needs. When these needs can be addressed promptly, discharge is possible, and when they cannot, hospital admission is required. We evaluated the care needs of frail older adults in the ED who were consulted to internal medicine and seen by a geriatrician to determine, under current practices, which factors were associated with hospitalization and which allowed discharge. Methods We preformed a chart-based, exploratory study. Data were abstracted from consultation records and ED charts. All cases had a standard Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA which records a Clinical Frailty Scale (CFA) and allows calculation of a Frailty Index (FI). Results Of 100 consecutive patients, 2 died in the ED, 75 were admitted, and 23 were discharged, including one urgent placement. Compared with discharged patients (0.39 ± SD 0.16), those admitted had a higher mean FI-CGA (0.48 ± 0.13; p &lt; .01). Greater mobility dependence (2% in discharged vs. 32% in admitted; p &lt; .05) was notable. Conclusions Discharge decisions require assessment of medical, functional, and social problems. Ill, frail patients often can be discharged home when social and nursing support can be provided. The degree of frailty, impaired mobility, and likely delirium must be taken into account when planning for their care.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundThe number of beds in care homes (with and without nurses) in the United Kingdom is three times greater than the number of beds in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective.ObjectivesTo critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes.MethodsA review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose.ResultsFive surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient.ConclusionsHistorical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives There is limited evidence for the management of diabetes in frail elderly residents living in long-term care (LTC) settings. The purpose of this study was to explore the current practices of glycemic management in frail elderly persons with diabetes living in LTC settings. Methods Using a mixed-methods convergent parallel design, this study surveyed medical directors and attending physicians of long-term care centres through an online questionnaire and one-on-one semistructured interviews. Results A total of 39 questionnaires were completed, representing a variety of LTC settings, including private and public settings. Diabetes management practices varied across the participating settings with respect to glucose targets, with 69% of respondents selecting glycated hemoglobin levels of 8% or greater as being appropriate for LTC residents. Blood glucose monitoring, pharmacotherapy, presence of comorbidities, frailty and life expectancy were highlighted as variables for consideration in diabetes management in LTC. Interviews with attending physicians further illustrated the variability of opinions related to the use of clinical practice guidelines, glucose target levels and intensity of management (i.e. blood glucose monitoring and pharmacotherapy). Conclusions The findings of this study were triangulated with both the quantitative survey and the qualitative interviews. The implications of these findings suggest a disparity between what physicians feel should be achieved for diabetes management and what is actually done for frail elderly adults in LTC settings. Further research needs to be completed to assess the distinct needs and considerations of this unique population and healthcare setting.</ab>
        <ab>Résumé Objectifs Les données scientifiques sur la prise en charge du diabète chez les résidents âgés fragiles qui vivent dans des établissements de soins de longue durée (SLD) sont peu nombreuses. L'objectif de la présente étude était d'explorer les pratiques actuelles de prise en charge de la glycémie chez les personnes âgées fragiles souffrant de diabète qui vivent dans des établissements de SLD. Méthodes À l'aide de méthodes mixtes selon un devis parallèle convergent, la présente étude a été menée auprès des directeurs médicaux et des médecins traitants des centres de SLD au moyen d'un questionnaire en ligne et d'entrevues individuelles semi-structurées. Résultats Les 39 questionnaires remplis représentaient divers types d'établissements de SLD, dont les établissements privés et publics. Les pratiques de prise en charge du diabète en ce qui concerne les valeurs cibles de la glycémie variaient entre les établissements participants, parmi lesquels 69 % des répondants choisissaient des taux d'hémoglobine glyquée de 8 % ou plus comme taux appropriés pour les résidents en SLD. La surveillance de la glycémie, la pharmacothérapie, la présence de comorbidités, la fragilité et l'espérance de vie étaient apparues comme des variables à considérer dans la prise en charge du diabète en SLD. Les entrevues avec les médecins traitants illustraient davantage la variabilité des opinions liées à l'utilisation des lignes directrices de pratique clinique, des taux de glycémie cibles et de la complexité de la prise en charge (c.-à-d. la surveillance de la glycémie et la pharmacothérapie). Conclusions Les résultats de la présente étude étaient triangulés à l'enquête quantitative et aux entrevues qualitatives. Les conséquences de ces résultats suggèrent une disparité entre ce que les médecins estiment devoir être réalisé en matière de prise en charge du diabète et ce qui est réellement fait pour les personnes âgées fragiles dans les établissements de SLD. D'autres recherches devront être réalisées pour évaluer les besoins distincts et les spécificités de cette population et de cet environnement hospitalier particuliers.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To describe how the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) is uniquely suited to meet the needs of older adults throughout the continuum of cancer, to explore the progress that APNs have made in gero-oncology care, and make suggestions for future directions. Data Source Google Scholar, PubMed, and CINAHL. Search terms included: “gero-oncology,” “geriatric oncology,” “Advanced Practice Nurse,” “Nurse Practitioner,” “older adult,” “elderly,” and “cancer.” Conclusion Over the last decade, APNs have made advances in caring for older adults with cancer by playing a role in prevention, screening, and diagnosis; through evidence-based gero-oncology care during cancer treatment; and in designing tailored survivorship care models. APNs must combat ageism in treatment choice for older adults, standardize comprehensive geriatric assessments, and focus on providing person-centered care, specifically during care transitions. Implications for Nursing Practice APNs are well-positioned to help understand the complex relationship between risk factors, geriatric syndromes, and frailty and translate research into practice. Palliative care must expand beyond specialty providers and shift toward APNs with a focus on early advanced care planning. Finally, APNs should continue to establish multidisciplinary survivorship models across care settings, with a focus on primary care.</ab>

        <ab>The number of patients with end-stage kidney disease 65 years and older is growing, and this growth is expected to continue. The presence of medical comorbidities, limited life expectancy, frailty, and poor functional status in these patients poses substantial challenges in clinical decision-making and provision of optimal care. Frailty is more common in elderly patients with CKD than without and is associated with poor outcomes. Several prognostic tools were developed to estimate the rate of CKD progression among elderly, and risk of mortality after dialysis initiation. Risk factors for CKD progression among elderly include low estimated glomerular filtration rate, high baseline proteinuria, acute kidney injury, low serum albumin, and presence of congestive heart failure. The decision to initiate dialysis in the elderly should take into consideration life expectancy, risks and benefits of each dialysis modality, quality of life, and patient and caregiver preferences. This article discusses common issues in the elderly with end-stage kidney disease, with particular emphasis on the impact of frailty and functional status, choice of dialysis modality and vascular access, and prognosis after dialysis initiation, to assist the nephrologist in making decisions regarding optimal care for this complex group of patients.</ab>

        <ab>Elderly patients (&gt;65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.</ab>

        <ab>Pressure ulcers are painful and cause discomfort, have a negative effect on quality of life, and are costly to treat. The incidence and severity of preventable pressure ulcers is an important indicator of quality of care; it is essential that healthcare providers monitor prevalence and incidence rates to ensure that care strategies implemented are effective. Frail older people are at increased risk of developing pressure ulcers. This article discusses the complexities of preventing pressure ulcers in frail older people and emphasises the importance of structured educational programmes that incorporate effective clinical leadership and multidisciplinary teamwork.</ab>

        <ab>To face the challenge of active and healthy ageing, European Health Systems and services should move towards proactive, anticipatory and integrated care. The comparison of methods to combine results across studies and to determine an overall effect was undertaken by the EU project ASSEHS (Activation of Stratification Strategies and Results of the interventions on frail patients of Healthcare Services, EU project (No. 2013 12 04). The questions raised in ASSEHS are broad and involve a complex body of literature. Thus, systematic reviews are not appropriate. The most appropriate method appears to be scoping studies. In this paper, an updated method of scoping studies has been used to determine the questions needed to appraise the health systems and services for frailty in the ageing population. Three objectives were set (i) to detect a relevant number of risk stratification tools for frailty and identify the best-in-class, (ii) to understand the feasibility of introducing stratification tools and identify the difficulties of the process and (iii) to find evidence on the impact of risk stratification in Health Services. This novel approach may provide greater clarity about scoping study methodology and help enhance the methodological rigor with which authors undertake and report scoping studies.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Geriatric Care Model ( GCM), an integrated care model for frail older adults based on the Chronic Care Model, with that of usual care. Design Economic evaluation alongside a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting Primary care (35 practices) in two regions in the Netherlands. Participants Community-dwelling older adults who were frail according to their primary care physicians and the Program on Research for Integrating Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy case-finding tool questionnaire (N = 1,147). Intervention The GCM consisted of the following components: a regularly scheduled in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment by a practice nurse followed by a customized care plan, management and training of practice nurses by a geriatric expert team, and coordination of care through community network meetings and multidisciplinary team consultations of individuals with complex care needs. Measurements Outcomes were measured every 6 months and included costs from a societal perspective, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Survey ( SF-12) physical ( PCS) and mental component summary ( MCS) scales), functional limitations (Katz activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), and quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D. Results Multilevel regression models adjusted for time and baseline confounders showed no significant differences in costs ($356, 95% confidence interval = −$488-1,134) and outcomes between intervention and usual care phases. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that, for the SF-12 PCS and MCS, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.76 if decision-makers are willing to pay $30,000 per point improvement on the SF-12 scales (range 0-100). For all other outcomes the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was low. Conclusion Because the GCM was not cost-effective compared to usual care after 24 months of follow-up, widespread implementation in its current form is not recommended.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose – A growing older population with complex care needs, including dementia, are living in care homes. It is important to support researchers in conducting ethical and appropriate work in this complex research environment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss key issues in care homes research including examples of best practice. The intention is to inform researchers across disciplines, leading to more sensitive and meaningful care home research practice. Design/methodology/approach – Experienced care homes researchers were invited to provide methodological insights and details not already reported in their publications. These have been analysed, creating key themes and linked to project publications. Findings – The need for reflexivity was a key finding. In particular, researchers need to: appreciate that the work is complex; see participants as potential research partners; and consider how cognitive and physical frailty of residents, staffing pressures and the unique environments of care homes might impact upon their research. Other challenges include recruitment and consenting people who lack mental capacity. Research limitations/implications – As the care homes research landscape continues to develop and grow, there still remains limited reflection and discussion of methodological issues with a need for a “safe space” for researchers to discuss challenges. Originality/value – This review is an updated methodological guide for care homes researchers, also highlighting current gaps in the mechanisms for continuing to share best research practice.</ab>

        <ab>Physical therapists often treat older adults with marked deficits in physical function secondary to an acute hospitalization. These deficits are often collectively defined as hospital-associated deconditioning (HAD). However, there is a paucity of evidence that objectively demonstrates the efficacy of physical therapy for older adults with HAD. Older adults with HAD represent a highly variable and complex population and thus may be difficult to study and develop effective interventions for using our current rehabilitation strategies. This perspective article outlines an innovative framework to operationalize and treat older adults with HAD. This framework may help therapists apply emerging exercise strategies to this population and facilitate additional research to support the total value of physical therapy for older adults in postacute care settings--with value measured not only by improvements in physical performance but perhaps also by reduced rates of disability development, rehospitalization, and institutionalization.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Given the growing number of vulnerable, older cardiac surgery patients, the preadmission PREvention Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery patients (PREDOCS) programme was developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with the acceptability, compliance and delivery. Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings. Methods: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI). Results: Twenty-one females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients. Conclusions: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To discuss models of care for frail seniors provided in primary care settings and those developed by Canadian FPs.Sources Of Information: Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane database were searched from 2010 to January 2014 using the terms models of care, family medicine, elderly, and geriatrics.Main Message: New models of funding for primary care have opened opportunities for ways of caring for complex frail older patients. Severity of frailty is an important factor, and more severe frailty should prompt consideration of using an alternate model of care for a senior. In Canada, models in use include integrated care systems, shared care models, home-based care models, and family medicine specialty clinics. No one model should take precedence but FPs should be involved in developing and implementing strategies that meet the needs of individual patients and communities. Organizational and remunerative supports will need to be put in place to achieve widespread uptake of such models.Conclusion: Given the increased numbers of frail seniors and the decrease in access to hospital beds, prioritized care models should include ones focused on optimizing health, decreasing frailty, and helping to avoid hospitalization of frail and well seniors alike. The Health Care of the Elderly Program Committee at the College of Family Physicians of Canada is hosting a repository for models of care used by FPs and is asking physicians to submit their ideas for how to best care for frail seniors.</ab>

        <ab>Objective The objective of this study was to examine whether the capacity of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood) to predict mortality in a nursing home population. Design, Setting, and Participants Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 773 older persons (74.4% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. Measurements The FI was computed as the ratio between actual and 30 potential deficits the participant might have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 deficits]). Death events were monitored and detected over a 12-month follow-up. The risk of death was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results Mean age of participants was 86.2 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.35 (SD 0.11). At the end of the follow-up, 135 (17.4%) death events were recorded. A positive association between the FI and mortality (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.018, 95% confidence interval 1.002–1.035, P = .03) was reported. The use of the traditional 0.25 cut-point for detecting the frailty status is inadequate in this population. Conclusion The FI is able to predict mortality even in very old and complex elders, such as nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to analyse effects of a comprehensive continuum of care (intervention group) on frail older persons' life satisfaction, as compared to those receiving usual care (control group). The intervention included geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes. Background Improvements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life satisfaction are not well explored. Design Randomised controlled study. Methods The validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12 months after the baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as well as six- to 12-month follow-ups. Results Older persons who received the intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who received usual care, between 6 and 12 month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Conclusions A comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Relevance to clinical practice Frail older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.</ab>

        <ab>Background Most older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are frail and have complex care needs. Holistic understanding of residents' health status is key to providing good care. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a valid assessment method which aims to embrace complexity. Here we aimed to study a CGA that has been modified for use in long-term care (the LTC-CGA) and to investigate its acceptability and usefulness to stakeholders and users. Methods This mixed methods study, conducted in 10 LTCFs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, reviewed 598 resident charts from pre- and post-implementation of the LTC-CGA. Qualitative methods explored stakeholder perspectives (physicians, nurses, paramedics, administrators, residents and families) though focus groups. Results The LTC-CGA was present in 78% of LTCF charts in the post -implementation, period though it did not appear in acute care charts of transferred residents, despite the intention that it accompany residents between care sites. Some items had suboptimal completion rates (e.g., Advance Directives at 56.4%), though these were located in other sections of the LTCF chart (98.2%). Nevertheless, qualitative findings suggest the LTC-CGA describes a clinical baseline health status which enabled timely and informed clinical decision-making. Conclusions The LTC-CGA is a useful resource whose full capacity may not yet have been realized.</ab>

        <ab>Transition care is increasingly common for older people, yet little is known about the subjective experience of the transition care 'journey' from the perspective of clients themselves. This study examines how older people cope with frailty within the context of a dedicated transition care programme and discusses implications for improving service delivery. Qualitative in-depth interviews were carried out during 2011 in the homes of 20 older people who had recently been discharged from a transition care programme operating in Adelaide, South Australia (average age 80 years, 65% female). Thematic analysis identified three key themes: 'a new definition of recovery', 'complexities of control' and 'the disempowering system'. Despite describing many positive aspects of the programme, including meeting personal milestones and a renewed sense of independence, participants recognised that they were unlikely to regain their previous level of functioning. For some, this was exacerbated by lacking control over the transition care process while adapting to their new level of frailty. Overall, this research highlighted that benefits associated with transition care can be undermined by fragmentation in service delivery, loss of control and uncertainties around future support.</ab>

        <ab>The term frailty is often used to describe a subset of the older population with complex health issues. It is associated with dependence, disability, increased health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Consumer-directed care (CDC) is increasingly widespread among aged care service options in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. However, the evidence base regarding the programmatic and contextual factors that affect the outcome of CDC interventions is surprisingly small. This paper reports on a self-directed care approach for older Australians with complex care needs. A multimethods longitudinal comparative cohort study was employed comprising 4 survey tools and 56 semi-structured interviews. Participation rates were around 20%. A total of 185 (98 in the intervention and 87 in the control group) older people and carers were recruited at baseline. Eleven months later, 109 participants (59 in the intervention and 50 in the control group) completed the repeat measure. Attrition rates were around 40%. Data collection occurred between July 2010 and April 2012. The data suggest that intervention group participants were likely to be more satisfied with the way they were treated (P = 0.013), their care options (P = 0.014), the 'say' they had in their care (P &lt; 0.001), the information they received regarding their care (P = 0.012), what they were achieving in life (P = 0.031), that the services changed their view on what could be achieved in life (P = 0.020) and with their standard of living (P = 0.008). The evaluation suggests that while only a very small segment of older people is interested in a voucher or cash option, a substantially larger group would like to have greater say over and more direct access to their care, without, however, assuming administrative and financial responsibilities. The paper concludes that a stepped capacity-building approach to CDC may improve the acceptability of CDC to older people and generate synergies that improve older people's care outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frail older patients may have increased length of stay (LoS) and poorer outcomes when kept on traditional medical assessment units due to lack of comprehensive geriatric assessment at an early stage of their admission.Innovation: A clinical specialist nurse for older people (CNS) and an Elderly Short Stay Unit (ESSU) were introduced to support the work of the Frail Older Peoples' Advice and Liaison Service (FOPALS) operating in MAU. The CNS actively sought patients for FOPALS to review, liaising with family and community services, helping MAU with complex discharges and triaging patients to ESSU. With an anticipated LoS less than 4 days ESSU benefited from daily consultant geriatrician ward rounds, twice-daily MDT board rounds and increased therapy input. FOPALS then expanded to 7 day working.Evaluation: LoS for all elderly patients admitted to Queen's Hospital from March-May in 2011 and 2012, was 11 days and 11.25 days (respectively). Data was analysed on 730 patients from March-May 2013. 353 patients were assessed by FOPALS between March and mid April 2013. Pro-formas were completed (prospectively) for every patient. Following introduction of seven-day working, a further 377 patients were assessed between mid-April- May 2013. FOPALS reduced LoS for all elderly patients admitted to geriatric wards at Queen's Hospital from March-May 2013, to 9.25 days. LoS for those specifically assessed by FOPALS was 9 days. This reduced further to 8.1 days once seven-day working was introduced. Readmission rates within seven days reduced from 10.4% to 6.9% for all geriatric patients. Readmission rates within thirty days declined from 33 to 25%.Conclusions: ESSU along with a specialist nurse improved LoS, when used in conjunction with FOPALS, not only improving outcomes at the ‘front door’, but for all ward areas.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Unplanned admissions for older people can result in lengthy hospital stays. It has been recognised that many of these admissions are avoidable, often associated with adverse patient outcomes and potential resource misappropriation.There is a drive to seek novel processes to better assess and manage frail elderly people presenting to Emergency Departments (ED).Innovation: Within a busy London District General Hospital, an Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) service was designed. Based in the ED Observation Ward this service provides an in-reach service to the ED, and liaison to the Acute Medical Unit.This is a consultant-led service, with support from a trust grade junior doctor and Band 6 nurse. At present this is a weekday in-hours resource. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is delivered to patients over the age of 80, with complex problems or frailty, but who do not require inpatient care. Therapies and social care support is provided through existing teams operating in the ED.Evaluation: Between January and October 2013, 662 patients have been assessed by the ACE team, in whom 459 inappropriate admissions were avoided. To receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment and appropriate treatment to facilitate discharge of these patients only needed to stay an extra 4.76 hours on average in hospital.Since the introduction of the ACE service the rate of admission in older people from ED Observation Ward has reduced 61.2% in 2012 to 35.1% this year, despite similar levels of activity. Comparing similarly aged patients and episode diagnosis coding, in excess of 4,200 bed days could be saved per year.Conclusions: The ACE service has provided clear benefits to patients and the trust by avoiding un-necessary hospital admission, while providing focused consultant-delivered care in a timely manner. Expansion to a seven-day service is imminent, with expected further benefits.</ab>

        <ab>Challenges exist in assimilating palliative care within community-based services for nursing home eligible low-income elders with complex chronic illness as they approach the end of life (EOL). This study assessed the feasibility of a consultation model, with hospice clinicians working with three Care Wisconsin Partnership Program teams. Consults occurred primarily during team meetings and also informally and on joint patient visits and were primarily with the palliative care nurse addressing physical issues. Fifty-seven percent of consultant recommendations were implemented. Benefits of consultation were identified with focus groups of clinical staff as were opportunities and barriers to the implementation. Models of integration are proposed.</ab>

        <ab>The move to care in t he community is a key feature of NHS policy aimed at delivering better care while reducing costs. A multi-award-winning service in Oxford is leading the way in innovative community care, making a real difference to improving patient health and wellbeing. The Oxford Emergency Multidisciplinary Unit in Abingdon, Oxford was set up to meet t he urgent assessment and treatment needs of patients with multiple, often complex problems, many of whom are frail and elderly. The unit provides comprehensive medical, nursing, therapist and social care assessment, supported by advances in 'point-of-care' diagnostic technology that provide test results with in minutes of patients' arrival. This successful project has led to duplicate units not only in the Oxford region, but across the UK.</ab>

        <ab>Background: An initiative to transform health and social care across the Leeds Healthcare Economy has developed in response to recent demographic, political and economic challenges. Two Interface Geriatricians were appointed to perform various innovative roles across the boundaries of primary and secondary care and to improve patient experience by moving care closer to home.Innovation: Interface Geriatricians provide early Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) by consulting in ED for four sessions per week. We aim to reduce unnecessary admissions from the ED by accessing alternative pathways where appropriate e.g. Intermediate Care or early Geriatric outpatient review. Referral criteria include medically stable frail older people experiencing a change in physical or cognitive function and/or complex co-morbidities. Cases are identified by ED clinicians, the Geriatrician, or the Early Discharge Assessment Team (EDAT) – a team of senior nurses and therapists experienced in arranging complex discharges.Evaluation: During the first year of the service, 534 patients were assessed during 146 sessions• 58%of selected patients were discharged from ED – this compares favourably with previous discharge rates from ED for frail older people of 20-33%.• A further 12% of patients were suitable for discharge but were admitted due to delays accessing community services or investigations.• Only 27% of selected patients needed admission for medical reasons.• The readmission rate was similar to the departmental rate of 20%.• A small reduction in the time waiting to be seen in ED for patients of all ages was demonstrated.Conclusions: Our innovative, high quality service is avoiding unnecessary admissions with their associated risks and cost. Feedback from ED staff, EDAT and patients regarding our service has been extremely positive. We are developing strong relationships with the ED team and EDAT, extending our influence outside of our allocated sessions and championing the individualised care of frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>With anticipated greater demand for formal care services globally, this article examines the sociodemographic and health characteristics of frail older people in receipt of community support. Data were collected from audits of case files of older people receiving care management at two time points during which two government policy initiatives were implemented to promote greater standardization in health and social care provision for older people in England. Findings at Time 2 revealed that there were higher levels of physical and mental impairment and more health care assessments undertaken. There was a slight decrease in home care receipt but a marginal increase of more intensive home care provision. Service users living with a carer were less likely to receive home care but more likely to receive respite care or day care than those living alone. The policy goal of widening access to specialist health and social care services for older people with mental health problems was achieved. Guidance that focused eligibility criteria on the identification of older people with complex needs required the availability of appropriate support and services. Irrespective of policy initiatives, the sociodemographic characteristics of older people and the availability of informal support are principal determinants of service provision.</ab>

        <ab>The Affordable Care Act directed Medicare to update its home health prospective payment system to reflect more recent data on costs and use of services—an exercise known as rebasing. As a result, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will reduce home health payments 3.5 percent per year in the period 2014–17. To determine the impact that these reductions could have on beneficiaries using home health care, we examined the Medicare reimbursement margins and the use of services in a national sample of 96,621 episodes of care provided by twenty-six not-for-profit home health agencies in 2011. We found that patients with clinically complex conditions and social vulnerability factors, such as living alone, had substantially higher service delivery costs than other home health patients. Thus, the socially vulnerable patients with complex conditions represent less profit—lower-to-negative Medicare margins—for home health agencies. This financial disincentive could reduce such patients’ access to care as Medicare payments decline. Policy makers should consider the unique characteristics of these patients and ensure their continued access to Medicare’s home health services when planning rebasing and future adjustments to the prospective payment system.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To explore the benefits and shortcomings of using standardised work methods in home care nursing. Background Health care is increasingly shaped by the use of standardised work methods. This trend is reflected in the use of management tools aimed at monitoring service quality and efficiency, as well as in the evidence-based movement that has led to a shift in focus from the practitioner to the knowledge found in guidelines and clinical protocols. This study addressed the impact of this development on home care services. Design This is an ethnographic study involving fieldwork in home care nursing in Iceland. Methods The study took place in one neighbourhood in an urban area in Iceland in 2010. Members of five of six home care nursing teams agreed to participate. Team leaders were observed during visits to older person's homes and at team and interdisciplinary meetings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the team leaders and 15 older persons. Results The results were presented as three themes: For it all to hang together, which referred to attempts on behalf of the team leaders to coordinate complex services and assistance for the benefit of each patient; Working with more advanced cases, which reflected the uptake of standardised methods to address health matters locally; and Being heard, which reflects the politics of using standardised methods. Conclusions Standardised work methods can be helpful and are welcomed by home care nurses as long as they can also use their own discretion and draw on other forms of knowledge when needed. Relevance to clinical practice This study brought out the importance of flexibility in home care practice. Standardised work methods are welcomed and seen as helpful as long as they can be used based on the discretion of the practitioner.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Purpose: Frailty is a significant challenge for health care. Therefore, it is important to identify frail individuals. Theoretical Framework: The Vulnerability/Risk/ Human Response/Care Model. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a measure to identify frail older adults. Methods: Instrument development encompassed the following: delineation of content domains, item generation, content validity, quantitative content validity analysis, and psychometric analysis. Results: Findings indicated the following: (a) Frailty is a complex concept, (b) the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE) is composed of 10 items, (c) FIFE was able to predict depression, and (d) FIFE was able to differentiate differences in demographic profiles by social support environment. Conclusions: FIFE is a valid instrument. FIFE can be used to study the relationships among frailty determinants, provide standardized measurement, and develop and measure interventional studies.</ab>

        <ab>Improving hospital care for frail older people requires expertise, leadership and resources as these patients have multiple complex needs. One innovative solution to providing the skilled care necessary is to train experienced nurses to become advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs). Such roles encompass activity previously undertaken by medical staff, together with leadership, teaching, research and service development. Skills specific to caring for older people, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, are also required. This article discusses the need for ANPs in this clinical area, a pilot that is under way in one acute trust to develop these roles, and the potential benefits and challenges that may accompany this development.</ab>

        <ab>In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To gain insight into which factors impede, and which facilitate, the implementation of a complex multi-component improvement initiative in hospitalized older patients.Design: A qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews. The three dimensions of Pettigrew and Whipp's theoretical framework, namely, Process, Content and Context, were used to undertake a structured data analysis.Setting: The study was conducted in 19 Dutch hospitals implementing the Frail Elderly Project.Participants: Sixty-five members of staff, including physicians, nurses and members of the policy team.Intervention: The Frail Elderly Project, a Dutch quality improvement program, aims to decrease adverse events in frail older hospitalized people by implementing screening instruments and interventions targeting delirium, falls, malnutrition and physical impairment.Main Outcome Measures: The management of the process of implementation, participants' opinions of the program elements and contextual factors which influence the implementation.Results: Barriers to implementation included two process factors (insufficient involvement of clinicians and lack of time), two content factors (having divergent objectives and concerns about recommended program elements) and two contextual factors (a lack of knowledge of delirium and minimal insight into the purposes and effects of the program). Facilitating factors included one process factor (leadership), one content factor (flexibility in choosing methods) and two contextual factors (the program's guidance and the use of digital patient records).Conclusion: We identified the barriers and the factors which facilitate implementing complex multi-component improvement programs concerning care for older patients. These barriers must be resolved in future improvement programs in order to ensure successful implementation.</ab>

        <ab>This study identifies factors that affect decisions people make regarding whether they want to receive life-sustaining treatment. It is an interpretive-descriptive study based on qualitative data from three focus groups (N = 23), representing a diverse population in central Pennsylvania. Study sites included a suburban senior center serving a primarily White, middle-class population; an urban senior center serving a frail, underserved, African American population; and a breast cancer support group. The most important factors affecting whether participants wished to receive life-sustaining medical treatment were prognosis, expected quality of life, burden to others, burden to oneself in terms of the medical condition and treatment, and effect on mental functioning and independence. Our findings contribute to the knowledge of the complex factors that influence how people make decisions about advance care planning and life-sustaining treatments. This understanding is critical if nurses are to translate the patient's goals, values, and preferences into an actionable medical plan.

        <ab>The author describes how a palliative approach to care addresses the complex issues that frail older people may face toward the end of their lives. She cites a report from the Care Quality Commission on the state of health care and adult social care in England which identified that end-of-life care for frail people needs improving. She discusses ways on how palliative nursing can make a positive contribution to the care of frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>"Social change is slow; it requires persistence over time, one person, one action at a time. We are still working to realize the promise of Title IX." - Donna A. Lopiano, Executive Director Women's Sports Foundation 2002. Strong scientific evidence, based on a wide range of studies, shows that physically active people have higher levels of health-related fitness, a lower risk profile for developing a number of disabling medical conditions and lower rates of various chronic diseases than do people who are inactive.1,2,3 A large body of literature indicates that increases in physical activity and in turn fitness, are associated with improvements in health status.3,4 Regular physical activity has particularly significant health benefits such as maintaining independent living among older adults, yet persons over the age of 50 are among the most sedentary group of the population.5,6 Older women's participation in physical activity is suboptimal; for example, only 18% of women aged 45-64 years and 11% of women aged 65-74 years engage in strength training two or more times a week.2 Older women's attitudes towards physical activity are complex, arising from the interplay between psychological, social, environmental and economic factors.7 Physical activity and sport are social institutions that have developed within the backdrop of gender discrimination.8, 9 Systematic discrimination against girls and women is evident historically in social processes of socialization to sports participation, portrayal of gender in sports participation media images, females' access to sport and resources available to girls and women for physical activity and sport.8, 9 For example, until 1972 women were not allowed to run in marathons in North America.9 Changes to gender discrimination in sport in the US were catalyzed by the endorsement of Title IX (1972), the Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act that states in part: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance...”10 Thus, the current cohort of older women lived during formative years in which there was systematic gender discrimination in physical activity and sport. This exclusion further underpins the complex interaction between the social environmental and economic factors that are barriers to older women's participation in physical activity. The health benefits of physical activity have been explored in the literature for several decades. Citing articles published in the late 1980s and early 1990s Fletcher et al.,11 note that “developing and maintaining aerobic endurance, joint flexibility and muscle strength is important in a comprehensive exercise program, especially as people age.” These authors point out that elderly men and women show comparable gains in health benefits when adhering to exercise training, both resistance and aerobic endurance training. Weuve, Kang, Manson, Bretyler, Ware &amp; Grodstein,12 conducted a longitudinal study using the Nurse’s Health Study data and showed that long-term regular physical activity, including walking, improved cognitive functioning and reduced cognitive decline in women 70-81 years. Almost a quarter of a century ago, findings from a study by Fiatarone et al., pointed to the importance of high-resistance weight training regardless of age by showing significant gains in muscle strength, size and functional mobility among frail residents of nursing homes up to 96 years of age.13 Findings indicated that strength training is even more important as individuals' age to improve functional capability and maintain community independence.14 Research has consistently demonstrated the benefits of physical activity to cognitive functioning in older adults.15 In 2001, 60% of the 56 million deaths annually and 47% of the global burden of disease were attributable to the risk factors of physical activity and diet; key risk factors for non-communicable diseases.16,17 Physical activity and diet have both a combined and separate effect on health. The burden of death and disability related to non-communicable diseases is greatest and continuing to grow in developing countries, while in developed countries, the overall burden of non-communicable diseases remains high.17,18,19 Rates of non-communicable diseases are increasing at an alarming rate globally.20 Recognizing that unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are the main risk factors for non-communicable diseases, regional consultations with UN member coun intergovernmental bodies, representatives of civil society and the private sector were held to develop a strategy for risk reduction for these risk factors.19,17 The goal of the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was to “promote and protect health by guiding the development of an enabling environment for sustainable actions at individual, community, national and global levels that when taken together will lead to reduced disease and death rates related to healthy diet and physical activity”.17 The WHO Strategy is inclusive of people across the life–span. Health benefits of physical activity for older adults include reduced risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, colon cancer, breast cancer and depression.21 It is notable that physical activity endows participants with physical, emotional and mental health benefits.22 As data accumulates about global health, the focus remains on the salience of physical activity to health. In 2008, the 61st World Health Assembly endorsed a resolution to implement the 2004 WHO Strategy, providing evidence-based recommendations for physical activity to guide implementation across all age groups and in diverse economic societies including low and middle income countries.21 Physical activity programs targeting older persons have been shown to improve health and physical activity levels in this population.5,6 In a critical review of 29 empirical studies, King, Resjeski and Buchner,5 concluded that there are a number of gaps in the current physical activity literature. In their discussion, the authors recommend undertaking systematic reviews of the literature to determine how best to design physical activity interventions targeting diverse subgroups of older adults. A search of both the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews and the Joanna Briggs Institute Library has been conducted. No systematic reviews of randomized controlled studies to promote physical activity for healthy older women living independently in the community are evident in the literature. However, a systematic review of the effects of physical activity in randomized controlled trials in healthy and “at risk” older adults has been registered with PROSPERO and was completed in December 2011.23 This review did not examine programs that specifically focus on healthy older women and address the unique challenges that contribute to their physical inactivity. The proposed systematic review fulfils all requirements for the PROSPERO data base. Definitions Physical activity is defined as: “Movement that increases heart rate and breathing and any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure”.24 In this systematic review, physical activity is defined as activities that focus on promoting bodily movement. This will include multior single-component programs: strength, balance, flexibility, aerobic fitness, yoga, tai chi, walking (pole walking), running, gardening, skiing, bicycling, swimming, dancing, and Wii fit (a popular computer game).25 Limits will not be imposed on duration or intensity of the physical activity intervention. A physical activity intervention is defined as an organized initiative or structured program designed to promote increased physical activity.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines specific to the medical care of frail older adults have yet to be widely disseminated. Because of the complex conditions associated with frailty, guidelines for frail older patients should be based on careful consideration of the characteristics of this population, balanced against the benefits and harms associated with treatment. In response to this need, the Diabetes Care Program of Nova Scotia (DCPNS) collaborated with the Palliative and Therapeutic Harmonization (PATH) program to develop and disseminate guidelines for the treatment of frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The DCPNS/PATH guidelines are unique in that they recommend the following: [1.] Maintain HbA1c at or above 8% rather than below a specific level, in keeping with the conclusion that lower HbA1c levels are associated with increased hypoglycemic events without accruing meaningful benefit for frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The guideline supports a wide range of acceptable HbA1c targets so that treatment decisions can focus on whether to aim for HbA1c levels between 8% and 9% or within a higher range (ie, &gt;9% and &lt;12%) based on individual circumstances and symptoms. [2.] Simplify treatment by administering basal insulin alone and avoiding administration of regular and rapid-acting insulin when feasible. This recommendation takes into account the variations in oral intake that are commonly associated with frailty. [3.] Use neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin instead of long-acting insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine (Lantus) or insulin detemir (Levemir), as insulin analogues do not appear to provide clinically meaningful benefit but are significantly more costly. [4.] With acceptance of more liberalized blood glucose targets, there is no need for routine blood glucose testing when oral hypoglycemic medications or well-established doses of basal insulin (used alone) are not routinely changed as a result of blood glucose testing. Although these recommendations may appear radical, they are based on careful review of research findings.</ab>

        <ab>The complexities associated with aging challenge advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to ensure that each patient receives an individualized evaluation. Determining whether the patient should remain in an independent or alternative living environment must be based on respect for the individual's right to self-determination and on the evidence, including assessment of biological, social, and cognitive resources. This determination also must be communicated in a clear and appropriate manner to the patient and family. This article describes the nature of this decision, appropriate assessment strategies, and legal considerations for the APRN who works with elderly patients and their families.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and practice nurses regarding the U- CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. Background Care for older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. Design An explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. Methods The barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and expectations regarding the U- CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires sent to all participating general practitioners ( n = 32) and practice nurses ( n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. Results Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to provide structured care. Conclusion This explanatory mixed-methods study showed that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U- CARE programme as feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care towards a proactive and preventive care approach.</ab>

        <ab>Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by older people, both with and without chronic disease. It is unpleasant and distressing and can affect functioning and quality of life. Fatigue also may inhibit an older person from participating optimally in a physical therapy program aimed at rehabilitation or the promotion of better health. However, confusion surrounds the concept of self-reported aging-related fatigue, not only because of the complexity of the problem itself but also because of lack of clarity of definition and the use of the term 'fatigue' to describe a range of different concepts. This article aims to provide clarification of the concept in the context of physical therapist clinical practice. The intention is to increase awareness of the issue among physical therapists, promoting their assessment and consideration of the problem when planning health interventions involving functioning, physical activity, and exercise for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated. Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design. Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands. Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded. Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions. Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. Methods The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. Findings Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. Conclusions Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice. Clinical Relevances The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is challenging for many older adults. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination and technology. Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. Setting: Older adults having difficulty in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. Methods: All participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. Discussion: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Frail older patients suffer from multiple, complex needs that often go unmet in an acute care setting. Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated “sub-acute” frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants (n = 62) required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose -- The authors aim to present findings from their research on the implementation of Unified Assessment (UA) policy and the work of care coordinators who oversee the delivery of support to older people with complex needs. Design/methodology/approach -- A mixed methods approach included staff interviews (n 95) and focus groups (n = 3). Findings -- The care coordinator role is controversial and the lack of common terminology across health and social care obscures its importance. It is seen as a social care responsibility. Limited ownership amongst healthcare professionals leads to tensions in practice. The challenges of breaking down silo thinking embedded in established professional practices are highlighted as are infrastructural and capacity deficits. Disparities between policy intentions and practice means that UA is failing to meet core objectives relating to the delivery of seamless support. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to develop and evaluate evidence-informed interventions that test solutions to the problems faced in practice and support the delivery of more effective arrangements. Practical implications -- Practice development may be supported by: guidelines that are more prescriptive and include a formal role definition; joint training to promote shared understanding of key concepts; investment in administrative and IT infrastructures; and more coordinated direction at strategic level. Originality/value -- Over a decade has elapsed since the publication of UA Policy Guidance; however, there is limited published evidence on the effectiveness of UA policy and its translation into practice.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To better understand the antibiotic prescribing process in assisted living ( AL) communities given the growing rate of antibiotic resistance. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Four AL communities in North Carolina. Participants Assisted living residents who received antibiotics (n = 30) from October 20, 2010, to March 31, 2011, a primary family member, staff, and the prescribing medical provider. Measurements Semistructured interviews that were conducted regarding prescribing included the information available at the time of prescribing and the perceptions of the quality of communication between providers, staff, residents and family members about the resident. Providers were asked an open-ended question regarding how to improve the communication process related to antibiotic prescribing for AL residents. Results For the 30 residents who received antibiotic prescriptions, providers often had limited information about the case and lacked familiarity with the residents, the residents' families, and staff. They also felt that cases were less severe and less likely to require an antibiotic than did residents, families, and staff. Providers identified several ways to improve the communication process, including better written documentation and staff and family presence. Conclusion In a small sample of AL communities, providers faced an array of challenges in making antibiotic prescribing decisions. This work confirms the complex nature of antibiotic prescribing in AL communities and indicates that further work is needed to determine how to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric medicine has an encyclopaedic sweep, reflecting the complexity of both the ageing process and of our patient group. Keeping up with, and making sense of, the relevant scientific literature is challenging, especially as ageing has increased in prominence as a focus of research across many branches of the sciences and the humanities. This review of research published in 2012 in generalist, geriatric medicine and gerontology journals has been compiled with a view to extracting those aspects of research into ageing which could be considered relevant not only to the practice of geriatric medicine, but also to our understanding of the ageing process and the relationship of geriatric medicine to other medical specialties and public health. The research discussed includes new insights into global ageing and the compression of morbidity; nosological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of dementia; an innovative study on the microbiome and ageing; epidemiological perspectives into multi-morbidity; an overview of the impact of the first waves of Baby Boomers; fresh thinking on geriatric syndromes such as orthostatic hypotension, kyphosis, urinary incontinence after stroke, frailty and elder abuse; an update of the Beers criteria and the first stirrings of recognition of the longevity dividend in the biomedical literature.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: While some people remain fit and active as they grow older, others experience complex problems: disease, dependency and disability. Frailty is a term used to describe this latter group, capturing differences in health status among older people. Many frail older people have multiple chronic co-morbidities and functional impairments and, according to guidelines for the management of individual conditions, should be prescribed long lists of medications. However, older people (particularly those who are frail) are often excluded from drug trials, and treatment decisions are therefore based on evidence extrapolated from more robust patient groups with fewer physiological deficits. The risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) increases with increasing patient frailty, and polypharmacy has negative consequences above and beyond the risks of individual drugs. Increasing numbers of medications are associated with a higher likelihood of non-adherence and a significantly greater risk of ADRs. Older people taking five or more medications are at higher risk of delirium and falls, independent of medication indications. Methods: This is a short review of the different approaches to defining and measuring frailty. We summarise the factors contributing to ADRs in frail older people and describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics changes associated with ageing and frailty. By considering goals of care for frail older people, we explore how the appropriateness of medication prescribing for older people could be improved. Conclusion: Since all physicians are likely to provide care for this group of vulnerable patients, understanding the concept of frailty may help to optimise medication prescribing for older people. The incorporation of frailty measures into future clinical studies of drug effects and pharmacokinetics is important if we are to improve medication use and guide drug doses for fit and frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Due to the ageing of the population, the number of frail older people who suffer from multiple, complex health complaints increases and this ultimately threatens their ability to function independently. Many interventions for frail older people attempt to prevent or delay functional decline, but they show contradicting results. Recent studies emphasise the importance of embedding these interventions into existing primary care systems and tailoring care to older people's needs and wishes. This article presents the design of an evaluation study, aiming to investigate the effects and feasibility of the early detection of health problems among community-dwelling older people and their subsequent referral to appropriate care and/or well-being facilities by general practices.Methods/design: A longitudinal, quasi-experimental study is designed comparing 13 intervention practices with 11 control practices. General practices select eligible community-dwelling older people (≥ 75 years). Practice nurses from intervention practices (1) visit older people at home for a comprehensive assessment of their health and well-being; (2) discuss results with the GP; (3) formulate - if required - a care and treatment plan together with the patient; (4) refer patient to care and/or well-being facilities; and (5) monitor and coordinate care and follow-up. Control practices provide usual care and match the intervention practices on the presence of different primary care professionals within the practice. Primary outcome measures are health-related quality of life and disability. Additionally, attitude towards ageing, care satisfaction, health care utilisation, nursing home admission and mortality are measured. Some outcomes are assessed by means of a postal questionnaire (at baseline and after 6, 12, and 18 months follow-up), others through continuous registration over the 18-month period. A profound process evaluation will provide insight into barriers and facilitators for implementing the intervention protocol within general practices from both the patient and caregiver perspective.Discussion: The proposed approach requires redesigning care delivery within general practices for accomplishing appropriate care for older people. A quasi-experimental design is chosen to closely resemble a real-life situation, which is desirable for future implementation after this innovation proves to be successful. Results of the effect and process evaluation will become available in 2013.Trial Registration: The Netherlands National Trial Register NTR2737.</ab>

        <ab>This qualitative cross-sectional study examines autonomy among long-term care residents and how certified nurse aides (CNAs) understand resident autonomy as expressed through residents' preferences. The study took place at one long-term care facility with N = 12 (7 residents and 5 CNAs). A phenomenological perspective is utilized in order to describe the meaning residents ascribe to personal preferences and the influence frailty has on those preferences. In addition, certified nurse aides, self-described as competent to report on a participating resident's preferences were interviewed separately. Open-ended interviews were conducted and the data obtained was examined for congruence between the resident's and CNA's perception of resident autonomy. Congruence and incongruence was examined as well within the individual resident interviews and within dyads.Findings indicate that resident autonomy as expressed in resident preferences is subjective, complex, durable, fluid, and in some instances, a rigid phenomenon. Long-standing preferences can endure and new preferences can evolve. Resident frailty can influence resident preferences to change and in some instances, reinforce a preference. Resident preferences can evolve from care giving interactions between the resident and CNA. Findings also indicate that CNA perception or understanding of resident autonomy often involves an intuitive process and is subjective in nature. Implications for social work are discussed including interdisciplinary opportunities in long-term care for social work and the nursing profession.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: : Examination of prevalence of depressive symptoms among older persons in home care (HC) and complex continuing care (CCC) hospitals/units, factors associated with depressive symptoms in those settings, and rate of antidepressant use among older persons with depressive symptoms. DESIGN: : Observational study using data from interRAI assessments used in normal clinical practice. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the frail elderly and treatment approaches were described. SETTINGS: : Fourteen HC agencies and 134 CCC hospitals/units in Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: : Older persons (N = 191,9871) aged 65 years and older, including 114,497 persons from HC and 77,490 persons from CCC. MEASUREMENT: : Data were collected using Resident Assessment Instrument 2.0 (RAI 2.0) (1996-2004) in CCC and Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care (RAI-HC) (2003-2004) in HC. RESULTS: : Prevalence of depressive symptoms among older HC enrollees was lower (12.0%) than in CCC (23.6%). It decreased significantly with age in HC (to about 6% in those older than 95 years) but there were not substantial age differences in CCC. Common factors associated with depressive symptoms in both types of care were cognitive impairment, instability of health, daily pain, disability in activities of daily living; however, advanced age lost its protective effect in CCC. Less than half of the persons in HC and CCC with depressive symptoms were treated with antidepressants and their use decreased with age. CONCLUSIONS: : Undertreatment of depressive symptoms among older persons remains a serious problem. Learning more about factors associated with depressive symptoms among the oldest old might improve detection and treatment of depression.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To examine the relationship between ingestive skill performance while eating and drinking and frailty status in acutely-hospitalized elderly patients and to examine whether there is a relationship between the proportion of ingestive skill difficulties and Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) and discharge destination. Methods: Frail (n = 64) and robust (n = 40) acutely-hospitalized elderly patients were assessed using The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment. Results: Forty-three ingestive skills were significantly more affected in frail patients (21.9% to 95.3%) versus robust patients (2.5% to 65.0%). When adjusting for frailty status, difficulties in self-feeding and texture management were related to prolonged LOS, and difficulties in positioning and liquid ingestion were related to discharge to institutional care. Conclusion: Ingestive skill difficulties among acutely-hospitalized frail elderly patients were frequent and characterized by great complexity. This necessitates a broad range of management strategies related to the patients' ability in positioning, self-feeding skills, as well as oropharyngeal sensorimotor skills.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The elderly population in Sweden is increasing. This will lead to an increased need for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance personnel to understand and meet these patients’ care needs. Using a caring science approach, we apply the patient’s perspective, and the aim of this study is to identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the assessment category “general affected health condition”. Thus, we have analyzed the characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state of “general affected health condition”, as either illness or ill-health. This offers a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the concept of frailty ought to be included in “The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems” (ICD-10).</ab>

        <ab>In the treatment of chronic malignant and non-malignant pain, opioids are used as strong analgesics. Frail elderly patients often have multiple comorbidities and use multiple medicines, leading to an increased risk of clinically relevant drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Age-related changes and increased frailty may lead to a less predictable drug response, increased drug sensitivity, and potential harmful drug effects. As a result, physicians face a complex task in prescribing medication to elderly patients. In this review, the appropriateness of the strong-acting opioids buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone and tapentadol is determined for use in elderly patients. Evidence-based recommendations for prescribing strong opioids to the frail elderly are presented. A literature search was performed for all individual drugs, using a validated and published set of 23 criteria concerning effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, experience, and convenience in elderly patients. First, information on the criteria was obtained from pharmaceutical reference books and a MEDLINE search. The information obtained on the individual drugs in the class of opioids was compared with the reference drug morphine. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated on the basis of the pros and cons for the frail elderly. Using the set of 23 criteria, no differentiation can be made between the appropriateness of buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine and oxycodone for use in elderly patients. Methadone has strong negative considerations in the treatment of chronic pain in the frail elderly. Methadone has a high drug-drug interaction potential and is associated with prolongation of the QT interval and a potential risk of accumulation due to a long elimination half-life. In addition, methadone is difficult to titrate because of its large inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics, particularly in the frail elderly. Because of a lack of empiric knowledge, the use of tapentadol is not recommended in frail elderly persons. Nevertheless, tapentadol may prove to be a useful analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain in frail elderly persons because of its possible better gastrointestinal tolerability. In the treatment of chronic pain in the frail elderly, the opioids of first choice are buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine and oxycodone. In order to improve the convenience for elderly patients, the controlled- release oral dosage forms and transdermal formulations are preferred.</ab>

        <ab>The interRAI Acute Care is a comprehensive geriatric assessment tool that provides a holistic picture of complex and frail hospitalized older persons. It is designed to support holistic care planning and to transfer patient data across settings. Its usefulness in clinical decision making depends on the extent to which clinicians can rely on the patient data as accurate and meaningful indicators of patients functioning. But its multidimensional character implies challenges for clinimetric testing as some of the traditional analyses techniques cannot be unconditionally applied. The objective was to present an overview of methods to examine the reliability of the interRAI Acute Care. For each line of evidence, examples of hypotheses and research questions are listed.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (&lt;4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (&lt;4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>At Leicester Royal Infirmary, the care of frail older people occupies a disproportionate amount of emergency department (ED) staff's time and resources. Too few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as possible. This article describes how the unit operates.</ab>

        <ab>With anticipated greater demand for formal care services globally, this article examines the sociodemographic and health characteristics of frail older people in receipt of community support. Data were collected from audits of case files of older people receiving care management at two time points during which two government policy initiatives were implemented to promote greater standardization in health and social care provision for older people in England. Findings at Time 2 revealed that there were higher levels of physical and mental impairment and more health care assessments undertaken. There was a slight decrease in home care receipt but a marginal increase of more intensive home care provision. Service users living with a carer were less likely to receive home care but more likely to receive respite care or day care than those living alone. The policy goal of widening access to specialist health and social care services for older people with mental health problems was achieved. Guidance that focused eligibility criteria on the identification of older people with complex needs required the availability of appropriate support and services. Irrespective of policy initiatives, the sociodemographic characteristics of older people and the availability of informal support are principal determinants of service provision.</ab>

        <ab>Background: With increasing age and longevity, the rising number of frail elders with complex and numerous health-related needs demands a coordinated health care delivery system integrating cure, care and welfare. Studies on the effectiveness of such comprehensive chronic care models targeting frail elders show inconclusive results. The CareWell-primary care program is a complex intervention targeting community-dwelling frail elderly people, that aims to prevent functional decline, improve quality of life, and reduce or postpone hospital and nursing home admissions of community dwelling frail elderly. Methods/design: The CareWell-primary care study includes a (cost-) effectiveness study and a comprehensive process evaluation. In a one-year pragmatic, cluster controlled trial, six general practices are non-randomly recruited to adopt the CareWell-primary care program and six control practices will deliver 'care as usual'. Each practice includes a random sample of fifty frail elders aged 70 years or above in the cost-effectiveness study. A sample of patients and informal caregivers and all health care professionals participating in the CareWell-primary care program are included in the process evaluation. In the cost-effectiveness study, the primary outcome is the level of functional abilities as measured with the Katz-15 index. Hierarchical mixed-effects regression models / multilevel modeling approach will be used, since the study participants are nested within the general practices. Furthermore, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated as costs per QALY gained and as costs weighed against functional abilities. In the process evaluation, mixed methods will be used to provide insight in the implementation degree of the program, patients' and professionals' approval of the program, and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. Discussion: The CareWell-primary care study will provide new insights into the (cost-) effectiveness, feasibility, and barriers and facilitators for implementation of this complex intervention in primary care.</ab>

        <ab>Frailty is a term often used to describe a subset of older adults with multiple system impairment superimposed on the aging process due to chronic and/or acute disease. This population is particularly vulnerable to stressors that increase morbidity and mortality. The health trajectory of frail older adults is of a slow decline, with steadily progressive disability. Although frail adults are a small cohort of the older adult population, they disproportionately represent the majority of consumers within the health care system and as recipients of nursing care. As the older adult population increases, society will experience the burden of increasing numbers of frail older adults.An emergent problem is the fragmented perspectives on the pathophysiology and multifactorial nature of frailty. Lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty has hindered the ability to establish guidelines to describe older adults as frail and identify individuals as frail or at risk for frailty. A valid frailty instrument would allow for the ability to initiate intervention programs to minimize risk of poor outcomes. Without the ability to assess older adults for frailty, effective management, coordination of health team member efforts, and conducting and applying research to prevent the downward trajectory of disability and mortality will be thwarted. To date there are no published studies that have utilized holistic research datasets to measure frailty in older adults.The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a measure to identify frail older adults.The study was designed as an instrument development for a multidimensional measure for frail older adults. Instrument development included psychometric testing through the use of secondary analysis of data derived from an on-going longitudinal prospective descriptive study.The Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE) as developed through a rigorous instrument development process is a robust measure to identify frailty risk factors in older adults. The instrument is conceptually sound with excellent content validity. Study findings indicated four points. First, frailty is a complex concept and requires factors from multiple health domains for measurement. Second, the FIFE is comprised of 10 items representing five health domains. Third, the FIFE was able to predict depression in both sample groups. Fourth, the final frailty model (FIFE) was able to differentiate differences in demographic profiles by social support environment.Through this study, an important gap in the literature was addressed: the development of a valid instrument to assess frailty through the use of holistic research datasets. FIFE items can easily be extrapolated from most nursing research and clinical datasets. A valid frailty instrument allows for the identification of health factors that predispose an older adult to frailty and development of preventative and treatment interventions that are evidence-based and cost-effective in regards to finances and quality of life outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Prior studies measuring fidelity of complex interventions have mainly evaluated adherence, and not taken factors affecting adherence into consideration. A need for studies that clarify the concept of fidelity and the function of factors moderating fidelity has been emphasized. The aim of the study was to systematically evaluate implementation fidelity and possible factors influencing fidelity of a complex care continuum intervention for frail elderly people.Methods: The intervention was a systematization of the collaboration between a nurse with geriatric expertise situated at the emergency department, the hospital ward staff, and a multi-professional team with a case manager in the municipal care services for older people. Implementation was evaluated between September 2008 and May 2010 with observations of work practices, stakeholder interviews, and document analysis according to a modified version of The Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity.Results: A total of 16 of the 18 intervention components were to a great extent delivered as planned, while some new components were added to the model. No changes in the frequency or duration of the 18 components were observed, but the dose of the added components varied over time. Changes in fidelity were caused in a complex, interrelated fashion by all the moderating factors in the framework, i.e., context, staff and participant responsiveness, facilitation, recruitment, and complexity.Discussion: The Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity was empirically useful and included comprehensive measures of factors affecting fidelity. Future studies should focus on developing the framework with regard to how to investigate relationships between the moderating factors and fidelity over time.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01260493.</ab>

        <ab>More than 1.5 million adults live in US nursing homes, and approximately 30% of individuals in the United States will die with a nursing home as their last place of residence. Physicians play a pivotal role in the rehabilitation, complex medical care, and end-of-life care of this frail and vulnerable population. The reasons for admission are multifactorial and a comprehensive care plan based on the Minimum Data Set guides the multidisciplinary nursing home team in the care of the patient and provides assessments of the quality of care provided. Using the cases of 2 patients with different experiences, we describe the physician's role in planning for admission, participating as a team member in the ongoing assessment and care in the nursing home, and guiding care at the end of life. The increasing population of older adults has also promoted community-based and residential alternatives to traditional nursing homes. The future of long-term care will include additional challenges and rich innovations in services and options for older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background Although it is widely recognised that frail older persons need adaptation of healthcare services, it is unclear how hospital care in general can best be tailored to their frailty. Objective To systematically review the evidence for hospital-wide interventions for older patients. Methods PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cinahl and reference lists of included articles (1980-2009) were searched. Papers describing (1) randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-after studies or interrupted time series, (2) patients &gt;=65years admitted to hospital, (3) hospital-wide organisational interventions, and (4) patient-related outcomes, quality of care, patient safety, resource use or costs were included. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently, according to Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group guidelines. Results The authors included 20 articles out of 1175. The mean age of the study populations ranged from 74.2 to 85.8years. Interventions included multidisciplinary (consultative) teams, nursing care models, structural changes in physical environment and/or changes in site of service delivery. Small or no effects were found on patient-related outcomes such as functional performance, length of stay, discharge destination, resource use and costs compared with usual care. Methodological quality evaluation showed data incompleteness and contamination as main sources of bias. Conclusions No single best hospital-wide intervention could be identified using strict methodological criteria. However, several interventions had positive results, and may be used in hospital practice. Since strict methodological designs are not optimal for evaluating highly complex interventions and settings, the authors recommend studying hospital-wide interventions for older persons using adapted quality and research criteria.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a scoping review of research on cognitive impairment in older adults who visit Emergency Departments of acute care hospitals, followed by an integrative review that included a quality assessment to determine the effectiveness of interventions for this population. Background. Being old and cognitively impaired in the Emergency Department -- a fast-paced intervention system -- is a complex phenomenon that challenges many healthcare professionals. The rise in the incidence and prevalence of dementia will have a large impact on healthcare systems. Data sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, AgeLine, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2008, for qualitative or quantitative studies reporting extractable data on delirium or dementia in non-institutionalized older people (65+ years) in the Emergency Department. Review methods. Titles screened by a project researcher and checked against inclusion criteria by another researcher. Two reviewers completed independent data extraction and synthesis of included studies. Quality assessment occurred using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tools. Results. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for integrative review. Analysis of these studies indicates that the prevalence of cognitive impairment is high and improvements are needed. Contextual details and relevant features of an appropriate intervention are poorly explained. Conclusion. Although the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment is recognized, appropriate interventions and programmatic responses remain elusive. Quality improvements require more thorough examination of emergency department context to identify modifiable influencing factors that are transferable across settings.</ab>

        <ab>New models of interprofessional working are continuously being proposed to address the burgeoning health and social care needs of older people with complex and long-term health conditions. Evaluations of the effectiveness of these models tend to focus on process measures rather than outcomes for the older person. This discussion paper argues that the concept of frailty, and measures based on it, may provide a more user-centred tool for the evaluation of interprofessional services -- a tool that cuts across unidisciplinary preoccupations and definitions of effectiveness. Numerous frailty scales have been developed for case identification and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes. We suggest that they may also be particularly suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of interprofessional working with community-dwelling older people. Several exemplars of frailty scales that might serve this purpose are identified, and their potential contributions and limitations are discussed. Further work is required to establish which is the most suitable scales for this application. The development of an appropriate frailty scale could provide an opportunity for interprofessional debate about the forms of care and treatment that should be prioritised to improve the health and well-being of this population.</ab>

        <ab>Older people, particularly those who are frail, are vulnerable to dehydration. Management of dehydration in older people can be more complex than in younger adults because of the physical effects of ageing. As the population ages, nurses will increasingly care for older patients in every setting. This article provides an overview of the physiological changes that affect the ability of older people to maintain a normal fluid balance. Risk factors for dehydration are reviewed and strategies for the prevention, detection and management of dehydration are discussed. The article focuses on subcutaneous fluid replacement for the management of dehydration in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background The growing demand on health services due to an ageing population and people living with complex chronic illnesses necessitates an integrated and evidence based care approach. In times of acute illness, trauma or difficult life situations, for many older people the Emergency Department is the first port of call. Despite the benefits of presenting to the Emergency Department, this environment can also be challenging for the older person, particularly those who are frail and have cognitive impairments. Emergency Department nurses play a pivotal role in tailoring the care of the older patient that specifically meets their needs, enhances their level of comfort and decreases the risk of additional distress unrelated to their presenting illness. Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to determine the best available evidence in relation to age-friendly nursing interventions in the management of older people presenting to the Emergency Department. Inclusion criteria Types of participants Participants considered for this systematic review included older people aged over 65 who were cared for in the Emergency Department Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest Nurse led interventions that enhanced older people's comfort during their stay in Emergency Department, specifically in relation to nutrition, hydration, pressure area care, pain management and communication. Types of studies Studies using quantitative research methods as well as opinion based papers were considered for this systematic review. Types of outcomes Outcomes were assessed in relation to the effectiveness of nursing interventions on pressure area status, hydration status, nutritional status and pain status measured during their stay in the Emergency Department. The text and opinion part of the review focused on the recommended policies for age-friendly nursing interventions. Search strategy An extensive search of the literature was undertaken to retrieve any English language material published and unpublished materials between January 1999 to October 2010. Methodological quality All included articles were assessed by two independent reviewers using the appropriate critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data collection Data were extracted from included papers using data extraction tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data synthesis Data were synthesised and pooled according to their methodological approach, using standardised JBI instruments. Due to the methodological diversity and limited data found, quantitative data were combined in narrative summary. A meta- synthesis was undertaken for the opinion based data. Results A total of 16 papers were included in the review, two research articles, seven expert opinion and another seven policy documents. This resulted in the identification of 39 findings, which were grouped into seven categories, which were further aggregated into two synthesised findings. Conclusions There is little high quality research in relation to effective nursing interventions in the management of older people in the Emergency Department. Identified strategies and interventions are predominately based on suggested practices, rather than based in rigorous research. This provides limited guidance to nurses working in ED Departments; however the expert opinion and other literature in this review strongly suggests that a focus on fundamental nursing interventions such as attention to skin integrity, nutrition and hydration, mobility, comfort, falls prevention and social support are important. Implications for research/practice Future research is urgently needed to identify the nursing needs of older people in the Emergency Department, and to evaluate the efficacy of nursing interventions to enhance outcomes for older people during and beyond their hospital stay.</ab>

        <ab>Structured clinical data generated using standardized terminologies such as the Omaha System are available for evaluating healthcare quality and patient outcomes. New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is needed and the level of care that is provided. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>

        <ab>Older people make extensive use of emergency departments, yet there is evidence that optimum care is difficult to provide for those with complex health and social problems. Inappropriate hospital admissions for older people have also been documented. This article describes the establishment of an assessment team for older people (ATOP) that has been created to address these issues in a district general hsopital. In the four months of the study period, the ATOP prevented admission of 178 of the 666 patients seen. Of these 178 patients, 19 re-attended the hospital and six were admitted.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the work of an acute assessment and liaison service for older people, including the role of the older people's apecialist nurse in the service. The service screens all patients admitted who are over the age of 75 for problems specific to a frail population and to identify where ongoing specialist support referral or advice is indicated. Patients with complex problems undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The service has reduced length of stay and resulted in better care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement. BACKGROUND: Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations. DESIGN: This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. METHODS: The convenience sample (n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. CONCLUSIONS: Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.</ab>

        <ab>Discharging frail older people from acute hospital settings has been an issue of concern for over 40 years and recent studies suggest that enduring problems remain. This paper explores the experiences of discharge from three different units: an acute surgical ward, an acute medical ward and a specialist ward for older people. Based on extensive data from interviews with older people, their family carers and ward-based staff, a grounded theory of the discharge experience is presented. This suggests that the quality of discharge hinges largely on whether the focus of efforts is on 'pace' (the desire to discharge older people as rapidly as possible) or 'complexity' (where due account is taken of the complex interaction of medical and wider social issues). When pace is the focus, 'pushing' and 'fixing' are the main processes driving discharge. However, when attention is given to complexity, far more subtle processes of 'informing' and 'brokering' are in evidence. These latter processes are conceived of as forms of 'relational practice' and it is argued that such practices lie at the heart of high quality care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>The primary aim of this article is to identify, from the perspective of primary care physicians and nurses, the challenges encountered in provision of health care to older adults and to identify potential roles, challenges, and benefits of integrating social workers into primary care teams. As more older adults live longer with multiple chronic conditions, primary care has been confronted with complex psychosocial problems that interact with medical problems pointing to a potential role for a social worker. From a policy perspective, the lack of strong evidence documenting the benefits that will accrue to patients and providers is a key barrier preventing the wider use of social workers in primary care. This article presents findings from three focus groups with primary care physicians and nurses to examine the perspectives of these key providers about the benefits and challenges of integrating social workers into the primary care team.</ab>

        <ab>The clinical approach toward elderly patients is often very complex and associated with an increased risk of medical errors. This case report is an example of how various objective (related to patient) and subjective (related to physicians) factors may influence the optimal diagnostic approach in elderly frail patients. We also discuss geriatric practice, which must be characterized by the intellectual honesty to refuse any sort of prejudices (such as ageism) and by the skill to navigate between the Scylla (ie, viewing clinical problems as unrelated to each other) and the Charibdy (ie, applying the Occam's razor principle) of the patient's complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric failure to thrive (GFTT) poses a complex clinical issue in gerontological nursing practice. GFTT is not a normal part of aging, nor is it an outcome of chronic illness. Rather, GFTT describes a lack of vitality and diminished capacity for life and outlines a process of functional decline that is often difficult to explain. The purpose of this article is to review GFTT, examine the literature on GFTT, and suggest strategies for the identification, assessment, and creative management of this complex condition that affects millions of older adults.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: In France, there is evidence to suggest that 50% of elderly individuals are prescribed psychotropic medications. However, it is known that use of these agents increases the risk of falls, fractures and delirium in older people. OBJECTIVE: To study the consumption of 'potentially inappropriate medication' (PIM) among patients aged &gt;/=75 years, paying particular attention to psychotropic drugs and the factors influencing the use of 'potentially inappropriate psychotropics' (PIPs). METHOD: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective multicentre cohort of 1306 hospitalized French patients aged &gt;/=75 years (the SAFEs [Sujet Agé Fragile: Evaluation et suivi (Frail Elderly Subjects: Evaluation and follow-up)] cohort). The present analysis involved the 1176 patients for whom there was information on the usual treatments being taken in the 2 weeks before hospitalization. The drugs were coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification; the Beers list as updated in 2003 defined which medications were considered PIPs. Standardized geriatric assessment variables were recorded on inclusion in the study. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors linked to use of psychotropics and PIPs. RESULTS: The mean number of drugs taken was 5.7 +/- 2.9 per patient. Twenty-eight percent of patients took at least one PIM. The number of patients who had taken at least one psychotropic drug in the 2 weeks before hospitalization (mean 1.6 +/- 0.9 psychotropics per patient) was 589 (50.1%). More than half of both the 510 patients with a depressive syndrome and the 543 patients affected by dementia were treated with psychotropics. Multivariate analysis showed that prescription of psychotropics was linked to the presence of a dementia syndrome (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.9; p = 0.03), the presence of a depressive syndrome (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.3, 2.1; p &lt; 0.001), living in an institution (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.5, 3.4; p &lt; 0.001), use of more than five drugs (OR = 3.2; 95% CI 2.5, 4.2; p &lt; 0.001) and Charlson's co-morbidity score &gt;1 (OR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.5, 0.8; p = 0.001). Nineteen percent of all psychotropics prescribed were PIPs. Of these PIPs, 66.5% were anxiolytics, 28.4% were antidepressants and 5.1% were antipsychotics. Use of PIPs in the multivariate analysis was associated only with consumption of more than five drugs (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.5; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION : PIM use is common among hospitalized older adults in France. The most important determinant of risk of receiving a psychotropic medication or a PIP was the number of drugs being taken. The elderly, who have multiple co-morbidities, complex chronic conditions and are usually receiving polypharmacy, are at increased risk for adverse drug events. These adverse events are often linked to problems that could be preventable such as delirium, depression and falls. Regular review of prescriptions would help optimize prescription of psychotropics in the elderly. The Beers list is a good tool for evaluating PIMs but is too restrictive with respect to psychotropics; in the latter respect, the list could usefully be widened.</ab>

        <ab>The numbers of frail older persons using emergency departments are already considerable and will continue to increase over time. There are a number of issues related to the assessment and care of older patients that are significantly different to other patient groups. The traditional emergency department (ED) model focusing on rapid triage, treatment and throughput does not meet the needs of many older patients, who have complex presentations, and require comprehensive assessment and referral. In response to this, there are already a number of appropriate and innovative approaches to the care of the older patient demonstrated in the literature. Nurses have a crucial role in contributing to these approaches and in raising the profile of quality care of the older person. Some specific areas that ED nurses can focus on include a more comprehensive approach to assessment and discharge planning, improved communication with the patient and their personal carers, attention to basic nursing care, and making the physical environment safer and less stressful for the older patient. While developing collaborations with their aged care nursing colleagues is important, emergency nurses need to view care of the older person as a central part of their own core business.</ab>

        <ab>This is a case study of two elderly, frail women in New York City who were recently rendered homeless. One woman had a massive tumor on her occipital scalp; the other was in renal failure. The obstacles and complexities of providing care to those with double jeopardy--being elderly and homeless--are described. There are enormous difficulties for placement into safe, supportive housing once people become homeless. The process is expensive and labor intensive. This can be complicated by the existence of mental illness. A New York agency that works with mentally ill homeless people is described. There are systemic obstacles as well: One woman loses her Medicaid when she moves from one state to another to be closer to her family. Another, 82 years old, is told to get a job so that she could qualify for Medicare. There are numerous contradictions and unnecessary costs in a fragmented health care system to which the obvious solution is a national single-payer system of care.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: In old age, reduction in physical function leads to loss of independence, the need for hospital and long-term nursing-home care, and premature death. We did a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of community-based complex interventions in preservation of physical function and independence in elderly people. METHODS: We searched systematically for randomised controlled trials assessing community-based multifactorial interventions in elderly people (mean age at least 65 years) living at home with at least 6 months of follow-up. Outcomes studied were living at home, death, nursing-home and hospital admissions, falls, and physical function. We did a meta-analysis of the extracted data. FINDINGS: We identified 89 trials including 97 984 people. Interventions reduced the risk of not living at home (relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.97). Interventions reduced nursing-home admissions (0.87, 0.83-0.90), but not death (1.00, 0.97-1.02). Risk of hospital admissions (0.94, 0.91-0.97) and falls (0.90, 0.86-0.95) were reduced, and physical function (standardised mean difference -0.08, -0.11 to -0.06) was better in the intervention groups than in other groups. Benefit for any specific type or intensity of intervention was not noted. In populations with increased death rates, interventions were associated with reduced nursing-home admission. Benefit in trials was particularly evident in studies started before 1993. INTERPRETATION: Complex interventions can help elderly people to live safely and independently, and could be tailored to meet individuals' needs and preferences.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Early diagnosis of dementia benefits both patient and caregiver. Nevertheless, dementia in primary care is currently under-diagnosed. Some educational interventions developed to improve dementia diagnosis and management were successful in increasing the number of dementia diagnoses and in changing attitudes and knowledge of health care staff. However, none of these interventions focussed on collaboration between GPs and nurses in dementia care. We developed an EASYcare-based Dementia Training Program (DTP) aimed at stimulating collaboration in dementia primary care. We expect this program to increase the number of cognitive assessments and dementia diagnoses and to improve attitudes and knowledge of GPs and nurses.Methods: The DTP is a complex educational intervention that consists of two workshops, a coaching program, access to an internet forum, and a Computerized Clinical Decision Support System on dementia diagnostics. One hundred duos of GPs and nurses will be recruited, from which 2/3 will be allocated to the intervention group and 1/3 to the control group. The effects of implementation of the DTP will be studied in a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Primary outcomes will be the number of cognitive assessments and dementia diagnoses in a period of 9 months following workshop participation. Secondary outcomes are measured on GP and nurse level: adherence to national guidelines for dementia, attitude, confidence and knowledge regarding dementia diagnosis and management; on patient level: number of emergency calls, visits and consultations and patient satisfaction; and on caregiver level: informal caregiver burden and satisfaction. Data will be collected from GPs' electronic medical records, self-registration forms and questionnaires. Statistical analysis will be performed using the MANOVA-method. Also, exploratory analyses will be performed, in order to gain insight into barriers and facilitators for implementation and the possible causal relations between the rate of success of the intervention components and the outcomes.Discussion: We developed multifaceted dementia training programme. Novelties in this programme are the training in fixed collaborative duos and the inclusion of an individual coaching program. The intervention is designed according to international guidelines and educational standards. Exploratory analysis will reveal its successful elements. Selection bias and contamination may be threats to the reliability of future results of this trial. Nevertheless, the results of this trial may provide useful information for policy makers and developers of continuing medical education.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00459784.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory study investigated caregiving and interdependencies in families of frail older case management clients who coreside with younger individuals in need of care. Analyses were based on interviews with 78 older adults recruited from a large urban case management program. To be eligible for the study, the older adult had to coreside with an individual under age 60 who had disabilities or chronic health problems and/or with minors. Results indicated that the majority of older adults were primary caregivers for at least one younger individual. In a substantial number of families, the older adult depended on a younger adult with disabilities for primary care. Older adults who lived with both younger adults with disabilities and minors experienced more negative affect than those who lived with only one of these two kinds of younger individuals. Positive affect among elders living with younger adults with disabilities was positively related to the number of formal services received by the younger adults. The implications of these findings for service delivery to families with complex needs for care are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify the informational cues that driver-assessor-trained occupational therapists (DATOTs) consider when making driver licensing recommendations for older and functionally impaired clients. Relatively little research supports these complex decisions. METHOD: A survey using a social judgment theory framework was mailed to all practicing registered DATOTs in Victoria, Australia. RESULTS: Cue mean rank order, as calculated across the 56 responses (return rate, 78%), revealed that the four most important cues were driving instructor interventions, driver behavior, cognitive and perceptual skills, and vehicle handling skills. Substantial individual variations in cue ranks were not attributable to respondents' years of experience. CONCLUSION: Because driver licensing recommendations may have a major impact on clients' lives, debate and further study concerning information use are needed to assist DATOTs in making consistent and optimal licensing recommendations to ensure the safety of all road users and avoid when possible the negative consequences of license loss.</ab>

        <ab>This study aimed to improve urinary incontinence (UI) among residents of a Teaching Nursing Home (TNH) in Trondheim, Norway, by implementing a unitbased educational program on UI in the elderly. Of the 33 patients on the study unit, 18 (16 women and 2 men) experienced UI. This quasi-experimental study began with baseline data collection before the unit-based educational program. The measures obtained from the residents included the following over one 24 hour period before the educational program and three months after completion of the program: pad change frequency, pad weighing, oral fluid intake, and size of pad used. As well, bladder-scanning volumes were obtained twice a day for two days at these same time periods. All direct care staff received 45 minutes education every other week. Findings include that average incontinent pad weights to be less, maximum incontinent pad weights to be less, and an increase in drinking times per night. Average post-voiding residual urine remained the same, but the average minimum amount per resident fell significantly. In conclusion, initiation of a unit-based educational program on UI may yield measurable benefits for complexly ill, frail elderly residents.</ab>

        <ab>Home-Based Primary Care is a program designed by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) to care for frail, medically complex, elderly veteran patients in their home setting. Unique to the VA, the program has similarities and differences in relation to typical Medicare/Medicaid home health and hospice programs. The VA has demonstrated success in maintaining the patients' independence and quality of life as well as exceptional management of chronic disease and prevention.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this research was to disclose the characteristics of quality of life as perceived by physically frail but lucid elderly people living in nursing homes to increase the understanding of the phenomenon of quality of life in this setting. Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what matters most in relation to their quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>This study used a mixed method design to explore congruence about the discharge destination decision of hospitalized frail older adults, their family members, and health care team members (HCTMs). There were 3 aims to this study. First, using the Control Preferences Scale (CPS), preferred level of participation (LOP) in the hospital discharge decision for frail older adults was established. Second, the extent that congruence between preferred LOP and actual LOP occurred for each participant was ascertained. Lastly, using the participants' perceptions of the discharge destination decision will be described. This finding revealed there was no common pattern of preferred LOP either among individuals, or in the triad. Congruence in the discharge destination occurred in the triad regardless of whether or not individual participants obtained their preferred LOP. There was more congruence with discharge destination decisions (a) in those triads that demonstrated ongoing communication with one another, (b) in which there was not a perceived safety issue for the older adult, (c) when post hospital care was not medically complex for families to manage, and (d) when the older adults were returning to an environment of their choice. The use of rehabilitation post-hospital stay was routine among the sample for frail elders, and HCTMs often avoided discussing permanent nursing home admission by suggesting temporary placement in skilled nursing facilities for rehabilitation. By so doing, the decision of moving permanently to the nursing home was not openly addressed by patients, families, or HCTMs. 'Safety' for the HCTMs meant physical safety, medication safety, and confidence in the older adult or caregivers' ability to manage at home. If any of these basic issues were compromised it was likely that a hotline call by HCTMs to the State Division of Senior Services for potential self neglect would be made. Limitations of the study included a small sample from a single hospital, and that one family member and one HCTM were interviewed for each older adult participant. Additionally, the hospital environment was noisy and chaotic, making it difficult for older adults to communicate during the interviews. Clinical implications include improving communication with the patient about their care and condition by using methods that will make the HCTM more accessible to the patient such as: (a) walking bedside report, and (b) making routine multidisciplinary rounds at the patients' bedside, and (c) development of a capacity assessment.</ab>

        <ab>Caring for frail older adults presents unique challenges for the primary care provider. Advancing age is associated with physical and cognitive decline related to increased co-morbid conditions including arthritis, heart disease, pulmonary disease and diabetes. Eighty-year-old Mrs. X illustrates the challenges and issues providers face daily caring for the complex population in the present fragmented health care environment in the United States. The challenges and issues faced by those caring for the frail elderly include lack of coordination and continuity of care for patients with multiple conditions, the nursing shortage, polypharmacy and soaring medication costs, and transportation and access to health care services. There are emerging models of care for the frail elderly; however barriers exist to implementing these models routinely in the present health care system. Barriers to implementing these models include: 1. lack of continuity between ambulatory, acute, and long term care. 2. financing dependent upon employer, age, and type of service. 3. transportation and access to appropriate health care services. 4. inconsistent results of studies of alternative models of care. With the growing older population we must address the health care needs of this frail, medically needy group.</ab>

        <ab>Success stories of disease management programs have heightened the interest of healthcare payors and providers in the adoption of disease management principles for their aging members. However, caution is needed for rapid adoption, as several crucial characteristics within the aging population may clash with disease management principles.When developing disease management programs, the characteristics of the frail elderly must be considered, otherwise there may be a potential for misapplication of disease management principles. For example: (i) frailty is a state rather than a condition; (ii) the complex needs of frail elders are less straightforward and therefore make it more difficult to apply a formalized set of treatment guidelines; (iii) the mental health and cognitive issues may challenge the reliance on self-management; and (iv) the involvement of caregivers may broaden the scope well beyond clinical care.This article summarizes several successes of disease management programs and examines the critical components leading to their success, including patient self-management and education, better provider coordination, risk stratifying tools, and the use of evidence-based guidelines.In considering the possibility of using disease management principles to care for the frail elderly population, this article demonstrates that more research, discussions, and practical applications are needed prior to widespread program implementation. The frail condition experienced by many older adults is not just the sum of several disease conditions; therefore, merely combining several disease management programs to serve this population may prove to be less effective than is hoped. Hence the pursuit of more effective approaches to providing care for an aging population continues. Disease management for the frail is most effective when the treatment integrates both the social and medical needs of the patient and caregivers. It is also essential to manage the patient's multiple diseases even though the patient selection and primary focus may be on the primary disease.</ab>

        <ab>The complex formed by chronic illness, episodes of acute illness, physiological disabilities, functional limitations, and cognitive problems is prevalent among frail elderly persons. These individuals rely on assistance from social and health care programs, which in Canada are still fragmented. SIPA (Services integres pour les personnes agees fragiles) is an integrated service model based on community services, a multidisciplinary team, case management that retains clinical responsibility for all the health and social services required, and the capacity to mobilize resources as required and according to the care protocol. The SIPA demonstration project used an experimental design, with random allocation of the 1,230 participants from two areas of Montreal to an experimental and a control group. The costs of institutional services were $4,270 less for those in the SIPA group compared to the control group ; the costs of community care were $3,394 more. The proportion of persons waiting in acute care hospitals for nursing home placement was twice as high in the control group as in the SIPA group. The costs of acute hospitalizations for persons in the SIPA group with ADL disabilities were at least $4,000 lower than those for persons in the control group. In conclusion, the SIPA trial showed that it is possible to undertake ambitious and rigorous demonstration projects in Canada. These results were obtained without an increase in the overall costs of health and social services, without reducing the quality of care, and without increasing the burden on elderly persons and their relatives.</ab>

        <ab>Rising nursing home (NH) costs and the poor quality of NH care make it important to recognize elders for whom NH care may be inappropriate. As a first step in developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer services than NHs.</ab>

        <ab>The prevalence of wounds, particularly pressure ulcers, has been collected over several years with little sustained improvements in overall rates. Consideration and appreciation of the complexity of the heterogeneous nature of the elderly population in the United States as well as the wounds themselves may offer some insight as to why prevalence rates seem so intractable. Frailty, as a descriptive term, has not achieved consensus among health professionals but nevertheless denotes a permanent loss in functional ability. It is common to find care of the frail elderly partitioned into treatments of discrete symptoms. This can often mean treatment goals are established without consideration of the burdensome impact of the treatments themselves for the frail elderly. These interventions, often fruitless, do not prioritize quality-of-life issues, limit independence, and result in further isolation of the frail elderly. Prevalence evaluations are a valuable tool in understanding and measuring the magnitude of wounds in both community and healthcare institutions. However, clinicians must further segregate and appreciate the complexity and diversity of wounds as a sequel of multiple influences among the frail elderly. Healthcare interventions should recognize and accommodate the dynamic nature of the functional decline of the frail elderly. Wound healing, to the exclusion of quality-of-life goals for the individual frail elderly, may not be the gold standard. Comfort, dignity, and control may be better measures of success.</ab>

        <ab>The U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 demographic trends indicate that a rapidly increasing elderly population is living well beyond younger, more functional ages into the 'old-old' stage (&gt;/= age 75), when debility is more common (Hetzel &amp; Smith, 2000). Increasingly, family members and friends are being called on to provide complex levels of care for older loved ones, which lends to both psychological and physiological stressors for the caregivers (Donelan et al., 2002). A variety of interventions have been implemented to help caregivers cope with the stresses associated with this demanding role. This article describes a demonstration project that evaluated the effects of writing support group for caregivers of frail older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Through the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Technology for Successful Aging (RERC-Tech-Aging) elder perspectives on cell phone designs and features were explored. Six-hundred and sixty-five participants (596 elders with disabilities, 69 adults with disabilities) from Northern Florida, Southern California, and Western New York were surveyed through face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, or mailed surveys. The survey addressed satisfaction, importance, frequency of use, methods for learning, barriers to use, views on features, and ways the cell phone had helped. The majority of elders (60%) valued their cell phone, and a large proportion (87%) use the cell phone for emergencies. Only one third of elders reported using their cell phone daily. Suggestions for improving phone design included increasing button size (50% of subjects), increasing display size (29% of subjects), increasing overall size of the cell phone (24% subjects), and decreasing the complexity of the phone.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between self-destructive behaviour and nursing home environment. We performed a cross-sectional study comprising 647 residents in 11 nursing homes in Sydney, Australia using the Harmful Behaviours Scale (HBS), Abbreviated Mental Test Scale and the Resident Classification Index. The Directors of Nursing completed a questionnaire that rated physical design, staff and resident characteristics and demographics were obtained from nursing home records. On regression analysis a greater number of design features for frail and residents with dementia in general, and increased security measures were associated with greater HBS total score and risk-taking and passive self-harm subscales. A residential environment in which the residents were more functionally dependent and more likely to be in a shared room, managerial policies less geared towards managing difficult behaviour and less staff availability and training were associated with the 'uncooperativeness' factor. There were no significant predictors of the other two factors. The relationship between nursing home environment and self-destructive behaviours and the environment is complex and there needs to be an individualized approach to placement.</ab>

        <ab>Parts I and II of this article examine the impact of a falls prevention program on the fall incidents among the residents in a nursing home. It was hypothesized that a diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and postponing problems resulting from inactivity. Part I (LCM, Nov-Dec 2001) discussed the background and process of a falls program and factors contributing to the occurrence of falls. This month we examine the interdisciplinary team approach to assessment, method, and implementing strategies for an effective fall prevention program. Tools used for prevention, monitoring, and investigation of falls are also detailed.</ab>

        <ab>Frail older patients-unlike younger persons in the health care system or even well elders-require complex care. Most frail older patients have multiple chronic illnesses. Optimum care cannot be achieved by following the paradigm of ongoing traditional health care, which emphasizes disease and cure. Because no one health care professional can possibly have all of the specialized skills required to implement such a model of health care delivery, interdisciplinary team care has evolved. This paper describes the roles of the participating team members in the context of interdisciplinary care for frail older adults. In addition, the challenges that occur when Geriatric Interdisciplinary (ID) Teams involved in providing care to frail older patients are identified and discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Managing the care of geriatric patients with one disease management program alone often does not actually improve medical or financial outcomes. Experts who treat geriatric patients say the complexity of medical arid psychosocial needs is nearly always greater than the sum of individual medical problems. In a unique model of care, geriatric patients and their caregivers are finding support for medical and daily living creeds -- a combination that ultimately allows the patient to maintain functional ability for longer periods of time and remain in the home.</ab>

        <ab>AIM: The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy in identifying and describing older adults as frail. BACKGROUND: Despite the dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. METHOD: The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. CONCLUSION: The review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the contribution of both individual and environmental factors.</ab>

        <ab>Care in the community has been constructed on the basis of professional support for carers who, as a result of community care policy that has released highly dependant people from residential care and long-stay wards, are carrying out a wide range of tasks, including complex health care activities. The present paper examines the health care activities currently undertaken by family carers and the way in which they work with, and are supported by, professional nurses in the home. It compares and contrasts the approaches of both groups to care-giving for this client group. The authors conclude by making some suggestions for improving the way in which family carers and nurses work together in the home.</ab>

        <ab>This article offers an approach to the assessment of frail older adults with complex needs that has been used by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Program on Aging as both a care delivery and a teaching strategy. The patient is assessed simultaneously by different disciplines to develop a holistic and practical plan of care. It is termed 'arena assessment,' borrowing from the pediatric literature on transdisciplinary assessment of children. The article explores the benefits and limitations of this approach for patients and families, as well as for professional learners. Case examples illustrate use of the model from community-based to institutional care. Copyright © 2002 by Aspen Publishers, Inc.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last few years the number of elderly patients in acute hospitals throughout Europe has risen dramatically. The pressure on hospital beds leads to earlier discharge and the task of sending patients home from hospitals is becoming more complex. The provision of health and social services is organized in different ways all over Europe. Therefore, it would be of interest to know more about how different kinds of systems support the professional carers in their effort to satisfy the needs which older people and their significant others experience in the discharge process. A pilot study was set up mainly to provide information on what kinds of problems are inherent in a multicentred, interprofessional research project involving a large number of countries. The findings serve as an important knowledge base in a future project. Experiences from the pilot study and the benefits of it are presented.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. AIMS OF THE PAPER: This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of research related to ethical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of frail older people to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older people to research while protecting their right to refuse.</ab>

        <ab>The ethics of dealing with the provision of nutritional therapies has been complicated by technological advances that have affected all of medical science. As a result, nurses are increasingly confronted with decisions regarding the provision of invasive treatments. Indeed, enormous faith is invested in the ability and wisdom of healthcare professionals to alleviate suffering and accomplish cure through the application of invasive therapeutic interventions such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Such decisions are often complex, present a moral dilemma, and are further complicated by prevailing politico-economic, social, and cultural influences. The insertion of tubes for artificial nutritional support in those patients who can be defined as 'vulnerable' is no exception. This article explores both the clinical and ethical realities of PEG tube placement and use thereafter in vulnerable patients. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice are discussed within the context of PEG placement and feeding and recommendations are given for nurses practicing in the area of gastroenterology.</ab>

        <ab>Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in monitoring some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer perceptions and experiences of services and involvement of users/carers in assessment and review. Using data from the study Evaluating Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales receiving community care services, this investigation examines three crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction. This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need to be aware of both the potential and pitfalls associated with using them as a means of assessing the quality of social services for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Optimal care for frail elderly patients depends on comprehensive assessment. This is especially true in the complex setting of interdisciplinary home care programs. To facilitate comprehensive assessment, as well as to generate a useful, policy-relevant patient database, standardized, multidimensional, and validated instruments are very helpful.Objectives: The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that the Minimum Data Set assessment instrument for Home Care (MDS-HC) can be used to detect functional and cognitive impairment as defined by analogous research instruments.Research Design: This was a cross-sectional correlation study.Subjects: We studied 95 patients admitted to home care services of the Health Care Agency of Bergamo (Italy).Measures: The MDS-HC form was completed for all patients by well-trained nurses, independently of and with nurses blinded to the results from the research rating scales. The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of Lawton (IADL), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were considered the gold standard.Results: Agreement between the MDS-HC scales and the research rating scales was assessed with Pearson's correlation coefficient. This coefficient was 0.74 for MDS-ADL versus Barthel Index, 0.81 for MDS-IADL versus Lawton Index, and 0.81 for Cognitive Performance Scale versus MMSE, indicating an excellent agreement.Conclusions: The MDS-HC scales, when performed by trained nurses using recommended protocols, provide a valid measure of function and cognitive status in frail home care patients. These findings point out the overall validity of the functional and clinical data contained in the MDS-HC assessment. Use of the MDS-HC gives the unique opportunity of setting up a database, a prerequisite for all epidemiological evidence-based medicine studies.</ab>

        <ab>As people age, there is an increase in chronic illness and disability and thus a growing need for long-term care. Unfortunately, the concept of long-term care can be very complex and confusing. Elderly individuals and their family members frequently have many questions, such as the following: What is long-term care, and who needs it? What long-term care services are available? Who will provide the services? Where will the services be provided? How much will the services cost, and who will pay for the expenses? Indeed, the cost of providing long-term care, whether in an institution or in one's own home, may represent an enormous burden for individuals and their families. Nurses, especially community health nurses, are in a prime position to address these questions and concerns to ensure appropriate care and services for their clients. This article addresses the questions clients frequently ask by defining long-term care and discussing long-term care services, settings, and providers. In addition, 4 methods of financing long-term care will be presented.</ab>

        <ab>Little is known about the processes involved in risk taking, and complex decision making of the type encountered on acute medical wards in general hospitals. The purpose of the present study was to examine certain of these processes in the context of decisions to discharge elderly inpatients from hospital. Vignettes of hypothetical frail and disabled elderly in-patients were presented to student and qualified occupational therapists (OTs). All the vignettes represented high risk discharges and each of the patients expressed the desire to return to their own home. The additional diagnosis of early dementia was manipulated within and between vignettes. Subjects were asked to decide on the appropriateness of discharging each patient to (a) home and (b) a residential or nursing home. In addition, subjects completed a short demographic questionnaire which also probed aspects of their knowledge about elderly people. Results indicated that qualified OTs were less likely to overrule patients' wishes by favouring discharge of patients to residential or nursing home, and more likely to favour discharge to patients' own homes than student OTs. There was no overall main effect of dementia on subjects' decisions. In addition to clinical experience, certain areas of knowledge about elderly people were significantly associated with different approaches to risk taking in response to the vignettes. Undergraduate syllabi may need to be modified to incorporate more information about elderly people, the prevalence of different diseases, and direct experience of clinical decision making in the context of uncertain and risky situations.</ab>

        <ab>Experienced social workers in an Australian residential aged care facility mounted a practice research project over three years. Aims included meeting agency accountability requirements and illustrating social work roles. In consultation with a university school of social work lecturer, the staff members devised a tool to document their practice on a per case basis across the care continuum as well as non case-related work associated with resident needs and agency purpose. A three-month pilot indicated that casework comprised 70% of work time, the 405 cases incorporating higher than expected time on preadmission gatekeeping and admission tasks. Analyses of the most time-consuming cases revealed complex interacting factors inadequately captured by available and physically-driven case classification and costing tools.</ab>

        <ab>Advances in healthcare have produced a rapid increase in the number of families that are providing care for frail, older relatives in the home. This phenomenon has presented multiple socio-political challenges for individuals, families, local communities, and nations, and as such has been the subject of multidisciplinary research. It is known that the family caregiving role for frail, older relatives is demanding, complex, most often assumed by a woman, and frequently associated with negative health effects on the caregiver. It is also clear that the family caregiver is a major national economic resource in providing care for the elderly. There is a need to understand the lived experience of the caregiver so that meaningful, appropriate preparation and interventions might be implemented to support the caregiver. This purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand and describe the lived experience of family caregiving for frail older relatives in the home from a female perspective. The study design is based on principles of naturalistic inquiry and van Manen's (1990) hermeneutic phenomenological approach to human science research. Caregiver perspectives provided data for phenomenologic reflection and were elicited from: (a) fourteen interviews with seven experienced women caregivers averaging three hours each, (b) review of three videotapes that presented five different caregiver stories, (c) review of seven poems about caregiving authored by recognized women poets, and (d) etymological study of the words 'care' and 'give'. Thematic analysis of caregiver descriptions of the lived experience of caregiving revealed six essential themes: (a) staying with, (b) answering, (c) uncertainty, (d) adapting, (e) controlling, and (f) vulnerability. Implications of study findings are discussed as giving direction to nursing research, practice, and education.</ab>

        <ab>As society ages, a challenge is presented to health care providers. The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.</ab>

        <ab>Demographic changes have created the need for psychiatric nurses to examine knowledge and practice in the area of geropsychiatry. Older adults present unique challenges. The interaction of biological and psychosocial problems are most evident in the oldest old and necessitate a holistic approach. This report addresses psychosocial causes and treatment of 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT) in the elderly. FTT is a label commonly used to describe a complex of nonspecific symptoms that often leads to increased disability and premature death. Psychiatric nurses are challenged to take a leadership role in case finding, as well as assessment and intervention.</ab>
