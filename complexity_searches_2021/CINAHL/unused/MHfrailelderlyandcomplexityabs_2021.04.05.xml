        <ab>Purpose Of Review: The number and the complexity of procedures taking place at ambulatory surgery centers is steadily increasing. The rate at which medically complex patients, including those with baseline neurocognitive disorders, are undergoing ambulatory procedures is seeing a concurrent rise. Given the significant physical and psychological stress associated with surgery even in the ambulatory setting, it is essential to evaluate the ability of a patient to acclimate to stressful triggers in order to assess risk of subpar medical outcomes and increased mortality. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the assessment of both cognition and frailty and describe the implementation of these tools in the ambulatory surgery setting.Recent Findings: Recent Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) recommendations for evaluating at-risk patients focus on a two-pronged approach that encompasses screening for both impaired cognition and frailty. Screening should ideally occur as early as possible, but tools such as the Mini-Cog examination and FRAIL Questionnaire are efficient and effective even when used the day of surgery in high-risk patients.Summary: The recognition of at-risk patients using standardized screening and the use of this assessment to guide perioperative monitoring and interventions is essential for optimizing outcomes for the complex ambulatory surgery patient.</ab>

        <ab>Background Blood pressure (BP) management in frail older people is challenging. An randomised controlled trial of largely non-frail older people found cardiovascular and mortality benefit with systolic (S) BP target &lt;120 mmHg. However, all-cause mortality by attained BP in routine care in frail adults aged above 75 is unclear. Objectives To estimate observational associations between baseline BP and mortality/cardiovascular outcomes in a primary-care population aged above 75, stratified by frailty. Methods Prospective observational analysis using electronic health records (clinical practice research datalink, n  = 415,980). We tested BP associations with cardiovascular events and mortality using competing and Cox proportional-hazards models respectively (follow-up ≤10 years), stratified by baseline electronic frailty index (eFI: fit (non-frail), mild, moderate, severe frailty), with sensitivity analyses on co-morbidity, cardiovascular risk and BP trajectory. Results Risks of cardiovascular outcomes increased with SBPs &gt;150 mmHg. Associations with mortality varied between non-frail &lt;85 and frail 75–84-year-olds and all above 85 years. SBPs above the 130–139-mmHg reference were associated with lower mortality risk, particularly in moderate to severe frailty or above 85 years (e.g. 75–84 years: 150–159 mmHg Hazard Ratio (HR) mortality compared to 130–139: non-frail HR = 0.94, 0.92–0.97; moderate/severe frailty HR = 0.84, 0.77–0.92). SBP &lt;130 mmHg and Diastolic(D)BP &lt;80 mmHg were consistently associated with excess mortality, independent of BP trajectory toward the end of life. Conclusions In representative primary-care patients aged ≥75, BP &lt;130/80 was associated with excess mortality. Hypertension was not associated with increased mortality at ages above 85 or at ages 75–84 with moderate/severe frailty, perhaps due to complexities of co-existing morbidities. The priority given to aggressive BP reduction in frail older people requires further evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In order to optimize interventions and services in the community, it is important to identify the profile of persons who are able to stay at home and of those who are being admitted into residential care. Understanding their needs and their use of resources is essential. The main objective of the study is to identify persons who are likely to enter residential care based upon their needs and resource utilization, so that care providers can plan interventions effectively and optimize services and resources to meet the persons' needs.Methods: This is a longitudinal quasi-experimental study. The data consists of primary data from the community setting collected every six months during the period of 2010-2016. Interventions had the goal of keeping older people longer at home. Participants were at least 65 years old and were living in the community. The interRAI Resource Utilization Group system (RUG-III) was used to calculate the case-mix indexes (CMI) of all participants. Comparisons were made between the case-mix of those who were still living at home and those who were admitted into residential care at follow-up.Results: A total of 10,289 older persons participated in the study (81.2 ± 7.1 yrs., 69.1% female). From this population, 853 participants (8.3%) were admitted into residential care. The CMI of the persons receiving night care at home were the highest (1.6 at baseline and 1.7 at the entry point of residential care), followed by persons receiving occupational therapy (1.5 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care) and persons enrolled in case management interventions with rehabilitation (1.4 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care). The CMIs at follow-up were significantly higher than at baseline and the linear regression model showed that admission to residential care was a significant factor in the model.Conclusions: The study showed that the RUG-III system offers possibilities for identifying persons at risk of institutionalization. Interventions designed to avoid early nursing home admission can make use of the RUG-III system to optimize care planning and the allocation of services and resources. Based on the RUG-III case-mix, resources can be allocated to keep older persons at home longer, bearing in mind the complexity of care and the availability of services in the community.</ab>

        <ab>Type 2 diabetes and its associated comorbidities are growing more prevalent, and the complexity of optimising glycaemic control is increasing, especially on the frontlines of patient care. In many countries, most patients with type 2 diabetes are managed in a primary care setting. However, primary healthcare professionals face the challenge of the growing plethora of available treatment options for managing hyperglycaemia, leading to difficultly in making treatment decisions and contributing to therapeutic inertia. This position statement offers a simple and patient-centred clinical decision-making model with practical treatment recommendations that can be widely implemented by primary care clinicians worldwide through shared-decision conversations with their patients. It highlights the importance of managing cardiovascular disease and elevated cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes and aims to provide innovative risk stratification and treatment strategies that connect patients with the most effective care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Of people admitted to the acute surgical unit (ASU) only 23% of them are aged over 70. However the number of bed days they occupy are disproportionate to this; comprising 48% of the total bed days. The average number of bed days rises exponentially with age, with those aged under 70 averaging less than two days; those aged 80 averaging approximately 4.5 bed days and those aged over 90 approximately 7 bed days. This disparity was recognised and a Medicine for Older People (MOP) liaison team comprising consultant geriatrician and Advanced Clinical Practitioner in Frailty starting working with the acute surgical team in November 2018, initially providing support two days a week, increasing to 5 days in March 2019. Methods: The MOP liaison team meets with the acute surgical team each morning identifying and discussing relevant patients; those identified as living with frailty with associated complexity and uncertainty. This group of patients is then reviewed by the MOP liaison team utilising the principles of the comprehensive geriatric assessment to formulate a person-centred plan. Plans are discussed and coordinated with the surgical, nursing and therapy teams utilising a multi-disciplinary/ multi-professional approach. Results: Length of stay is the main outcome measure and readmissions are monitored. Data on admission length and readmissions was analysed from April 2018 and has continued following commencement of the liaison service. Primary results-Length of stay has reduced from 4.4 to 3.3 days on average for all over 70-year-olds admitted to the ASU team. Whilst admission rates have dropped across all age ranges the biggest reduction in readmissions is among the over 80-year-olds with an almost 50% reduction as opposed to a 33% reduction in the under 70 age group Conclusions: Proactively managing the admissions and discharges of patients with frailty allows them to receive the right care at the right time in their period of crisis and shortens their admissions by approximately 25%.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Acutely ill and frail older adults have complex social and health care needs. It is important to understand how this complexity affects acute outcomes for admission to hospital. We validated a frailty index using routine admission laboratory tests with outcomes after patients were admitted to hospital.Methods: In a prospective cohort of older adults admitted to a large tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom, we created a frailty index from routine admission laboratory investigations (FI-Laboratory) linked to data comprising hospital outcomes. We evaluated the association between the FI-Laboratory and total days spent in hospital, discharge to a higher level of care, readmission and mortality.Results: Of 2552 admissions among 1750 older adults, we were able to generate FI-Laboratory values for 2254 admissions (88.3% of the cohort). More than half of admitted patients were women (55.3%) and the mean age was 84.6 (SD 14.0) years. We found that the FI-Laboratory correlated weakly with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS; r2 = 0.09). An increase in the CFS and the equivalent of 3 additional abnormal laboratory test results in the FI-Laboratory, respectively, were associated with an increased proportion of inpatient days (rate ratios [RRs] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.52; and 1.47, 95% CI 1.41-1.54), discharge to a higher level of care (odd ratios [ORs] 1.39, 95% CI 1.27-1.52; and 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.47) and increased readmission rate (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.37; and 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.26). Increases in the CFS and FI-Laboratory were associated with increased mortality HRs of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28-1.51) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.37-1.54), respectively.Interpretation: We determined that FI-Laboratory, distinct from baseline frailty, could be used to predict risk of many adverse outcomes. The score is therefore a useful way to quantify the degree of acute illness in frail older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Diabetes and frailty are highly prevalent conditions that impact the health status of older adults. Perturbations in protein/amino acid metabolism are associated with both functional impairment and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the present study, we compared the concentrations of a panel of circulating 37 amino acids and derivatives between frail/pre-frail older adults with T2DM and robust non-diabetic controls. Sixty-six functionally impaired older persons aged 70+ with T2DM and 30 age and sex-matched controls were included in the analysis. We applied a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-based analytical strategy to characterize the metabotype of study participants. The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found to be two latent variables. The proportion of correct classification was 94.1 ± 1.9% for frail/pre-frail persons with T2DM and 100% for control participants. Functionally impaired older persons with T2DM showed higher levels of 3-methyl histidine, alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, ethanolamine sarcosine, and tryptophan. Control participants had higher levels of ornithine and taurine. These findings indicate that a specific profile of amino acids and derivatives characterizes pre-frail/frail older persons with T2DM. The dissection of these pathways may provide novel insights into the metabolic perturbations involved in the disabling cascade in older persons with T2DM.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the prevalence, severity, and change in health-related problems in a sample of older adults who received individual care and support from Embrace, for the whole sample, per subgroup based on complexity of care needs and frailty, and for those who had at baseline a health-related problem. Design: A pretest-posttest study with assessments at baseline and after 12 months. Settin g: Community. Participants: Older adults aged 75 years and older (N= 136) who are frail (n = 56) or who have complex care needs (n = 80). Intervention : Participants received care and support by Embrace, a person-centered and integrated care service for community-living older adults supporting them to age in place. A multidisciplinary team provided care and support, with intensity depending on the older adults' risk profile. Main Outcome Measure: Health-related problems as perceived by older adults and measured with the Geriatric International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core Set. Results: Health-related problems were related to 6 coherent clusters: (1) Mental Functions; (2) Physical Health; (3) Mobility; (4) Personal Care; (5) Nutrition; and (6) Support. The most prevalent and most severe problems at baseline were related to Mental Functions and Mobility. Changes in the prevalence of problems after 12 months varied. Severity scores decreased or remained stable, except for Mobility items which showed a varying changing pattern in participants with complex care needs. Prevalence and severity of problems for those with a problem at baseline decreased after 12 months. Frail participants with a problem had higher baseline severity scores than those with complex care needs experiencing a problem, but differences in changes between individuals who are frail and those with complex care needs were small. Conclusions: The results are encouraging and may indicate that individual, person-centered and integrated care and support from Embrace offers a route to counteracting the decline in physical, cognitive and social functioning associated with aging.

        <ab>Background: Person-centred care (PCC) focusing on personalised goals and care plans derived from "What matters to you?" has an impact on single disease outcomes, but studies on multi-morbid elderly are lacking. Furthermore, the combination of PCC, Integrated Care (IC) and Pro-active care are widely recognised as desirable for multi-morbid elderly, yet previous studies focus on single components only, leaving synergies unexplored. The effect of a synergistic intervention, which implements 1) Person-centred goal-oriented care driven by "What matters to you?" with 2) IC and 3) pro-active care is unknown.Methods: Inspired by theoretical foundations, complexity science, previous health service research and a patient-driven evaluation of care quality, we designed the Patient-Centred Team (PACT) intervention across primary and secondary care. The PACT team collaborate with the patient to make and deliver a person-centred, integrated and proactive multi-morbidity care-plan. The control group receives conventional care. The study design is a pragmatic six months prospective, controlled clinical trial based on hospital electronic health record data of 439 multi-morbid frail elderly at risk for emergency (re) admissions referred to PACT and 779 propensity score matched controls in Norway, 2014-2016. Outcomes are emergency admissions, the sum of emergency inpatient bed days, 30-day readmissions, planned and emergency outpatient visits and mortality at three and six months follow-up.Results: The Rate Ratios (RR) for emergency admissions was 0,9 (95%CI: 0,82-0,99), for sum of emergency bed days 0,68 (95%CI:0,52-0,79) and for 30-days emergency readmissions 0,72 (95%CI: 0,41-1,24). RRs were 2,3 (95%CI: 2,02-2,55) and 0,9 (95%CI: 0,68-1,20) for planned and emergency outpatient visits respectively. The RR for death at 3 months was 0,39 (95% CI: 0,22-0,70) and 0,57 (95% CI: 0,34-0,94) at 6 months.Conclusion: Compared with propensity score matched controls, the care process of frail multi-morbid elderly who received the PACT intervention had a reduced risk of high-level emergency care, increased use of low-level planned care, and substantially reduced mortality risk. Further study of process differences between groups is warranted to understand the genesis of these results better.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02541474 ), registered Sept 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Emergency department (ED) care for frail elderly patients is associated with an increased use of resources due to their complex medical needs and frequently difficult psycho-social situation. To better target their needs with specially trained staff, it is vital to determine the times during which these particular patients present to the ED. Recent research was inconclusive regarding this question and the applied methods were limited to coarse time windows. Moreover, there is little research on time variation of frail ED patients' case complexity. This study examines differences in arrival rates for frail vs. non-frail patients in detail and compares case complexity in frail patients within vs. outside of regular GP working hours. Arrival times and case variables (admission rate, ED length of stay [LOS], triage level and comorbidities) were extracted from the EHR of an ED in an urban German teaching hospital. We employed Poisson time series regression to determine patterns in hourly arrival rates over the week. Frail elderly patients presented more likely to the ED during already high frequented hours, especially at midday and in the afternoon. Case complexity for frail patients was significantly higher compared to non-frail patients, but varied marginally in time only with respect to triage level and ED LOS. The results suggest that frailtyattuned emergency care should be available in EDs during the busiest hours. Based on EHR data, hospitals thus can tailor their staff needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant.Methods: The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant.Discussion: The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03883425 , registered on March 20, 2019.</ab>

        <ab>This case describes a 103-year-old lady who presented from home with an incidental diagnosis of a left femoral fracture. She had no history of trauma and denied pain. She had a known diagnosis of osteoporosis, and sustained a fracture of the contralateral femur aged 93 which was managed conservatively. She was bed-bound with fixed contractures, poor oral intake and was non-compliant with prescribed calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Clinical biochemical measurements showed severe vitamin D deficiency and mild hypocalcaemia. Secondary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of an inappropriately normal phosphate suggested concurrent renal bone disease. Biomarkers of bone turnover were also consistent with bone remodelling. The history of prior fragility fractures, severe vitamin D deficiency and immobility supports a diagnosis of osteoporotic fracture, however other causes of spontaneous fracture were also considered. This case highlights the complexity of interpreting clinical biochemistry results in the setting of multi-morbidity and addresses the challenges of bone health management in the frail older person.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: Frailty syndrome is related to decreased physiological complexity, functional capacity and cognition. Physical exercise has been suggested to slow down and reverse this syndrome. However, evidence of its effectiveness is not as straightforward as conventionally admitted, as there is a lack of trials with rigorous methodology. The purpose of this study was to describe the Pre‐Frail Multicomponent Training Intervention protocol. Methods: Cardiovascular, motor control and neuromuscular systems of pre‐frail older adults will be assessed by measuring the complexity of the output of these systems. Functional capacity and cognition will be assessed by specific tools. A 16‐week training protocol will be carried out on three alternate days, with 60‐min sessions, and combining aerobic, muscle strength, flexibility and balance exercises. The objective of this intervention is to improve the cardiovascular, motor control and neuromuscular systems, as well as functional capacity and cognition of pre‐frail older adults. The assessment of these systems will be carried out using gold standard devices. Results: The results of the present study might allow clinical and functional support for the evaluation of the variables analyzed. Conclusion: This protocol is easily reproducible and requires low‐cost materials, thus the Pre‐Frail Multicomponent Training Intervention could be a therapeutic strategy for pre‐frail older adults.

        <ab>Background: Physical frailty, characterized by reduced physiologic complexity and ability to cope with stressors, is closely associated with cognitive impairment, which increases the risk of poor clinical outcomes. To better capture the association between frailty and cognitive impairment, a new construct, cognitive frailty, has been proposed. Cognitive frailty is a clinical condition characterized by the simultaneous presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment. There is little evidence on the relationship between physical frailty and cognition, as well as cognitive frailty, in Chinese older adults. We aimed to elucidate whether physical frailty is associated with cognitive impairment in an older Chinese population.Methods: Data were obtained from the China Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Study. The sample comprised 3202 community-dwelling adults, aged 60 years and older, from seven Chinese cities. Physical frailty was assessed using a modified, four-item version of the Fried criteria, according to frailty phenotype. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).Results: The prevalence of physical frailty, prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and cognitive frailty was 9.9, 33.9, 7.5, and 2.3%, respectively (weighted: 8.8, 33.8, 6.5, and 2.0%). The prevalence of the combination of prefrail/frail and cognitive impairment was 5.1% (weighted 4.5%). Frail participants performed worse on global cognition and all cognitive domains than robust and prefrail participants. The MMSE total score was positively correlated with walking speed and negatively correlated with age and frailty. A multivariate logistic regression revealed that after adjusting for age, gender, education level, living area, and chronic diseases, frailty, exhaustion, slowness, and inactivity were significantly associated with poor global cognition.Conclusions: The standard prevalence of physical frailty, prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and cognitive frailty in community-dwelling older adults in China was 8.8, 33.8, 6.5, and 2.0%, respectively. Frailty, exhaustion, slowness, and inactivity were significantly associated with poor global cognition.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Especially patients older than 65 years undergoing surgery are prone to develop frailty-related complications that may go far beyond the index hospitalization (e.g., cognitive impairment following postoperative delirium). However, aging-relevant information are currently not fully integrated into hospitals' perioperative processes.Methods: We introduce a temporal perspective, which focuses on the social construction of time, to better understand existing barriers to the exchange of frailty-related data, targeting complexity research. Our chosen context is perioperative care provided by a tertiary hospital in Germany that has implemented a special track for patients over 65 years old undergoing elective surgery. The research followed a participatory modelling approach between domain and modelling experts with the goal of creating a feedback loop model of the relevant system relationships and dynamics.Results: The results of the study show how disparate temporal regimes, understood as frameworks for organizing actions in the light of time constraints, time pressure, and deadlines, across different clinical, ambulant, and geriatric care sectors create disincentives to cooperate in frailty-related data exchanges. Moreover, we find that shifting baselines, meaning continuous increases in cost and time pressure in individual sectors, may unintentionally reinforce - rather than discourage - disparate temporal regimes.Conclusions: Together, these results may (1) help to increase awareness of the importance of frailty-related data exchanges, and (2) impel efforts aiming to transform treatment processes to go beyond sectoral boundaries, taking into account the potential benefits for frail patients arising from integrated care processes using information technology.</ab>

        <ab>In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

        <ab>OBJECTIVES To summarize available tools that can assist clinicians in identifying and reducing or stopping (deprescribing) potentially inappropriate medications and that specifically consider frailty or limited life expectancy. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. SETTING We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL from inception to December 2017, along with grey literature. We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications. PARTICIPANTS Frail older persons and older persons with limited life expectancy. MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of tools. RESULTS: We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medication‐specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, step‐wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in very low‐quality studies). CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:172–180, 2019.</ab>

        <ab>Mobility is a key aspect of active ageing enabling participation and autonomy into later life. Remaining active brings multiple physical but also social benefits leading to higher levels of well-being. With globally increasing levels of urbanisation alongside demographic shifts meaning in many parts of the world this urban population will be older people, the challenge is how cities should evolve to enable so-called active ageing. This paper reports on a co-design study with 117 participants investigating the interaction of existing urban spaces and infrastructure on mobility and well-being for older residents (aged 55 + years) in three cities. A mixed method approach was trialled to identify locations beneficial to subjective well-being and participant-led solutions to urban mobility challenges. Spatial analysis was used to identify key underlying factors in locations and infrastructure that promoted or compromised mobility and well-being for participants. Co-designed solutions were assessed for acceptability or co-benefits amongst a wider cross-section of urban residents (n = 233) using online and face-to-face surveys in each conurbation. Our analysis identified three critical intersecting and interacting thematic problems for urban mobility amongst older people: The quality of physical infrastructure; issues around the delivery, governance and quality of urban systems and services; and the attitudes and behaviors of individuals that older people encounter. This identified complexity reinforces the need for policy responses that may not necessarily involve design or retrofit measures, but instead might challenge perceptions and behaviors of use and access to urban space. Our co-design results further highlight that solutions need to move beyond the generic and placeless, instead embedding specific locally relevant solutions in inherently geographical spaces, populations and processes to ensure they relate to the intricacies of place.</ab>

        <ab>Drug treatment is often an essential part in treatment and prevention of diseases in older people, but there is much concern about inappropriate medication use. This paper aims to describe the complexity of medication safety issues and clinical judgments when optimizing prescribing in older individuals. It uses the case of Mrs. Hansen, an aged nursing home resident, to illustrate the facilitators and barriers of this process. With decreasing life expectancy, medication use should shift from cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment to increase the patient's well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of (potentially) dangerous medications were reduced, and non-pharmacological alternatives were considered. There were some medicines added, as underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. Deprescribing long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family as "giving up hope". More clinical evidence and practical communication tools are needed to guide deprescribing decisions, taking medical and patient-centered priorities into account. Studies evaluating such interventions should select outcome measures that are particularly relevant for frail old individuals.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community‐dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Current demographic and epidemiological trends highlight a growing task in surgical departments by elderly patients, characterized by high prevalence of comorbidity, complexity, and functional disability. Of consequence, discharge of an elderly patient must be considered in a new cultural perspective and should be imagined as a well-structured process starting from admission to surgical department and finishing with the patient discharge in a setting able to support her/him in the best possible way. The lack of a suitable discharge planning and of a proper transition program in the elderly subjects increases the risk of quick re-admission and may negatively affect the functional and the status quality of life of patients and caregivers. To reduce the risk of negative outcome it is essential a hospital organization dedicated to the discharge of frail older patients considering: (1) adequate attention to assess the comprehensive clinical/social/care conditions; (2) respect of the expectations of the patient and her/his relatives; (3) formalization of institutional roles or teams designated to the planning and coordination of discharge; (4) good knowledge of management programs of transitional care, and (5) strong communication/information ability in patients transition between hospital, home care and community settings.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined by the International Continence Society as any involuntary leakage of urine. It is a common clinical problem, and its incidence increases with age. It is a particular problem in the frail elderly, who can sometimes pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge by virtue of their complexity. UI is a major cause of disability and dependency and adversely affects the psychological and physical health of the older person. However, treatment can lead to significant improvements.</ab>

        <ab>The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical problems. However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and researchers.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives There are limited screening tools to predict adverse postoperative outcomes for the geriatric surgical fracture population. Frailty is increasingly recognized as a risk assessment to capture complexity. The goal of this study was to use a short screening tool, the FRAIL scale, to categorize the level of frailty of older adults admitted with a fracture to determine the association of each frailty category with postoperative and 30-day outcomes. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Level 1 trauma center. Participants A total of 175 consecutive patients over age 70 years admitted to co-managed orthopedic trauma and geriatrics services. Measurements The FRAIL scale (short 5-question assessment of fatigue, resistance, aerobic capacity, illnesses, and loss of weight) classified the patients into 3 categories: robust (score = 0), prefrail (score = 1–2), and frail (score = 3–5). Postoperative outcome variables collected were postoperative complications, unplanned intensive care unit admission, length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and orthopedic follow-up after surgery. Thirty-day outcomes measured were 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality. Analysis of variance (1-way) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare continuous variables across the 3 FRAIL categories. Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Multiple regression analysis, adjusted by age, sex, and Charlson index, was conducted to study the association between frailty category and outcomes. Results FRAIL scale categorized the patients into 3 groups: robust (n = 29), prefrail (n = 73), and frail (n = 73). There were statistically significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidity, dementia, functional dependency, polypharmacy, and rate of institutionalization, being higher in the frailest patients. Hip fracture was the most frequent fracture, and it was more frequent as the frailty of the patient increased (48%, 61%, and 75% in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, respectively). The American Society of Anesthesiologists preoperative risk significantly correlated with the frailty of the patient (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3–4: 41%, 82% and 86%, in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, P &lt; .001). After adjustment by age, sex, and comorbidity, there was a statistically significant association between frailty and both LOS and the development of any complication after surgery (LOS: 4.2, 5.0, and 7.1 days, P = .002; any complication: 3.4%, 26%, and 39.7%, P = .03; in robust, prefrail, and frail groups). There were also significant differences in discharge disposition (31% of robust vs 4.1% frail, P = .008) and follow-up completion (97% of robust vs 69% of the frail ones). Differences in time to surgery, unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day readmission and mortality, although showing a trend, did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Frailty, measured by the FRAIL scale, was associated with increase LOS, complications after surgery, and discharge to rehabilitation facility in geriatric fracture patients. The FRAIL scale is a promising short screen to stratify and help operationalize the perioperative care of older surgical patients.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To examine how medical complexity modifies the relationship between enrollment in Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) home-based primary care ( HBPC) and hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions ( ACSC) for veterans with diabetes mellitus and whether the effect of HBPC on hospitalizations varies according to clinical condition. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting VA and non- VA hospitals. Participants VA beneficiaries aged 67 and older with diabetes mellitus and enrolled in Medicare (N = 364,972). Measurements Instrumental variables regression models were used to estimate the effect of HBPC enrollment on hospitalization for ACSCs (defined according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators) overall and in subgroups stratified according to medical complexity. Models were also estimated for each ACSC to determine which conditions were most sensitive to HBPC. Distance from the veteran's residence to the nearest HBPC site was used as the instrumental variable. Results HBPC was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations (odds ratio ( OR) = 0.35 per person-month, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.30-0.42). For veterans in the highest quartile of medical complexity, HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.93), whereas for those in the lowest quartile, HBPC was associated with more ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 33.2, 95% CI = 4.6-240.1). HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs. Conclusion HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs in veterans with diabetes mellitus but only in the most medically complex individuals. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate targeting and suggests that the effect of HBPC is attributable to its comprehensive approach rather than condition-specific interventions.</ab>

        <ab>The exploration of frailty as a pre-disability geriatric condition represents one of the most promising research arenas of modern medicine. Frailty is today indicated as a paradigmatic condition around which the traditional healthcare systems might be re-shaped and optimized in order to address the complexities and peculiarities of elders. Unfortunately, the lack of consensus around a single operational definition has limited the clinical implementation of frailty in clinical practice. In these last years, growing attention (even beyond the traditional boundaries of geriatric medicine) has been given to physical performance measures. These instruments have shown to be predictive of negative health-related events and able to support an accurate estimation of the 'biological age' in late life. The strong construct of physical performance measures also makes them particularly suitable for the assessment of the frailty status. Furthermore, the adoption of physical performance measures may help render the frailty condition more organ-specific (i.e., centred on the skeletal muscle quality) and less heterogeneous than currently perceived. The translation of the frailty concept by means of physical performance measures implicitly represents an attempt to go beyond traditional paradigms. In this context, the recently funded 'Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies' (SPRINTT) project (largely based on such a novel approach) may indeed fill an important gap in the field and provide key insights for counteracting the disabling cascade in the elderly.</ab>

        <ab>Physical frailty (PF) and sarcopenia are major health issues in geriatric populations, given their high prevalence and association with several adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, the lack of an univocal operational definition for the two conditions has so far hampered their clinical implementation. Existing definitional ambiguities of PF and sarcopenia, together with their complex underlying pathophysiology, also account for the absence of robust biomarkers that can be used for screening, diagnostic and/or prognostication purposes. This review provides an overview of currently available biological markers for PF and sarcopenia, as well as a critical appraisal of strengths and weaknesses of traditional procedures for biomarker development in the field. A novel approach for biomarker identification and validation, based on multivariate methodologies, is also discussed. This strategy relies on the multidimensional modeling of complementary biomarkers to cope with the phenotypical and pathophysiological complexity of PF and sarcopenia. Biomarkers identified through the implementation of multivariate strategies may be used to support the detection of the two conditions, track their progression over time or in response to interventions, and reveal the onset of complications (e.g., mobility disability) at a very early stage.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the development of a conceptual framework for explaining the etiology of violence in later life by various groups involved in the field of elder abuse. In this study, we explore this through eight focus groups with different professionals involved in the field of elder abuse and older persons themselves and in interviews with 35 experts in the field. Our findings show that dependency, vulnerability, power and control, social isolation, stress, and care burden play a central role in their explanations for the occurrence of violence in later life. The role of a history of violence in violence in later life is equivocal. The complexity and ambiguity of dependency and vulnerability, the notion of mutual dependency, and diverse attitudes and expectations toward them that arise with the aging process are distinct features of violence in later life that were found.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) resulting in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is a widespread disease that strongly interferes with the quality of life (QoL) of elderly males. It represents a real clinical and socio-economic problem may be due to the lack of a diagnostic, therapeutic and care pathway (DTCP) tool for LUTS/BPH that considers elderly people population in its whole complexity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the proposed DTCP LUTS/BPH tool. Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 278 patients over 75 years old with non-neurogenic LUTS recruited from February to July 2014 by 10 general practitioners (GP) and two assisted sanitary residences (ASR). Only five GPs and one ASR were provided with the complete DTCP LUTS/BPH tool to create two different groups of patients: group A (138 patients) was treated without the aid of the DTCP; group B (140 patients) was treated according to the DTCP. Results: At 1 year of follow-up, the patients of Group B compared with Group A achieved a greater and significant mean reduction in the questionnaires score (International Prostate Symptom Score, Quick prostate test and QoL) linked to a higher increase in the flowmetry parameters (Qmax) and a lower postvoid residual. Furthermore, in Group B compared to Group A, a greater improvement of hydronephrosis, creatinine values and erectile dysfunction (ED) were obtained at 1 year of follow-up. Conclusion: The encouraging results obtained from this study are significant and support the use of this diagnostic, therapeutic and care tool (DTCP) as the ideal pathway management for elderly men with LUTS associated to BPH and ED. Further studies with greater number of elderly subjects and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm DTCP utility in the clinical management of LUTS/BPH and ED.</ab>

        <ab>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded eligibility for subsidized health insurance, and this has the potential to substantially increase health insurance coverage among persons with disabilities. The increase will depend, at least in part, on the complexity of the application process. To facilitate access, the ACA streamlined the application process for subsidized coverage; however, this did not include disability-based coverage. This article analyzes and describes the application process, identifies complexities, and defines steps to reduce complexities. The following application complexities were identified: (a) the need for applicants to apply separately for cash assistance and subsidized coverage, (b) the need for applicants to determine whether to pursue a disability-based Medicaid determination, and (c) the absence of a way for persons to self-identify their disability on the streamlined paper application form. The analysis indicates that the application process for subsidized coverage is complex and may hinder access among persons with disabilities. We identified operational steps that states and the federal government can take to reduce the complexities and improve access.</ab>

        <ab>This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundThe number of beds in care homes (with and without nurses) in the United Kingdom is three times greater than the number of beds in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective.ObjectivesTo critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes.MethodsA review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose.ResultsFive surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient.ConclusionsHistorical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.</ab>

        <ab>On the road towards personalized treatments for type 2 diabetes, we suggest here that two parameters could be added to the ABCDE algorithm, 'F' for frailty and 'G' for geography. Indeed, the progressive ageing of population is causing a simultaneous increase of frailty worldwide. The identification of the optimal therapeutic approach is often difficult in frail subjects because of the complexity of 'frailty syndrome'. Nevertheless, given the relevance of diabetes in the development and progression of frailty, a safe and effective cure of diabetes is extremely important to guarantee a good medical outcome. There are few data about diabetes treatment in this delicate category of patients, and the choice of the appropriate therapy mostly remains a challenge. Moreover, type 2 diabetes affects more than 382 million people of different countries, races and ethnicities. To face the lack of solid evidence-based medicine for the treatment of diabetes in different ethnic groups, it is extremely important to increase knowledge about the different pathophysiology of diabetes according to ethnicity. In this way, a tailored approach to treatment of various ethnic groups living in the same or different regions can eventually be developed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that leads to impairment in interrelated physiological systems and progressive homeostatic dysregulation in physiological systems.Objective: The focus of the present systematic review was to study the association between the activity of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) and frailty.Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov; the last search was performed in March 2015. Inclusion criteria were: (1) that the studied population was classified for frailty according to a standard definition, such as Fried's criteria; (2) that the study had a nonfrail control group, and (3) that heart rate (HR) and/or heart rate variability (HRV) were parameters of interest in the study.Results: Of the 1,544 articles screened, 54 were selected for full-text review and 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. Assessment of HRV using different standard time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear domain approaches confirmed the presence of an impaired cardiac ANS function in frail compared to nonfrail participants. Furthermore, HR changes while performing a clinical test (e.g., the seated step test or the lying-to-standing orthostatic test) were decreased in the frail group compared to the nonfrail group.Conclusions: The current systematic review provides evidence that the cardiac ANS is impaired in frail compared to nonfrail older adults, as indicated by a reduction in the complexity of HR dynamics, reduced HRV, and reduced HR changes in response to daily activities. Four out of 6 included articles recruited only female participants, and in the other 2 articles the effect of gender on impairment of cardiac ANS was insufficiently investigated. Therefore, further studies are required to study the association between cardiac ANS impairments and frailty in males. Furthermore, HRV was studied only during static postures such as sitting, or without considering the level of activity as a potential confounder. Accordingly, simultaneous measurement of both physiological (i.e., HRV) and kinematic (e.g., using wearable sensor technology) information may provide a better understanding of cardiac ANS impairments with frailty while controlling for activity.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Measures of frailty (Groningen Frailty Indicator, GFI) and case complexity (INTERMED for the Elderly, IM-E-SA) may assist healthcare professionals to allocate healthcare resources. Both instruments have been evaluated with good psychometric properties. Limited evidence has been published about their predictive validity. Thus, our aim is to evaluate the predictive validity of both instruments on healthcare costs.Methods: Multivariate linear regression models were developed to estimate associations between the predictors frailty (GFI) and/or case complexity (IM-E-SA) and the healthcare costs (in € log transformed) in the following year. All models were adjusted for demographics and the presence of morbidity.Results: In the multivariate regression analyses the continuous scores of the GFI and IM-E-SA remained significant predictors for total healthcare costs. Adjusted βs for GFI and IM-E-SA were respectively 0.14 (95% CI 0.10-0.18) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.07). The corresponding explained variance (R(2)) for both models was 0.40. Frailty remained a significant predictor of long-term care costs (adjusted β 0.13 [95% CI 0.09-0.16]), while case complexity was a significant predictor of curative care costs (adjusted β 0.03 [95% CI 0.02-0.05]).Conclusions: The GFI and IM-E-SA both accurately predict total healthcare costs in the following year.</ab>

        <ab>Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background Most older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are frail and have complex care needs. Holistic understanding of residents' health status is key to providing good care. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a valid assessment method which aims to embrace complexity. Here we aimed to study a CGA that has been modified for use in long-term care (the LTC-CGA) and to investigate its acceptability and usefulness to stakeholders and users. Methods This mixed methods study, conducted in 10 LTCFs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, reviewed 598 resident charts from pre- and post-implementation of the LTC-CGA. Qualitative methods explored stakeholder perspectives (physicians, nurses, paramedics, administrators, residents and families) though focus groups. Results The LTC-CGA was present in 78% of LTCF charts in the post -implementation, period though it did not appear in acute care charts of transferred residents, despite the intention that it accompany residents between care sites. Some items had suboptimal completion rates (e.g., Advance Directives at 56.4%), though these were located in other sections of the LTCF chart (98.2%). Nevertheless, qualitative findings suggest the LTC-CGA describes a clinical baseline health status which enabled timely and informed clinical decision-making. Conclusions The LTC-CGA is a useful resource whose full capacity may not yet have been realized.</ab>

        <ab>Transition care is increasingly common for older people, yet little is known about the subjective experience of the transition care 'journey' from the perspective of clients themselves. This study examines how older people cope with frailty within the context of a dedicated transition care programme and discusses implications for improving service delivery. Qualitative in-depth interviews were carried out during 2011 in the homes of 20 older people who had recently been discharged from a transition care programme operating in Adelaide, South Australia (average age 80 years, 65% female). Thematic analysis identified three key themes: 'a new definition of recovery', 'complexities of control' and 'the disempowering system'. Despite describing many positive aspects of the programme, including meeting personal milestones and a renewed sense of independence, participants recognised that they were unlikely to regain their previous level of functioning. For some, this was exacerbated by lacking control over the transition care process while adapting to their new level of frailty. Overall, this research highlighted that benefits associated with transition care can be undermined by fragmentation in service delivery, loss of control and uncertainties around future support.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frailty has emerged as an important predictor of operative risk among elderly surgical patients. However, the complexity of prospective frailty scores has limited their widespread use. Our goal was to develop two frailty-based surgical risk models using only routine preoperative data. Our hypothesis was that these models could easily integrate into an electronic medical record to predict 30-day morbidity and mortality.Study Design: American College of Surgeons NSQIP Participant Use Data Files from 2005 to 2010 were reviewed, and patients 65 years and older who underwent elective lower gastrointestinal surgery were identified. Two multivariate logistic regression models were constructed and internally cross-validated. The first included simple functional data, a comorbidity index based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, demographics, BMI, and laboratory data (ie, albumin &lt;3.4 g/dL, hematocrit &lt;35%, and creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL). The second model contained only parameters that can directly autopopulate from an electronic medical record (ie, demographics, laboratory data, BMI, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score). To assess diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed.Results: There were 76,106 patients who met criteria for inclusion. Thirty-day mortality was seen in 2,853 patients or 3.7% of the study population and 18,436 patients (24.2%) experienced a major complication. The c-statistic of the first expanded model was 0.813 for mortality and 0.629 for morbidity. The second simplified model had a c-statistic of 0.795 for mortality and 0.621 for morbidity. Both models were well calibrated per the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that routine preoperative data can approximate frailty and predict geriatric-specific surgical risk. The models' predicative powers were comparable with that of established prospective frailty scores. Our calculator could be used as a low-cost simple screen for high-risk individuals who might require additional evaluation or specialized services.</ab>

        <ab>Delirium is a common postoperative surgical complication associated with poor outcomes. The complexity of delirium demands that each patient be assessed individually and a tailored prevention and treatment regimen be put in place. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies are available to achieve this goal.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Many frail older adults are thin, weak, and undernourished; this component of frailty remains a critical concern in the geriatric field. However, there is also strong evidence that excessive adiposity contributes to frailty by reducing the ability of older adults to perform physical activities and increasing metabolic instability. Our scoping review explores the impact of being obese on physical frailty in older adults by summarizing the state of the science for both clinical markers of physical function and biomarkers for potential underlying causes of obesity-related decline. We used the 5-stage methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley to conduct a scoping review of randomized trials of weight loss and/or exercise interventions for obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) in older adults (aged &gt;60 years), examining the outcomes of inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid accumulation in muscle, as well as direct measures of physical function. Our initial search yielded 212 articles; exclusion of cross-sectional and observational studies, cell culture and animal studies, disease-specific interventions, and articles published before 2001 led to a final result of 21 articles. Findings of these trials included the following major points. The literature consistently confirmed benefits of lifestyle interventions to physical function assessed at the clinical level. Generally speaking, weight loss alone produced a greater effect than exercise alone, and the best outcomes were achieved with a combination of weight loss and exercise, especially exercise programs that combined aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training. Weight loss interventions tended to reduce markers of inflammation and/or oxidative damage when more robust weight reduction was achieved and maintained over time, whereas exercise did not change markers of inflammation. However, participation in a chronic exercise program did reduce the oxidative stress induced by an acute bout of exercise. Weight loss interventions consistently reduced lipid accumulation in the muscle; however, in response to exercise, 3 studies showed an increase and 2 a decrease in muscle lipid infiltration. In summary, this scoping review identified strong clinical evidence that weight reduction and/or exercise interventions can improve physical function and biomarkers of physical dysfunction among overweight/obese older adults, supporting the suggestion that excessive adiposity contributes to physical frailty. However, the evidence also suggests a complexity of metabolic influences, both systemically and within muscle, which has not been elucidated to date. Considerable further study is needed to examine the mechanisms by which lifestyle interventions influence physical frailty before the net impact of such interventions can be fully understood.</ab>

        <ab>In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.</ab>

        <ab>Working in the patient narrative has become a familiar part of the common language used in the context of caring for patients. Working in the patient narrative encompasses sharing conversation that allows exploration of the entire patient experience as it relates to health and illness. However, the complexity of engaging in end-of-life conversations, standing steady with conflict, remaining present, maintaining neutrality, and actively listening remain challenging concepts in practice even though they are integral to effectively doing so. Literature review has identified and defined key elements of interactions that can lead to significant opportunities to "wander more fully" in the patient narrative.

        <ab>Working in the patient narrative has become a familiar part of the common language used in the context of caring for patients. Working in the patient narrative encompasses sharing conversation that allows exploration of the entire patient experience as it relates to health and illness. However, the complexity of engaging in end-of-life conversations, standing steady with conflict, remaining present, maintaining neutrality, and actively listening remain challenging concepts in practice even though they are integral to effectively doing so. Literature review has identified and defined key elements of interactions that can lead to significant opportunities to 'wander more fully' in the patient narrative. Two case studies reviewed therein demonstrate ways in which palliative care encounters and end-of-life discussions afford the interdisciplinary team members purposeful engagement with patients. One case discusses taking risks to delve more deeply into patient's fears related to dying. This exploration lays the foundation for assuring goals of care are aligned with individual patient values. The other case demonstrates the use of symbols to share dialog related to an individual's tasks of dying. When directed, intentional facilitation occurs, the patient's unique holistic needs and values are identified, and goals of care can be clarified. In conclusion, highlights of research and clinical applications provide advantageous practice implications.</ab>

        <ab>The complexities associated with aging challenge advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to ensure that each patient receives an individualized evaluation. Determining whether the patient should remain in an independent or alternative living environment must be based on respect for the individual's right to self-determination and on the evidence, including assessment of biological, social, and cognitive resources. This determination also must be communicated in a clear and appropriate manner to the patient and family. This article describes the nature of this decision, appropriate assessment strategies, and legal considerations for the APRN who works with elderly patients and their families.</ab>

        <ab>Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by older people, both with and without chronic disease. It is unpleasant and distressing and can affect functioning and quality of life. Fatigue also may inhibit an older person from participating optimally in a physical therapy program aimed at rehabilitation or the promotion of better health. However, confusion surrounds the concept of self-reported aging-related fatigue, not only because of the complexity of the problem itself but also because of lack of clarity of definition and the use of the term 'fatigue' to describe a range of different concepts. This article aims to provide clarification of the concept in the context of physical therapist clinical practice. The intention is to increase awareness of the issue among physical therapists, promoting their assessment and consideration of the problem when planning health interventions involving functioning, physical activity, and exercise for older people.</ab>

        <ab>As the proportion of elderly people in the general population increases, so does the number admitted to critical care. In caring for an older patient, the intensivist has to balance the complexities of an acute illness, pre-existing co-morbidities and patient preference for life-sustaining treatment with the chances of survival, quality of life after critical illness and rationing of expensive, limited resources. This remains one of the most challenging areas of critical care practice.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric medicine has an encyclopaedic sweep, reflecting the complexity of both the ageing process and of our patient group. Keeping up with, and making sense of, the relevant scientific literature is challenging, especially as ageing has increased in prominence as a focus of research across many branches of the sciences and the humanities. This review of research published in 2012 in generalist, geriatric medicine and gerontology journals has been compiled with a view to extracting those aspects of research into ageing which could be considered relevant not only to the practice of geriatric medicine, but also to our understanding of the ageing process and the relationship of geriatric medicine to other medical specialties and public health. The research discussed includes new insights into global ageing and the compression of morbidity; nosological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of dementia; an innovative study on the microbiome and ageing; epidemiological perspectives into multi-morbidity; an overview of the impact of the first waves of Baby Boomers; fresh thinking on geriatric syndromes such as orthostatic hypotension, kyphosis, urinary incontinence after stroke, frailty and elder abuse; an update of the Beers criteria and the first stirrings of recognition of the longevity dividend in the biomedical literature.</ab>

        <ab>Elderly patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer present a complex treatment dilemma. On the one hand, patients can be treated with primary debulking surgery to achieve the ideal oncologic outcomes but at the expense of risk of surgical morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, they can be treated with alternative, less morbid approaches, reducing toxicity, but sacrificing the survival benefits of low residual disease by surgical cytoreduction. Retrospective studies have attempted to identify risk factors for poor surgical outcome. Although there is no consensus to define "elderly" or "frail," current evidence identifies age, performance status, nutritional status, and surgical complexity as major risk factors for surgical morbidity. Accepting the shortcomings of these retrospective data, candidates for primary debulking surgery can be assessed for risk of surgical morbidity. Age is likely a contributor to morbidity, particularly in the face of comorbid conditions. Clinicians should strive to treat elderly patients with a standard approach of primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy when healthy and in the absence of other risk factors. Elderly patients with the following are poor surgical candidates and an alternative treatment approach should be considered: poor nutritional status (characterized by serum albumin &lt;3.0 g/dL), or poor performance status (ASA ≥3), and stage IV disease. Several of these factors are modifiable by treating the underlying cancer. These patients should be treated with two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and reassessed for surgical debulking. Patients with improvement in their nutritional or performance status can undergo interval debulking with the goal to resect all visible disease.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To examine the relationship between ingestive skill performance while eating and drinking and frailty status in acutely-hospitalized elderly patients and to examine whether there is a relationship between the proportion of ingestive skill difficulties and Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) and discharge destination. Methods: Frail (n = 64) and robust (n = 40) acutely-hospitalized elderly patients were assessed using The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment. Results: Forty-three ingestive skills were significantly more affected in frail patients (21.9% to 95.3%) versus robust patients (2.5% to 65.0%). When adjusting for frailty status, difficulties in self-feeding and texture management were related to prolonged LOS, and difficulties in positioning and liquid ingestion were related to discharge to institutional care. Conclusion: Ingestive skill difficulties among acutely-hospitalized frail elderly patients were frequent and characterized by great complexity. This necessitates a broad range of management strategies related to the patients' ability in positioning, self-feeding skills, as well as oropharyngeal sensorimotor skills.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (&lt;4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose DS Care integration has been the hallmark of most proposed solutions to current and prospective challenges of health systems. However, it is an imprecise umbrella term encompassing heterogeneous models and little substantive knowledge exists on the basic mechanisms leading to positive outcomes. This study aims to address this gap by identifying the environmental conditions and the configurations of factors associated with service delivery success in integrated care initiatives. Design/methodology/approach DS On the basis of an extensive literature review, an analytical framework aimed at structuring and interpreting the relations between contextual, cultural and organizational factors and the outcomes of integrated care initiatives is proposed. The framework is applied to four successful cases of care integration in the USA, Canada, Italy and Switzerland. Findings DS The results suggest that positive outcomes mainly depend on the correct matching of macro-level factors with a balanced mix of operating means at the micro-level, rather than on the intense focus on any one element of the framework. Research limitations/implications DS The analysis infers, from a small-purposive sample, that successful initiatives are a matter of appropriate configuration of contextual, organizational and technical factors. Generalizability of results would benefit from additional international cases and using the framework on decentralized health systems. Originality/value DS This framework can guide future research efforts in the field as it is adaptable and relatively easy to operationalize. It can also be a useful tool for practitioners and policy-makers, to bring structure and reduce the complexity of efforts aimed to design, evaluate and improve integrated care initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frailty is a late-life syndrome of vulnerability to adverse health outcomes characterized by a phenotype that includes muscle weakness, fatigue, and inflammatory pathway activation. The identification of biologically relevant pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically relevant pathways that contribute to frailty.Methods: Based on current understanding of the physiological basis of frailty, we hypothesize that variation in genes related to inflammation and muscle maintenance would associate with frailty. One thousand three hundred and fifty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped across 134 candidate genes using the Illumina Genotyping platform, and the rank order by strength of association between frailty and genotype was determined in a cross-sectional study.Results: Although no single-nucleotide polymorphism reached study-wide significance after controlling family-wise false-discovery rate at 0.05, single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), Caspase 8 (CASP8), CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), and beta-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) loci were among those strongly associated with frailty.Conclusions: The apoptosis- and transcription regulation-related pathways highlighted by this preliminary analysis were consistent with prior gene expression studies in a frail mouse model and provide useful etiological insights for future biological studies of frailty.</ab>

        <ab>As nonreplicative cells age, they commonly accumulate subcellular deficits that can compromise function. As people age, they too experience problems that can accumulate. As deficits (symptoms, signs, illnesses, disabilities) accumulate, people become more susceptible to adverse health outcomes, including worse health and even death. This state of increased risk of adverse health outcomes is indistinguishable from the idea of frailty, so deficit accumulation represents another way to define frailty. Counting deficits not only allows grades of frailty to be discerned but also provides insights into the complex problems of older adults. This process is potentially useful to geriatricians who need to be experts in managing complexity. A key to managing complexity is through instruments such as a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which can serve as the basis for routine clinical estimation of an individual's degree of frailty. Understanding people and their needs as deficits accumulate is an exciting challenge for clinical research on frailty and its management by geriatricians.</ab>

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>

        <ab>Currently, an estimated 38 million individuals 65 years or older live in the United States, and more than 11 million of these individuals are 80 years or older. Older people are at high risk of neuropathic pain because many diseases that cause neuropathic pain increase in incidence with age. Depending on their underlying health, older adults with neuropathic pain may have to cope with multiple coexisting diseases, polypharmacy, and impaired functional ability. The objective of this article is to review how aging and frailty affect the treatment of older adults with neuropathic pain. Specific topics reviewed include the complexity of treatment decisions in older patients due to aged heterogeneity, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy; selection of treatment in an effort to maximize patients' functional abilities in addition to relieving their pain; more careful dosing (usually lower) and monitoring of pharmacotherapy relative to younger patients due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; and underrepresentation of older adults in clinical trials of neuropathic pain treatments, which further compromises physicians' ability to make informed treatment decisions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Balance during quiet stance involves the complex interactions of multiple postural control systems, which may degrade with frailty. The complexity of center of pressure (COP) dynamics, as quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE), during quiet standing is lower in older adults, especially those with falls. We hypothesized that COP dynamics from frail elderly individuals demonstrate less complexity than those from nonfrail elderly controls; complexity decreases when performing a dual task; and postural complexity during quiet standing is independent of other conventional correlates of balance control, such as age and vision.Methods: We analyzed data from a population-based study of community-dwelling older adults. Frailty phenotype (nonfrail, prefrail, or frail) was determined for 550 participants (age 77.9 +/- 5.5 years). COP excursions were quantified for 10 trials of 30 seconds each. Participants concurrently performed a serial subtraction task in half of the trials. Complexity of balance dynamics was quantified using MSE. Root-mean-square sway amplitude was also computed.Results: Of the 550, 38% were prefrail and 9% were frail. Complexity of the COP dynamics in the anteroposterior direction was lower in prefrail (8.78 +/- 1.91 [mean +/- SD]) and frail (8.38 +/- 2.13) versus nonfrail (9.20 +/- 1.74) groups (p &lt; .001). Complexity reduced by a comparable amount in all three groups while performing the subtraction task (p &lt; .001). Quiet standing complexity was independently associated with frailty after adjusting for covariates related to balance while sway amplitude was not.Conclusion: Cognitive distractions during standing may further compromise balance control in frail individuals, leading to an increased risk of falls.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frailty in older adults, defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms, is associated with abnormal levels in individual physiological systems. We tested the hypothesis that it is the critical mass of physiological systems abnormal that is associated with frailty, over and above the status of each individual system, and that the relationship is nonlinear.Methods: Using data on women aged 70-79 years from the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and II, multiple analytic approaches assessed the cross-sectional association of frailty with eight physiological measures.Results: Abnormality in each system (anemia, inflammation, insulin-like growth factor-1, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, hemoglobin A1c, micronutrients, adiposity, and fine motor speed) was significantly associated with frailty status. However, adjusting for the level of each system measure, the mean number of systems impaired significantly and nonlinearly predicted frailty. Those with three or more systems impaired were most likely to be frail, with odds of frailty increasing with number of systems at abnormal level, from odds ratios (ORs) of 4.8 to 11 to 26 for those with one to two, three to four, and five or more systems abnormal (p &lt; .05 for all). Finally, two subgroups were identified, one with isolated or no systems abnormal and a second (in 30%) with multiple systems abnormal. The latter group was independently associated with being frail (OR = 2.6, p &lt; .05), adjusting for confounders and chronic diseases and then controlling for individual systems.Conclusions: Overall, these findings indicate that the likelihood of frailty increases nonlinearly in relationship to the number of physiological systems abnormal, and the number of abnormal systems is more predictive than the individual abnormal system. These findings support theories that aggregate loss of complexity, with aging, in physiological systems is an important cause of frailty. Implications are that a threshold loss of complexity, as indicated by number of systems abnormal, may undermine homeostatic adaptive capacity, leading to the development of frailty and its associated risk for subsequent adverse outcomes. It further suggests that replacement of any one deficient system may not be sufficient to prevent or ameliorate frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Discharging frail older people from acute hospital settings has been an issue of concern for over 40 years and recent studies suggest that enduring problems remain. This paper explores the experiences of discharge from three different units: an acute surgical ward, an acute medical ward and a specialist ward for older people. Based on extensive data from interviews with older people, their family carers and ward-based staff, a grounded theory of the discharge experience is presented. This suggests that the quality of discharge hinges largely on whether the focus of efforts is on 'pace' (the desire to discharge older people as rapidly as possible) or 'complexity' (where due account is taken of the complex interaction of medical and wider social issues). When pace is the focus, 'pushing' and 'fixing' are the main processes driving discharge. However, when attention is given to complexity, far more subtle processes of 'informing' and 'brokering' are in evidence. These latter processes are conceived of as forms of 'relational practice' and it is argued that such practices lie at the heart of high quality care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Age-related deterioration in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms leads to decreased complexity in their output. For example, the degradation of cardiac autonomic control results in loss of complexity in the heart rate signal. Frailty is a state of critically impaired homeostasis that results in heightened vulnerability to stressors. We propose a new measure of heart rate variability (HRV) to capture the impairment in cardiac autonomic control associated with frailty.Methods: Traditional time and frequency domain indices of HRV were obtained from 2-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 276 women (65-101 years old) in the Women's Health and Aging Study-I. Principal components analysis was conducted on the correlation matrix of HRV indices. Frailty was defined using a validated instrument. Regression models were used to evaluate associations of HRV measures with age, frailty, and 5-year mortality.Results: The first two principal components (PCs), PC1 and PC2, explained 90% of the variance in HRV indices. PC1 is the mean of log-transformed HRV indices. PC2 is a linear combination of log-transformed indices, with positive weights for very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), and negative weights for high frequency (HF), root-mean-squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and proportion of all N-N intervals that are larger than 50 ms (pNN50). Decreases in SDNN, VLF, LF, and LF/HF were associated with an increased risk of frailty. PC2 was more strongly associated with age (beta = -.23, p &lt; .001) and frailty (beta = -.73, p &lt; 10(-5)) than were the individual HRV indices and LF/HF. PC2 was also the best predictor of 5-year mortality (beta = -.60, p &lt; 10(-6)).Conclusions: Cardiac autonomic control, as reflected by HRV, is impaired in frailty. A new measure derived from PC aggregation of traditional HRV indices provides a compact summary of this impairment.</ab>

        <ab>The clinical approach toward elderly patients is often very complex and associated with an increased risk of medical errors. This case report is an example of how various objective (related to patient) and subjective (related to physicians) factors may influence the optimal diagnostic approach in elderly frail patients. We also discuss geriatric practice, which must be characterized by the intellectual honesty to refuse any sort of prejudices (such as ageism) and by the skill to navigate between the Scylla (ie, viewing clinical problems as unrelated to each other) and the Charibdy (ie, applying the Occam's razor principle) of the patient's complexity.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To assess whether less physiological complexity underlying regulation of heart rate dynamics, as indicated by lower approximate entropy for heart rate (ApEn(HR)), is associated with frailty. For supporting validity, relationships between frailty and traditional linear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were also assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, a community-based observational study, 1992 to 1995. PARTICIPANTS: Subset of 389 community-dwelling women aged years and older with moderate to severe disability with ApEn(HR) data (convenience sampling). MEASUREMENTS: Electrocardiographic Holter recordings obtained over 2- to 3-hour periods were processed for ApEn(HR) and HRV measures. ApEn(HR) is a nonlinear statistic that quantifies the regularity of heart rate fluctuations over time. Lower ApEn(HR) is characteristic of heart rate time series containing a high proportion of repetitive patterns. Frailty was defined according to validated phenotype criteria. RESULTS: Median ApEn(HR) was lower in frail than in nonfrail subjects (P=.02). Lower ApEn(HR) (top quartile) was associated with lower likelihood of frailty than higher ApEn(HR) (bottom three quartiles) (odds ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.26-0.86), even after adjustment for major confounders. Frailty was consistently associated with lower HRV as assessed using time- and frequency-domain indices. CONCLUSION: This study supports the notion that less physiological complexity marks frailty and provides an empirical basis to the concept of frailty as a syndrome of homeostatic impairment. Future research will determine whether noninvasive measures of physiological complexity underlying heart rate dynamics might be useful for screening and monitoring of clinical vulnerability in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>This is a case study of two elderly, frail women in New York City who were recently rendered homeless. One woman had a massive tumor on her occipital scalp; the other was in renal failure. The obstacles and complexities of providing care to those with double jeopardy--being elderly and homeless--are described. There are enormous difficulties for placement into safe, supportive housing once people become homeless. The process is expensive and labor intensive. This can be complicated by the existence of mental illness. A New York agency that works with mentally ill homeless people is described. There are systemic obstacles as well: One woman loses her Medicaid when she moves from one state to another to be closer to her family. Another, 82 years old, is told to get a job so that she could qualify for Medicare. There are numerous contradictions and unnecessary costs in a fragmented health care system to which the obvious solution is a national single-payer system of care.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatricians have embraced the term 'geriatric syndrome,' using it extensively to highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors-older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility-were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.</ab>

        <ab>The majority of deaths in the United States occur in the geriatric population. These older adults often develop multiple chronic medical problems and endure complicated medical courses with a variety of disease trajectories. Palliative care physicians need to be skilled in addressing the needs of these frail elders with life-limiting illness as they approach the end of life. Although geriatrics and palliative medicine share much in common, including an emphasis on optimizing quality of life and function, geriatric palliative care is distinct in its focus on the geriatric syndromes and on the provision of care in a variety of long-term care settings. Expertise in the diagnosis and management of the geriatric syndromes and in the complexities of long-term care settings is essential to providing high-quality palliative care to the elderly patient. This paper is a practical review of common geriatric syndromes, including dementia, delirium, urinary incontinence, and falls, with an emphasis on how they may be encountered in the palliative care setting. It also highlights important issues regarding the provision of palliative care in different long-term care settings.</ab>

        <ab>Frailty in older adults is increasingly a recognized syndrome of decline, sometimes subtle, in function and health that may be amenable to available approaches to care. Frailty manifests the following core clinical features: loss of strength, weight loss, low levels of activity, poor endurance or fatigue, and slowed performance. The presence of 3 or more of these features is associated with adverse outcomes including falls, new or worsened function impairment, hospitalization, and death. In this article, we use the case of Mrs K to describe the challenges of recognizing frailty in clinical practice, common problems and symptoms that frail older adults experience, and approaches to these issues that clinicians may incorporate into their practices. We discuss the importance of advance care planning, provider-patient communication, and appropriate palliative care and hospice referral for frail older adults. Frailty is associated with symptomatic long-term disease, decline in function, and abbreviated survival. Therefore, when frailty is severe, delivery of palliative care focused on relief of discomfort and enhancement of quality of life is highly appropriate. The application of multidisciplinary, team-based palliative approaches and of up-to-date geriatrics knowledge is beneficial for treating these patients because of the complexity of their coexisting social, psychological, and medical needs.</ab>

        <ab>In scenarios that predict the future of health service delivery in the Western world, the rapid increase in frail elderly patients is seen as one of the major challenges of health care in addition to the care of the chronic medically ill. In this article the relation between age, frailty, comorbidity, and disability is elaborated further, a method to detect frail patients quickly is introduced, and its relation to complexity is explored. An argument for patient-tailored integrated care in frail elderly patients is made. At the same time, the argument will be made that standard evidence-based care can be delivered for patients who have a negative screen on frailty. Copyright © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

        <ab>The authors have argued that complexity in general health care is increasingly prevalent because of the increase in patients who have multimorbid conditions, and the increased professional and technical possibilities of medicine. In the increasingly complex care systems, it is necessary-specifically when treating patients in need of integrated care by several providers-that an optimal match between case and care complexity be found in order to prevent poor outcomes in this vulnerable group. The authors discussed several approaches to case complexity that can be identified in the literature. Most of them seem unsuitable for adjusting case and care complexity, and inadequate for designing multidisciplinary care. Theoretic approaches to case complexity may be of interest, but did not result in clinically meaningful information. The INTERMED, which can be considered the first empirically based instrument to link case and care complexity, is an attempt to improve care delivery and outcomes for the complex medically ill.

        <ab>Objectives: Prior research shows that the quality of care provided to vulnerable older persons is suboptimal, but little is known about the factors associated with care quality for this group. In this study, the influences of clinical conditions, types of care processes, and sociodemographic characteristics on the quality of care received by vulnerable older people were evaluated. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Two senior managed care plans. Participants: Three hundred sixty-two community-dwelling patients aged 65 and older identified as vulnerable by the Vulnerable Elder Survey (VES-13). Measurements: Outcome variable: patients' observed-minus-expected overall quality score. Predictor variables: types of care processes, types and number of clinical conditions, sex, age, VES-13 score (composite score of function and self-rated health), income, education, mental health status, and number of quality indicators triggered. Results: Patients whose conditions required more history-taking, counseling, and medication-prescribing care processes and patients with diabetes mellitus received lower-than-expected quality of care. A greater number of comorbid conditions was associated with higher-than-expected quality of care. Age, sex, VES-13 score, and other sociodemographic variables were not associated with quality of care. Conclusion: Complexity, vulnerability, and age do not predispose older persons to receive poorer-quality care. In contrast, older patients whose care requires time-consuming processes such as history taking and counseling are at risk for worse quality of care and should be a target for intervention to improve care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To expand the ability to assess physical frailty by developing a Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty (CGIC-PF) instrument. DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. SETTING: Academic centers. PARTICIPANT:s Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. RESULTS: The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less. CONCLUSION: The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.</ab>

        <ab>Through the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Technology for Successful Aging (RERC-Tech-Aging) elder perspectives on cell phone designs and features were explored. Six-hundred and sixty-five participants (596 elders with disabilities, 69 adults with disabilities) from Northern Florida, Southern California, and Western New York were surveyed through face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, or mailed surveys. The survey addressed satisfaction, importance, frequency of use, methods for learning, barriers to use, views on features, and ways the cell phone had helped. The majority of elders (60%) valued their cell phone, and a large proportion (87%) use the cell phone for emergencies. Only one third of elders reported using their cell phone daily. Suggestions for improving phone design included increasing button size (50% of subjects), increasing display size (29% of subjects), increasing overall size of the cell phone (24% subjects), and decreasing the complexity of the phone.</ab>

        <ab>Under basal resting conditions most healthy physiologic systems demonstrate highly irregular, complex dynamics that represent interacting regulatory processes operating over multiple time scales. These processes prime the organism for an adaptive response, making it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given set of boundary conditions, most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively short periods of time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response mode, which is denoted "reactive tuning." Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in resting dynamics and maladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline and frailty. Nonlinear mathematical techniques that quantify physiologic dynamics may predict the onset of frailty, and interventions aimed toward restoring healthy dynamics may prevent functional decline.</ab>

        <ab>Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in monitoring some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer perceptions and experiences of services and involvement of users/carers in assessment and review. Using data from the study Evaluating Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales receiving community care services, this investigation examines three crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction. This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need to be aware of both the potential and pitfalls associated with using them as a means of assessing the quality of social services for older people.</ab>

        <ab>METHODS: the ability to learn three inhaler techniques of increasing levels of complexity was studied in 50 normal and demented inhaler-naive elderly people (mean age 81 years) with stable 10-point mini-mental test scores (MTS). There were 10 subjects in each of the following groups: MTS 8-10 (non-demented), MTS 7 (borderline), MTS 6 (mild dementia), MTS 5 and MTS 4 (2 moderate dementia groups). The techniques were taught on one day and reassessed on the following day on consecutive days in ascending order of complexity. RESULTS: those with an MTS of 4 were unable to learn any of the techniques, while all the non-demented people could learn all three techniques. For the five-stage technique (standard metered dose inhaler) the 0% threshold (i.e. when none of the subjects was able to learn) was MTS 6, the 50% threshold (at least half but not all could learn) MTS 7 and the 100% threshold (all could learn) MTS 8. For the four-stage technique (inhaler with large spacer) the 0% threshold was MTS 5, the 50% threshold MTS 6 and the 100% threshold MTS 8. For the three-stage technique (inspiration-triggered inhaler) the 0% threshold was MTS 4, the 50% threshold MTS 5 and the 100% threshold MTS 7. CONCLUSIONS: MTS can be used to determine the likelihood of a mild or moderately demented patient being able to learn a multiple-stage inhaler technique.</ab>

        <ab>As society ages, a challenge is presented to health care providers. The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.</ab>
