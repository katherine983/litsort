        <ab>Background Little is known about the prognostic differences between older emergency department (ED) patients who present with different formal support requirements in the community. We set out to describe and compare the patient profiles and patterns of health service use among three older ED cohorts: home care clients, nursing home residents and those receiving no formal support. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of the Canadian cohort from the interRAI multinational ED study. Data were collected using interRAI ED contact assessment on patients 75 years of age and older (n = 2,274), in eight ED sites across Canada. A series of descriptive statistics were reported. Adjusted associations were determined using logistic regression. Results Older adults receiving no formal support services were most stable. However, they were most likely to be hospitalized. Older home care clients were most likely to report depressive symptoms and distressed caregivers. They also had the greatest odds of frequent ED visitation post-discharge (OR=1.9; 95% CI=1.39-2.59). Older adults transferred from a nursing home were the frailest but had the lowest odds of hospital admission (OR=0.14; 95% CI=0.09-0.23). Conclusion We demonstrated the importance of inquiring about community-based formal support services and provide data to support decision-making in the ED.</ab>

        <ab>Background Frail older adults are high users of emergency departments (EDs). Many Canadian EDs have hired Geriatric Emergency Management (GEM) nurses in an effort to improve care to older adults. Methods We conducted a systematic review to determine the impact of GEM nurses on care provided to frail older adults. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases. A grey literature search was also conducted. Inclusion criteria were English-language, evaluation of GEM nurse or geriatric-trained nurse assessments of older adults (age ≥ 65 years) within the ED, and reported clinical and/or health system outcomes. The PRISMA statement was followed, and article quality was assessed using GRADE. Results 5,115 citations and 191 full text articles were screened; 8 articles from 7 different studies were included. Study quality varied between very low to high. Five included studies analyzed the effect of GEM nurses on ED revisits, with most finding they decreased revisits. Four included studies analyzed the effect of GEM nurses on hospital admissions/readmissions, demonstrating variable impact. One study looked at the cost-effectiveness and found the cost to be negligible. The impact on patient-specific outcomes was less clear. Conclusions GEM nurses may be an effective option to help in the management of frail older adults in the ED.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: The lack of coordination of care for complex patients in the hematology setting has prompted nurse case managers (NCMs) to coordinate that care. OBJECTIVES: This article aimed to identify the frequency of NCM care coordination activities and quality and resource use outcomes in the complex care of patients in the hematology setting. METHODS: NCM aggregate data from complex outpatients with hematologic cancer were retrieved from electronic health records at a comprehensive cancer center in the midwestern United States. Total volume of activities and outcomes were calculated as frequency and percentage. FINDINGS: Care coordination activities included communicating; monitoring, following up, and responding to change; and creating a proactive plan of care. Quality outcomes included improving continuity of care and change in health behavior, and resource use outcomes most documented were patient healthcare cost savings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a stakeholder analysis of the strengthening a palliative approach to long-term care (SPA-LTC) model and refine it based on feedback from long-term care (LTC) residents and their families, staff, researchers and decision makers. Methods: We used a mixed-methods design to conduct a stakeholder analysis of the SPA-LTC model that consisted of two sequential components: qualitative focus groups with LTC staff followed by a quantitative survey with key stakeholders. Results: Twenty-one LTC staff provided feedback about the SPA-LTC model after residents relocated to LTC, during advanced illness and at end of life and in the period of grief and bereavement. This feedback helped to guide revisions of the model. According to the survey results, the SPA-LTC model was well received by 35 stakeholders, but its feasibility was questioned. Conclusion: The Canadian SPA-LTC model is evidence based and endorsed by LTC staff and stakeholders. Efforts are needed to determine the feasibility of implementing the model to ensure that residents' needs are made a priority while in LTC.</ab>

        <ab>International organizations, such as the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, recommend integrating comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) into the care of older adult patients with cancer. Geriatric screening and assessment, which are part of the CGA process, detect many geriatric problems related to all geriatric domains, predict survival and toxicity, and influence treatment decisions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depressive symptoms are common in later life and increase both the risk of functional and cognitive decline and the use of healthcare services. Despite older people expressing preferences for talking therapies, they are less likely to be referred than younger adults, particularly when aged ≥80 years.Aim: To explore how healthcare professionals (HCPs) manage older people in relation to depression and referrals to psychological therapies.Design and Setting: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.Method: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Social Sciences Citation Index (inception-March 2018) were searched for studies exploring HCPs' views regarding management of late-life depression across all settings. Studies of older people's views or depression management across all ages were excluded.Results: In total, 27 studies, were included; these predominantly focused on the views of GPs and primary and community care nurses. Many HCPs felt that late-life depression was mainly attributable to social isolation and functional decline, but treatments appropriate for this were limited. Clinicians perceived depression to have associated stigma for older adults, which required time to negotiate. Limited time in consultations and the complexity of needs in later life meant physical health was often prioritised over mental health, particularly in people with frailty. Good management of late-life depression appeared to depend more on the skills and interest of individual GPs and nurses than on any structured approach.Conclusion: Mental ill health needs to be a more-prominent concern in the care of older adults, with greater provision of psychological services tailored to later life. This may facilitate future identification and management of depression.</ab>

        <ab>In Canada, up to 32,000 older adults experience a fragility hip fracture. In Ontario, the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care has implemented strategies to reduce surgical wait times and improve outcomes in target areas. These best practice standards advocate for immediate surgical repair, within 48 hours of admission, in order to achieve optimal recovery outcomes. The majority of patients are good candidates for surgical repair; however, for some patients, given the risks of anesthetic and trauma of the operative procedure, surgery may not be the best choice. Patients and families face a difficult and hurried decision, often with no time to voice their concerns, or with little-to-no information on which to guide their choice. Similarly, health-care providers may experience moral distress or hesitancy to articulate other options, such as palliative care. Is every fragility fracture a candidate for surgery, no matter what the outcome? When is it right to discuss other options with the patient? This article examines a case study via an application of a framework for ethical decision-making.</ab>

        <ab>This case study illustrates the importance of collaboration in complex care across the hospital-community continuum to improve the patient experience The team engaged the patient by building rapport and trust, providing education, and implementing evidence-based care. These contributed to better outcomes for this patient, who had severe chronic venous leg ulceration and poor treatment concordance. Our objectives were to promote ulcer healing and increase treatment concordance by engaging the patient. Engagement was achieved by enhanced communication and the use of technology such as digital photography and advanced wound therapies. The provision of support, education and assessment of advanced skills competence of clinicians across the care continuum achieved our objectives.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to identify accessibility to treatment and health status of hemodialysis patients. Method: quantitative, cross - sectional, descriptive study performed at a nephrology clinic. Data were collected through interviews, analyzed using descriptive statistics and presented in tables of absolute and relative frequency distribution. Results: of the 151 patients, 49.6% were elderly; 54.3% have low schooling; 66.2% have a monthly income of up to two minimum wages; 93.4% have their treatment financed by the Unified Health System, however, 45.7% refer to treatment expenses; 66.9% mention noncompliance with conservative treatment; 84.1% received pre-dialysis care; 84.1% declare their self-perception of health as good and half of them are accompanied by primary health care (50.3%). Conclusion: it is necessary to strengthen the social support network and health care, since the condition of vulnerability characterized elucidates new challenges in the development of actions in health promotion, prevention of complications and in the accessibility and organization of the flow of care.</ab>

        <ab>In Canada, 45% of new cancer cases and 63% of cancer deaths occur amongst Canadians 70 years and older. These older people with cancer and their families present particular needs and concerns that often remain under-recognized and unmet. As the number of older Canadians is expected to more than double in the next 25 years, we must integrate understanding of aging into oncology nursing practice, education, policy, and research, developing models of care that optimize appropriate outcomes for older adults. We present the Canadian Association of Nurses in Oncology (CANO) Oncology and Aging Special Interest Group (SIG), as an initiative to mobilize oncology nurses in addressing these concerns. In an overview of the 2015 CANO conference workshop that launched this group, we highlight practice concerns and priorities identified through interactive discussion with participants. We also describe development of the SIG since 2015, including objectives that will define next steps.</ab>
        <ab>Au Canada, 45 % des nouveaux cas de cancer et 63 % des décès dus au cancer se produisent chez les Canadiens de 70 ans et plus. Ces personnes âgées et leurs familles ont des préoccupations et des besoins particuliers, mais qui demeurent souvent mal reconnus et satisfaits. Or, le nombre de personnes âgées au Canada devrait plus que doubler au cours des 25 prochaines années. Nous devons donc intégrer à notre pratique en oncologie, de même qu'aux politiques, à la recherche et à la formation, une meilleure compréhension du vieillissement, et développer des modèles de soins optimisés et adéquats pour les personnes âgées. Le groupe d'intérêt sur l'oncologie et le vieillissement de l'Association canadienne des infirmières en oncologie (ACIO) est une initiative incitant les infirmières du domaine à se pencher sur ces questions. Nous résumons ici les faits saillants de l'atelier qui a donné le coup d'envoi à ce groupe lors de la conférence annuelle de l'ACIO en 2015 et rappelons les priorités et problèmes liés à la pratique qui ont été relevés pendant les échanges avec les participants. Nous relatons également la façon dont le groupe d'intérêt a évolué depuis sa création et listons les objectifs qui orienteront les prochaines étapes.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to evaluate the occurrence of falls in hospitalized elderly patients who presented high risk for the event. Method: a quantitative, concurrent cohort study, with 96 elderly individuals at risk of falling, using the Fall Risk Score scale. The data was released in the EpiInfo, program version 3.5.1, and performed double typing. Results: 53.13% were female; age between 60 and 95 years; of 24 days, and the incidence of falls during the hospitalization of the 96 elderly was 13.54%. After the final adjustment of the model, the factors associated with the occurrence of falls in the studied sample were: to present cognitive deficits, to have a diagnosis of depression and to use some type of orthosis. Conclusion: the falls are directly linked to the patient's safety indicators, requiring a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach, assessing the risk factors to which the hospitalized elderly are exposed in order to adopt preventive strategies for health maintenance.</ab>

Método: estudio cuantitativo, tipo cohorte concurrente, con 96 ancianos en riesgo de caída, utilizando la escala Fall Risk Score. Los datos fueron lanzados en el programa EpiInfo, versión 3.5.1, y realizada doble digitación. Resultados: 53,13% eran del sexo femenino; edad entre 60 y 95 años; promedio de internación de 24 días, y la incidencia de caída durante la internación de los 96 ancianos fue del 13,54%. Después del ajuste final del modelo, los factores asociados a la ocurrencia de caídas en la muestra estudiada fueron: presentar déficit cognitivo, tener diagnóstico de depresión y utilizar algún tipo de ortesis. Conclusión: las caídas están ligadas directamente a los indicadores de seguridad del paciente, siendo necesaria un abordaje multiprofesional e interdisciplinario, evaluando los factores de riesgo a los que los ancianos hospitalizados están expuestos para que se adopten estrategias preventivas para el mantenimiento de la salud.</ab>

        <ab>Presently only about 9% of seniors over the age of 75 live in residential care facilities but the anticipated exponential growth of the senior population will put increasing pressure on the need for supportive, continuing care services in the years ahead (CIHI 2017a). They are on average 86 years of age with a diagnosis of dementia (67%) and some cognitive and/or functional impairment (98%) (CIHI 2017b). These compromised seniors are also more likely to use hospital services than others, and in many jurisdictions occupy acute care beds for extended periods because ongoing management of their complex conditions is often not possible within long-term care (LTC) homes. In addition, unnecessary and futile care at the end of life often leads to suffering for individuals and their families (Dobbins 2016), which might otherwise be avoided with the presence of institutionally based providers such as nurse practitioners (NPs). Christian and Barker (2009) identified NPs as a valuable resource to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations which often lead to complications and devastating results for seniors. Although evidence of the positive impact of NPs working in LTC facilities dates back to the 1970s, very few organizations have created and obtained funding support for these positions in LTC settings. This case study illustrates the impact of the NP role in a New Brunswick LTC facility; demonstrating the value of a model that includes an NP collaborating with physicians, nurses and allied health professionals. As shown in this case, the presence of an NP clearly impacted a reduction in emergency room visits and hospitalizations, events that more often than not accelerate further physical, mental and functional decline particularly among the frail elderly. Christian and Barker (2009) described the significant consequences of hospitalization for the elderly patient including irreversible decline in function, delirium and exposure to iatrogenic disease. Having an NP available within LTC affords the residents ongoing monitoring that allows for preemptive and proactive care. NPs providing oversight to the collaborative management of the care of LTC residents has the potential to not only realize cost-avoidance for the healthcare system but also enhance the quality of care for residents and their families.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to analyze nursing diagnoses more frequent in the care of institutionalized elderly diabetics. Method: a descriptive study, with a quantitative approach, in a Long Stay Institution for the Elderly, with 12 elderly women, where socio-demographic and clinical issues were used, physical examination guide, Mini Mental State Examination and Katz Scale were used. After the selection, the nursing diagnoses were submitted to a descriptive analysis, in which the defining characteristics and factors related to the identified problem were established. Results: 21 diagnoses were, identified, including risks of falls, aspiration, infection and impaired skin integrity, impaired dentition and memory, and self-care deficits. Conclusion: a Long Stay Institution for the Elderly generates changes related to the accelerated decline of functional and cognitive capacity. The management of nursing care should consider peculiarities of each resident, especially, in the presence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the logistics and acceptability of an electronic medication dispenser (EMD) within a homebased medication management service as a substitute for face-to-face home visiting, to remind elderly clients to take their medication on time. Method: A qualitative usability study methodology was used to conduct this study, which was centred on a small group of clients receiving this service from a community nursing organisation in Christchurch, New Zealand. Clients, pharmacists, nurses and managers of the community nursing service were all actively involved in this process. Findings: The study found the device was useful and acceptable to the clients and the health professionals. The study also identified critical processes and protocols required to safely support a wider roll-out of the product within the service. Ongoing monitoring required to identify "ideal" clients, grow the service and identify potential risks for clients was also developed. This article focuses on the experience of participants in this study, demonstrating the teamwork required to incorporate an electronic product into an existing service involving elderly clients. Conclusion: This usability study recommends the EMD as a viable option for selected clients referred for medications support. The potential benefits outweighed the potential risks and costs for the organisation and clients, and the device was also acceptable for both health professionals and clients.</ab>

        <ab>Inadequate hydration is identified in the literature as placing the elderly at risk of both falls and pressure injuries. This article describes the process and presents the findings of an audit of 34 hospital-level (dependent on 24/7 care) aged residential care clients' hydration over a 24-hour period. The findings of the audit supported the literature that indicates the majority of aged residential care clients do not consume sufficient fluids to maintain adequate levels of hydration. The audit design was a simple process, undertaken primarily by health-care assistants (non-regulated staff). Following the audit findings, strategies were implemented to work with the residents, family and staff to meet daily fluid requirements, using an internationally agreed standard of 30ml of fluid per kilogram of body weight, with a minimum of 1500ml consumed per day.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated relationships among hospitalized elders' perceptions of nurse caring behaviors, the type of unit on which they received care, their satisfaction with nursing care, and their outcome of functional status. A predictive correlational nonexperimental design was used with a sample of 180 subjects, 90 from an acute care elder unit and 90 from a telemetry unit in an acute care medical center where new-nurse orientation included Nurses Improving Care for Health System Elders (NICHE) concepts of care. Elders' perceptions of nurse caring behaviors were correlated with satisfaction with nursing care (r[178] = 0.555, p = .000). Only one of seven hypotheses was supported. Type of care unit had no effect on elders' perceptions of nurse caring behaviors, satisfaction with care, or functional status outcome. Nurses who are taught how to care for acutely ill hospitalized elders are likely to demonstrate nurse caring behaviors that result in satisfaction with nursing care, better functional outcomes, and care quality. This study supports evidence that the NICHE model of care could be the answer to the Institute of Medicine's (2001, 2010) charge to improve the delivery of health care and care quality to vulnerable population of elders.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to understand the beginning of family adaptation to the situation of a disabling disease in selfcare during hospitalization. Method: a descriptive exploratory study of qualitative approach, based on a phenomenological design. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews conducted at three times. The participants were intentionally grouped according to their genogram, considering the total number of family caregivers of patients who became dependent, hospitalized in the medical service of a hospital in northern Portugal. Results: the situation in question is experienced by family caregivers with feelings of fear and powerlessness, causing significant changes in their personal, labor and social life, with repercussion in family functioning. Conclusion: in caregiving, the relation is still individual-centered, and the family is seen as a unit that can be divided into parts.</ab>

Método: estudio exploratorio-descriptivo, de abordaje cualitativo, con acercamiento a la fenomenología. Datos generados a partir de entrevista semiestructurada en tres momentos. Los participantes fueron agrupados intencionalmente a partir del genograma, considerando el número total de cuidadores familiares que se convirtieron en dependientes, internados en el servicio de medicina de un hospital del norte de Portugal. Resultados: la situación en cuestión es experimentada por los cuidadores familiares con sentimientos de miedo e impotencia, generando esto múltiples cambios significativos en su vida personal, laboral y social; con repercusiones en el funcionamiento familiar. Conclusión: en el proceso del cuidar, la relación establecida está, aún, enfocada en el individuo, y la familia es vista como una unidad divisible en partes.</ab>

        <ab>This qualitative study used the method of oral history - thematic modality - aimed to comprehend existing relationships in the process of resignification of life on the street from the diagnosis of a socially stigmatizing disease. It was developed in a Shelter Center, with five homeless people, who have a socially stigmatizing disease. From the analysis, two categories emerged: The stigmatizing disease; Resignifying life. We inferred that to have a stigmatizing disease, prejudice and fear contributes with the frailty of social bonds, it broadens personal vulnerabilities and chances to start and/or perpetuate life on the street. The self-knowledge about the disease and the reflection about one's own finitude contribute with resignification of life. The symbolisms involved in each of the discussed diseases are little sensitive to public polices interventions for this matter.</ab>

        <ab>The objective was to compare the prevalence and factors associated with functional incapacity for BADLs in elderly residing in two institutional modalities. A cross-sectional study with 159 seniors from long term permanence institutions, being 84 resident of Nursing Homes and 75 in Integral Permanence Homes. The functional incapacity (FI) was assessed by the Katz index. The associations were investigated using the χ² Test or Fisher's exact Test. The prevalence of FI in Nursing Homes was 16.7% (CI 95%: 8.0 - 28.8) and 56.0% (CI 95% 44.2 - 68) in Integral Permanence Homes. In the two institutions, hypertension and cataract were prevalent. In Nursing Homes, it was seen an association between FI and age &gt;80 years and the report of musculoskeletal diseases. Depression was statistically significant in both institutions. The most compromised ADLs were to keep continence, to get dressed and to shower. The findings demonstrate a need of interventions with institutionalized elderly, especially those living in integral permanence modality, focused in depression control.</ab>

        <ab>The objectives of this mixed methods study were to: compare the outcomes of discharge planning and follow-up care, for elders with chronic healthcare conditions, among an advanced practice nurse (APN), expert-by-experience nurses, and novice nurses who delivered care through a 'Continuity of Care Program;' and, describe the benefits of APN care services from key stakeholders' (i.e., healthcare colleagues and family caregivers) perspectives. The outcomes of care, compared among the three type of nurse groups, at two-months post-discharge, included: patient outcomes (functional ability, pressure sores, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, acute confusion, and falls); hospital outcomes (emergency room visits, hospital readmission, time between hospital discharge and the first readmission, and length of re-hospitalization stay); and, family caregivers' satisfaction with nursing care. One hundred elderly patients and their respective family caregivers were recruited from the medical wards of a major university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, over 12 months, by way of nursing and medical records, questionnaires, and interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square, one-way ANOVA, and the posthoc Tamhane test, whereas qualitative data were analyzed via content analysis. Even through the results revealed only family caregivers' satisfaction with nursing care was higher for the APN-directed care, compared to the care delivered by the novice and expert-by-experience nurses, benefits of APN practice were noted from the data obtained from key stakeholders.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this pilot study was to prospectively explore the feasibility of engaging family caregivers to electronically report observations of delirium symptoms in community-dwelling older adults with dementia. This study also sought to assess the ability to recruit and retain participants, gauge satisfaction with computerized communication using personal computers or smart phones and describe agreement between family observations of delirium (Family Confusion Assessment Method [FAM-CAM]) and researcher assessments (Confusion Assessment Method [CAM]). Family caregivers accessed an electronic delirium assessment instrument via their personal computer or a study supplied smart phone daily to transmit data. Compliance with daily data transmission of the FAM-CAM was 77%. The family caregivers were generally satisfied with the technology and the task of answering the assessment questions. Out of a total of 13 participants, there were 7 confirmed episodes of delirium in 3 participants in this study. Overall, the CAM and FAM-CAM scores were positively correlated at 0.856 using the Pearson Correlation statistic (p=0.01).</ab>

        <ab>The incidence of end stage renal disease in older persons has been increasing progressively over the last 10 years. Improved survival rates with renal replacement therapy are making this increased prevalence even more pronounced. The usual risks of morbidity and requirements for specialized care associated with older people increase dramatically when they have chronic kidney disease (CKD). It has been seen that the majority of patients in hemodialysis units are over the age of 60, and have significant co-morbidities. Therelationship between older age, chronic disorders and functional dependence (FD) is well known. Accordingly, nursing care planning must be designed with this in mind. The aim of this study was to assess whether the comorbidity associated with CKD modifies FD in patients on hemodialysis. We undertook a prospective longitudinal cohort study of hemodialysis outpatients in Málaga, Spain, using the Barthel test to establish FD and the Charlson comorbidity index to quantify comorbidity. All health events were analyzed to select those study patients with incident comorbidity, understood as the appearance of a new disease that could modify the Charlson comorbidity index, and determine the change in FD. Multivariate linear regression showed that the best model for predicting functional loss was that which considered comorbidity adjusted for age, particularly when it occurred as a result of hospital admission, as it was shown to have an important predictive value for the onset of a decrease in functional dependency scores in patients with CKD.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are at higher risk for developing Alzheimer disease. Physical performance decline on gait and mobility tasks in conjunction with executive dysfunction has implications for accelerated functional decline, disability, and institutionalization in sedentary older adults with aMCI. Objectives. The purpose of this study was to examine whether performance on 2 tests commonly used by physical therapists (usual gait speed and Timed "Up &amp; Go" Test [TUG]) are associated with performance on 2 neuropsychological tests of executive function (Trail Making Test, part B [TMT-B], and Stroop-Interference, calculated from the Stroop Word Color Test) in sedentary older adults with aMCI. Design. The study was a cross-sectional analysis of 201 sedentary older adults with memory impairment participating in a longitudinal intervention study of cognitive function, aging, exercise, and health promotion. Methods. Physical performance speed on gait and mobility tasks was measured via usual gait speed and the TUG (at fast pace). Executive function was measured with the TMT-B and Stroop-Interference measures. Results. Applying multiple linear regression, usual gait speed was associated with executive function on both the TMT-B (β=-0.215, P.003) and Stroop-Interference ( 0.195, P.01) measures, indicating that slower usual gait speed was associated with lower executive function performance. Timed "Up &amp; Go" Test scores (in logarithmic transformation) also were associated with executive function on both the TMT-B (β=0.256, P.001) and Stroop-Interference (β=0.228, P=.002) measures, indicating that a longer time on the TUG was associated with lower executive function performance. All associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, depressive symptoms, medical comorbidity, and body mass index. Limitations. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for inferences of causation. Conclusions. Physical performance speed was associated with executive function after adjusting for age, sex, and age-related factors in sedentary older adults with aMCI. Further research is needed to determine mechanisms and early intervention strategies to slow functional decline.</ab>

        <ab>Injury among older persons is well recognized as a growing problem. We reviewed our level-1 trauma center trauma registry finding that the most frequent presentations among people aged older than 65 years were due to falls and motor vehicle crashes. We surveyed participants at two of our older person injury awareness seminars to identify risk factors. Participants at our out-reach programme have several injury risk factors including polypharmacy for which our programme content has been tailored. We discuss this in relation to the older person injury-prevention literature. Because implementing our out-reach seminars, older person trauma presentations to our trauma center have decreased slightly.</ab>

        <ab>The age of the UK population is increasing, resulting in many people living with multiple long-term conditions, such as diabetes. Many older people who have complex health needs reside in care homes. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of the diabetes-related problems that exist for older people living in care homes, including the barriers to the delivery of high-quality diabetes care. The authors focus on the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines for Care Home Residents with Diabetes (Diabetes UK, 2010), which discusses the shortfalls in delivery of care, identifies possible barriers and their consequences and highlights the tools that can support change.</ab>

        <ab>Quality care for older people with diabetes requires an integrated, multidisciplinary approach by health and social carers to provide a seamless, person-focused service. Although many older people with diabetes live independently, some have specific problems relating to their frailty, comorbidities and impaired cognitive and physical functions. Specific issues relating to the management of diabetes in the older population are associated with these age-related morbidities and disabilities in addition to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes with aging. Effective diabetes services must be commissioned not solely by the NHS but collaboratively by health and social care. In this article, an overview of the prevalence of diabetes in older people is provided and some of the challenges facing healthcare providers in meeting the increased demand on diabetes services are identified. In addition, the author considers the impact of effective team work on improving diabetes care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>As the population ages, risks for cognitive decline threaten independence and quality of life for older adults and present challenges to the health care system. Nurses are in a unique position to advise older adults about cognitive health promotion and to develop interventions that optimize cognition in older adults. A literature review was conducted to provide nurses in mental health and geriatric care with an overview of research related to the promotion of successful cognitive aging for older adults. Research evaluating cognitively stimulating lifestyles and the effects on cognitive function in older adults of interventions targeting cognitive training, physical activity, social engagement, and nutrition were reviewed. Overall research findings support positive effects of cognitive and physical activity, social engagement, and therapeutic nutrition in optimizing cognitive aging. However, the strength of the evidence is limited by research designs. Applications for health promotion to optimize cognitive aging and future directions for research are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the experiences of older people living with heart failure and their transitions from independence to dependence and for some death. New Zealand's ageing population is predicted to increase from 12% in 2001 to 25% by the year 2051, similar to the worldwide trend of ageing. A high proportion of these people will have one or more chronic illnesses. Associated with the increase in survival is a growing body of research examining the needs of the older person with heart failure and finding particular problems with end of life care. Older people face many challenges in living with their heart failure, in particular the transition to dependence. To study the transition a longitudinal qualitative study using General Inductive approach was used. Participants were interviewed every 3 months for a 12-month period during 2006-2008. A total of 79 interviews with 25 people were completed. Our findings showed that transition was not a simple linear process with the older person moving from one phase to another; instead their experiences illustrated the complexity of transitions they faced and what helped them to manage these. The older people in this study illustrated the importance of trust in health professionals and believed they would receive good care. Their fears revealed concerns about being a burden as they deteriorate and becoming more dependent. Understanding the complex issues related to transition to dependence can provide health professionals with a framework for assessment and approaches to providing the support required.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In the future, health care services will be challenged by an increasing number of older hospital patients. This prompts a need to focus on and implement a health promoting approach in older people's nursing. Aim: The aim of this exploratory study was to illuminate nurses' reflections about health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients. Method: The study had a qualitative descriptive design. The concepts of health, health promotion and empowerment were initially introduced to nurses before participating in multistage focus group interviews. Two groups of nurses participated in three focus group interviews that were conducted by a moderator and an assistant. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with qualitative content analysis. Findings: The nurses unfolded the theme «diversity and complexity marks health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients » as the latent content in the text. Two categories, «empowerment as balance of power - a twofold relation» and «focusing on the individual person», described the manifest content in the texts. The categories were further supported by sub-categories. Conclusion: The focus group interviews showed the ambiguity and complexity in the interpretation of the concepts -- health promotion and empowerment -- related to the older hospital patient. The findings also indicated that multistage focus group interviews may be a useful tool to develop nurses ' reflections about their clinical practice.</ab>

        <ab>Caring for residents with dementia impose a higher challenge and workload on the nursing staff because of a higher degree of motor function and cognitive decline among the residents. Training in person transfer tasks for nursing staff has mostly been concentrated on ergonomics irrespective of the nature of the resident's functional decline. An increased knowledge about the nursing staffs' experiences of physical workload in dementia care and in how to reduce their physical strain is needed.Aim: The aim of the study was to describe nurse's aids' experiences of physical strain during person transfer tasks at dementia care units.Method: Four focus group interviews with altogether 16 nurses' aids, working at special care units for people with dementia, were performed.Results: The results show that knowledge about the disease and personality of residents in dementia care units can help to decrease the physical strain on nurses' aids in person transfer situations.Nurse's aids need to be flexible when performing transfer tasks to accommodate variations in the resident's functional ability. Physical strain associated with person transfer tasks is not related to the weight of the resident. Misunderstandings because of cognitive decline and communication problems increase physical strain on nurses' aids. Specialized training in person transfer tasks is needed for nurse's aids working in dementia care.Conclusions: These results may serve to guide physiotherapists working in dementia care units in assessing residents' functional ability, in when to use assistive devices and mobility aids and in training and supervising nurse's aids in person transfer tasks.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: This case study describes a quality initiative to minimize restraint in an Australian residential aged care facility.Approach: The process of improving practice is examined with reference to the literature on implementation of research into practice and change management. The differences between planned and emergent approaches to change management are discussed. The concepts of resistance and attractors are explored in relation to our experiences of managing the change process in this initiative. The importance of the interpersonal interactions that were involved in facilitating the change process is highlighted.Implications: Recommendations are offered for dealing with change management processes in clinical environments, particularly the need to move beyond an individual mind-set to a systems-based approach for quality initiatives in residential aged care.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. The aim of this study was to explore experiences with overnight respite care (ORC) of Norwegian carers who provided care to frail elderly awaiting nursing home placement. Background. In many Western countries respite care has become part of health care service provision, and various types of respite care are available. The intent with respite care can be twofold; caring for the care receiver and supporting the carer. Methods. This is a descriptive qualitative study. Interviews were conducted with 15 carers, transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Findings. The carers described various experiences with ORC. If ORC supported the whole family, it was welcomed by carers and experienced as supportive. If ORC did not support the whole family, many carers rejected ORC, and it was experienced as non-supportive. Two categories were constructed: 'experiencing ORC as supportive for the family as a whole' and 'not experiencing ORC as supportive for the family as a whole'. Concluswn. To support more carers, nurses have to listen to carers' experiences about ORC. Nurses need to take responsibility for the family as a whole and provide more flexible ORC services based on both carers' and elderly's needs.</ab>

        <ab>As one of the faster growing segments of the population, over 70 million American citizens will be considered elderly by 2030 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2007). The growth of this group is unprecedented in American history, owing in part to advances in health care research having a positive impact on longevity. Inevitably older adults will likely be more involved in research than ever before. Ethical protection becomes a principal concern when a group, such as the elderly, is identified as vulnerable. This article reviews concepts of autonomy, beneficence, and justice in relation to geriatric research and discusses ethical risks with case studies.</ab>
