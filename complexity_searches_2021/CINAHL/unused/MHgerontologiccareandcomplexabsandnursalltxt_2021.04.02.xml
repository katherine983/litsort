        <ab>Background: Evidence to guide clinical decision making for pain management in nursing home residents is scant. Objective: Our objective was to explore the extent of consensus among expert stakeholders regarding what analgesic issues should be prioritized for comparative-effectiveness studies of beneficial and adverse effects of analgesic regimens in nursing home residents. Methods: Two stakeholder panels (nurses only and a mix of clinicians/researchers) were engaged (n = 83). During a three-round online modified Delphi process, participants rated and commented on the need for new evidence on nonopioid analgesic regimens and opioid regimens, short-term adverse effects, long-term adverse effects, comorbid conditions, and other factors in the nursing home setting (9-point scale; 1 = not essential to 9 = very essential to obtain new evidence). The quantitative data were analyzed to determine the existence of consensus using an approach from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User's Manual. The qualitative data, consisting of participant explanations of their numeric ratings, were thematically analyzed by an experienced qualitative researcher. Results: For nursing home residents, evidence generation was deemed essential for opioids, gabapentin (alone or with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]), and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs with SNRIs. Experts prioritized the following outcomes as essential: long-term adverse effects, including delirium, cognitive decline, and decline in activities of daily living (ADLs). Kidney disease and depression were deemed essential conditions to consider in studies of pain medications. Coprescribing analgesic regimens with benzodiazepines, sedating medications, serotonergic medications, and non-SNRI antidepressants were considered essential areas of study. Experts noted that additional study was essential in residents with moderate/severe cognitive impairment and limitations in ADLs. Conclusions: Stakeholder priorities for more evidence reflect concerns related to treating medically complex residents with complex drug regimens and included long-term adverse effects, coprescribing, and sedating medications. Carefully conducted observational studies are needed to address the vast evidence gap for nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>Existing research on spousal care focuses on one spouse receiving care from the other, which fails to address the complexity that is created when both spouses experience some impairments. Our study included situations in which one or both spouses have functional impairments when examining the extent to which spouses from the same couple hold a (dis)similar level of functional impairment and whether such within‐couple (dis)similarity has an impact on the spousal care arrangement. A subsample of 1170 older married couples was selected from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study. Descriptive statistics were used for describing the level of each spouse's functional impairment regarding the number of limitations in activities (activities of daily living [ADL]) or instrumental ADL (IADL). Logistic regressions were used to examine whether spousal dissimilarity in functional impairment (dissimilar, similarly low, similarly high) was associated with spousal care arrangement. Within couples with one functionally impaired spouse, the impaired spouse was more likely to receive spousal care when reporting a higher level of ADL/IADL impairment. Within couples with two functionally impaired spouses, the more impaired person was more likely to receive spousal care (without giving back) when spouses reported dissimilar level of IADL impairment; spouses were more likely to report mutual care when they had similarly high levels of IADL impairment. By documenting the role of spousal dissimilarities in functioning for determining spousal care arrangement, our study can inform couple‐based interventions that capitalize on each spouse's capabilities and resources.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To examine the role of frailty in risk of re‐hospitalisation and mortality for aged care residents following a fall injury hospitalisation. Methods: Retrospective analysis of linked hospitalisation and aged care data of adults aged ≥65 years residing in aged care. A semi‐competing risk analysis examined risk of hospital readmission. Results: Residents who had intermediate or high frailty, who were aged 70‐79 or 80‐89 years, who had 1‐2 or ≥3 comorbidities, sustained a hip fracture, and who had either low, moderate or high complex health‐care requirements had a higher risk of being readmitted to hospital. Frailty was not associated with mortality for those with no hospital readmission or mortality after readmission. Conclusion: Frailty is an important prognostic factor associated with readmission for residents of aged care hospitalised for a fall injury. Frailty screening could assist to identify people at a high risk of re‐hospitalisation following a fall injury.</ab>

        <ab>Background Older adults are entering long-term care (LTC) homes with more complex care needs than in previous decades, resulting in demands on point-of-care staff to provide additional and specialty services. This study evaluated whether Project ECHO® (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Care of the Elderly Long-Term Care (COE-LTC)--a case-based online education program--is an effective capacity-building program among interprofessional health-care teams caring for LTC residents. Methods A mixed-method, pre-and-post study comprised of satisfaction, knowledge, and self-efficacy surveys and exploration of experience via semi-structured interviews. Participants were interprofessional health-care providers from LTC homes across Ontario. Results From January--March 2019, 69 providers, nurses/nurse practitioners (42.0%), administrators (26.1%), physicians (24.6%), and allied health professionals (7.3%) participated in 10 weekly, 60-minute online sessions. Overall, weekly session and post-ECHO satisfaction were high across all domains. Both knowledge scores and self-efficacy ratings increased post-ECHO, 3.9% (p = .02) and 9.7 points (p &lt; .001), respectively. Interview findings highlighted participants' appreciation of access to specialists, recognition of educational needs specific to LTC, and reduction of professional isolation. Conclusion We demonstrated that ECHO COE-LTC can be a successful capacity-building educational model for interprofessional health-care providers in LTC, and may alleviate pressures on the health system in delivering care for residents.</ab>

        <ab>To describe long-term care services and supports (LTSS) in the United States, note their limitations in serving older adults post-incarceration, and offer potential solutions, with special consideration for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Narrative review. LTSS for older adults post-incarceration. Literature review and policy analysis. Skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, adult foster homes, and informal care from family and friends compose LTSS for older adults, but their utilization suffers from access and payment complexities, especially for older adults post-incarceration. A combination of public-private partnerships, utilization of health professional trainees, and unique approaches to informal caregiver support, including direct compensation to caregivers, could help older adults reentering our communities following prison. Long-standing gaps in US LTSS are revealed by the coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic. Older adults entering our communities from prison are particularly vulnerable and need unique solutions to aging care as they face stigma and access challenges not typically encountered by the general population. Our review and discussion offer guidance to systems, practitioners, and policy makers on how to improve the care of older adults after incarceration.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence (UI) is a burdensome condition for older adults with diabetes receiving home-care services, yet little is known about the prevalence and correlates of UI in this population. The objective of this cross-sectional study, informed by a complexity model, was to determine the prevalence and correlates of UI in older adults with diabetes receiving home care in Ontario, Canada. In this study, we analyzed population-level data of the most recently completed Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care from 2011 to 2016 for older (≥65 years) home-care clients with diabetes. Older adults with daily or multiple daily episodes of UI were compared with adults who were continent or had less than daily UI on sociodemographic, functional, psychosocial and clinical variables. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine correlates of UI in this population. Of 118,519 older adults with diabetes, 39,945 (33.7%) had daily or multiple daily episodes of UI. Correlates of UI included: impaired function in activities of daily living (odds ratio [OR], 5.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.14‒5.50), cognitive impairment (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 2.28‒2.47), female sex (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.82‒1.93), multiple (≥2) chronic conditions (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.74‒1.93), presence of a distressed caregiver (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.27‒1.35), making economic trade-offs (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11‒1.34) and falls (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19‒1.26). Urinary incontinence is common among older adults with diabetes using home-care services. Targeted interventions are required to address the social, functional and clinical factors associated with UI in this population.</ab>
        <ab>L'incontinence urinaire (IU) est un état de santé contraignant chez les personnes âgées atteintes du diabète qui reçoivent des services de soins à domicile. On en connaît encore peu sur la prévalence et les corrélats de l'IU au sein de cette population. L'objectif de la présente étude transversale, fondée sur un modèle de complexité, était de déterminer la prévalence et les corrélats de l'IU au sein des personnes âgées atteintes du diabète qui reçoivent des soins à domicile en Ontario, au Canada. Dans la présente étude, nous avons analysé les données populationnelles du dernier RAI-HC© (Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care) effectué de 2011 à 2016 auprès de clients âgés (≥ 65 ans) atteints du diabète qui reçoivent des soins à domicile. Nous avons comparé les variables sociodémographiques, fonctionnelles, psychosociales et cliniques des personnes âgées qui avaient des épisodes quotidiens ou des épisodes quotidiens multiples d'IU aux adultes qui étaient continents ou qui avaient des épisodes d'IU moindres que quotidiens. Nous avons utilisé la régression logistique multiple pour déterminer les corrélats de l'IU dans cette population. Parmi les 118 519 personnes âgées atteintes du diabète, 39 945 (33,7 %) avaient des épisodes quotidiens ou des épisodes quotidiens multiples d'IU. Les corrélats de l'IU étaient les suivants : la détérioration du fonctionnement dans les activités de la vie quotidienne (ratio d'incidence approché [RIA], 5,31; intervalle de confiance à 95 % [IC], 5,14‒5,50), la détérioration cognitive (RIA, 2,37; IC à 95 %, 2,28‒2,47), le sexe féminin (RIA, 1,87; IC à 95 %, 1,82‒1,93), les maladies chroniques multiples (≥ 2) (RIA, 1,83; IC à 95 %, 1,74‒1,93), la présence d'un soignant en détresse (RIA, 1,31; IC à 95 %, 1,27‒1,35), les compromis sur le plan économique (RIA, 1,23; IC à 95 %, 1,11‒1,34) et les chutes (RIA, 1,22; IC à 95 %, 1,19‒1,26). L'IU est fréquente chez les personnes âgées atteintes du diabète qui reçoivent des services de soins à domicile. Des interventions ciblées sont nécessaires pour remédier aux facteurs sociaux, fonctionnels et cliniques associés à l'IU dans cette population.</ab>

        <ab>By 2030 more people in the United States will be older than age sixty-five than younger than age five. Our health care system is unprepared for the complexity of caring for a heterogenous population of older adults--a problem that has been magnified by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, as part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we identify six vital directions to improve the care and quality of life for all older Americans. The next administration must create an adequately prepared workforce; strengthen the role of public health; remediate disparities and inequities; develop, evaluate, and implement new approaches to care delivery; allocate resources to achieve patient-centered care and outcomes, including palliative and end-of-life care; and redesign the structure and financing of long-term services and supports. If these priorities are addressed proactively, an infrastructure can be created that promotes better health and equitable, goal-directed care that recognizes the preferences and needs of older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale/aim: Medication administration is a complex and time‐consuming task in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Understanding the time associated with each administration step may help identify opportunities to optimize medication management in RACFs. This study aimed to investigate the time taken to administer medications to residents, including those with complex care needs such as cognitive impairment and swallowing difficulties. Method: A time‐and‐motion study was conducted in three South Australian RACFs. A representative sample of 57 scheduled medication administration rounds in 14 units were observed by a single investigator. The rounds were sampled to include different times of day, memory support units for residents living with dementia and standard units, and medication administration by registered and enrolled nurses. Medications were administered from pre‐prepared medication strip packaging. The validated Work Observation Method By Activity Timing (WOMBAT) software was used to record observations. Results: Thirty nurses were observed. The average time spent on scheduled medication administration rounds was 5.2 h/unit of average 22 residents/day. The breakfast medication round had the longest duration (1.92 h/unit). Resident preparation, medication preparation and provision, documentation, transit, communication, and cleaning took an average of 5 minutes per resident per round. Medication preparation and provision comprised 60% of overall medication round time and took significantly longer in memory support than in standard units (66 vs 49 seconds per resident per round for preparation, 79 vs 58 for provision; P &lt;.001 for both). Almost half (42%) of tablets/capsules were crushed in memory support units. The time taken for medication administration was not significantly different among registered and enrolled nurses. Conclusions: Nurses took an average of 5 minutes to administer medications per resident per medication round. Medication administration in memory support units took an additional minute per resident per round, with almost half of tablets and capsules needing to be crushed.</ab>

        <ab>The emergence of COVID-19 has changed the world as we know it, arguably none more so than for older people. In Sweden, the majority of COVID-19-related fatalities have been among people aged ⩾70 years, many of whom were receiving health and social care services. The pandemic has illuminated aspects within the care continuum requiring evaluative research, such as decision-making processes, the structure and organisation of care, and interventions within the complex public-health system. This short communication highlights several key areas for future interdisciplinary and multi-sectorial collaboration to improve health and social care services in Sweden. It also underlines that a valid, reliable and experiential evidence base is the sine qua non for evaluative research and effective public-health systems.</ab>

        <ab>• We report the "hidden" characteristics that influence geriatric model implementation. • Leadership, planning, and champions are associated with successful implementation. • Staff turnover, lack of resources, and competing demands are implementation barriers. • Reported contextual and organizational attributes may guide future implementers. • Findings highlight complexities of geriatric model uptake, adaptation, and sustainability. Systems Addressing Frail Elders (SAFETM) Care is a geriatric model of care that identifies high-risk hospitalized older adults, and provides targeted interprofessional interventions for risk factors associated with frailty. This post, mixed methods study sought to evaluate SAFETM Care implementation retrospectively at one public academic medical center and describe practical "real-world" considerations for implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). In addition to barriers and facilitators, hidden characteristics to consider for implementation include initiating conditions, skills and experiences of implementers, interpersonal challenges, unique facilitators and barriers, surprising conditions, and threats to and requirements for sustainability. Implementation of SAFETM Care demonstrated effective adoption and implementation, but faced multiple threats that led to failed sustainability. The public sharing of these successes and failures will help implementers understand and make progress in adapting such important geriatric programs and quality improvement initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>• A comprehensive systematic review on person-centered care. • A consensus about the crucial components of person-centered care for older people. • A guide to support policymakers and health care professionals in implementing person-centered care. • A guide to improve the quality of care for older people, particularly for those with complex health care needs. • The crucial components of person-centered care based on Ricœur's philosophy and ethics. of this study was to explore the content and essential components of implemented person-centered care in the out-of-hospital context for older people (65+). A systematic review was conducted, searching for published research in electronic databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Embase between 2017 and 2019. Original studies with both qualitative and quantitative methods were included and assessed according to the quality assessment tools EPHPP and CASP. The review was limited to studies published in English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Spanish. In total, 63 original articles were included from 1772 hits. The results of the final synthesis revealed the following four interrelated themes, which are crucial for implementing person-centered care: (1) Knowing and confirming the patient as a whole person; (2) Co-creating a tailored personal health plan; (3) Inter-professional teamwork and collaboration with and for the older person and his/her relatives; and (4) Building a person-centered foundation. Approaching an interpersonal and inter-professional teamwork and consultation with focus on preventive and health promoting actions is a crucial prerequisite to co-create optimal health care practice with and for older people and their relatives in their unique context.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Agitation in older people is commonly associated with cognitive decline, complex medical diagnoses and polypharmacy. Impaired communication and comprehension within a dementia trajectory adds complexity to assessment and management. Despite high prevalence, agitated behaviours remain challenging to manage in residential aged care settings. Aim: To explore staff perceptions of agitation in residents of aged care facilities, including the influence of dementia, when selecting management strategies to reduce agitated behaviour. Design: Qualitative descriptive. Methods: Semi‐structured interviews with 11 aged care staff were conducted at two aged care sites. Transcripts were examined using content analysis to identify common issues and categories. The study complied with COREQ guidelines (see. Appendix S1). Results: Participants reported managing resident agitation at least once per shift; most frequently manifesting as wandering, restlessness or aggression. Management strategies included distraction, providing space, knowing the resident, identifying causative factors, spending individual time and if necessary medication administration. Agitation management was more challenging for residents with dementia due to impaired communication or comprehension of instruction. Conclusions: While participants strived to deliver individualized person‐centred care, this was difficult given time and resource constraints. Contemporary management of agitation therefore remains variable in everyday practice, with resident preference used when causative factors were known. Conversely, for residents with impaired communication and/or comprehension, distraction and chemical restraint were commonly used. Nuanced education for assessment and management is recommended to better address this unmet need for some residents. Relevance to clinical practice: For optimal care, appropriate allocation of time and resources is necessary to identify causative and contextual factors for individual residents. Recommendations are for additional staff training in communication and attitude, and collaborating with frontline staff to develop a practical guide for management of agitation in aged care. These simple initiatives may help to improve consistency of care delivery and resident outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Advances in healthcare have contributed to population longevity with many older adults living with complex comorbidities, including those in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Nursing staff require knowledge of gerontology, normal ageing processes and expected physiological, psychosocial, function and cognitive changes in addition to health promotion in order to provide individualised care. The complexity inherent in the medical, palliative and basic care needs of the residents makes RACFs excellent places for learning for undergraduate student nurses who undertake clinical placement as part of a Bachelor of Nursing course. Previous research has identified that knowledge of care staff is relatively poor. To explore the knowledge and misconceptions of ageing among first year undergraduate nursing students and aged care staff facilitating a placement during a clinical learning experience. Descriptive cross-sectional design. Three clinical RACFs in Australia. First year nursing students and staff of three different RACFs. Pre and post-test clinical placement surveys. Students and staff completed Palmore's Facts on Ageing Quiz, a 25-item tool to assess knowledge and attitudes of ageing, before commencing the clinical placement and on the last day of a two week placement. Physiological questions were answered correctly. A knowledge deficit was evident from a sociological perspective. Negative attitudes have been found to devalue care and can directly affect the quality of practice in an undesirable way, forming a barrier to effective and therapeutic relationships with older adults, potentially impacting on patient care. From an education provider perspective, the inclusion of activities to enrich the learning activities of nurses within RACF- inclusive of reflective activities and guidance from an expert clinical facilitator - may assist in dispelling negative attitudes and stereotypes of the older adult and increase recognition of the value of working with older adults. • Misconceptions of the older adult were related to sociological aspects of ageing. • Stereotyping older adults devalues care and affects the quality of practice. • Education should focus on learning strategies that promote a positive view of the older adult.</ab>

        <ab>Skin tears frequently occur following a simple trauma, but can become chronic and complex wounds if inappropriately assessed and managed, particularly if on the lower leg. It is important for health professionals, patients and carers to understand the principles of prevention and the importance of fundamental skin care. Identifying those at risk can help with the development of a specific preventive approach. This article offers a brief overview of the International Skin Tear Advisory Panel (ISTAP) best practice recommendations for holistic strategies to promote and maintain skin integrity.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. The aim of this study was to describe emergent approaches to integrated care for older people with complex care needs and investigate the viability of measuring integrated care. Methods. A case study approach was used. Sites were recruited following discussion with senior staff in health and social care agencies. Service arrangements were categorised using a framework developed by the researchers. To investigate joint working within the sites, the development model for integrated care was adapted and administered to the manager of each service. Data were collected in 2018. Results. Six case study sites were recruited illustrating adult social care services partnerships in services for older people with home care providers, mental health and community nursing services. Most were established in 2018. Service arrangements were characterised by joint assessment and informal face-to-face discussions between staff. The development of an infrastructure to promote partnership working was evident between adult social care and each of the other services and most developed with home care providers. There was little evidence of a sequential approach to the development of integrated working practices. Conclusion. Components of partnerships promoting integrated care have been highlighted and understanding of the complexity of measuring integrated care enhanced. Means of information sharing and work force development require further consideration.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There is some evidence that health and social care professional (HSCP) teams contribute to enhanced patient and process outcomes in increasingly crowded emergency departments (EDs), but the views of service users and providers on this model of care need investigation to optimize implementation. Objective: This qualitative study investigated the perspectives of key ED stakeholders about HSCP teams working in the ED. Methods: Using a participatory design, we conducted World Café focus groups and individual interviews in two Irish hospital sites with 65 participants (purposive sampling) including ED patients and carers/relatives, ED doctors and nurses, HSCPs and pre‐hospital staff. Data were thematically analysed using NVivo software. Results: Participants reported that ED‐based HSCP teams could improve quality and integration of care and staff experience (Theme 1) and would be appropriate for older adults with complex needs and non‐urgent complaints (Theme 2). Concerns were raised about operational and relational barriers to implementation (Theme 3), and changes in processes and culture were considered necessary for HSCPs to work successfully in the ED (Theme 4). In contrast to service providers, service users' concerns centred on the importance of positive communication and relations (Theme 5). Conclusions: Our study indicates potential acceptability of HSCP teams working in the ED, especially to care for older adults; however, operational and relational aspects, particularly developing interdisciplinary and integrated care, need addressing to ensure successful implementation. Differences in priorities between service users and providers (relational vs operational) highlighted the usefulness of gathering views from multiple stakeholders to understand ED processes.</ab>

        <ab>Home care for elderly people is an important part of the social welfare system. The sector employs many people, especially women, and work environment issues are common. This review explores the scientific literature on organizational interventions that target the home care work environment. Altogether, 16 studies of varying quality met the inclusion criteria. The interventions identified involved organizational change, education and training, digitalization and scheduling. Many interventions were concerned with changing specific behaviors or with introducing new technology rather than tackling complex issues such as sick leave, stress or gender inequality. Employee participation increased the likelihood of success.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The growing geriatric population has unique and often complex oral health care needs. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions regarding direct access dental hygienists (DH) regarding the geriatric curriculum needed in dental hygiene education programs to prepare DHs to provide direct access care for geriatric populations. Methods: Purposive and network sampling strategies were used to recruit eligible direct access DHs from across the United States for this qualitative study. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted until was met. Demographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Open coding techniques were used to identify themes. Results: Ten direct access DHs agreed to participate. Nine themes emerged from the data analysis: combining didactic and hands-on experience, how direct access differs from traditional practice, importance of a standardized course in entry-level programs, need for a specialty course in geriatrics, understanding the geriatric patient, understanding direct access settings, modifications to treatment modalities, process of care, and interprofessional knowledge. Participants indicated that entrylevel dental hygiene students should be exposed to hands-on clinical rotations, have a standardized aging and geriatrics course, and potentially incorporate geriatrics as a specialty tract within dental hygiene programs. Conclusion: Geriatrics may not be covered in sufficient depth to prepare entry-level dental hygiene students for work with these populations in direct access settings. Findings from this study may be used to support improvements in geriatric curriculum for entry-level dental hygiene programs. Future research is needed to determine necessary focus and most effective way to disseminate this curricular content.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: This study examined sociodemographic and health factors affecting Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) among older adults with osteoarthritis based on the duration of osteoarthritis. Methods: Data were obtained from the Seventh Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (VII-1, 2016; VII-2, 2017). The sample consisted of total 747 older adults with osteoarthritis. The complex sample analysis was performed using an independent t-test, ANOVA, χ² test, and multiple linear regression using the SPSS/WIN 24.0 program. Results: The HRQoL of older adults who had experienced osteoarthritis for 10 years or more was lower than the group who had experienced osteoarthritis for less than 10 years. The most influential factors affecting HRQoL across both groups were subjective health, limit of daily activity, and sickbed experience. Current alcohol consumption and body weight control were factors affecting HRQoL in the group who had experienced osteoarthritis for less than 10 years, while gender, current smoking, and walking were factors affecting HRQoL in the group who had experienced osteoarthritis for 10 years or more. Conclusion: Community nurses should consider the target population and customize interventions based on the duration of osteoarthritis in order to improve HRQoL in older adults with osteoarthritis.</ab>

        <ab>Background The number of older adults with complex health needs in Ontario is growing. The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care requested a resource mapping project to assess the current 2018 and projected 2025 number of specialist physician resources. Methods Geriatric specialist physicians were defined as geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, and Care of the Elderly (COE) physicians. We determined the current number of geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, and COEs and clinical full-time-equivalent complement (CFTE) for geriatric medicine and geriatric psychiatry specialists. We projected the number of new trainees expected to enter practice and the number of physicians expected to retire by 2025. We compared these numbers and projections against established specialist/population ratios for geriatricians and geriatric psychiatrists. Results There was a deficit of geriatricians and geriatric psychiatrists (geriatricians: CFTE deficit of 150.5; geriatric psychiatrists: CFTE deficit of 116.3). In 2025, the projected CFTE deficit of geriatricians will increase to at least 210.35 and geriatric psychiatrists to 194.6. Only about 30% of COE physicians work in direct support of specialized services for the elderly. Conclusions There is significant current and anticipated undersupply in the required number of geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, and COE physicians to meet anticipated population demand.</ab>

        <ab>• We evaluated preparation for future care status in older adults in rural China. • We evaluated depressive symptoms and loneliness in older adults in rural China. • Preparation for future care moderated the effect of loneliness on depressive symptoms. • The results were self-reported and are not generalizable to all over the world. • Preparation for future care can buffer against depressive symptoms among older adults. Loneliness has been identified as a risk factor for depression, while preparation for future care (PFC) can be a protective factor. Little is known about their complex relationships in older adults in China. This study aimed to explore whether PFC moderated the association between loneliness and depression. A total of 481 older adults aged 60 years and above were recruited in rural Shandong, China. After excluding those whose data missing rates were over 15%, data were analyzed for a total of 436 participants. Loneliness, PFC, and depression were measured. Statistical analyses included descriptive analysis, and moderating effects analyses. Our findings showed that PFC and its related dimensions can moderate the relationship between loneliness and depression. When the level of PFC and its dimensions were higher, the effect of loneliness on depression was weaker. PFC should be taken into consideration when interventions are being developed to reduce depression in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The number of older people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, both long‐term and first‐time homelessness, is increasing. The proportion of women facing homelessness within that cohort is also increasing. When combined with complex health needs, appropriate long‐term care options remain limited. This qualitative study conducted in Sydney, Australia, aimed to explore the care needs of older people with comorbid health issues who are facing homelessness and, from this assessment, derive a preferred model of residential aged care. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 29 participants from providers in the aged care and homelessness sectors. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Causal and contextual factors, and consequences surrounding the experience of homelessness, informed the wide range of care needs of this group (model of care), and the organisational resources required to deliver them (management issues and staff). A trauma‐informed approach to care consistently applied by all staff to all processes throughout the care home was recommended. Such an approach would further strengthen existing models of care and take into account both health needs (such as mental health, substance dependence and acquired brain injury) and significant losses through the life course of this vulnerable population.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES To identify the perceived organizational resources required by healthcare workers to deliver geriatric primary care in a geriatric patient aligned care team (GeriPACT). DESIGN Cross‐sectional observational study using deductive analyses of qualitative interviews conducted with GeriPACT team members. SETTING GeriPACTs practicing at eight geographically dispersed Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare systems. PARTICIPANTS GeriPACT clinicians, nurses, clerical associates, clinical pharmacists, and social workers (n = 67). MEASUREMENTS Semistructured qualitative interviews conducted in person, transcribed, and then analyzed using the PACT Resources Framework. RESULTS: Using the PACT Resources Framework, we identified facility‐, clinic‐, and team‐level resources critical for GeriPACT implementation. Resources within each level reflect how the needs of older adults with complex comorbidity intersect with general population primary care medical home practice. GeriPACT implementation is facilitated by attention to patient characteristics such as cognitive impairment, ambulatory limitations, or social support services in staffing and resourcing teams. CONCLUSION: Models of geriatric primary care such as GeriPACT must be implemented with an eye toward the most effective use of our most limited resource‐trained geriatricians. In contrast to much of the literature on medical home teams serving a general adult population, interviews with GeriPACT members emphasize how patient needs inform all aspects of practice design including universal accessibility, near real‐time response to patient needs, and ongoing interdisciplinary care coordination. Examination of GeriPACT implementation resources through the lens of traditional primary care teams illustrates the importance of tailoring primary care design to the needs of older adults with complex comorbidity.</ab>

        <ab>Most transfers of long-term care (LTC) facility residents to the emergency department (ED) via 911 calls are necessary. Avoidable transfers can have adverse effects including increased confusion and dehydration. Around 20% of transfers are perceived to be avoidable or unnecessary, yet decision making around transfers is complex and poorly understood. Using a qualitative-focused ethnographic approach, we examined 20 health care aides' (HCAs) perceptions of decision processes leading to transfer using experiential interview data. Inductive analysis throughout iterative data collection and analysis illuminated how HCAs' familiarity with residents make them vital in initiating care processes. Hierarchical reporting structures influenced HCAs' perceptions of nurse responsiveness to their concerns about resident condition, which influenced communications related to transfers. Communication processes in LTC facilities and the value placed on HCA concerns are inconsistent. There is an urgent need to improve conceptualization of HCA roles and communication structures in LTCs.</ab>

        <ab>The older adult population is the most rapidly growing population in the United States. It is projected that by 2035, the population of adults older than 65 years is expected to be greater than the population of children. The projected number of Veterans age 60 and older is about 11 million. Along with common age-related complex and high-risk chronic medical conditions, care of older adult Veteran requires a holistic approach that focuses on the culture, and subcultures, and unique health care needs resultant of military service. Veterans' health care is often multifocal and complex, requiring an integrated, collaborative, and comprehensive model of care that better facilitates meeting health goals to the degree most realistic and attainable for each older adult Veteran. This highlights the need to promote awareness and provide educational opportunities for engaging in best practices that meet the unique needs of the aging Veteran population.</ab>

        <ab>Measuring the impact of care delivered at home for frail older people is a complex task given many confounding variables that may impact on the ability of service providers to identify the direct impact of their programs on their clients' well-being and quality of life. The recent publication of the 2018 Wellness and Reablement Report Outcomes indicated that organizations lack formal processes to measure the impact of their programs on service users. There are therefore limited data exits on measuring outcomes and the performance of the ACCOM tool in the real world. Knowledge of a strong causal relationship between services provided and outcomes enables confidence in assuming the care provided was largely responsible for the outcome achieved. This paper will reflect on the experiences of one service provider in Brisbane, in implementing the Australian Community Care Outcomes Measurement (ACCOM) tool to measure and demonstrate the impact of their programs.</ab>

        <ab>Help-seeking related to mental health concerns has been found to decrease as age increases. Despite extensive literature devoted to barriers to accessing mental health services, the reasons why older adults are especially unlikely to seek treatment are not well understood. The present study had two objectives concerning the experiences of older adults accessing outpatient psychological treatment: 1) classifying pathways into treatment using the Network Episode Model (NEM; Pescosolido et al., 1998), and 2) critically examining whether these pathways effectively captured the process of seeking treatment for older adults. Utilizing secondary qualitative data from three studies (N = 35), we met our first objective of classifying pathways according to the NEM with directed content analysis. The majority (n = 21, 60%) of older adults willingly accessed treatment (choice) and 42.9% of those involved 'others' in their help-seeking by way of referrals or support. The remaining participants' (n = 14, 40%) pathways into treatment reflected a process of muddling through (being unsure of their need for mental health services and where to access support, or bouncing around the treatment system). No participants' pathways were categorized as coercive. To meet our second objective, we used conventional content analysis to explore how best to categorize pathways to treatment. Findings demonstrated that a minority of participants (n = 10, 28.6%) had a help-seeking journey that represented only one of the three pathways. Instead, most participants described a lengthy period of muddling through, eventually followed by a willingness to seek help. These findings highlight the complex process of seeking treatment, and suggest a need to implement more direct mental health literacy interventions to reduce the amount of time spent muddling through, while improving the experience of mental health help-seeking for older adults. • Mental health treatment seeking is a dynamic and social process. • Older adults accessed mental health services willingly, often supported by others. • Coercion was rare but most older patients "muddled through" treatment seeking. • Increased mental health literacy and collaborative care is likely to improve treatment seeking.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To report on the conceptualisation of a model for residential aged care in Australia. Methods: Three‐stage approach involving initial model conceptualisation; extensive consultation with stakeholders to test and develop the model for feasibility and acceptability; and examination of whether the model addresses circumstances that arise in scenarios of organisational failure. Results: A model consisting of five domains relevant to the experience of older adults living in residential aged care—health care; social inclusion; rights; personal care and re‐ablement; and dementia management. Conclusions: This proposed model of residential aged care takes as its purpose the provision of person‐centred care to older people with complex health issues, requiring end‐of‐life care, and/or living with dementia. This includes supporting dignity of risk and quality of life and enabling older adults to thrive.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: As the population of Australia ages, EDs will experience an increasing frequency of presentations of older adults from residential aged care facilities (RACFs). These presentations are often complex and time consuming in the chaotic and potentially hazardous ED environment. The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention (GEDI) model was developed to optimise the care of frail older adults, especially RACF residents, in the ED. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the GEDI model on the primary outcomes of disposition (admission, discharge or death) and ED length of stay for residents of RACFs, presenting to an ED in regional Queensland, Australia. Methods: GEDI is a nurse‐led, physician‐championed, innovative model delivered by advanced practice nurses with expertise in gerontology. This quasi‐experimental pragmatic study compared outcomes for RACF residents who presented to a regional Queensland ED during three time periods: pre‐GEDI, interim GEDI and post‐GEDI implementation of the GEDI model. Outcomes included disposition, ED length of stay, ED re‐presentation and mortality. Results: A significant increase in the likelihood of discharge from ED (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05–1.26) and reductions in ED length of stay (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.24–1.78) were evident for RACF residents following the implementation of the GEDI intervention. There were no differences in mortality, ED re‐presentation or in‐hospital length of stay between the three time periods. Conclusion: There is a paucity of evidence to support the implementation of nurse‐led teams in EDs designed to target older adults living in RACFs. The GEDI model was effective in reducing ED length of stay while increasing the likelihood of safe discharge for RACF residents.</ab>

        <ab>The complexity of health care systems requires coordination among multiple health care providers to adopt strategies that are congruent with patients' levels of health literacy. In the current study, 12 interdisciplinary members of a Program of All-Inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE) completed the Assessment Questionnaire from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit. Once the questionnaire was complete, organizational priorities were identified and the AHRQ Toolkit was used to develop next steps. Of the five subsets included in the Toolkit, the organization identified three as priorities: (a) development of a health literacy team; (b) improving spoken communication with patients and caregivers; and (c) improving written information given via letters and home instructions. Organizations, nurses, and quality care leaders may find these results useful as they seek to assess organizational literacy and develop improvement plans.

        <ab>Older adults use the Emergency Department (ED) more than any other age group besides infants. Despite high utilization, both the physical environment and care processes in the traditional ED are poorly suited to address the complex needs of older adults. As a result, older adults often experience poor outcomes in the ED. Geriatric nursing has been at the forefront of efforts to develop Geriatric Emergency Department Interventions (GEDI's) to try to address these deficits and improve care. As frontline providers with frequent patient contact, nursing brings critical viewpoints to these issues. This article provides some resources and other ideas for how frontline nurses can improve care for older adults in the ED. Ultimately, to have meaningful impacts on care of older adults in the ED, there is a dire need for greater financial investment specific to geriatric nursing education, training, and research in the ED.</ab>

        <ab>Mastering geriatric nursing skills takes time and its acquisition should start early in undergraduate nursing training. The purpose of this study is to synthesise and evaluate the learning experiences that first-year nursing students had following geriatric patient simulation and practice of clinical patient handover. Qualitative content analysis of survey comments from first-year students (n = 216) at a large university in Norway were performed. Simulation training included systematic patient observation of scenarios based on genuine geriatric cases in nursing homes and practice of clinical patient handover. Content analyses identified four generic categories: (1) 'embodying theoretical knowledge'; (2) 'increased awareness about one's self'; (3) 'understanding that collaboration is needed'; (4) 'preparing for future work life'. These themes provide evidence for students integrating geriatric theoretical knowledge with clinical skills as a result of simulation. Analysis of learning experiences shows that geriatric scenario simulation and practice of clinical patient handover are valuable instruments before entering clinical training with geriatric patients, even for novice students. The use of genuine simulation cases and instruction on the use of clinical handover instruments are effective in producing conceptual changes that prepare students for their first encounter with complex, real-world geriatric scenarios. • Simulation-based learning is a good didactic method for first-year nursing students. • Clinical handover practice is useful when introducing novice students to geriatrics. • Simulation helps to integrate geriatric theoretical knowledge with clinical skills. • Simulation and clinical handover practice lead to conceptual changes. • Conceptual changes help preparing for first encounter with complex, geriatric cases.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To identify factors associated with frequent emergency department (ED) use among older adults with ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using databases from the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec. We included community‐dwelling individuals aged ≥65 years in the Province of Quebec (Canada), who consulted in ED at least once between 2012 and 2013 (index period), and were diagnosed with at least one ambulatory care sensitive condition in the 2 years preceding and including the index date (n = 264 473). We used a multivariate logistic regression model to evaluate the association between independent variables and being a frequent geriatric ED user, defined as four or more visits during the year after the index date. Results: Out of the total study population, 17 332 (6.6%) individuals were considered frequent ED users in the year after the index date, accounting for 38% of ED uses for this period. The main variables associated with frequent geriatric ED use were older age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or diabetes, higher comorbidity index, common mental health disorders, polypharmacy, higher number of past ED and specialist visits, rural residence, and higher material and social deprivation. Dementia was inversely associated with frequent ED use. Conclusions: Frequent geriatric ED users constitute a complex population whose characteristics need to be managed thoroughly in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of their care. Further studies should address their description in administrative databases so as to combine self‐perceived and professionally evaluated variables. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 317–323.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives Poor identification of sensory impairments in care homes can be due to multiple factors. This scoping review identifies and synthesizes the literature into the detection of hearing and vision loss in the care home environment, and the management of these sensory losses once identified. Research Design and Methods A scoping review methodology was used to identify primary research of any design published from 1985 to September 2018. Six electronic databases were searched, and articles were also sourced from reference lists, relevant charity organizations and published experts. Results Six electronic databases and multiple gray literature sources identified 51 articles for inclusion. The evidence confirmed that lack of knowledge in care home staff, poor management of assistive aids, unsuitable environment, lack of connections with optometrists and audiologists, underuse of effective screening tools, and the added complexity of assisting those with dementia are all barriers to effective practice. Conversely, flexible training programs, availability of a variety of assistive aids, simple screening tools, and adaptions to the environment are effective facilitators. Discussion and Implication This review acknowledges that the barriers to identification and management of hearing and vision loss in care homes are multifaceted and that collaboration of multiple stakeholders is required to implement change and improve the residents' ear and eye care. Recommendations are offered to support more effective service provision tailored to meet the needs of people with sensory impairments living in care homes, and this could subsequently improve best practice.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing a healthcare workforce able to respond to the growing complexity of health issues facing older adults is a critical issue for interprofessional educators. Students are in need of experiences promoting confidence and skill in communicating with older adults with cognitive issues. Student emotional and cognitive responses to an interprofessional Music and Memory® project in long term care facilities were evaluated. Forty-eight students met with assigned adults weekly to develop personalized music playlists and complete a journal entry. Student participants demonstrated improved interpersonal connections, enhanced professional skills, and increased empathy toward clients. Results are explored within the context of Kolb's Learning Theory and application of the evaluation outcomes for interprofessional education.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this paper is to explore the process of staff leading change in consumer engagement practice in aged care. Background: Shifting expectations make engagement practice increasingly complex for service providers. This requires adaptive change within organisations. Organisations need to empower and support staff to critically assess practice, identify issues and pursue opportunities for innovation. Method: Data were collected as part of an action research project addressing client engagement practice in Australian aged care. Staff worked together to identify issues for practice, generate solutions and create change within their organisations. Results: Staff identified innovative ways of generating change, demonstrating leadership. However, a range of technical, practical, systemic and philosophical factors impacted their progress. Conclusions: Staff are effective, proactive change agents who can provide valuable insights into directions for their organisations and can lead practice improvement in engagement. However, they require support through the organisational environment. Implications for Nursing Management: Staff in all roles can demonstrate adaptive leadership in changing engagement practice. However, those in traditional roles of authority need to recognize their own roles in showing leadership and supporting adaptive change. This provides a new insight into how managers can support practice change in consumer engagement.</ab>

        <ab>Global population ageing has meant a rapid increase in the numbers of older people with dementia, most of whom live in their own homes. Staying at home is an important determinant of health and well‐being. As care needs increase, the quality of community support which older people receive directly influences their capacity to remain in their own homes. While many are supported informally by family carers, formal support provided by home care workers often enables them to remain at home for longer period. However, providing community‐based care for people with dementia can be challenging. Workers often lack training in dementia‐specific care for clients with increasingly complex needs, and typically work without direct supervision. As the demand for person‐centred home care for people with dementia increases, specialist dementia training for home care workers is urgently needed. In this qualitative study, we used in‐depth interviews of a purposive sample, comprising 15 family carers and four older people with dementia, to understand the experience of receiving community care. Data analysis was guided by Braun and Clarke's approach to thematic analysis and revealed the following five overlapping themes, relating to home care workers' understanding of dementia, person‐centred care, communication and rapport, mutual collaboration, and the influence of organisational constraints on continuity of care. Although participants acknowledged that service providers operated under challenging circumstances, they were frustrated with home care workers' lack of dementia knowledge and inconsistent staff rostering. Conversely, an understanding of the lived experience of dementia, effective communication and rapport, and continuity of care contributed significantly to a positive experience of receiving care. The findings of this study will be used to inform the essential elements of a training program aimed at enabling and empowering a skilled, specialist home care workforce to support older people with dementia to live well at home for as long as possible.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores care practices of older people outside formal care and without appealing to predefined relationships. We conducted interviews with 30 independent‐living men and women aged 67–93 in three municipalities in Sweden. The interviews explored how they cared for themselves and other older people who were not family. Interviews were conducted between December 2017 and May 2018 and later transcribed and analysed using grounded theory. Our paper presents one of the first studies on informal care practices among older people that looks beyond the definition of formal care to understand how such care complements formal care services. The findings show that older people participate in several care arrangements to care for themselves as well as for others. The arrangements feature different types of mutuality and include distant relations to other older people and larger more or less formalised groups. The findings highlight the importance of looking beyond conceptualisations of care based on understandings of formal care and specific relationships as a frame for understanding informal care. To promote older people's health by cultivating and supporting older people's care for themselves and others, research and healthcare practitioners need to explore and acknowledge the significance and complexity of older people's everyday care practices.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There is some evidence that healthcare professionals prefer an interprofessional approach to care and this approach is of particular importance to older people due to their complex needs and multitude of chronic conditions. Objective: This metasynthesis aimed to synthesise and unearth new understandings of the experiences of interprofessional team members that are caring for older people from a variety of qualitative studies. Design: This review is designed as a metasynthesis based on the method put forth by Noblit and Hare for synthesising qualitative research. Data sources: A search for qualitative and mixed methods articles that included healthcare professionals' experiences of caring for older people as a member of an interprofessional team was conducted via an electronic database search of CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. Review methods: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) the method of the study was qualitative or included a qualitative component, (b) an interprofessional team cared for an older person, (c) data regarding interprofessional team members' experiences were gathered, (d) published in English and (e) between the period of 2000 and 2019. Key metaphors were extracted from the data and juxtaposed until themes emerged. Results: A total of 1807 full‐text articles were retrieved and screened via their titles and abstracts. Nine studies were included in this metasynthesis based upon full‐text relevance and meeting the inclusion criteria. Six themes emerged describing the experience of interprofessional team members caring for older people: All for One: Unifying the Team for a Meaningful Purpose; The Cast; A Shared Vocabulary; Collaboration and Integration; A Functional‐Dysfunctional Family and Appreciate the Lifeworld. Team members appreciated this model of care. Conclusions: The emergent themes suggest potential buy‐in from interprofessional team members to this care model for older people. Nursing can assert their unique knowledge and practice into the role as the team leader to mitigate potential barriers and team conflicts. Implications for practice: Interprofessional team members caring for older people can improve their experience. Improved experiences for interprofessional team members can lead to better care for older people. Professionals need specialized training prior to practicing interprofessionally.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: We will provide insights in the theoretical background and key concepts of a Narrative Care approach, such as narrative cultures, narrative curiosity, narrative co‐composition and narrative reflective practice. Background: Care understood as narrative practice underscores the importance of experiences and how these shape identities. Important to the quality of care in institutional care settings is the ability of care providers to cope with complexities and uncertainties in older adults' stories, which can be realised by attending to ways that foster and co‐compose evolving and forward‐looking narratives. Recognising these ongoing co‐compositions means that persons living in institutional care settings and care providers live, tell, retell and relive their experiences. A change in the current institutional culture is necessary to implement care as narrative practice. To support such a change, approaches are needed that foster a focus on experiences and relationships and make relational ethics central to care. Methods: The proposed Narrative Care approach is the result of an iterative development process involving a literature review, interviews with, and observations of, care providers, dialogues with an advisory committee, and consultation with experts. Main contributions: The proposed Narrative Care approach aims to help care providers (a) to recognise the importance of curiosity in a person's verbal and embodied narratives—especially for those living with dementia; (b) to take note of individual experiences in all of their complexity and uncertainty; (c) to respect these narratives; (d) to open up spaces to co‐compose new narratives; and (e) to allow care providers to engage in narrative reflective practices that shape who they are and are becoming. Conclusion: The introduced approach responds to the need of implementing strategies to think and work narratively in institutional care settings. Implications for practice: Narrative Care has the potential to reshape task‐oriented, technical notions of care. Concepts such as embodied narratives, relational ethics, narrative co‐composition and narrative reflective practice must be integrated in the education of all care providers.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to explore family members' perceptions of assisted bodily care in a nursing home. Background: Many older people living in nursing homes need assisted bodily care, provided by assistant nurses. This means exposedness, as the assistance is often provided under stress, but also brings pleasure. Family members, who may wish to and often benefit from continuing to provide assisted bodily care, are perceived as visitors and are expected to relinquish the assisted bodily care to the assistant nurses. Design: This study has a qualitative design with a phenomenographic approach. Methods: Data were collected through semi‐structured interviews (n = 13) with family members of older people who were aged &gt; 80, permanently living in a nursing home, suffering from multimorbidity, and in daily need of assisted bodily care. The data were analysed using a phenomenographic method. Results: Three categories of description presenting an increasing complexity were identified. The family members perceived that assisted bodily care is built upon a respect for the older person's self‐determination, practically supported by assistant nurses, and complemented by family members. Conclusions: In the family members' perceptions, assisted bodily care signifies ambiguity, as they find themselves balancing between the older persons' need for self‐determination and need for help, and, further, between their trust in the assistant nurses' skills and their own perceived inadequacies in intimate assisted bodily care. Implications for practice: Policies that address the family members' role in nursing homes are needed. Furthermore, time for collaboration is needed for assistant nurses to inform and explain care decisions, become aware of the family members' perceptions of their situation and learn from them.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Managing patients in advanced age is complex, especially when it comes to multi-morbidities and polypharmacy. The purpose of this qualitative study is to investigate challenges, opportunities and potential solutions from a primary healthcare provider perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Fifty-seven participants joined in group discussions on challenges and opportunities of working with advanced age. Participants included general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, students and administration staff working in ten general practices. A thematic analysis was developed, supported by NVivo software. Findings: Poor lines of communication and fragmentation of services between differing levels of health care services available for older people were highlighted. This has implications for quality of care and equity of services. Participants also reported challenges in treatment and funding regimes. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size and regional nature of the study, along with the semi-structured nature of the group discussions and rigorous thematic analysis, indicate that this qualitative data is transferable, dependable, confirmable and credible. Comparing the views of tertiary and community services would be useful. Practical implications: A range of potential strategies and solutions to the current fragmented services was offered by GPs. For example, adequately funded and staffed community-based health hubs; IT platforms enabling timely flow of patient information between primary and tertiary health providers and creation of medical, nursing and allied health roles aimed at improving synergy between GP and tertiary services. Originality/value: Obtaining the perspectives of general practice highlights the challenges and complexities of caring for those in advanced age brings. These insights have not been previously been explored in-depth within this setting in New Zealand.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many family care partners are involved in making help‐seeking choices. The aim of this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still maintaining their own dignity. Methods: Data were collected in 2009–2010 in open semi‐structured interviews and follow‐up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an in‐depth data analysis. Results: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the follow‐up of policy for older people.</ab>

        <ab>workforce deficits, requiring a modernised service model for frail older people that moved from individual provider focus to system-wide perspective, with emphasis on proactive care. Methods: Electronic Frailty Index (eFI) in primary care system identified 3,200 out of 300,000 Hull residentsHull with severe frailty. Recruited 9 GPs with extended role in older people’s care and Advanced Nurse Practitioners to support 4 Community Geriatricians. Redesigned roles for pharmacy, social services and non-clinical care coordinator teams. New therapy roles created, multiple third sector organisations involved, including carer support, and purpose-built location with older people in mind. Interventions: Structured and anticipatory comprehensive geriatric assessment of all 3200 residents (either at home or in care homes) by the multidisciplinary multiagency team. Pre-assessment home visit by support worker to complete patient concern’s questionnaire. Dedicated patient transport and one-stop multi-disciplinary team assessment in one building. Proactive discussion of RESPECT and advance care planning, electronic personalised care plan delivered with system-wide record sharing across providers, Same day basic diagnostics available. Complex care coordinators ongoing support in community. Multidisciplinary outreach to care homes and truly housebound. Results: • 99.7% patients and carers extremely likely/likely to recommend the service • 21,000 interventions for 2,500 patients seen since June 2018 • Majority of patients moderately frail by Clinical Frailty Score • Average saving on drug costs - £110.17 /patient/year • 15% reduction in ED attendances, 29% reduction in emergency admissions • Patients’ survey: adequate time and opportunity to discuss health problems/concerns, felt informed and empowered during consultation and in future planning • Very high levels of staff satisfaction Conclusions and future: • Innovative high quality, cost-effective new model of care delivering improved patient care and experience with emphasis on proactive care and future planning • High levels of patient and staff satisfaction • Future expansion with disease specific teams including COPD, parkinsonism and diabetes and targeting moderately frail by eFI. • Redesign of community services with improved integration across teams and providers can be a blue-print for other services.</ab>

        <ab>Topic: Setting up an interface geriatrics service in a seaside area with a large elderly population. Many elderly patients are readmitted due to the challenge of managing their chronic health conditions in the community. These patients are frail, with frequently exacerbated chronic conditions causing regular readmissions. We noted that treatment was rarely changed during these admissions and patients were not uniformly managed. Aims: Aims for this project were to improve care for older people, reduce readmissions and produce clear patient care plans. Interventions: Our first PDSA cycle involved implementing geriatrician presence at community MDTs (involving social services, GPs, intermediate care teams, and various others). This generated home visits to several patients, with amix of acute and chronic issues. We offered Advance Care planning where appropriate to these patients. We noted several patients were repeatedly discussed at MDT. This brought into focus frequent attenders who were usually well-known to the community. In the next cycle we introduced ‘frequent attender’ plans for these patients, ensuring a unified approach to their management. Subsequent cycles involved geriatrician presence at the ‘frequent attenders’ steering group, and further links with community teams. Our primary intervention has been Advance care &amp; frequent attender plans offering tailored management for complex patients. These are completed by a geriatrician discussing patients wishes for treatment and future care. Improvements: Readmission rates show up to 90% reduction in admissions/ED attendances for patients following care plan implementation. Feedback from families and patients is positive – the service is ‘pragmatic and supportive’, delivering ‘empathetic care’. Discussion: Implementing an interface geriatrics service highlights the importance of caring for frail patients in their preferred place of care, reducing unnecessary/inappropriate hospitalisations. Geriatrician presence at community MDTs has improved care by offering prompt access to medical advice and review of complex patients. It highlights patients presenting frequently to services, allowing us to work with patients and families to improve management. A frequent attender list generated by the hospital helps target patients for whom intervention will give significant benefit. We plan to extend this further by working with nursing homes that have high conveyancing rates. The service is being extended to more areas within our region, and we are working with GPs and care homes to further offer advance care planning to vulnerable and frail patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives Minimizing disability is critical to reduce the costly health care associated with disability and maintain quality of life into old age. We examined the effect sizes of nonpharmacological intervention studies in reducing disability and explored the active ingredients of interventions. Research Design and Methods A scoping review was conducted via PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Thirty-one randomized controlled trials were included. Eight active ingredients were identified by three experts (exercise, problem-solving, cognitive behavioral therapy, environmental modification, education, goal setting, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and cognitive training). Results The range of Cohen's d was –0.85 to 1.76 across 31 studies (included 33 interventions); 67% studies (n = 22) obtained small-to-negative effect sizes (d = –0.85 to 0.18), accounting for 83% participants across studies. Interventions that incorporated exercise, problem-solving, cognitive behavior therapy, and environmental modification were associated with stronger effect sizes. Interventions that incorporated comprehensive geriatric assessment obtained small effect sizes. Discussion and Implications Majority of intervention studies found little or no effect in reducing disability for older adults. To optimize the effects of nonpharmacological interventions, we recommend researchers to (i) develop a screening tool for "risk of disability" to inform those who are early on the disability progression, yet not experience any difficulties in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living; (ii) specify the active ingredients embedded in complex interventions to facilitate change in disability; and (iii) select sensitive tools to capture the progression of disability in late life.</ab>

        <ab>Few studies have been conducted on strategies to promote the implementation of complex interventions in nursing homes (NHs). This article presents a pilot study intended to assess the strategies that would enable the optimal implementation of a complex intervention approach in NHs based on the meanings of screams of older people living with Alzheimer's disease. An action research approach was used with 19 formal and family caregivers from five NHs. Focus groups and individual interviews were held to assess different implementation strategies. A number of challenges were identified, as were strategies to overcome them. These latter included interactive training, intervention design, and external support. This study shows the feasibility of implementing a complex intervention to optimize older people's well-being. The article shares strategies that may promote the implementation of these types of interventions in NHs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: An interdisciplinary team-based approach in nursing homes has been suggested in the literature as a strategy for delaying functional decline in residents. Function-focused care is a philosophy-based approach in which interdisciplinary practitioners assess functional capacity and help older adults to optimize and maintain their remaining abilities. Purpose: This study explored and described the shared subjective frames of interdisciplinary practitioners as regards function-focused care for nursing home residents. Methods: Q-methodology was used to analyze the subjectivity of each factor of function-focused care for nursing home residents. Data were collected from August to September 2016. Thirty-four Q-statements were selected and scored by the 30 interdisciplinary practitioners on a 9-point scale with a normal distribution. Data were analyzed using the PQ Method 2.33 program. Results: The results revealed four factors of function-focused care, including (a) using a wait-and-see approach to encourage self-care, (b) maintaining interactive communications to identify and respond to changes, (c) reinforcing residents' inner and outer strengths for homeostasis, and (d) using a tailored approach based on comparisons between the past and the present. Shared subjectivity may provide an important collaborative framework to identify and solve complex problems related to the functional needs of nursing home residents. Conclusions: The results of this study elucidate the subjectivities of interdisciplinary practitioners and better enable their provision of effective care in support of the remaining functional abilities of older adults living in nursing homes. The findings may be used as a reference to establish communication methods and shared documentation for interdisciplinary practitioners in nursing homes and construct interdisciplinary function-focused care practice guidelines.</ab>

        <ab>Background Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are highly prevalent in major neurocognitive disorders and have considerable impacts. Many clinical settings struggle with insufficient knowledge, suboptimal management and excessive use of psychotropic medications. Research aim Given the low availability of specialized staff and the remoteness of some healthcare locations, our aim was to document the effects and the implementation process of a telehealth coaching service on BPSD care. Methods Geriatric specialists at the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal (IUGM) offered a structured training program to distant community care teams through tele-consultation. It involved setting up a BPSD team in each participating community to ensure acquired skills would be sustained. The program proposed a 2-day formal training followed by a monthly complex BPSD case tele-consultation. One of these clinical projects with the Magdalen Islands health centre (MIHC) included a mixed methods research component. We evaluated clinical benefits by comparing Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q), Clinical Global Impression (CGI-I) and psychotropic intake at baseline and three months post tele-consultation, on clinical chart review with non-parametric Wilcoxon analysis. The implementation process was evaluated by open-ended interviews and satisfaction questionnaires. The qualitative data were analyzed using Miles and Huberman's approach. Results Twelve patients were evaluated by tele-consultation. Results showed clinical benefits (decrease of 35% NPI-Q (p=0.024), an improvement on CGI, as well as high satisfaction levels (caregivers and remote team). Eleven open interviews were completed (2 nurses, 3 psychosocial staff, 2 managers, 4 doctors). The project helped to define a better care trajectory for BPSD. Professionals felt a sense of competency and relief from helplessness and isolation. They also described improved patient care (systematic evaluations, individualized interventions integrating non-pharmacological aspects, more appropriate prescriptions). Conclusion These results suggest that tele-consultation is a good way to disseminate expertise concerning BPSD.</ab>

        <ab>Ten thousand Americans turn 65 daily. With age, individuals are confronted by complex medical modalities which can be difficult to understand and potentially burdensome. Historically, clinicians lacked the education, skill, and comfort level to identify the need for and address the patient's goals of care (GoC). Inter-professional content experts convened to develop a comprehensive program to educate and increase the comfort level of clinicians when having GoC conversations. The goal was to provide structured guidance to increase the practitioners' level of confidence in engaging patients/families in these conversations. A multimodal educational methodology using simulation was chosen as a learning strategy permitting clinicians to practice GoC conversations while receiving immediate feedback. A five hour inter-professional educational program called Goals of Care Conversation Education Program® (GoCCEP™) was developed and piloted. The GoCCEPTM's evaluations demonstrate success giving clinicians necessary tools and a safe practice environment increasing knowledge and confidence to have substantive GoC conversations.</ab>

        <ab>The changing age profile of the human population globally means that the requirement for residential long-term care (LTC) for older adults is escalating, with an associated increase in deaths in these facilities. Health care assistants (HCAs), whose main role is provision of direct care to residents, comprise the largest staff cohort in residential care for older adults. The purpose of this scoping review was to explore three key areas related to HCAs: their role and responsibilities, end-of-life (EOL) education, and their views and experiences of caring for residents at EOL. The literature search included five databases and 32 studies were ultimately reviewed. Key issues were as follows: HCAs feel marginalized and undervalued, they need and desire EOL education, and resident deaths impact negatively on them. The changing care needs for older adults with complex comorbidities at EOL in LTC will place an increased onus on HCAs' skills, knowledge, and personal and professional development.

        <ab>Objectives: Australia's aged care workforce is facing pressures due to increased demands from an ageing population. This paper reflects upon whether existing workspace environmental design evaluations are supporting the aged care workforce. Methods: This brief report was informed by a 2018 Optimising Aged Care Workspace Environment Symposium with three streams: (a) Developing, (b) Implementing and (c) Evaluating Aged Care Workspace Environments. Results: Symposium key messages included the following: 'evidence (lived experiences and feedback) from both older people and the aged care workforce needs to inform both development and implementation of aged care environment design'. The Evaluating Aged Care Workspace Environments stream key messages included the following: 'evaluation approaches are required that are responsive and appropriate to the complex dynamic aged care workspace contexts'. Conclusion: To better inform the design of future aged care settings and support the aged care workforce, principles‐focused evaluations of existing aged care settings with input from the aged care workforce are required.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated the complex mechanisms underlying team-based delivery of person- and family-centred care (PFCC) in geriatric home care. Using a realist synthesis approach, an evaluative framework was developed and populated with 159 references from scoping the literature, consulting Canadian experts in PFCC, purposive searching in PubMed/MEDLINE® and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and reviewing grey literature within Canada. References were selected using a two-person review and/or consensus approach and quality appraisal. Data were extracted and synthesized using context, mechanism, and outcome configurations into a theoretical framework of team-based PFCC in geriatric home care. The framework details the predominant discipline-specific contributions of nurses, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists, their collective contributions through communication in the context of a virtual team, and the system-level support required for comprehensive team-based PFCC delivery. Findings from this study could inform improvements to PFCC education, best practice guidelines, and more integrated delivery of PFCC in geriatric home care and other team-based care environments.</ab>
        <ab>RÉSUMÉ: Cette étude a examiné les mécanismes complexes intervenant lors de la prestation de soins axés sur la personne et la famille (SAPF) par des équipes de soins gériatriques à domicile. Une approche par synthèse réaliste a été utilisée pour élaborer un cadre d'évaluation qui a inclus 159 références provenant de la littérature scientifique, des consultations d'experts canadiens en SAPF, des recherches ciblées dans les bases PubMed/MEDLINE® et CINAHL, et des recensions de la littérature grise canadienne. Les références ont été sélectionnées par deux personnes, selon une approche consensuelle avec évaluation de la qualité. Les données ont été extraites et synthétisées en tenant compte du contexte, des mécanismes et des configurations des résultats dans un cadre théorique de SAPF d'équipe pour les soins gériatriques à domicile. Le cadre présente les contributions spécifiques prédominantes des infirmières, des ergothérapeutes et des physiothérapeutes, leurs apports collectifs impliquant des communications pour des équipes virtuelles, ainsi que le soutien du système nécessité pour la prestation de SAPF d'équipe complets.

        <ab>Aims: To examine prevalence, types, challenges and the impact of medical/nursing tasks (MNT) on caregivers of older adults with dementia. Background: Medical/nursing tasks have been perceived as a professional healthcare role; however, research shows that many caregivers of older adults with dementia perform those tasks in the home, such as giving injections, tube feedings or operation of medical equipment. Little is known about the caregivers' challenges in engaging in these MNT. Design: Integrative review. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched to explore MNT among caregivers of older adults with dementia who lived in a community setting. Four quantitative and nine qualitative studies published between 1980–2018 were included. Overall, process of the review was guided by PRISMA. Results: About 67% of U.S. caregivers of older adults with dementia performed MNT, including managing multiple medications, wound care and nutritional management. Care recipients' cognitive impairment complicated the provision of those tasks due to their limited cognitive functioning, behavioural changes, comorbidities and complex medication regimen. Insufficient information and training from healthcare professionals as well as caregivers' age and their own health problems made performance of those tasks even more challenging. As a result, caregivers frequently suffered from emotional distress such as worrying, anxiety and sleep disturbance. Conclusions: Medical/nursing tasks have become one of the daily tasks of caregivers of older adults with dementia within the home. However, the tasks are difficult and complicated, and inadequate support from healthcare professionals may compromise the caregivers' well‐being. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare professionals should provide education and should be aware of caregivers' needs related to MNT. Structured‐medical information, skill‐based instructions and hands‐on training may be beneficial to decrease the caregivers' distress from MNT.</ab>

        <ab>Background Skin and wound care programmes in residential aged care (RAC) facilities are essential to prevent and manage wounds in this complex population. Method A 6-month pilot research study was conducted in two hospital-level RAC facilities using a mixed method and a continuous quality improvement methodology. The first part of this study aimed to determine professional knowledge about, and reporting of, skin tear and pressure ulcers/injuries (PIs) within this setting -- both by nurses and by healthcare assistants (HCA) -- in order to determine educational need in this area of practice. Focus groups were held for both nurses and HCAs, and responses to questions asked in the sessions were analysed. In addition, both of these groups completed knowledge questionnaires in order to determine further educational requirements. This was followed up by a programme of education, including educational resources. Nurse and HCA 'champions' were also recruited to aid programme implementation. Finally, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme, a post-programme reassessment of knowledge using the same focus group questions and knowledge questionnaires was implemented. The number of facility-reported skin tears and PIs were also recorded periodically over 16 months, from 6 months before the start of the programme to 4 months afterwards. Results Retrospective and post-programme PI numbers in both facilities were low. During pre-programme knowledge testing, PI numbers increased in one facility, which may be attributed to an increase in reporting. In both facilities, skin tear numbers declined, and this was maintained 3 months post-programme; this was attributed to the implementation of a skin care regime. The champion role, developed throughout the programme, was also seen as aiding both staff leadership and programme ownership. Conclusion The establishment of an evidence-based skin and wound programme determined from staff-identified practice issues and associated learning needs can improve professionals' knowledge and practice, and can improve resident care. The two programmes were comparable in both facilities and therefore may be transferable to other RAC facilities.</ab>

        <ab>This commentary highlights the importance of health system responsiveness to older people living with complex health needs. Age-related changes and associated morbidity can present barriers to identifying an individual's health needs, expectations, values and preferences, and so sufficient time, skill and resource is required to inform the development of a tailored plan for each individual. A focus on responsiveness moves thinking beyond the responsibilities of the individual clinician in the single encounter, and allows us to identify elements of the wider system that may constrain how well the clinician is able to respond. Setting the goal of responsive health care requires us to assess the suitability of wider health system features and processes for meeting the diverse needs of individual people throughout their journey, and the extent to which the system can adapt dynamically as needs change. Standardised approaches to care prescribed across organisations (such as time-based targets or routinised approaches to inpatient nursing care) are likely to result in low responsiveness as individual complexity grows, disadvantaging patients with needs that do not fit the prescribed approach. Responsiveness is high when individual practitioners and clinical teams have the resources, decentralised authority, flexibility and autonomy to provide the care required. Building a more responsive health system requires a greater understanding of how these conditions can be achieved.</ab>

        <ab>To investigate the impact of a complex multifaceted intervention on the appropriateness of prescribing for Belgian nursing home (NH) residents. A multicenter, nonblinded, cluster-randomized controlled trial, with randomization at the NH level, was set up [Cluster-Controlled Trial of an Intervention to Improve Prescribing in Nursing Homes (COME-ON) Study]. The complex intervention consisted of repeated interdisciplinary case conferences (ICCs) involving the general practitioner, pharmacist, and nurse, aimed at performing a medication review for each NH resident included. The ICCs were supported by a blended training program and local interdisciplinary meetings (discussion of the appropriate use of specific medication classes at the NH level). Control NHs delivered usual care. (isrctn.com: ISRCTN66138978). Belgian NHs with at least 35 NH residents were eligible to participate. Eligible residents were those aged 65 years or over, not receiving palliative care, and being treated by a participating general practitioner. The primary outcome measure related to appropriateness of prescribing at resident level and was considered successful when at least 1 potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) or potential prescribing omission (PPO) present at baseline had been solved at the end of study and when there were no new PIMs or PPOs at the end of study compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes included clinical outcomes, medication use, criterion-specific prevalence of PIMs and PPOs, and ICC outcomes. In total, 54 NHs (24 intervention; 30 control) and 1804 NH residents (847 intervention; 957 control) participated. Using a 3-level mixed-effects model accounting for data clustering, a significant effect in favor of the intervention was observed (odds ratio 1.479 [95% confidence interval 1.062-2.059, P =.021]). There was no significant difference between groups for most clinical outcomes. The median number of medications did not change over time in either group. The complex multifaceted intervention tested in the COME-ON study successfully improved appropriateness of prescribing in NHs.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives Most research on human-animal interaction (HAI) and human health focuses on one of three perspectives: (a) health effects of pet ownership; (b) health effects of contact with a companion animal; or (c) health effects of animal-assisted interventions including animal-assisted therapies, and animal-assisted activities. Methods We reviewed research methods used to address each perspective, within the context of human aging, and identified challenges associated with these methods. Results The complex challenges involved in designing studies to address all three perspectives and examples of research design elements that can be used to alleviate issues raised in each type of study are provided. Discussion and Implications We suggest emerging methodologies that may be helpful for answering important questions from all three perspectives about the relationship of HAI to health outcomes for older adults.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: Nursing home (NH) residents with complex care needs ask for attentive monitoring of changes and appropriate in‐house decision making. However, access to geriatric expertise is often limited with a lack of geriatricians, general practitioners, and/or nurses with advanced clinical skills, leading to potentially avoidable hospitalizations. This situation calls for the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative, contextually adapted nurse‐led care models that support NHs in improving their quality of care and reducing hospitalizations by investing in effective clinical leadership, geriatric expertise, and care coordination. DESIGN: An effectiveness‐implementation hybrid type 2 design to assess clinical outcomes of a nurse‐led care model and a mixed‐method approach to evaluate implementation outcomes will be applied. The model development, tailoring, and implementation are based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). SETTING: NHs in the German‐speaking region of Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven NHs were recruited. The sample size was estimated assuming an average of.8 unplanned hospitalizations/1000 resident days and a reduction of 25% in NHs with the nurse‐led care model. INTERVENTION: The multilevel complex context‐adapted intervention consists of six core elements (eg, specifically trained INTERCARE nurses or evidence‐based tools like Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation [ISBAR]). Multilevel implementation strategies include leadership and INTERCARE nurse training and support. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes are unplanned hospitalizations/1000 care days. Secondary outcomes include unplanned emergency department visits, quality indicators (eg, physical restraint use), and costs. Implementation outcomes included, for example, fidelity to the model's core elements. CONCLUSION: The INTERCARE study will provide evidence about the effectiveness of a nurse‐led care model in the real‐world setting and accompanying implementation strategies.

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to contribute new knowledge about how first line managers (FLMs) in elderly care perceive their situation, with a focus on differences in management approaches at the intersection of the central and local parts of the organization. Design/methodology/approach: The present study has a qualitative approach and is part of a larger project on FLMs in elderly care. The results presented here are based on a secondary analysis of 15 of the total of 28 interviews carried out in the project. Findings: The main results are twofold: the majority of FLMs perceived differences in management approaches between local and central management; the differences caused some struggle because FLMs perceived that the management system did not support the differences. The two main aspects that caused the FLMs to struggle were differences in the foci of the management levels and difficulties in influencing the conditions of management. Originality/value: The results contribute to the debate on what aspects are important to sustainable management of elderly care. It is common knowledge that FLMs have a complex position, intermediate to the central, upper level management and their subordinates at the local level – levels with different foci and interests. The study contributes new knowledge about what these differences consist of and the dilemmas they cause and offers suggestions as to what can be done to reduce both energy waste and the risk of low job satisfaction.</ab>

        <ab>Several studies describe intersectoral collaboration in Western healthcare as hampered by lack of coordination of care and treatment and incoherent patient pathways. We performed an ethnographic study following elderly patients from admission to an emergency unit (EMU) to discharge and further treatment and care at other facilities in the healthcare system. The aim was to explore how health professionals work together across sectors in the Danish healthcare system and how they create patient pathways for elderly patients (+65) with multiple chronic illnesses. Intersectoral collaboration was identified as distant relations between large numbers of health professionals, where communication was conveyed by electronic health record (EHR) formats which promoted information delivery that focused on patients' immediate symptoms. Other significant 'mediators' of communication were the telephone that seemed to resemble face‐to‐face communication and the patient who delivered information from one professional to another. We suggest that the communication among professionals at various facilities interacts with the format and functionalities of the EHRs, which typically fall short in delivery of information across sectors, because the often complex needs of patients with multimorbidity do not fit in with the available functionalities of the EHR.</ab>

        <ab>Pressure injury (PI) prevention is an area of focus for post-acute care organizations. This quality improvement study focused on reducing the number of stage two and above pressure injuries on three complex continuing care hospital units from 0.63% to 0.13% per patient day from April 2018 to March 2019. The advanced practice nursing team implemented three change ideas: 1) quarterly point-of-care nursing-led PI prevalence and incidence studies; (2) standardized positioning plans developed from inter-disciplinary bedside assessments; and (3) revising a current mattress selection algorithm. A six-month planning phase and point-of-care leadership contributed to the project's success.</ab>

        <ab>NHS continuing healthcare is a package of care that is arranged and funded solely by the NHS where an individual has been found to have a 'primary health need'. Individuals who may be eligible have a right to be assessed for NHS continuing healthcare, and this assessment is undertaken by healthcare professionals using a national framework. However, there is a lack of literature on continuing healthcare and its assessment process. The aim was to review the literature on undertaking and providing continuing healthcare in terms of workforce roles, education and training, and competencies. A literature search was undertaken to identify relevant literature on continuing healthcare. Primary searching of electronic internal databases and indices at the Royal College of Nursing and King's College London was used, alongside a further database search and hand searching. A narrative synthesis of the literature was used to synthesise the findings, and a thematic analysis was undertaken to identify themes from the literature. The literature search identified 100 articles, of which 84 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or provided insufficient details in the abstract. A total of 18 articles were included and examined in detail. Four themes were identified in the literature: complexity of care in transitioning care from hospital to home; different care models; importance of education of healthcare professionals; and role of continuing healthcare. Healthcare professionals – including nurses – should receive further training in caring for older people, especially in relation to continuing healthcare. Since there is an increasing ageing population, there is an increasing requirement for continuing healthcare, and thus further research examining all aspects of this care is required.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Working with patients and health care providers to co-design health interventions is gaining global prominence. While co-design of interventions is important for all patients, it is particularly important for older adults who often experience multiple and complex chronic conditions. Persona-scenarios have been used by designers of technology applications. The purpose of this paper is to explore how a modified approach to the persona-scenario method was used to co-design a complex primary health care intervention (Health TAPESTRY) by and for older adults and providers and the value added of this approach. Methods: The persona-scenario method involved patient and clinician participants from two academically-linked primary care practices. Local prospective volunteers and community service providers (e.g., home care services, support services) were also recruited. Persona-scenario workshops were facilitated by researchers experienced in qualitative methods. Working mostly in homogenous pairs, participants created a fictitious but authentic persona that represented people like themselves. Core components of the Health TAPESTRY intervention were described. Then, participants created a story (scenario) involving their persona and an aspect of the proposed Health TAPESTRY program (e.g., volunteer roles). Two stages of analysis involved descriptive identification of themes, followed by an interpretive phase to extract possible actions and products related to ideas in each theme. Results: Fourteen persona-scenario workshops were held involving patients (n = 15), healthcare providers/community care providers (n = 29), community service providers (n = 12), and volunteers (n = 14). Fifty themes emerged under four Health TAPESTRY components and a fifth category - patient. Eight cross cutting themes highlighted areas integral to the intervention. In total, 414 actions were identified and 406 products were extracted under the themes, of which 44.8% of the products (n = 182) were novel. The remaining 224 had been considered by the research team. Conclusions: The persona-scenario method drew out feasible novel ideas from stakeholders, which expanded on the research team's original ideas and highlighted interactions among components and stakeholder groups. Many ideas were integrated into the Health TAPESTRY program's design and implementation. Persona-scenario method added significant value worthy of the added time it required. This method presents a promising alternative to active engagement of multiple stakeholders in the co-design of complex interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background The prevalence of dementia in Ireland is rising. General Practitioners (GPs) play a central role in caring for people with dementia. There is a growing demand for community-based care, emphasized by the Irish National Dementia Strategy (INDS). The INDS advocates a multidisciplinary, community-based approach to dementia care. However, there is a paucity of research exploring GPs' views on dementia since publication of the INDS. The aim of the study is to develop a deeper understanding of how to improve the quality of dementia care in General Practice from the perspective of Irish GPs. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs. GPs who completed a continuing professional development module in Cork on dementia in primary care were purposively recruited. Interviews were analyzed thematically. Analysis was iterative and ongoing with data collection. Results 12 (34.3%) GPs agreed to participate. 10 interviews have been conducted to-date. Participants were evenly distributed by sex (5 male, 5 female). Experience in General Practice varied (3-32 years). Most GPs practiced in mixed urban-rural settings (n=8) and had nursing home commitments (n=7). The average interview length was approximately 45 minutes. Three major themes emerged from the data set: factors promoting care in current practice; resistance to care; and recommendations to improve care. Continuity of care, early disease recognition, coding, audit, and coordinated care teams were recognized as factors promoting quality care. Time, funding, access to secondary care, and inadequate community resources hindered care. GPs emphasized the need for coordinated community services, GP education, review of the chronic disease management scheme for GPs, and service standardization in order to improve care. Conclusion GPs find dementia care to be a complex, challenging aspect of primary care. While education and training is advocated by GPs, service delivery also needs to be reconfigured. Dementia needs to be included under chronic disease management in Ireland and services must become standardized.</ab>

        <ab>Background The average application processing time for the National Nursing Home Support Scheme (NHSS) has seen drastic improvement from 15 weeks in 2014 to 4 weeks in 20161. There is no available data of the duration of stay in rehabilitation beds after approval of NHSS application and reasons for delay in transition to nursing home. Aims (1) To examine average length of stay in rehabilitation before multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision is made for nursing home care. (2) To examine average length of stay in rehabilitation bed from the time of NHSS approval to discharge into nursing home. (3) To examine reasons for delay in discharge to nursing home after NHSS approval. Methods A retrospective chart review of patients discharged into nursing homes between January to June, 2018 from geriatric rehabilitation units. Data collected include age, length of stay in rehabilitation unit before multidisciplinary decision was made in conjunction with patients/family to seek nursing home care (LOS1), Length of stay in rehabilitation bed following decision for nursing home care (LOS 2). Reasons for the delay in the transition from rehabilitation bed to nursing home bed were also documented. Results Seventeen patients were discharged into nursing homes, LOS1 of 43.12 days and LOS2 of 50 days. Complexity of application in terms of financial evaluation especially for patients who were deemed cognitively incapable of managing their finances, lack of suitable nursing homes for patients with complex needs/challenging behaviours, family dynamics with regards to choice of nursing homes and medical stability to facilitate such transfers were reasons for delay in transition to nursing home beds. Conclusion Transitional care beds, which are generally acknowledged to be more appropriate to these patients' care needs and are less expensive than rehabilitation beds, need to be utilized more. Education of healthy adults over 65 years to proactively plan for future care needs and promote awareness of legislatures regarding capacity and decision making.</ab>

        <ab>This multi-perspective study focuses on how a service robot for the elderly should behave when interacting with potential users. An existing service robot and a scenario were used as a concrete case, which was discussed and analyzed during focus group sessions with older adults (n = 38), informal caregivers (n = 24), and professional caregivers (n = 35) in the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom. A total of seven topics—privacy, task execution, environment, appearance, behavior, visitors, and communication—were explored. The results showed that some of the characteristics mentioned were unique to a user group, but several were cross-cutting. Overall, potential users expected the service robot to be customizable in order to match the users' needs and preferences. Also, high expectations concerning its functioning and behavior were expressed, which sometimes could even be compared to the qualities of a human being. This emphasizes the complexity of service robot development for older adults, and highlights the need for a personalized and flexible solution. One size does not fit all, and specific attention should be paid to the development of the robot's social behavior and skills beyond a mere functional support for the person.</ab>

        <ab>Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being.

        <ab>With the increased use of multisite evaluation and implementation studies in health care, our team of evaluators reflects on our evaluation of a large-scale multiyear geriatric and extended care program implementation. We share lessons from conducting multiple rounds of data collection, analyses, and reporting. We also identify some key factors that can facilitate or hinder multisite evaluation efforts involving programs with different models of implementation. This article strives to improve the quality of large-scale evaluations of health programs implementation. Knowledge gained from this complex evaluation will inform public health programs funders, implementers, and key program staff to better plan for, engage in, and benefit from effective complex evaluations to promote health in diverse settings.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The work situation for first‐line managers in elderly care is complex and challenging. Little is known about these managers' work situation from a structural and psychological empowerment perspective. Aim: To describe first‐line managers' experiences of their work situation in elderly care from a structural and psychological empowerment perspective. Method: Interviews from 14 female first‐line managers were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The theme described the managers' work situation as "It's not easy, but it's worth it." In the four subthemes, the managers described their work in terms of "Enjoying a meaningful job," "A complex and demanding responsibility that allows great authority within set boundaries," "Supported by other persons, organisational preconditions and confidence in their own abilities" and "Lacking organisational preconditions, but developing strategies for dealing with the situations." Conclusion: The managers described having various amounts of access to structural empowerment and experienced a feeling of meaning, competence, self‐determination and impact, that is, psychological empowerment in their work. Implications for nursing management: It is vital that first‐line managers have access to organisational support. Therefore, upper management and first‐line managers need to engage in continuous dialogue to customize the support given to each first‐line manager.</ab>

        <ab>The importance of family's involvement in care planning has been stressed to cater individualized, person-centered care in residential aged care. However, in reality, there are numerous structural obstacles and barriers that limit opportunities for their involvement. The aim of this article is to explore what they are. The findings based on the 12 focus groups, six groups of care professionals and six groups of family/relatives, reveal that the narrow pathway of communication between staff and families, which is hierarchically structured, one-directional, and clinically driven, enables the former to maintain and control professional boundaries between formal and informal care-giving. Such communication style delimits an opportunity for families to engage in quality discussion about care planning for their loved ones with care staff. Communication within residential aged care facilities embodies complex dynamics of care expectations and responsibilities held by care staff and families.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To present Specific and Generalized Resistance Resources (SRRs/GRRs) and Deficits (SRDs/GRDs) described by 32 informal caregivers as originating from themselves and their older adult carerecipients as dyads. Method: Salutogenic interviewing was used to assemble data from caregivers. A theory-driven, memo-guided and comparative analysis using within- and across- case analysis was applied to unravel resources and deficits influencing the outcomes when they managed tension associated with caregiving. Findings:Living in fellowship in a well-functioning dyad unites the essence of having access to dyadic SRRs/GRRs. Such access enables dyads to use their specific dyadic tension management to resolve challenges through cooperation, derives 'positive' life-experiences and preserves dyad functioning. Struggling alone in a malfunctioning dyad indicates the presence of dyadic SRDs/GRDs counteracting such a development. If these SRDs/GRDs accumulate, the dyad become less able to resolve challenges, 'negative' life-experiences accumulates, the carerecipient's capability to cooperate decreases, caregiver's workload increases, the dyad becomes increasingly malfunctioning and moves towards the point where caregiving ends due to lack of usable SRRs/GRRs. Conclusions: Findings reveals the complex duality of caregiving and the necessity to assess all available SRRs/GRRs and SRDs/GRDs for caregiving dyads, including out of the carerecipient's perspective. Appropriate 'salutogenic' support reduces SRDs/GRDs, makes available SRRs/GRRs usable or provides alternative SRRs/GRRs, thereby dyadic tension management and dyadic functionality is preserved during this phase of life labelled Caregivinghood. The study adds new knowledge to the salutogenic framework regarding central, theoretical concepts and suggests how data for health promoting initiatives conducted the 'salutogenic way' may be acquired.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Multi-morbidity and polypharmacy are common among older people. It is essential to provide a better understanding of the complexity of prescription drug use among older adults to optimise rational pharmacotherapy. Population-based utilisation data in this age group is limited. Using the Danish nationwide health registries, we aimed to characterise drug use among Danish individuals ≥ 60 years. Methods: This is a descriptive population-based study assessing drug prescription patterns in 2015 in the full Danish population aged ≥ 60 years. The use of specific therapeutic subgroups and chemical subgroups and its dependence on age were described using descriptive statistics. Profiles of drug combination patterns were evaluated using latent class analysis. Results: We included 1,424,775 residents (median age 70 years, 53% women). Of all the older adults, 89% filled at least one prescription during 2015. The median number of drug groups used was five per person. The most used single drug groups were paracetamol and analogues (34%), statins (33%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (24%). Eighteen drug profiles with different drug combination patterns were identified. One drug profile with expected use of zero drugs and 11 drug profiles expected to receive more than five different therapeutic subgroup drugs were identified. Conclusion: The use of drugs is extensive both at the population level and increasing with age at an individual level. Separating the population into different homogenous groups related to drug use resulted in 18 different drug profiles, of which 11 drug profiles received on average more than five different therapeutic subgroup drugs.</ab>

        <ab>In Australia there is an absence of an elder abuse screening instrument that is widely accepted and that has been designed with, and for, end-users. This study aimed to develop an effective and acceptable elder abuse screening instrument by engaging with frontline professionals through a co-design process. To date, co-design methodologies are recommended to ensure successful adoption and implementation of complex interventions by end-users, but the scholarship is limited on the specific steps to achieve this as well as the pragmatics of such work. Addressing this lacunae, results demonstrate how qualitative methods align with a co-design approach; underscore the importance of multidisciplinary perspectives; showcase how to streamline complex processes into routine practice; and accentuate the importance of good design. These are valuable insights necessary to develop inter-professional and community-based solutions to the challenge of elder abuse.</ab>

        <ab>This cross-sectional study uses data from the US National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations to assess the association between accountable care organization–reported care management and coordination activities and outcomes in older adults with complex needs. Key Points: Question: What is the association between care management and outcomes among patients with complex needs in Medicare accountable care organizations? Findings: In this cross-sectional analysis of 1 402 582 US Medicare beneficiaries who had frailty or multiple chronic conditions, beneficiaries attributed to accountable care organizations in the top vs bottom tertile of reported care management and coordination activities did not have statistically different quality, utilization, spending, or health care system interaction measures. Meaning: Accountable care organization–reported care management and coordination activities were not associated with improved outcomes among patients with complex needs. Importance: People with complex needs account for a disproportionate amount of Medicare spending, partially because of fragmented care delivered across multiple practitioners and settings. Accountable care organization (ACO) contracts give practitioners incentives to improve care coordination to the extent that coordination initiatives reduce total spending or improve quality. Objective: To assess the association between ACO-reported care management and coordination activities and quality, utilization, spending, and health care system interactions in older adults with complex needs. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, survey information on care management and coordination processes from 244 Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs in the 2017-2018 National Survey of ACOs (of 351 Medicare ACO respondents; response rate, 69%) conducted from July 20, 2017, to February 15, 2018, was linked to 2016 Medicare administrative claims data. Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who were defined as having complex needs because of frailty or 2 or more chronic conditions associated with high costs and clinical need were included. Exposures: Beneficiary attribution to ACO reporting comprehensive (top tertile) care management and coordination activities. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause prevention quality indicator admissions, 30-day all-cause readmissions, acute care and critical access hospital admissions, evaluation and management visits in ambulatory settings, inpatient days, emergency department visits, total spending, post–acute care spending, health care contact days, and continuity of care (from Medicare claims). Results: Among 1 402 582 Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions, the mean (SD) age was 78 (8.0) years and 55.1% were female. Compared with beneficiaries assigned to ACOs in the bottom tertile of care management and coordination activities, those assigned to ACOs in the top tertile had identical median prevention quality indicator admissions and 30-day all-cause readmissions (0 per beneficiary across all tertiles), hospitalization and emergency department visits (1.0 per beneficiary in bottom and top tertiles), evaluation and management visits in ambulatory settings (14.0 per beneficiary [interquartile range (IQR), 8.0-21.0] in both tertiles), longer median inpatient days (11.0 [IQR, 4.0-33.0] vs 10.0 [IQR, 4.0-32.0]), higher median annual spending ($14 350 [IQR, $4876-$36 119] vs $14 229 [IQR, $4805-$36 268]), lower median health care contact days (28.0 [IQR, 17.0-44.0] vs 29.0 [IQR, 18.0-45.0]), and lower continuity-of-care index (0.12 [IQR, 0.08-0.20] vs 0.13 [IQR, 0.08-0.21]). Accounting for within-patient correlation, quality, utilization, and spending outcomes among patients with complex needs attributed to ACOs were not statistically different comparing the top vs bottom tertile of care management and coordination activities. Conclusions and Relevance: The ACO self-reports of care management and coordination capacity were not associated with differences in spending or measured outcomes for patients with complex needs. Future efforts to care for patients with complex needs should assess whether strategies found to be effective in other settings are being used, and if so, why they fail to meet expectations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older people are frequent users of primary health care (PHC) services. PHC services have been critiqued, mainly regarding limited accessibility and continuity of care. In many countries, investment in nurse practitioners (NPs) has been one strategy to improve PHC services. In the North of Europe, the NP role is still in its infancy. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of introducing geriatric nurse practitioners (GNPs) in PHC in Scandinavia, from multiprofessional and older persons' perspectives. Methods: The study had a qualitative design, including 25 semi-structured interviews with nurses, nurse leaders, physicians, politicians and older persons from several communities in Scandinavia. The material was analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. Results: The results highlight current challenges in health services for the older population, i.e. comorbid older patients with complex care needs aging in place, lack of competent staff, and organisational challenges. The results present an envisioned GNP scope of practice in health services for the older population, including bringing advanced competence closer to the patient, an autonomous role including task-shifting, and a linking role. The results also present factors influencing implementation of the GNP role, i.e. GNP competence level, unclear role and scope of practice, and openness to reorganisation. Conclusions: The results indicate that it is feasible to implement the GNP role in primary health care in Scandinavia. Notwithstanding, there are factors influencing implementation of the GNP role that should be considered.</ab>

        <ab>It is well documented that Health care assistants (HCAs) provide the most hands‐on care to residents in aged care facilities, and play a critical role in the provision of care to dementia residents. Over the last 25 years, a philosophy of person‐centred care has become the preferred approach to care and this has meant that HCAs are encouraged to get to know the resident very well. This paper reports the experiences of HCAs in caring for people at end‐of‐life, identifies the skills required for their work and examines the education provided against these skills. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted in 49 facilities (n = 34) across New Zealand and data analysed thematically, with the aim of critically examining the adequacy of education for health care assistants which meets their needs within a person‐centred environment. The results confirm that the skills include traditional tasks of care (showering, feeding, toileting, and dressing) but the increasingly important communication and de‐escalation skills, both verbal and non‐verbal, have become central to their care skills. Education provided has not sufficiently shifted focus to include these more complex skills. Provision of educations that acknowledges the increased complexities of their role needs to be provided. As well, facilities need to be challenged to reconsider the HCA's position in the facility care tem.</ab>

        <ab>Given limited available geriatric specialists and complexity of dementia care, there is a need for greater collaboration between primary care and specialists to better meet the needs of persons with dementia. Meaningful family physician—specialist collaboration has the potential to improve health outcomes, timely access to care and more appropriate healthcare resource utilisation. Primary Care Collaborative Memory Clinics (PCCMCs), which include specialist support, provide a significant opportunity for studying the family physician–specialist interface. This study aimed to explore the nature of collaborative relationships between memory clinic family physicians and specialists caring for persons with memory concerns in PCCMCs across Ontario, Canada. Family physicians (N = 71) attending an education session and specialists (N = 21) completed a survey in the fall of 2017 that measured frequency and amount of collaboration, perceptions of their relationship and identified factors that enable and challenge collaboration. Descriptive statistics were generated for quantitative data and themes for responses to open‐ended questions were explored using descriptive qualitative content analysis. Specialists and memory clinic family physicians valued their collaboration particularly as related to capacity building for dementia care and desired more time devoted to collaboration. Identified enablers and barriers to collaboration have implications for further integration of specialist support to potentially support improved patient care and further build capacity in primary care to manage dementia care. Opportunities exist for expanding and more intentionally supporting how family physicians and specialists interact with the creation of more formalised processes to support optimal collaboration, including a clear delineation of roles, responsibilities and expectations, more formally planned and structured relationship building and monitoring, identifying and addressing unique barriers to collaboration and use of a variety of methods of communication. Study findings have implications for how specialists and family physicians communicate and collaborate in other programmes for complex chronic conditions.</ab>

        <ab>Health care policies for the elderly are complex, multidimensional, and contextually circumscribed. While engagement of health experts, economists, health care administrators, and political leaders is generally viewed as instrumental to the success and sustainability of eldercare programs, the elders themselves are often viewed as passive recipients of care and not included in the policy processes. Experiences and expectations from users' perspectives can be invaluable information for policy formulation and systems design. This paper examines a participatory policy process using a "citizens' jury" to promote public engagement in eldercare policy. The process was initiated by the National Health Commission Office in Thailand to explore how a citizens' jury as a model for civic deliberation can be utilized to provide sophisticated policy recommendations on long-term care policies for the elderly. The objectives of this paper are to (1) examine how public participation in health policy can be actualized through the citizens' jury as an operational model, (2) understand the strengths and weaknesses of the ways the idea was implemented, and (3) provide recommendations for further use of the model. Details of how a citizens' jury was deployed are discussed, with recommendations for further use provided at the end.</ab>

        <ab>Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Background: The burden of pain in nursing homes is substantial; however, pain assessment for both acute and chronic conditions remains inadequate, resulting in inappropriate or inadequate treatment. Complexities in assessing resident pain have been attributed to factors (barriers and facilitators) arising at the resident, healthcare provider, and healthcare system levels. Objectives: In this systematic review protocol, we identify our research approach that will be used to critically appraise and synthesize data in order to assess barriers and facilitators to pain assessment in nursing home residents aged ≥65 years. Methods: This is a Cochrane style systematic review protocol adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols reporting standards. This review will include primary (original) qualitative literature concerning either barriers or facilitators to pain assessment in older adult nursing home residents. A thematic analysis approach will be employed in collating and summarizing included data and will be categorized into resident, healthcare provider, and system-level factors. Database searches will include Abstracts in Social Gerontology, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Discussion: The identification of barriers and facilitators to pain assessment in older adult nursing home residents may assist healthcare providers across all platforms and levels of education to improve pain assessment among nursing home residents. Improving the assessment of pain has the potential to improve quality of care and ultimately quality of life for older adult nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>With the predicted growth in the number of people with dementia living at home across the globe, the need for home-based care is expected to increase. As such, it will be primarily family carers who will provide this crucial support to family members. Designing appropriate support for family carers is thus essential to minimise risks to their health, to prevent premature institutionalisation or poor care for persons with dementia, as well as to sustain the effective functioning of health and social care systems. To date, the high volume of research related to care at home and acknowledged low impact of interventions suggests that a re-examination of the nature of care at home, and how we come to know about it, is necessary if we are to advance strategies that will contribute to better outcomes for families. This paper describes findings from an ethnographic study that was designed to support an analysis of the complexity and materiality of family care arrangements – that is, the significance of the actual physical, technological and institutional elements shaping care-giving situations. In this paper, we describe the arrangements made by one family to show the necessary collectivity of these arrangements, and the consequences of the formal care system's failure to respond to these.</ab>

        <ab>The health care aide position embodies one of the most basic paradoxes of long-term care for older adults: those who have the most contact and most intensive interaction with nursing-home residents are also those having the least training, authority, and status within the system. They therefore hold one of the keys to quality care in many settings, especially nursing homes. In the absence of agreement on the position's roles, responsibilities, and authority, it is important to examine how the position is perceived by the key members in the long-term-care framework. The current study examined and compared health care aides' and nurses' perceptions of the position in nursing-home settings in Israel, using a standardized tool developed for this inquiry. The comparison accounted for potential intervening factors that may help better understand the job requirements and boundaries. A comparative survey design. 30 nursing homes (of at least 20 beds) in northern Israel. We used convenience sampling to recruit 369 health care aides and 261 nurses (a total of 630 participants). The main instrument of data collection was specially designed and validated for this study. It was based on a qualitative study that defined basic content units representing tasks importance, knowledge, and personal characteristics for the job. Participants found it difficult to prioritize the job components or to differentiate between core tasks and characteristics and the secondary aspects of their job. General care, profession-specific knowledge, and emotional abilities were endorsed the most by participants. Cleaning, communication, and safety were ranked lower (although rankings were still considerably high). However, previous experience as a health care aide undermined incumbents' perceptions of their own responsibilities and professionalism. Incumbent health care aides rated most factors higher than nurses did, with the exception of the importance of communication. Our results may help decision makers understand the complexity around the health care aide position, manage and develop it more effectively while setting standards (training and certification, performance appraisal, and more) for professionalization processes and better defining the division of nursing work between health care aides and nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Few empirical studies have examined strengths and support of older people in circumstances of precarity. A better understanding of this problem has the potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery. Purpose: To investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana. Method: More than 300 hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for low‐income older persons and two senior citizen centres. Results: The findings demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home‐based healthcare services, (b) stress after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home‐based services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships and activities, and (i) grocery store and café contacts. Conclusion: Home‐based services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services. Implications for practice: This study adds to the literature about precarity among community‐based older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home‐based services are necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths and supportive resources of older people.</ab>

        <ab>The UK has an ageing population more and more elderly people are living with diabetes. Jill Hill explores the condition as well as other healthcare challenges that comes with caring for this particular patient group With the increasingly ageing population worldwide, more older people are living with diabetes. The conditions that often accompany older age, such as dementia, renal impairment, visual impairment and manual dexterity difficulties, can make diabetes management complex and self-care challenging. However, the status of older people varies considerably, and so choice of glucose-lowering agents and clinical targets should be individualised to maximise safety and ensure that the risks of treatments do not outweigh the benefits. For many patients, there will be an increasing dependence on others to manage their diabetes care, therefore an appropriate skill mix among health professionals and carers, adequate training and regular competency assessment are crucial to support patients to remain safe and symptom free from diabetes.</ab>

        <ab>Activity programs are described in institutional policies as an added benefit in the lives of residents in that such activities are assumed to maintain health through the process of socialization. The purpose of this study is to describe the determining factors in the socialization process of elderly residents in retirement homes. A qualitative study, in nursing study using anthropological methodology was carried out from April 2016 to May 2018 in ten retirement homes in the Limousin and on Reunion Island, territory. Fifty-eight semi-structured interviews have been analyzed using NVivo 11 Plus® software. The socialization process of the elderly in the context of institutional regulation is complex. Attendance at social activities is often used to measure the degree of socialization and integration in the institution, but, on its own, it is not a significant indicator. Other elements involved in the complex socialization process of the elderly in retirement homes include: family, relations with other residents, and interaction with caregivers plays a major role. An elderly person can remain isolated in his or her room, never participate in activities, and yet feel perfectly integrated and socialized within the institution. Future research will focus on the relationship between residents and caregivers as a factor in the socialization process, including the knowledge and skills of the caregivers.</ab>
        <ab>Les activités d'animation sont inscrites dans les projets d'établissement des maisons de retraite présentées comme une valeur ajoutée de la vie du résident, le maintenant en santé par son processus de socialisation. L'objectif de l'étude est de décrire les déterminants de la socialisation en maison de retraite. Une étude qualitative en sciences infirmières, suivant une démarche anthropologique, a été menée d'avril 2016 à mai 2018 dans dix maisons de retraite du Limousin et de l'île de La Réunion. Cinquante-sept entretiens semi-directifs ont été analysés en utilisant le logiciel NVivo 11 Plus®. Le processus de socialisation des personnes âgées est complexe dans un contexte de règles institutionnelles contraintes. L'indicateur d'assiduité aux activités, utilisé pour mesurer le niveau de socialisation et d'intégration dans la structure n'est pas, à lui seul, pertinent. En effet, parmi les éléments participant au processus complexe de socialisation en institution, on retrouve : la famille, les relations entre résidents et l'interaction avec les soignants y jouent un rôle majeur. Les personnes âgées isolées dans leur chambre, peuvent ne jamais participer aux activités, et se sentir socialisées dans la structure. Une prochaine recherche étudiera la relation soignant/soigné comme vecteur de socialisation et les savoirs soignants qu'ils supposent.</ab>

        <ab>As Americans live longer lives, we will see an increased demand for quality healthcare for older adults. Despite the growth in the number of older adults, there will be a decrease in the supply of a primary care physician workforce to provide adequately for their care and health needs. This article reviews the literature that explores ways to address the primary care workforce shortage in a community‐based geriatric healthcare setting, with special attention to elevating the role of nurses and caregivers and shifting the way we think about delivery of care and end‐of‐life conversations and planning. The shift is toward a more integrated and collaborative approach to care where medical and nonmedical, social services, and community providers all play a role. Several models have demonstrated promising positive benefits and outcomes to patients, families, and providers alike. The goal is to provide high quality care that addresses the unique attributes of older adults, especially those with complex conditions, and to focus more on care goals and priorities. The many barriers to scaling and spreading models of care across varied settings include payment structures, lack of education and training among all stakeholders, and, at the top of the list, leadership resistance. We address these barriers and make recommendations for a path forward where healthcare providers, policymakers, patients, families, and everyone else involved can play a role in shaping the workforce caring for older adults.

        <ab>Home health, home care, and personal care aides provide most of the paid hands‐on care delivered to seriously ill, functionally impaired individuals in their homes, assisted living, and other noninstitutional settings. This workforce delivers personal care, assistance with activities of daily living, and emotional support to their patients. They are often the eyes and ears of the health system, observing subtle changes in condition that can provide important information for clinical decision making and therapeutic intervention. Despite this fact, the growing number of team‐based home care initiatives have failed to incorporate this workforce into their programs. Barriers to inclusion of aides into teams include a basic lack of value and understanding on the part of clinical team members and society in general of the complex tasks that these caregivers perform, inadequate investments in training and education of this workforce to develop their knowledge and competencies, and variation in state delegation laws that limit the scope of practice and consequently the ability of aides to work effectively in teams and to advance in their careers. Building on the few programs that have successfully included aides as key members of home care teams, federal and state policymakers, educators, and health systems and providers should standardize competency‐based training requirements, expand nurse delegation consistently across states, and support evaluation, dissemination, and replication of successful programs.

        <ab>Family caregivers provide the vast majority of care for individuals with serious illness living in the community but are not often viewed as full members of the healthcare team. Family caregivers are increasingly expected to acquire a sophisticated understanding of the care recipient's condition and new skills to execute complex medical or nursing tasks, often without adequate preparation and support, and with little choice in taking on the role. This review draws on peer‐reviewed literature, government reports, and other publications to summarize the challenges faced by family caregivers of older adults in the context of serious illness and to identify opportunities to better integrate them into the healthcare workforce. We discuss promising approaches such as inclusion of family caregivers in consensus‐based practice guidelines; the "no wrong door" function, directing consumers to needed resources, regardless of where initial contact is made; and caregiver‐friendly workplace policies allowing flexible arrangements. We present specific recommendations focusing on research, clinical practice, and policy changes that promote family‐centered care and improve outcomes for caregivers as well as persons with serious illness.

        <ab>Most older people experiencing chronic health problems, physical disabilities, and memory losses are still able to age in place in their own homes. However, they often need help from others to enjoy healthy, active, and independent lives. They turn mostly to family members, mainly women and usually their daughters, daughters-in-law or wives. But caring for frail elders has become more demanding and complex, and these family members often feel physically and emotionally overwhelmed and burnt out. They concede that they cannot do it alone. Others find it more difficult to hold full-or even part-time jobs. Hiring home (direct) care workers to assist their loved ones can be an effective solution to ease their caregiving responsibilities. However, these personal care aides, home health aides, and nursing assistants are already in short supply. Moreover, going forward the aging of the baby boomer population will result in an even greater demand for their services even as these jobs are often unattractive to American-born workers and turnover is high. This country's immigration policies will make it even more difficult for women caring for older persons to hire these workers. Over 25 percent of home care workers are low-skilled immigrants or foreign-born. However, the Trump administration's policies reduce the number of immigrants entering the U.S. and specifically choke off the various pathways that enable low-skilled persons to be hirable in the home care sector. Female caregivers seeking relief from their caregiving responsibilities will lose out unless we remove these immigration barriers.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Currently, the number of older adults has been rapidly increasing due to the current demographic transition, which has made more visible the need for providing care. Becoming a caregiver is a complex process that includes changes in the daily life and health of caregivers, especially when they are also elderly caregivers. Therefore, this study aimed to find out the impact generated in the daily life of caregivers caring for dependent elderly. Materials and Methods: An observational, descriptive study using a qualitative approach was conducted on elderly caregivers caring for elderly people. 39 elderly caregivers were interviewed. For data collection, the interview was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire with digital audio recording. For data analysis, Minayo's thematic content analysis was used. Results: The following three thematic categories were proposed: changing daily routine, being an untrained elderly caregiver and having an emotional and physical imbalance. Discussion: It was possible to observe that caregivers of elderly people, in order to become caregivers, go through an intense change of their routine with respect to the time staying at home, social isolation, which makes this population be vulnerable to psychological and physical dependence and have a greater tendency to the physiological condition of aging. In addition, it was possible to confirm the poor performance of the Primary Health Care service in relation to educational guidance and actions. Conclusions: It was evident the great overburden on caregivers who care for older adults, especially when they are also elderly caregivers with similar characteristics and needs to those of elderly dependents. Further investments are required for educational actions on the primary care service.</ab>
        <ab>Introducción: Con la actual transición demográfica, el número de personas de la tercera edad está aumentando, lo que ha acentuado la necesidad de cuidado. El proceso para convertirse en cuidador es complejo e incluye cambios en la vida cotidiana y la salud de quien cuida, principalmente cuando esa persona también es de la tercera edad. Por ello, se pretenden conocer cuáles son las repercusiones que se generan en la vida cotidiana de las personas que cuidan a ancianos dependientes. Materiales y Métodos: Estudio observacional, descriptivo, con enfoque cualitativo, realizado con personas ancianas que cuidan a otros ancianos. Entrevistamos a 39 ancianos cuidadores. Para la recolección de datos, se utilizó la entrevista dirigida por un cuestionario semiestructurado para el cual se utilizaron medios digitales de grabación de audio. Para el análisis de los datos, se utilizó el análisis de contenido temático propuesto por Minayo. Resultados: Se propusieron tres categorías temáticas: transformación de la rutina; ser cuidador anciano sin conocimiento; y desequilibrio emocional y físico. Discusión: Es posible ver que los cuidadores de ancianos, para convertirse en cuidadores, pasan por una intensa transformación de su rutina con respecto a la retención domiciliaria, el aislamiento social, lo que hace que la población se haga vulnerable a la dependencia psicológica y física, y que tenga una tendencia mayor a la condición fisiológica del envejecimiento. Además, se constató el poco desempeño que tiene el servicio de Atención Primaria a la Salud, con relación a orientaciones y acciones educativas. Conclusiones: La gran sobrecarga que sufren las personas que cuidan a ancianos fue evidente, principalmente cuando esa persona también está en la tercera edad y cuando tiene características y necesidades similares a las de los ancianos dependientes. Se verificó que deben hacerse mayores inversiones en acciones educativas por parte de la atención básica.</ab>
        <ab>Introdução: Com a atual transição demográfica, o número de idosos está aumentando e com isso aumenta a demanda por cuidado. O processo de tornar-se cuidador é complexo e envolve mudanças no cotidiano e na saúde do cuidador, principalmente quando o cuidador também é idoso. Nesse sentido, objetiva-se conhecer as repercussões causadas no cotidiano de cuidadores de idosos que cuidam de idosos dependentes. Materiais e Métodos: Estudo observacional, descritivo, com delineamento qualitativo, realizado com cuidadores de idosos que cuidam de outros idosos. Entrevistamos 39 idosos cuidadores. Para a coleta de dados, utilizou-se a entrevista, orientada por um roteiro semiestruturado com o uso de mídia digital do tipo gravação de áudio. Para a análise dos dados, utilizou-se a análise de conteúdo temática proposta por Minayo. Resultados: Três categorias temáticas foram propostas: Transformação da rotina; ser cuidador idoso sem conhecimento; e desequilíbrio emocional e físico. Discussão: Portanto, é possível ver que os cuidadores de idosos para se tornar cuidadores passam por uma intensa transformação da rotina quando se refere à retenção domiciliar, isolamento social, deixando o vulnerável a população dependência psicológica e física junto com o próprio condição fisiológica do envelhecimento. O baixo desempenho do serviço de Atenção Primária à Saúde foi verificado, no sentido de orientações e ações educativas. Conclusões: A grande sobrecarga sofrida pelos cuidadores de idosos foi marcante, principalmente quando esse cuidador também é idoso, com características e necessidades semelhantes às dos idosos dependentes. Destaca-se a necessidade de maiores investimentos em ações educativas pela atenção básica.</ab>

        <ab>With the increasingly ageing population worldwide, more older people are living with diabetes. The conditions that often accompany older age, such as dementia, renal impairment, visual impairment and manual dexterity difficulties, can make diabetes management complex and self-care challenging. However, the status of older people varies considerably, and so choice of glucose-lowering agents and clinical targets should be individualised to maximise safety and ensure that the risks of treatments do not outweigh the benefits. For many patients, there will be an increasing dependence on others to manage their diabetes care, so an appropriate skill mix among healthcare professionals and carers, adequate training and regular competency assessment are crucial to support patients to remain safe and symptom free from diabetes.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Posthospital discharge shows increased risk for falls in older people. This pilot study was created to determine feasibility and acceptability of a community-delivered posthospital multifactorial program. Method: This mixed-method study used randomized controlled design (quantitative component) and interviews (qualitative component). People aged ≥65 years, hospitalized for a fall, underwent assessment for quality of life and falls-related outcomes, followed by interviews, randomization into intervention (exercise, medication review, and education) or control group, and follow-up at 6 months. Results: Thirteen people commenced, with 10 people assessed at 6 months. Participants were complex with high degrees of frailty, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and falls risk. Interview data related to intervention, impacts on quality of life, and fall-related outcomes. Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest suitability of a multifactorial program for older people posthospital discharge following a fall. A social component would be a useful addition to falls prevention strategies, utilizing existing community nursing organizations.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: This study explores the intersection of marriage and caregiving amongst older spousal caregivers in regional Australia. Specifically, we address the research question: 'How do expectations of informal care impact spousal caregivers in later life?' Methods: These comprise interpretive qualitative in‐depth interviews in order to understand the lived experience of caregiving within the context of long‐term marriage. Results: Findings highlight the complexity and diversity of marital relationships as the context of informal care. Individual and social obligations were evident in key themes, demonstrating how spouses automatically assume and continue in caregiver roles in later life. Conclusion: Caregiving is an expectation of couples in long‐term marriages, regardless of the relationship quality and willingness to care. Normative expectations also impact decision‐making around future care planning and transitions away from home‐based care. These are important considerations for both policy and practice with older adults and their caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Older adults with complex comorbidities are at risk for challenges that compromise their post-discharge safety at home. A growing body of evidence suggests that post-hospitalization outcomes for vulnerable elders can be improved by interventions that encourage patient empowerment. The purpose of this pilot project was to determine if an individualized transition intervention would improve patient empowerment 30days after home discharge following an acute illness. Through individualized interaction with an advanced practice nurse, a sample of 25 elder patients was encouraged to acquire the knowledge and confidence to advocate for their needs after discharge from a subacute facility. Pre and post-intervention patient empowerment was measured through the Senior Empowerment and Advocacy in Patient Safety survey. Quantitative data from this study provided evidence to support the benefit of transition care in enhancing patient empowerment. The data generated by this project will add to the existing body of evidence on transitional care.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Background and objectives The complex health problems of older persons require that health professionals closely work together, in particular when an acute decline necessitates admission at an acute geriatric unit. These working conditions may cause additional stress in staff. This study aims to identify the relation between interprofessional teamwork, the quality of care and turnover intention in acute geriatric units. Design, setting, participants and methods Perceptions of interprofessional teamwork, quality of care and turnover intention among team members of 55 acute geriatric units were measured using validated questionnaires. A multilevel linear regression model was built for quality of care and logistic regression for turnover intention, with random intercept for acute geriatric unit. Results The overall response rate was 60%. Of the 890 respondents, 71% were nursing professionals, 20% allied health professionals, 5% physicians, and 4% administrative staff. Twenty-three percent reported poor to fair quality of care in their unit; 19% was not sure that patients or families had been given enough means to organise care after discharge. Fifteen percent reported turnover intention (18%, 8%, 9% and 11% among nursing professionals, allied health professionals, physicians and administrative workers respectively, p = 0.005). Higher perceived interprofessional teamwork was related to higher quality of care (estimated coefficient 0.05, p &lt; 0.001) and lower turnover intention in nursing professionals only (estimated OR 0.94, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Creating a care environment of good interprofessional teamwork can help acute geriatric units to retain nursing professionals in the job and achieve higher quality of care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: A Community Wellness Team was implemented in North East England in 2014, in line with national policy directives to support frail older people in the community. The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. Design: A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Results: Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self‐management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. Discussion: The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team "works" is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live. Conclusion: Severely frail older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a complex and flexible person‐centred approach. Implications for Practice: This study paves the way for further research into the care networks surrounding severely frail older people living in the community, and how they can most effectively be implemented.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To develop and prioritise recommendations to prevent the use of physical restraints among nursing home residents. Methods: This study comprised two expert and stakeholder consultation forums using a modified nominal group technique and a follow‐up electronic survey to rank the final set of recommendations. Results: There were 15 recommendations formulated to prevent the use of physical restraint among nursing home residents. The three recommendations ranked as most important were that: a single definition be mandated for describing "physical restraint"; use of physical restraint acts as a trigger for mandatory referral to a specialist aged care team; and nursing home staff profile and competencies are appropriate to meet the complex needs of residents with dementia and obviate the need to apply physical restraint. Conclusions: Future studies should investigate the feasibility of implementing these recommendations and whether the proposed interventions reduce the use of physical restraint. Implications: Implementation of recommendations to prevent the use of physical restraint may assist nursing home staff, providers and policy makers to deliver improved care that is more aligned with contemporary views of human rights.</ab>

        <ab>Background In recent years, the value of co-production has become embedded in the social care agenda. Care home residents are at significantly higher risk of dental diseases and often rely on the care team for support. It is therefore vital that staff are trained and confident in delivering evidence based oral care to their clients. Methods Three London care homes co-produced a pilot oral health training programme, informed by in-depth interviews and group discussions. The initiative was evaluated using pre/post-questionnaires of carers and semi-structured interviews of managers and the dental teams. Results Two care homes were available for delivery of the programme, which resulted in training of 64% (n = 87) of care staff. The training programme involved videos and resources and was delivered flexibly with the support of an oral health educator and a dental therapist. There was an improvement in knowledge and self-reported confidence post-training; however, only 54% (n = 45) completed the post-training questionnaire. Conclusions This study suggests that co-production of an oral care training package for care home staff, is possible and welcome, but challenging in this complex and changing environment. Further work is needed to explore the feasibility, sustainability and impact of doing so.</ab>

        <ab>Policy PointsWe identified two overarching classifications of integrated geriatric and palliative care to maximize older people's quality of life at the end of life. Both are oriented to person‐centered care, but with differing emphasis on either function or symptoms and concerns.Policymakers should both improve access to palliative care beyond just the last months of life and increase geriatric care provision to maintain and optimize function. This would ensure that continuity and coordination for potentially complex care needs across the continuum of late life would be maintained, where the demarcation of boundaries between healthy aging and healthy dying become increasingly blurred.Our findings highlight the urgent need for health system change to improve end‐of‐life care as part of universal health coverage. The use of health services should be informed by the likelihood of benefits and intended outcomes rather than on prognosis. Context: In an era of unprecedented global aging, a key priority is to align health and social services for older populations in order to support the dual priorities of living well while adapting to a gradual decline in function. We aimed to provide a comprehensive synthesis of evidence regarding service delivery models that optimize the quality of life (QoL) for older people at the end of life across health, social, and welfare services worldwide. Methods: We conducted a rapid scoping review of systematic reviews. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and CDSR databases from 2000 to 2017 for reviews reporting the effectiveness of service models aimed at optimizing QoL for older people, more than 50% of whom were older than 60 and in the last one or two years of life. We assessed the quality of these included reviews using AMSTAR and synthesized the findings narratively. Results: Of the 2,238 reviews identified, we included 72, with 20 reporting meta‐analysis. Although all the World Health Organization (WHO) regions were represented, most of the reviews reported data from the Americas (52 of 72), Europe (46 of 72), and/or the Western Pacific (28 of 72). We identified two overarching classifications of service models but with different target outcomes: Integrated Geriatric Care, emphasizing physical function, and Integrated Palliative Care, focusing mainly on symptoms and concerns. Areas of synergy across the overarching classifications included person‐centered care, education, and a multiprofessional workforce. The reviews assessed 117 separate outcomes. A meta‐analysis demonstrated effectiveness for both classifications on QoL, including symptoms such as pain, depression, and psychological well‐being. Economic analysis and its implications were poorly considered. Conclusions: Despite their different target outcomes, those service models classified as Integrated Geriatric Care or Integrated Palliative Care were effective in improving QoL for older people nearing the end of life. Both approaches highlight the imperative for integrating services across the care continuum, with service involvement triggered by the patient's needs and likelihood of benefits. To inform the sustainability of health system change we encourage economic analyses that span health and social care and examine all sources of finance to understand contextual inequalities.</ab>

        <ab>For five years by now, legislation requires organizations in Austria and Germany to undertake assessments for psychological risks in the workplace. A reduction of psychological work-related risk factors is particularly substantial in high-risk sectors such as the health-care setting. Based on phone interviews elderly care facilities in two Austrian countries a high rate of conducted risk-assessments is confirmed, however rather general and partly superficial instruments are applied. Thereby, the complexity of this occupational field is not accounted for, rather superficial data are generated. Consequently, it cannot be supposed that the merits of psychological risk assessments yield their full potential yet.</ab>
        <ab>Seit mittlerweile fünf Jahren sind Unternehmen in Österreich und Deutschland gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet, die Evaluierung bzw. Gefährdungsbeurteilung psychischer Belastungen durchzuführen. Eine Verringerung psychosozialer Belastungen der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter ist speziell in Hochrisikobereichen wie der Gesundheitswirtschaft wesentlich. Mittels telefonischer Befragungen bei Alten- und Pflegeheimen in zwei österreichischen Bundesländern wurde eine hohe Rate an erfolgten Evaluierungen bestätigt, allerdings wurden eher allgemeine, zum Teil oberflächliche, Instrumente verwendet. Damit wird der Komplexität der Berufsfelder oft nicht Rechnung getragen, sondern vor allem Überblicksdaten generiert. Der Nutzen dieser Erhebungen ist daher noch nicht vollständig ausgeschöpft.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To explore health professionals' perspectives about caring for community‐dwelling older patients in the ED. Methods: This exploratory qualitative study was undertaken with emergency nursing, medical and allied health staff from the ED of a large metropolitan public hospital in Melbourne. Nine focus groups (n = 54) and seven interviews were conducted between 2013 and 2014. Data were thematically analysed. Results: Health professionals described tailoring their approach when caring for older patients, including adopting a specific communication approach (i.e. increased voice volume, slower rate of speech). Caring for older patients was perceived as challenging given the need to balance the expectations of family members to deal with associated complex needs and limited time for transitional care planning in the ED. The environment and equipment were perceived as unsuitable, alongside a lack of geriatric‐specific knowledge; contributing to what health professionals described as a poor fit between the ED system and older patients' needs. Conclusion: The growing number of older patients presents numerous challenges for emergency health professionals and necessitates a tailored approach to care. Understanding health professionals' perspectives about caring for older patients can inform strategies that may improve the quality of care. Creating older person‐friendly areas, improving transitional care and providing staff with specific education would foster an environment that promotes person‐centred care, safety, independence and functional wellbeing.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Healthy ageing is a multi-dimensional concept which appertains to all older adults. This study reviewed the intervention characteristics, intervention content and effectiveness of multi-dimensional healthy ageing interventions (MHAIs) addressing physical, mental and social health among independent community-dwelling older adults. A search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO for studies published from Jan 2007 to October 2016. 18 publications were included, accounting for 15 studies. The review reflected the complexity, variations and methodological considerations of developing a comprehensive MHAI. It demonstrated the possibility of integrating person-focused to environment-focused content topics in future MHAIs, beyond the physical, mental and social health dimensions. Among the reviewed studies, health education programs reported improvements in quality of life and life satisfaction while health assessment and education programs promoted positive health behaviors. Future MHAIs studies need to employ more robust research methods and greater contextual information reports to build stronger evidence base.</ab>

        <ab>Highlights • Self-management education is a priority for care coordination programs. • Older adults manage their health and healthcare by living with limits and living with grit. • Daughters frequently provide support for their parents with multimorbidity yet sons also provide support. • Older adults with multimorbidity want to stay in their own homes. • Being in control of their own health is a priority for older adults with multimorbidity. Abstract As the number of older adults with multimorbidity increases, care coordination programs are being designed to streamline the complex care older adults receive from multiple providers by improving health and reducing unnecessary costs. Well-coordinated care requires actions by both patients and providers. Yet little attention is paid to the what older adults do to manage their own care alongside a formal Care Coordination Program (CCP). This paper presents a qualitative descriptive study that explored what actions older adults took on their own to manage their care. Findings from this study identified that there were two actions older adults took to manage their care; they lived within their limits and they lived with grit. This study suggests that by recognizing what older adults do to self-manage their care within the context of a CCP, nurses can build on older adults' actions and provide person-centered strategies for care coordination.</ab>

        <ab>Integrated care is increasingly promoted as an effective and cost‐effective way to organise care for community‐dwelling frail older people with complex problems but the question remains whether high expectations are justified. Our study aims to systematically review the empirical evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for community‐dwelling frail older people and close attention is paid to the elements and levels of integration of the interventions. We searched nine databases for eligible studies until May 2016 with a comparison group and reporting at least one outcome regarding effectiveness or cost‐effectiveness. We identified 2,998 unique records and, after exclusions, selected 46 studies on 29 interventions. We assessed the quality of the included studies with the Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk‐of‐bias tool. The interventions were described following Rainbow Model of Integrated Care framework by Valentijn. Our systematic review reveals that the majority of the reported outcomes in the studies on preventive, integrated care show no effects. In terms of health outcomes, effectiveness is demonstrated most often for seldom‐reported outcomes such as well‐being. Outcomes regarding informal caregivers and professionals are rarely considered and negligible. Most promising are the care process outcomes that did improve for preventive, integrated care interventions as compared to usual care. Healthcare utilisation was the most reported outcome but we found mixed results. Evidence for cost‐effectiveness is limited. High expectations should be tempered given this limited and fragmented evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for frail older people. Future research should focus on unravelling the heterogeneity of frailty and on exploring what outcomes among frail older people may realistically be expected.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Heart disease is the most significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in older adults. Care decisions are complex because patients may have multiple comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Additionally, older adults often have vague symptomology, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and a reported delay of treatment. Although multiple clinical guidelines are available, the applicability of guidelines to the older population needs to be evaluated based on a holistic, individualized basis. Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes and priorities, incorporating risk-benefit assessment, quality of life, functional assessment, and frailty assessment when making treatment decisions. Highlights • Older adults are a heterogeneous group who require complex care decisions for coronary heart disease. • There are gaps in recommendations for care in many evidence-based guidelines. • Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes, incorporating analysis of risk benefit and quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To implement an educational programme for nursing staff on recognising, reporting and managing resident‐to‐resident elder mistreatment in aged care facilities. Background: The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an educational programme. Design: Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). Methods: This trial was undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be evaluated on an intention‐to‐treat analysis. Discussion: It is vital to manage and reduce resident‐to‐resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and may improve comprehensive evidence‐based care for older people residing in aged care facilities.</ab>
        <ab>目的: 为护理人员实施对养老院住院老人虐待的认知、报告和管理教育方案。 背景: 人口老龄化现象的出现增加了对生活在养老院的老年人进行最佳护理的需求。照顾老人是一项复杂工作,但应包括管理老年人之间的攻击性互动。护理人员在识别和管理这些行为方面起着至关重要的作用。然而,许多护理人员可能不认为攻击性互动属于虐待。因此,本研究旨在通过教育活动来管理和减少这种虐待。 设计: 在澳大利亚新西兰临床试验注册中心(ACTRN 12617001618347)注册的分组随机试验。 方法: 该试验在澳大利亚墨尔本的养老院中进行,于2017年1月获得资助。使用密封的不透明信封,随机分配病房(作为干预组和对照组)。相继招聘符合条件的护理人员,并提供知情同意。干预组的护士接受教育活动,对照组的护士继续接受常规标准护理。主要结果包括认知、管理和报告干预前后的虐待情况,并根据意向治疗分析进行评估。 讨论: 管理和减少对住院老年人的虐待至关重要。这项教育活动可协助护理人员保护遭受虐待的弱势老人,并可改善对居住在养老院的老人的综合循证护理。</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To examine nursing staffs' geriatric knowledge, perceptions about interprofessional collaboration and patient‐centred care, and perceived learning needs related to working with hospitalised older people. Method: A triangulation mixed methods design was used. A survey was administered to nursing staff that contained the Knowledge About Older Patients Quiz, the patient‐centered Care measure and the Modified Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration measure. Interviews were conducted to understand nursing staffs' learning needs. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Interview data were analysed using content analysis. Survey and interview data were then compared and contrasted. Results: Twenty‐two nursing staff (response rate 26%) completed surveys and 14 participated in interviews. The mean knowledge about older patients score was 22.95, indicating moderately high gerontological knowledge. The mean scores on the patient‐centered Care measure and Modified Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration were moderately high at 3.75 and 3.86, respectively. Themes developed from analysis of the interview data were as follows: complex vulnerable population, clinical care concerns and working as a team. In spite of scores on knowledge surveys, nursing staff identified learning needs related to managing the responsive behaviours of older patients with cognitive impairment, chemical and physical restraints, mobility and continence. Conclusions: There was an incongruence between survey and interview data as nursing staff reported gaps in their knowledge despite moderately high scores on the Knowledge about Older People Quiz. Further research is needed to understand additional factors that influence nurses' educational needs.</ab>

        <ab>In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

        <ab>Life-expectancy is constantly increasing; it is no longer unusual to be treating patients older than 85 or even 90 years, whether at their own home or in a nursing home. The medical prescription often specifies "maintaining the independence of an elderly subject; walking rehabilitation", with no mention of any underlying pathology or pathologies, however frequent, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, cognitive disorder, psychomotor disorder, iterative falls, osteoarthritis and/or depression, all of which complicate and prolong treatment. According to the prescription assistance document of the French national health insurance system, management of the elderly centers on rehabilitation of walking, either in a complex context of resumption of walking, or in a context of independence when the subject is able to remain upright, where it often amounts to "maintaining walking capacity" or "walk therapy". The aim of the present article is to define "independence", to describe management aims and techniques in this population, to compare the specifications of the medical prescription versus the actual content of our rehabilitation protocol, and to match this with the health insurance system terminology. We present feedback from one detailed example and other more summary cases, so as to keep the article relatively succinct. Readers may consult any of the numerous essential tools,^ such as the French Health Authority's "Masso-kinésithérapie dans la conservation des capacities motrices de la personne âgée fragile à domicile" (Role of physiotherapy in conserving motor capacity in frail elderly subjects at home) (April 2005) (HAS, 2005) or the update of the Encyclopédie Médico-Chirurgicale on geriatric assessment and rehabilitation (EMC-kinésithérapie, 2015).</ab>
        <ab>La longévité des personnes âgées augmente de plus en plus ; il n'est pas rare de traiter des personnes de plus de 85 ans, voire de plus de 90 ans, à domicile ou en établissement d'hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes. La prescription médicale est souvent intitulée « maintien de l'autonomie de la personne âgée, rééducation à la marche », sans précision de pathologies sous-jacentes éventuelles, mais fréquentes, comme un syndrome extra-pyramidal, des troubles cognitifs, une désadaptation psychomotrice, des chutes à répétition, des troubles arthrosiques ou une dépression qui rendent le traitement complexe et prolongé. Pour l'assurance maladie, dans son aide à la prescription, le traitement des personnes âgées s'articule autour de la rééducation de la déambulation, soit dans un contexte complexe de reprise de la marche, soit dans un contexte d'autonomie quand le sujet est capable de tenir la verticalité ; il se traduit bien souvent par « entretien de la marche ou marcho-thérapie ». Le but de cet article est de définir l'autonomie, de décrire les objectifs et les techniques de traitement de cette population, de confronter l'intitulé de la prescription médicale avec le contenu de notre protocole de rééducation, et d'en faire le parallèle avec la nomenclature. Il s'agit d'un retour d'expériences à partir d'un exemple détaillé et d'autres cas plus synthétiques pour ne pas alourdir l'exposé. Le lecteur peut consulter des outils essentiels comme « Masso-kinésithérapie dans la conservation des capacités motrices de la personne âgée fragile à domicile » élaboré par la Haute Autorité de Santé en avril 2005 (HAS, 2005) ou la mise à jour de l'Encyclopédie Médico- Chirurgicale sur l'évaluation et la rééducation gériatrique (EMC-kinésithérapie, 2015).</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To characterise older inpatients in a haematology unit. Methods: Hospital case‐mix data of haematology separations of all ages (n = 7419) and more extensive data restricted to older patients (age ≥75 years, n = 1025) were evaluated. Results: From 2000 to 2014, there was a 200% increase in those aged ≥85 years who were more likely to have a geriatric syndrome as the principal diagnosis (P &lt; 0.05), have delirium (P &lt; 0.05), receive less intensive treatment (P &lt; 0.001) and be discharged to a nursing home (P &lt; 0.001). Compared to younger inpatients, those aged ≥75 years were more likely to be emergency admissions (48% vs 37%, P &lt; 0.001) and die during the admission (8% vs 4%, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Haematologists care for older inpatients who are complex with multidisciplinary health service needs. There may be value in conducting comprehensive geriatric assessments in this setting.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Mealtimes directly impact the quality of life of residents in aged care. The objective of The Lantern Project is to improve the dining experience of aged care residents to reduce malnutrition risk through improving dietary intake, meal. Methods: A transdisciplinary team of aged care professionals and resident advocates was formed as a collaboration collectively known as The Lantern Project. Results: This paper outlines the journey and timeline of The Lantern Project collaboration since its inception and the interplay between the monthly stakeholder meetings and inter‐related research projects demonstrating improved outcomes. Conclusion: Transdisciplinary collaboration offers well‐grounded benefits and realistic strategies sensitive to the complexity of the aged care setting.</ab>

        <ab>Background Older adults living with frailty represent a complex group who are increasingly accessing regional geriatric services. Goal-based care planning is the industry standard in the care of older adults, yet few studies illustrate how goal-based care planning is being conducted with this population. Understanding how frailty impacts goal-based care planning in regional geriatric services is key to improving patient care. Methods In this "Go-Along" method of data collection, nine observational experiences were conducted, nine responses from the Interprofessional Role Shadowing Tool were obtained, and eight responses to follow-up questions were received. Open coding of the data was performed retrospectively, and indexed themes were identified. Results Although the Geriatric Clinicians indicated that goal-based care planning and frailty were central to practice, the observations indicated no clear process to patient-centred goal-setting or frailty identification in practice. The results infer a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Conclusions A clear process to goal-based care planning in interprofessional geriatric services is needed. This objective requires practical education that emphasizes the skills necessary to implement goal-setting within unique, interprofessional care environments. Further research is necessary to establish if frailty identification is necessary in goal-based care planning, or if a patient-centred approach is more advantageous in practice.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Person‐centredness is important in delivering care for long‐term conditions. New models of care aim to co‐ordinate care through integration of health and social care which require new ways of working, often remotely from the patient. Objective: To describe how person‐centred care is enacted within multidisciplinary groups (MDGs) created as part of a new service, integrating health and social care for older people. Methods: We followed the implementation of eight neighbourhood MDGs, observing and interviewing staff from three MDGs at different phases of programme implementation using semi‐structured topic guides. Results: Thirty‐four MDG meetings were observed and 32 staff interviewed. Three core themes were identified which impacted on enactment of person‐centred care: the structural context of MDGs enabling person‐centred care; interaction of staff and knowledge sharing during the MDG meetings; and direct staff involvement of the person outside the MDG discussion. Conclusions: This study provides new insights into attempts to enact person‐centred care within a new model of service delivery. Teams did what they could to enact person‐centred care in the absence of the "real" patient within MDG meetings. They were successful in delivering and co‐ordinating some aspects of care (eg prompting medication reviews, referring to social worker, health improvement and arranging further multidisciplinary team meetings for complex cases). This "absence of patients" and time pressures within the MDGs led to reliance on the "virtual" record, enhanced by additional "soft" knowledge provided by staff, rather than ensuring the patient's voice was included.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Nursing home residents often suffer from multi-morbidities and geriatric syndromes leading to lower quality of life or mortality. Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) and malnutrition are profound conditions in this complex profile of multi-morbidities and are associated with deprived mental -and physical health status, e.g. aspiration pneumonia or dehydration. This study aimed to assess the association between OD and malnutrition in Dutch nursing home residents.Design: Data for this cross-sectional study were obtained from the annual National Prevalence Measurement of Quality of Care (LPZ).Setting: The National Prevalence Measurement of Quality of Care was conducted in Nursing Homes in The Netherlands.Participants: Participants were nursing home residents age 65 or older and admitted to psychogeriatric- or somatic wards.Measurements: The measurements were taken by trained nurses from the participating nursing homes. Anthropometric measurements and unintended weight loss (%) were assessed to determine nutritional status (malnutrition). OD was assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire assessing clinically relevant symptoms of OD such as swallowing problems or sneezing/coughing while swallowing. Cox regression was applied to assess the association between malnutrition and clinically relevant symptoms of OD in older Dutch nursing home residents.Results: Approximately 12% of the residents suffered from swallowing problems and 7% sneezed/coughed while swallowing liquids or solid foods. Approximately 10% of the residents was malnourished. Residents with OD symptoms were more often malnourished compared to residents without OD symptoms. Approximately 17% of the problematic swallowers were concurrently malnourished. Increased risk for malnutrition was found in residents suffering from swallowing problems (PR 1.5, 95%CI 1.2-1.9), as well as in residents that sneezed/ coughed while swallowing (PR 1.3, 95%CI 1.0-1.7). Stratification based on wards revealed that problematic swallowers from somatic wards were at a high risk of malnutrition (PR 1.9, 95%CI 1.3-2.8).Conclusion: Clinically relevant symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia, such as swallowing problems and sneezing/coughing while swallowing are associated with increased risk of malnutrition in psychogeriatric and somatic Dutch nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>As the population ages, the risk of becoming malnourished increases. Research has shown that poor oral health can be a risk factor for malnutrition in institutionalized elderly. However, it remains unclear whether oral health problems, edentulousness and health-related quality of life also pose a risk for malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults. In this cross-sectional observational study, 1325 community-living elderly (≥75 years) were asked to complete questionnaires regarding nutritional status, oral status (edentulous, remaining teeth, or implant-supported overdentures), oral health problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, activities of daily living (ADL) and complexity of care needs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with nutritional status as dependent variable. Of the respondents, 51% (n = 521) were edentulous, 38.8% (n = 397) had remaining teeth and 10.2% (n = 104) had an implant-supported overdenture. Elderly with complex care needs were malnourished most frequently, followed by frail and robust elderly (10%, 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively). Malnourished elderly reported more frequent problems with chewing and speech when compared with well-nourished elderly (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analysis did not show an association between malnutrition and oral health problems and edentulousness, although HRQoL was associated with malnutrition (odds ratio (OR) 0.972, confidence interval (CI) 0.951–0.955). Based on the results of this cross-sectional study, it can be concluded that poor HRQoL is significantly associated with malnutrition; however, edentulousness and oral health problems are not.</ab>

        <ab>Background the need for palliative and end of life care for the oldest old is growing rapidly. Family carers often report they do not feel well supported; for better practice and policy, we need better understanding of their experiences and how to support them. Design and setting people in the LiLACS NZ longitudinal study of advanced age identified a carer to be interviewed after their death. Nominated caregivers were contacted 3–6 months after an older person's death and invited to take part in the current study. Subjects fifty-eight interviews were conducted with carers of 52 people in advanced age, 20 Māori and 32 non-Māori. The majority of the 58 carers were in their 60 s and were women. Methods guided-conversation interviews covered end of life preferences and experiences, needs and gaps in support, arrangements after death, and experiences of bereavement. Rigorous data analysis included multiple researchers identifying and interrogating themes across and within the transcripts, and feedback and discussion with participants. Results we identify a typology of nine categories of care, and argue that the support and care provided by family should be understood as going beyond simple task-based transactions. We present a model of end of life care describing and explaining inter-related aspects of knowing, doing and negotiating care tasks. Conclusions this work furthers current understandings of care, as multifaceted and negotiated. This has very practical implications for thinking about how best to support the complex end of life caregiving work of people caring for a person in advanced age.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that the Care Quality Commission examined 20 local health and care systems in Great Britain to understand how services collaborated to support people aged over 65 years. They concluded that an effective system relied on the right culture, capability, and capacity. They admitted that collaboration between organisations is not always encouraged. It is mentioned that community nursing is an essential element of complex care delivery.</ab>

        <ab>Pioneering advances have been made in Internet of Things technologies (IoT) in healthcare. This article describes the development and testing of a bespoke IoT system for dementia care. Technology integrated health management (TIHM) for dementia is part of the NHS England National Test Bed Programme and has involved trailing the deployment of network enabled devices combined with artificial intelligence to improve outcomes for people with dementia and their carers. TIHM uses machine learning and complex algorithms to detect and predict early signs of ill health. The premise is if changes in a person's health or routine can be identified early on, support can be targeted at the point of need to prevent the development of more serious complications.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of self-care on the prevalence of loneliness among elderly people living in retirement homes and older people living in their homes/communities.Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted through standardized SELSA-L assessment loneliness questionnaires and the Self Care Assessment Worksheet for self-care assessment. The results were processed using the Kruskal–Wallis test.Findings The obtained results have shown that impaired self-care ability affects the prevalence of loneliness among the elderly almost the same in both groups of participants. However, regarding the relationship between the state of health and self-care, only a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of loneliness is found in the case of the participants living in their homes, with the worst health condition affecting the poorer psychological care.Research limitations/implications It is necessary to point out the limitations of the research, primarily sample limitations and the selected design of the study. The sample consisted of two different and relatively small groups of participants which could adversely affect the representativeness of the sample and reduce the possibility of generalising the results. The next limiting factor is the age distribution the authors used in the research, where the age of the participants as a very important variable was collected by age range and not precisely which consequently resulted in inequality in subgroup sizes. Thus, the middle age (75–85) covers up to ten years, which is a huge range at an older age and can mean major differences in functional ability, and can impact the self-care assessment.Practical implications Nurses are indispensable in care for the elderly and they need to promote and encourage self-care of the elderly through health care. Elderly people living in retirement homes should be allowed to participate equally in health care in order to preserve their own autonomy and dignity. However, to benefit those who live in their homes, nurses should be connected to the local community and thus stimulate various forms of preventative (testing blood sugar levels, blood pressure and educating on the importance of preventive examinations) or recreational activities in the environment of elderly people with the goal of preserving their functional abilities.Originality/value The impact of self-care on loneliness was not sufficiently researched, and this paper contributed to understanding the complexity of loneliness phenomena among the elderly with the aim of developing a model of prevention.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: More than 77% of older people in residential aged care require some support with bowel management1. The Aged Care Complaints Commissioner provides a free service for anyone to raise their concerns about quality of care and services being delivered to people receiving aged care services subsidised by the Australian Government. In 2017, more than 75% of all complaints to the Aged Care Commissioner were for residential care, and of these complaints, continence and bowel management rated in the top five of the most frequent issues received. The Aged Care Complaints Commissioner has a clinical unit which provides advice on complex clinical matters that arise from complaints. The aim of this study was to explore the scenarios that resulted in complaints to the Commissioner's clinical unit on bowel management in residential aged care to identify why the complaints were made and how the Commissioner worked with complainants and service providers to reach satisfactory outcomes and improve bowel management in residential aged care. Materials and methods: This descriptive case study tracked complaints through the Commissioner's Clinical Unit in a six-month period, between July and December 2017. Complaints were analysed for information from complainants and service providers about bowel management. Twelve complaints were identified and included in the case study. Data from the 12 complaints were collected and analysed. Results: Of the 12 complaints analysed, nine complaints resulted in the clinical unit identifying gaps according to an expected level of bowel management. Poor management of chronic constipation and staff not recognising signs and symptoms of impaction were the most common clinical issues identified. Other clinical issues identified included gaps in continence assessments, individualised bowel care planning, communication processes and documentation. The Commissioner worked with complainants and service providers to resolve all 12 complaints, which resulted in actions taken by service providers to improve bowel management of residents. These actions included continence and bowel management education to staff, revision of bowel management policies and procedures, and implementation of communication systems to improve monitoring processes to aid in clinical decision making. As the result of the complaints and investigation, four referrals were made to the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency regarding bowel management. Conclusions: Analysis of the complaints showed that bowel management was not raised in isolation of other clinical issues by the complainants in all of the 12 complaints. Other issues concurrently investigated by the clinical unit included falls, wound care, hydration, nutrition, medication management, skin care, behaviour management, staffing and skills mix. It is not surprising that when a complaint was made about bowel management, other clinical factors were also identified. Bowel management in the older person requires a broad scoped view that considers multiple interacting factors. Effective bowel management in residential care requires a holistic and person centred approach as well as effective systems in place to guide staff in the management of complex care needs of residents. Competing interest statement: None.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: This scoping review explored: (i) the role of unregulated care providers in the healthcare system; (ii) their potential role on interprofessional teams; (iii) the impact of unregulated care provider’s role on quality of care and patient safety; and (iv) education and employment standards. Background: Unregulated care providers in Canada assist older adults with personal support and activities of daily living in a variety of care settings. As the care needs of an aging population become increasingly complex, the role of unregulated care providers in healthcare delivery has also evolved. Currently, many unregulated care providers are performing tasks previously performed by regulated health professionals, with potential implications for quality of care and patient safety. Information is fragmented on the role, education and employment standards of unregulated care providers. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the methods outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, 2005, 19) and Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien (Implementation Science, 5, 2010, 69). An iterative search of published and grey literature was conducted from January 2000 to September 2016 using Medline, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Google. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to identify relevant studies published in English. Results: The search yielded 63 papers for review. Results highlight the evolving role of unregulated care providers, a lack of recognition and a lack of authority for unregulated care provider decision‐making in patient care. Unregulated care providers do not have a defined scope of practice. However, their role has evolved to include activities previously performed by regulated professionals. Variations in education and employment standards have implications for quality of care and patient safety. Conclusions: Unregulated care providers are part of an important workforce in the long‐term care and community sectors in Canada. Their evolving role should be recognised and efforts made to leverage their experience on interprofessional teams and reduce variations in education and employment standards. Implications for practice: This study highlights the evolving role of unregulated care providers in Canada and presents a set of recommendations for implementation at micro, meso, and macro policy levels.</ab>

        <ab>The prison population is aging at an alarming rate and many older persons have the potential to develop dementia while in prison. This case report aims to explore the needs of older people living with dementia in prison and discusses the interventions that exist to address these needs. As the condition progresses, persons with dementia become increasingly reliant on the support of others for their health and well-being because of the increasing complexity of physical healthcare and psychosocial needs. Very few interventions are cited in the research literature regarding the use, acceptability, and/or effectiveness of programming for people living with dementia in prison. To support the unique and complex needs of these persons, research is needed to guide the development of evidence-informed dementia programs and services as well as consideration of interdisciplinary collaboration with community organizations.</ab>

        <ab>Interprofessional collaborative education and practice has become a cornerstone of optimal person-centered management in the current complex health care climate. This is especially important when working with older adults, many with multiple chronic conditions and challenging health care needs. This paper describes a feasibility study of the Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training 2.0 (GITT 2.0) program focused on providing interprofessional care to complex and frail older adults with multiple chronic conditions. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design facilitated program implementation and evaluation. Over three years (2013-2016), 65 graduate students from nursing, midwifery, social work, and pharmacy participated along with 25 preceptors. Participants were surveyed on their attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration pre and post-intervention and participated in focus groups. While attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration did not change quantitatively, focus groups revealed changes in language and enhanced perspectives of participants. Based on the evaluation data, the GITT 2.0 Toolkit was refined for use in interprofessional education and practice activities related to quality initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Problems experienced by older people with complex needs to live at home have been reported in the literature. This qualitative study builds on previous research and investigates enduring issues older people face when interacting with healthcare services. Aim: To gain an in‐depth understanding of what is involved in providing good quality health care for older people who need support to live at home. Methodological design: We adopted an interpretive descriptive approach and conducted semi‐structured interviews with older people (n = 7), carers (n = 8) and key informants (n = 11). Initial and secondary analysis of qualitative data was completed. Findings: Major themes emerged about meanings of partnership in health care, and invisibility of the older person as a partner in health care. Partnership in health care was understood to mean being treated as an equal, being involved in decision‐making, and making contributions which impact on health care and health systems. The metaphorical concept of ‘invisibility’ related to the older person not being seen and heard as a partner in health care, as well as being a recipient of care. Conclusions: We concluded that older people who need support to live at home are not highly visible to health providers, policymakers and researchers as a central partner and consumer to be meaningfully engaged in shaping their health care. Opportunities to address persistent issues with quality of health care may in future be achieved through stronger partnerships between older people and health providers, to find new ways to improve the quality of care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Aims: To determine how undergraduate assistant in nursing employment in aged care helps to prepare new graduates for clinical work as a Registered Nurse. Background: The amount and quality of clinical experience afforded by university programs has been the subject of constant debate in the nursing profession. New graduate nurses are often deemed inadequately prepared for clinical practice and so many nursing students seek employment as assistants in nursing whilst studying to increase their clinical experience. Design: This paper presents the first phase of a larger mixed‐methods study to explore whether undergraduate assistant in nursing employment in aged care prepares new graduate nurses for the clinical work environment. The first phase involved the collection of quantitative data from a modified Preparation for Clinical Practice survey, which contained 50‐scaled items relating to nursing practice. Methods: Ethics approval was obtained prior to commencing data collection. New graduate nurses who were previously employed as assistants in nursing in aged care and had at least 3 months’ experience as a Registered Nurse, were invited to complete the survey. Social media and professional networks were used to distribute the survey between March 2015 – May 2016 and again in January 2017—February 2017. Purposeful and snowballing sampling methods using social media and nursing networks were used to collect survey responses. Data were analysed using principal components analysis. Results: 110 completed surveys were returned. Principal components analysis revealed four underlying constructs (components) of undergraduate assistant in nursing employment in aged care. These were emotional literacy (component 1), clinical skills (component 2), managing complex patient care (component 3) and health promotion (component 4). Conclusion: The four extracted components reflect the development of core nursing skills that transcend that of technical skills and includes the ability to situate oneself as a nurse in the care of an individual and in a healthcare team.</ab>

        <ab>Delivering person-centered care (PCC) is no longer an option for nursing homes (NH) that receive funding from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. NH staff need evidence-based protocols to guide efforts in honoring preferred choices of residents, especially those that are perceived to be risky. The Rothschild Care Planning Process for Resident Choice was created to honor such choices. The current article provides a case exemplar to demonstrate the use of the Rothschild Care Planning Process for Resident Choice with one NH resident who was perceived by staff to be making a risky choice. The scenario outlines six steps to the process, highlighting areas for focus and documentation that addresses complexities and best practices in delivering PCC. Three recommendations are offered to address residents' choices that carry risk: (a) adapt care community policies, (b) engage direct care staff in care planning, and (c) provide staff training in facilitating resident choice.</ab>

        <ab>In the context of an aging population, both the need for home care services and its complexity of care have increased in many high-income countries. Yet, the definition of what constitutes complex care is largely elusive. This systematic review examined the conceptual definition of complex care within the home care environment using several social and health science databases for research published from 2000 to 2017. Of the 25 articles and reports identified, only 16 addressed complex care specifically and included older adults, aging, and/or home care. The results showed that complex care for older adults is primarily defined from a biomedical approach focusing on chronic disease and management and less commonly from the perspective of the social determinants of health. Future studies should consider the importance of the continuum of care needs from both the biomedical and the social determinants to adequately plan and provide care for older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisymptom, neurodegenerative disease affecting primarily older adults. With progression, many individuals become homebound and removed from coordinated, expert care, resulting in excess morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures in acute care settings and institutions. Home visit care models have achieved the triple aim of improving individual and population health while reducing costs in many frail, community‐dwelling geriatric cohorts. This study details a novel, interdisciplinary home visit program specifically designed for individuals with PD and related disorders and their family caregivers built upon best practice principles in the care of multimorbid older adults. At each quarterly home visit, a movement disorders–trained neurologist, social worker, and nurse work in parallel with the individual and caregiver to complete a history, physical, detailed medication reconciliation, psychosocial needs assessment, and home safety assessment. A comprehensive, person‐centered plan is agreed upon, referrals to community resources are made, standardized documentation is shared, and follow‐up communication is instituted. In the first 2 years, 272 visits were conducted with 85 individuals who represent one of the oldest, most disabled PD populations reported. Satisfaction with and retention in the program were high. This study represents the first translation of the success of interdisciplinary and home‐based geriatric care models to a population with a specific neurological disease. Preliminary evidence supports the need for such programs in vulnerable populations. Future studies will prospectively assess person‐centered outcomes, the effect of using telemedicine on sustainability, and cost effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Background: With ageing of Australians, the numbers of residential aged care (RAC) residents is rising. This places a spotlight on decisions about appropriate care for this population, including hospitalisation and end-of-life (EOL) care. The aim was to study a sample of RAC residents who attended and died in hospital, to quantify measurable components of EOL care so as to describe the extent of palliative care required. Methods: A retrospective case-note review of hospital records was conducted in Adelaide, Australia. Participants were 109 RAC residents who attended from July 2013 to June 2014 and died in hospital. Measurements were advance care planning, health care input from the RAC facilities to hospital and components of EOL care. Residents with and without advanced dementia were compared. Results: Advance care directives (ACDs) were present from 11 to 50%, and advance care plans (ACPs) at 60%. There were more ACPs, resuscitation orders (for/against) and do-not-hospitalise orders in residents with advanced dementia than those without. General practitioner (GP) and extended care paramedic (ECP) input on decisions for hospital transfer were 30% and 1 %. Mean hospital stay to death was 5.2 days. For residents admitted under non-palliative care teams, specialist palliative care (SPC) was needed for phone advice in 5%, consultation in 45%, transfer to palliative care unit in 37%, and takeover by SPC team in 19%. Mean number of documented goals-of-care discussions with family/caregiver was 1.7. In the last 3 days of life, the mean daily number of doses of EOL medications was 4.2. Continuous subcutaneous infusion was commenced in 35%. Conclusion: Staff in RAC need to be adequately resourced to make complex decisions about whether to transfer to hospital. RAC nurses are mainly making these decisions as GP and ECP input were suboptimal. Ways to support nurses and optimise decision-making are needed. Advance care planning can be improved, especially documentation of EOL wishes and hospitalisation orders. By describing the components of EOL care, it is hoped providers and policy makers have more information to assist with making decisions about what is the most appropriate care for this population.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate decision-making around hospital transfer and/or referral of residents to a Residential InReach (RiR) service in north-eastern metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, from the perspectives of residential aged care facility (RACF) staff, general practitioners (GPs) and RiR registered nurses (RNs). Methods: Thirty-one staff from eight RACFs, five GPs and four RiR RNs participated in individual or group interviews. Results: Residential aged care facility staff and GPs valued and relied upon RiR to manage unwell residents. Thematic analysis identified RiR utilisation was driven by the following: (i) complexity of decision-making processes in RACFs; (ii) variability in facility-based medical and nursing care; and (iii) impact of RiR service outcomes on patients and referrers. Conclusion: Availability of timely and appropriate medical and nursing care in RACFs was reported to influence transfers to the hospital and/or referrals to RiR. RiR was used to complement or substitute usual care available to residents. Further research and improvements in RACF and RiR resources are required.</ab>

        <ab>RÉSUMÉ: Malgré la complexité croissante des soins en foyers de soins de longue durée, le rôle des médecins dans la prestation des soins aux résidents a été peu étudié. Cette étude exploratoire internationale visait à mieux comprendre les rôles des médecins, leurs responsabilités et leurs tâches, ainsi qu’à explorer les caractéristiques uniques de la pratique médicale dans les foyers de soins de longue durée. Des entrevues ont été menées avec 18 médecins. Ces médecins ont mentionné qu’ils contribuaient fortement à la qualité des soins pour les résidents, en clarifiant les objectifs des soins, en prenant des mesures pour réduire les hospitalisations et les prescriptions de médicaments non nécessaires, et en contribuant à la formation du personnel. Les pratiques en foyers de soins de longue durée impliquaient les médecins au centre de réseaux de relations qui assuraient non seulement une meilleure qualité des soins médicaux, mais aussi une satisfaction professionnelle chez les médecins. L’importance de ces relations est telle qu’elle permettait d’aller au-delà des démarcations traditionnelles entre le domaine médical et le domaine social, et mettait en évidence qu’une bonne pratique médicale implique de bonnes pratiques sociales. Considérant la nature exploratoire de l’étude, les auteurs recommandent que de futures recherches soient menées pour mieux comprendre les dimensions relationnelles associées à la pratique de la médecine en foyers de soins de longue durée. Despite the increasing complexity of nursing home care, the role of physicians caring for residents is largely unexplored. This international, exploratory study sought to learn about physicians’ roles, responsibilities, and tasks as well as investigate the unique qualities of medical practice in nursing homes. We conducted interviews with 18 physicians, who reported making important contributions to the quality of resident care, including clarifying the goals of care, working to reduce unnecessary medication and hospitalization, as well as contributing to staff education. Nursing home practice involved physicians in networks of relations that were instrumental to the quality of medical care and physicians’ job satisfaction. The importance of these relationships disrupts the oft-drawn boundary between the medical and the social, suggesting that good medical practice depends on good social practice. Reflecting the exploratory nature of the study, we recommend research to better understand and support the relational dimensions of nursing home medicine.</ab>

        <ab>I am a social gerontologist, broadly defined as a social scientist who studies how later life is experienced, structured, and controlled in a society and in social settings. Although gerontology is often confused with geriatrics (a medical specialty), gerontologists are typically not clinicians but may study issues related to old age and health care such as the societal conditions that shape how medical care is provided and financed and how early exposure to education relates to later life health. In this essay, I argue that thinking like a gerontologist is important when considering what makes a good life in late life. To think like a gerontologist is to consider the cultural and societal values—past and present—that shape the experience of aging, to recognize people as complex beings whose individual lives do not follow predictable patterns or easily identified trajectories, and to recognize our own habits of regarding older persons as "other" and the consequences of "othering" for older persons and social systems. After a brief history of gerontology, highlighting a few core concepts that gerontologists share, I propose three important questions to consider regarding a good life in late life.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Worldwide increases in the numbers of older people alongside an accompanying international policy incentive to support ageing‐in‐place have focussed the importance of home‐care services as an alternative to institutionalisation. Despite this, funding models that facilitate a responsive, flexible approach are lacking. Casemix provides one solution, but the transition from the well‐established hospital system to community has been problematic. This research seeks to develop a Casemix funding solution for home‐care services through meaningful client profile groups and supporting pathways. Unique assessments from 3,135 older people were collected from two health board regions in 2012. Of these, 1,009 arose from older people with non‐complex needs using the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐Contact Assessment (CA) and 2,126 from the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐Home‐Care (HC) from older people with complex needs. Home‐care service hours were collected for 3 months following each assessment and the mean weekly hours were calculated. Data were analysed using a decision tree analysis, whereby mean hours of weekly home‐care was the dependent variable with responses from the assessment tools, the independent variables. A total of three main groups were developed from the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐CA, each one further classified into “stable” or “flexible.” The classification explained 16% of formal home‐care service hour variability. Analysis of the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐HC generated 33 clusters, organised through eight disability “sub” groups and five “lead” groups. The groupings explained 24% of formal home‐care services hour variance. Adopting a Casemix system within home‐care services can facilitate a more appropriate response to the changing needs of older people.</ab>

        <ab>Today, millions of Americans age 65 and older are living with dementia. With the progressive decline in cognition and the incurable nature of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, patients experience multiple complex conditions and are not able to choose their care priority. In this study we review the unique challenges related to dementia faced by older adults with dementia, their families, and the health system in the United States, and we propose to address or alleviate such issues by building evidence-based, age-friendly health systems for older adults with dementia, including improving patient priority care and transitions and coordination among different care settings.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To examine nursing student placement preferences submitted as online comments to a university's placement management system, to inform strategies for positive residential aged care experiences. Background There are predicted shortages of nurses to service an ageing population. Clinical placements undertaken by undergraduate nursing students help shape their attitudes and are a key determinant of career decision-making, yet there is little research about why students prefer particular placement areas. Design Analysis of qualitative data from a placement management system. Methods Of 6,610 comments received between 2007-2014, 607 related to aged care and were coded according to preferences for being placed in a residential aged care facility, with reasons for this preference thematically coded and quantified. Results Four hundred and one comments (66.1%) related to students requesting not to be allocated residential aged care for the upcoming placement, primarily due to previous experience in the sector; 104 (17.1%) referred to aged care in a neutral manner, focusing on conflict of interest; 102 (16.8%) related to a request for an aged care placement. Conclusions The student nurse comments characterise students as being focused on maximising their learning, while considering prior experience. In some cases, increased exposure to aged care is considered to offer limited learning opportunities, which is concerning and suggests that both the tertiary and aged care sectors have a joint responsibility to pursue recognition of aged care nursing as a specialised, highly skilled role. Relevance to clinical practice Nursing programme providers should ensure curriculum content and exposure to aged care placement clearly identify the complexities of care and provide genuine opportunities for knowledge acquisition and skill development based on multifaceted resident care needs. This will support both those interested in a future aged care career and those undecided.</ab>

        <ab>AimTo examine how the introduction of intensive community support (ICS) affected admissions to community hospital (CH) and to explore the views of patients, carers and health professionals on this transition.BackgroundICS was introduced to provide an alternative to CH provision for patients (mostly very elderly) requiring general rehabilitation.MethodRoutine data from both services were analysed to identify the number of admissions and length of stay between September 2012 and September 2014. In total, 10 patients took part in qualitative interviews. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were undertaken with 19 staff members, including managers and clinicians.FindingsThere were 5653 admissions to CH and 1710 to ICS between September 2012 and September 2014. In the five months before the introduction of ICS, admission rates to CH were on average 217/month; in the final five months of the study, when both services were fully operational, average numbers of patients admitted were: CH 162 (a 25% reduction), ICS 97, total 259 (a 19% increase). Patients and carers rated both ICS and CH favourably compared with acute hospital care. Those who had experienced both services felt each to be appropriate at the time; they appreciated the 24 h availability of staff in CH when they were more dependent, and the convenience of being at home after they had improved. In general, staff welcomed the introduction of ICS and appreciated the advantages of home-based rehabilitation. Managers had a clearer vision of ICS than staff on the ground, some of whom felt underprepared to work in the community. There was a consensus that ICS was managing less complex and dependent patients than had been envisaged.ConclusionICS can provide a feasible adjunct to CH that is acceptable to patients. More work is needed to promote the vision of ICS amongst staff in both community and acute sectors.</ab>

        <ab>Amish older adults represent a growing and understudied population whose current health practices, interactions with health care systems outside of their community, and care needs are unknown. Limited research exists on why, when, and how Amish older adults and their caregivers experience health care services outside of their family and community. The purpose of the current study was to describe and explore the perspectives of Amish caregivers caring for older adults and their experiences with health care services outside of their community. A qualitative phenomenological research design was used in combination with a community-based participatory framework with caregivers in a small, rural Amish settlement. Amish caregiving of older adults is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by cultural characteristics. Caregivers place significant cultural value on home caregiving, emphasize the experience as a blessing, and relate misunderstandings between themselves and outside health care providers as significant concerns.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this DNP project was to identify family and psychiatric mental health advanced practice registered nurses' (APRNs) self-rated competence, confidence, experience, and training in the treatment of geriatric depression. The population of older adults in the United States is growing rapidly, and it is becoming increasingly important for health care providers to have a thorough understanding of common mental health disorders. Depression is a commonly misdiagnosed and undertreated mental illness in older adults, and can result in increased morbidity, mortality, and suicide. Diagnosis and treatment of geriatric depression is complicated by polypharmacy, age-related physical changes, and comorbidities. Due to the complexities of this older population, it is critical to have well-trained APRN providers to provide high quality care. This study used a newly developed survey that was distributed to practicing APRN members of the Southern Arizona Advanced Practice Nurse/Nurse Practitioner Society (SAZAPN/NPS). Clinical experts (n=6) reviewed the survey questions for content validity before it was distributed. The participants (n=32) answered 16 questions about their competence, confidence, experience, and training with geriatric depression. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed to describe APRN's responses in each of these four domains. The findings from this study show that the majority of the participants (82%) agree and strongly agree that they are competent in assessing geriatric depression. Over three-fourths (76%) report feeling confident in their ability to accurately diagnose and treat geriatric patients with depression. While just over 70% of the APRNs in this study report they feel confident prescribing antidepressants for geriatric patients, and 65% report feeling confident in psychiatric assessments, only 51% of the respondents agreed that they had adequate training to care for geriatric patients. Organization-offered trainings in geriatric depression were available to 21% of the participants, and 78% agreed they could have used more education and training to help them understand the link between physical and mental health in older adults. While most participants in this survey feel confident and competent, there is still a need to enhance education and training opportunities to better prepare them to provide high quality care for a complex population.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To examine hospital nurses' attitudes towards caring for older adults and delineate associated factors contributing to their attitudes. Background Population ageing is of international significance. A nursing workforce able to care for the ageing population is critical for ensuring quality older adult care. A synthesis of research related to nurses' attitudes towards older adult care is important for informing care quality and the nursing workforce issues. Methods A systematic integrative review process guided the review. Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Medline databases were searched for primary research published between 2005-2017. A total of 1,690 papers were screened with 67 papers read in-depth and eight selected for this review that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results Nurses' held coexisting positive and negative attitudes towards generic and specific aspects of older adult care. Negative attitudes, in particular, were directed at the characteristics of older adults, their care demands or reflected in nurses' approaches to care. Across jurisdictions, work environment, education, experience and demographics emerged as influences on nurses' attitudes. Conclusion There is a paucity of research examining nurses' attitudes towards older adult care. The limited evidence indicates that attitudes towards older people care are complex and contradictory. Influences on nurses' attitudes need further study individually and collectively to build a strong evidence base. Interventional studies are needed as are the development of valid and reliable instruments for measuring nurses' attitudes towards older adult care. Relevance to clinical practice Bolstering postgraduate gerontological preparation is critical for promoting nurses' attitudes towards older adult care. Creating age-friendly work environments, including appropriate resource allocation, is important to support older people care and facilitate positive nursing attitudes.</ab>

        <ab>The physical environment is of particular importance for supporting activities and interactions among older people living in residential care facilities ( RCFs) who spend most of their time inside the facility. More knowledge is needed regarding the complex relationships between older people and environmental aspects in long-term care. The present study aimed to explore how the physical environment influences resident activities and interactions at two RCFs by using a mixed-method approach. Environmental assessments were conducted via the Swedish version of the Sheffield Care Environment Assessment Matrix (S- SCEAM), and resident activities, interactions and locations were assessed through an adapted version of the Dementia Care Mapping ( DCM). The Observed Emotion Rating Scale ( OERS) was used to assess residents' affective states. Field notes and walk-along interviews were also used. Findings indicate that the design of the physical environment influenced the residents' activities and interactions. Private apartments and dining areas showed high environmental quality at both RCFs, whereas the overall layout had lower quality. Safety was highly supported. Despite high environmental quality in general, several factors restricted resident activities. To optimise care for older people, the design process must clearly focus on accessible environments that provide options for residents to use the facility independently.</ab>

        <ab>In high-income countries, migrant live-in caregivers are increasingly in demand to provide health and social care in the home. While there is a wide range of research on the perspectives of live-in caregivers (including domestic workers) in destination countries, few studies address the perspective of families who hire them. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, range and nature of international literature on the needs and experiences of employers/families and care recipients of live-in caregivers. We undertook a scoping review of the literature on this topic using Arksey and O'Malley's five stages. With the assistance of a health science librarian, a comprehensive search of nine databases was undertaken from April to July 2014. Two research assistants independently reviewed 2493 articles. The data were analysed through data charting, numerical summary and thematic analysis. Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria for the scoping review. Many of these studies ( n = 7) were conducted in Israel, and the majority ( n = 8) focus on elderly care recipients. The findings reveal the diverse roles live-in caregivers perform, including emotional and physical care; changes in family dynamics and roles upon hiring a live-in caregiver; the negative experiences, including abuse, of live-in caregivers and elderly care recipients; the positive outcomes for families with a live-in caregiver; and families' common perception that live-in caregivers are like kin, a part of the family. Furthermore, evidence points to some degree of bi-directional emotional support between caregivers and employers/families, which adds complexity to their relations and the negotiation of power.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To investigate relationships between first-line managers' ratings of structural and psychological empowerment, and the subordinates' ratings of structural empowerment, as well as their ratings of the managers' leadership-management performance. Background Work situations in elderly care are complex. To date, few studies have used a longitudinal, correlational and multilevel design to study the working life of subordinates and managers. Method In five Swedish municipalities, questionnaires were answered twice during 2010-12 by 56 first-line managers and 769 subordinates working in nursing homes or home-help services. Results First-line managers' empowerment at Time 1 partially predicted subordinate's structural empowerment and ratings of their managers' leadership-management performance at Time 2. Changes over time partially revealed that the more access managers had to structural empowerment, i.e. increase over time, the higher the ratings were for structural empowerment and managerial leadership-management performance among subordinates. Conclusions Findings strengthen research and theoretical suggestions linking first-line managers' structural empowerment to their subordinates' structural empowerment and ratings of their manager's leadership-management performance. Implications for nursing management Managers with high access to structural empowerment are more likely to provide subordinates access to structural empowerment.</ab>

        <ab>The theory of life in the round is a useful theoretical framework for research aimed at gaining insight into information behaviours of populations in institutional settings such as health care assistants. The theory originates from library and information sciences, drawing on social network theory and the model of information dissemination to explore the information behaviours of marginalised populations participating in small institutionalised worlds. Life in the round provides defining concepts that can be used to support an inquiry into the social norms of a small world that either restrict or liberate the information use and exchange on a daily basis. The discussion includes the supporting theories of information poverty and normative behaviours that add additional detail and depth to concepts within the theory of life in the round. The context of residential aged care is used as an exemplar for the application of the theory of life in the round and provides examples to support application of these concepts to the information practices of health care assistants. Residential aged care is frequently depicted as a healthcare setting where a socially and economically marginalised workforce exists in an increasingly demanding and complex institutional setting. There is limited use of life in the round as a theoretical framework for research in institutional healthcare settings; residential aged care provides a suitable context to explicate the theoretical concepts.</ab>

        <ab>Communicating effectively about risk is fundamental to professionals addressing critical issues with clients and families, and to informed decision making. Using a grounded theory approach, this qualitative study explored how risk is conceptualised and communicated in dementia care. Data were gathered across five focus groups (thirty-five health and social care professionals) covering concepts and perspectives on verbal, numeric and visual forms of communicating risk. Risks were primarily conceptualised as consequences (positive and negative) rather than as likelihood, and related to a wide range of domains. Perceptions were influenced by socio-cultural factors including risk-assessment mechanisms and wider discourse relating to positive risk taking. The language of probability was used in a nonquantified, subjective manner. While professionals routinely received quantitative information, they did not typically communicate using numeric expressions. Verbal expressions of likelihood were widely preferred to numeric. When risks were presented in numeric formats, frequency presentation was seen as more comprehensible than percentages. Several participants saw potential in visual forms of risk communication. Bar charts were generally favoured over icon arrays as more easily understood. Good practice examples for risk communication were identified. This study provides pointers towards further research to support optimal risk communication in the complex domain of community care.</ab>

        <ab>Background The phenomena of missed nursing care is usually measured through quantitative surveys that detail the specific tasks that are rationed or delayed, and the reasons why this is so. These studies report high levels of agreement within and across countries between the two major measures employed; the Kalisch’s MISSCARE tool and the RN4Cast Basel Extent of Rationing of Nursing Care (BERNCA) instrument. Most of these studies have been conducted in acute care settings and demonstrate the impact of lack of human and other resources upon decisions to omit care. Less in known about missed care in residential aged care Aim To explore the frequency and causes of missed care in residential aged care in three Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Methods Quantitative and qualitative data from 922 respondents working in residential aged care to the MISSCARE survey were bought together to identify the tasks missed in aged care and reasons for this. Findings Respondents report the omission of unplanned care (toileting and answering bells) and rehabilitative care. The primary reasons for missed care are staffing shortages and difficulties in meeting residents’ complex health care needs due to demands arising from increased resident acuity and fewer skilled nurses to meet this demand. Conclusion Resident care is missed in residential aged care with staffing numbers identified as a key cause.</ab>

        <ab>Enhancing support workers’ (SW) role is timely given increasing demands on human and financial health care resources. This article presents outcomes of a program, delivered to 140 participants from five community aged care providers in Australia, designed to enhance knowledge, skills, and confidence of community aged care SWs, building their practical skills in understanding, recognizing, and responding to complexity. Evaluation training modules on communication, complexity, behavior change, and chronic condition self-management support involved pre/post surveys with SWs and their supervisors. SWs reported greater awareness, skills, and confidence in working with complexity, reinforcing the value of their existing practices and skills. Coordinators reported greater appreciation of SWs’ skills, and greater awareness of gaps in SWs’ support and supervision needs. Educators, policy makers, and services should account for these contributions, given growing fiscal restraint and focus on reablement and consumer-directed care.</ab>

        <ab>The number of older adults with multiple complex comorbidities and frailty is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades, which will necessitate a concomitant increase in the need for skilled clinicians who are able to manage complex geriatric needs. Many physicians, however, lack the required formal training, often leading to long wait-lists for specialist clinics. Yet, clinics led by non-physician professionals specialising in geriatric care could decrease these delays. This article describes the development and evaluation of a nurse practitioner-led interprofessional geriatric outpatient clinic (Inter-D Clinic). A combination of semi-structured clinician interviews, post-clinic follow-up phone calls, satisfaction surveys, and information from the hospital workload management system served as data sources for this formative programme evaluation. Between January 2013 and December 2014, 293 patients were seen in the clinic with the majority being referred for either memory issues (49%) or functional decline (35%). The clinic assessment frequently uncovered other issues, which led to guidance around falls prevention, improved nutrition, medication management, and referrals to available community supports. Both patients and referring physicians were very satisfied with this model of care, which is likely transferable to other locations provided the needed clinical expertise and community support services are available.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare assistants provide the majority of direct care to the residents living in aged residential care. In New Zealand, the delivery of care is under the supervision of the registered nurse. The purpose of this article is to examine the New Zealand policy landscape and care demands in aged residential care. Within the current care environments, registered nurses are challenged by the responsibility of ensuring quality care delivered under supervision by healthcare assistants in an increasingly complex and contract driven environment. The complexity and acuity of a client population requiring specialised care challenges the constraints of care contract expectations and creates significant difficulties for both registered nurses and healthcare assistants. Variability in role identification and scope is a significant barrier to understanding the healthcare assistant workforce as a whole. Individual employment contracts between the employers and healthcare assistants promote further variability with differing role and certification requirements for hourly rates of pay. National contracts used by District Health Boards do not address the acuity creep that is occurring at all levels in aged residential care and the workload increases that directly impact registered nurse supervision of care. The overall funding of aged residential care is caught between a client population predominately funded by the State and the sweeping economic reforms that depend on privatization. Registered nurses need to have an understanding of the socio-political, economic and educational factors that influence care delivery in aged residential care.</ab>

        <ab>Pressure injury is a highly complex multifactorial and costly health problem, which is defined as any injury located on the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence. The objective is to measure the cost and benefit relation regarding the treatment of pressure injuries, focused on the elderly who are treated at home in supplementary health. This is a descriptive study with a quantitative approach, involving medical records of elderly subjects diagnosed with pressure injury, cared for in an institution of self-management, located in Fortaleza (Ceará State, Brazil). Data were collected through the analysis of reports with information about the treatment by associating them with their financial costs. These data were statistically analyzed and organized in four worksheets that were divided into period, procedure, beneficiary, and certified subject. It is known that pressure injury negatively affects the welfare of the elderly, impoverishing their living. Thus, the support to prevention and development of the permanent education of caregivers and family is relevant, by means of health promotion strategies made by Nursing professionals.</ab>

Estudio descriptivo con un enfoque cuantitativo, con la inclusión de los registros de pacientes ancianos con diagnóstico de los daños por presión, atendidos en una institución en la modalidad de autogestión, que se encuentra en Fortaleza (Ceará, Brasil). Los datos fueron recolectados a través del análisis de los informes que contienen datos relacionados con el tratamiento, asociándolos con sus gastos financieros. Los datos se analizaron y se organizaron en cuatro hojas que están divididas por: período, procedimiento, beneficiario y acreditado. Se sabe que los daños por presión afectan negativamente el bienestar de los ancianos, empobreciendo su vivir. Por lo tanto, es importante fomentar la prevención y la construcción de la educación permanente para cuidadores y familiares a través de estrategias de promoción de la salud llevadas a cabo por los profesionales de Enfermería.</ab>
        <ab>A lesão por pressão é um problema de saúde altamente complexo, multifatorial e de alto custo, sendo definida como qualquer lesão localizada na pele e/ou no tecido subjacente, normalmente sobre uma proeminência óssea. Objetivou-se avaliar a relação custo-benefício relacionada ao tratamento de lesões por pressão, com enfoque em idosos atendidos em domicílio na saúde suplementar. Estudo descritivo com abordagem quantitativa, envolvendo prontuários de idosos com diagnóstico de lesões por pressão, atendidos em uma instituição na modalidade autogestão, localizada em Fortaleza (CE). Os dados foram coletados mediante análise de relatórios contendo informações relacionadas ao tratamento, associando- os com os seus gastos financeiros. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente e organizados em quatro planilhas que estão divididas por: período, procedimento, beneficiário e credenciado. Sabemos que a lesão por pressão interfere negativamente no bem-estar dos idosos, empobrecendo o seu viver. Dessa forma, é relevante o incentivo à prevenção e à construção de educação permanente aos cuidadores e familiares, por meio de estratégias de promoção de saúde realizadas pelos profissionais de Enfermagem.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To develop and test feasibility and acceptability of an interactive ICT platform integrated in a tablet for collecting and managing patient-reported concerns of older adults in home care. Background Using different ICT applications, for example interactive tablets for self-assessment of health and health issues based on health monitoring as well as other somatic and psychiatric monitoring systems may improve quality of life, staff and patient communication and feelings of being reassured. The European Commission hypothesises that introduction of ICT applications to the older population will enable improved health. However, evidence-based and user-based applications are scarce. Design The design is underpinned by the Medical Research Council's complex intervention evaluation framework. A mixed-method approach was used combining interviews with older adults and healthcare professionals, and logged quantitative data. Methods In cooperation with a health management company, a platform operated by an interactive application for reporting and managing health-related problems in real time was developed. Eight older adults receiving home care were recruited to test feasibility. They were equipped with the application and reported three times weekly over four weeks, and afterwards interviewed about their experiences. Three nurses caring for them were interviewed. The logged data were extracted as a coded file. Results The older adults reported as instructed, in total 107 reports (Mean 13). The most frequent concerns were pain, fatigue and dizziness. The older adults experienced the application as meaningful with overall positive effects as well as potential benefits for the nurses involved. Conclusions The overall findings in this study indicated high feasibility among older adults using the ICT platform. The study's results support further development of the platform, as well as tests in full-scale studies and in other populations. Relevance to clinical practice An ICT platform increased the older adults' perception of involvement and facilitated communication between the patient and nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Quality of care in the residential aged sector has changed over the past decade. The purpose of this paper is to examine these changes from the perspectives of staff to identify factors influencing quality of residential aged care, and the role and influence of an aged care accreditation programme.Design/methodology/approach Focus groups were held with 66 aged care staff from 11 Australian aged care facilities. Data from semi-structured interviews were analysed to capture categories representing participant views.Findings Participants reported two factors stimulating change: developments in the aged care regulatory and policy framework, and rising consumer expectations. Four corresponding effects on service quality were identified: increasing complexity of resident care, renewed built environments of aged care facilities, growing focus on resident-centred care and the influence of accreditation on resident quality of life. The accreditation programme was viewed as maintaining minimum standards of quality throughout regulatory and social change, yet was considered to lack capacity of itself to explicitly promote or improve resident quality of life.Research limitations/implications For an increasingly complex aged care population, regulatory and societal change has led to a shift in service provision from institutional care models to one that is becoming more responsive to consumer expectations. The capacity of long-established and relatively static accreditation standards to better accommodate changing consumer needs comes into question.Originality/value This is the first study to examine the relationship between accreditation and residential aged care service quality from the perspectives of staff, and offers a nuanced view of “quality” in this setting.</ab>

        <ab>Background: our orthopaedic trauma unit serves a large elderly population, admitting 400-500 hip fractures annually. A higher than expected mortality was detected amongst these patients, prompting a change in the hip fracture pathway. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a change in orthogeriatric provision on hip fracture outcomes and care quality indicators. Patients and Methods: the hip fracture pathway was changed from a geriatric consultation service to a completely integrated service on a dedicated orthogeriatric ward. A total of 1,894 consecutive patients with hip fractures treated in the 2 years before and after this intervention were analysed. Results: despite an increase in case complexity, the intervention resulted in a significant reduction in mean length of stay from 27.5 to 21 days (P &lt; 0.001), a significant reduction in mean time to surgery from 41.8 to 27.2 h (P &lt; 0.001) and a significant 22% reduction in 30-day mortality (13.2-10.3%, P = 0.04). After controlling for the effects of age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Grade and abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), the effect of integrating orthogeriatric services into the hip fracture pathway significantly reduced the risk of mortality (odds ratio 0.68, P = 0.03). Conclusions: changing our hip fracture service from a geriatric consultation model of care to an integrated orthogeriatric model significantly improved mortality and performance indicators. This is the first study to directly compare two accepted models of orthogeriatric care in the same hospital.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To explore current knowledge of medical assessment units (MAUs) with specific reference to older people with complex needs and to stimulate new topics and questions for future policy, research and practice. Methods A scoping review was conducted using an integrated-latent thematic approach. Results This review provides a unique perspective on MAUs and older people which is framed using four themes: efficiency, effectiveness, equity and time. Eighteen articles were reviewed. Most (14) articles reported on efficiency and effectiveness while none reported explicitly on equity. Time was identified as a fourth, latent theme within the literature. Conclusion Findings from this review indicate that future policy, research and practice relating to MAUs should focus on older people with complex needs, patient-centred metrics and those MAU characteristics most likely to deliver positive health outcomes to this particular cohort of patients.</ab>

        <ab>Objective To investigate older patients' encounters with general practice registrars ( GPRs) to inform training and clinical practice. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of data from GPR consultations across five regional training providers in Australia. Data were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression models. Results Our analysis included details of 118 831 consultations, 20 555 (17.6%, 95% CI 17.4-17.8) with patients aged ≥65 years. Older patient encounters had an increased likelihood of including chronic disease ( OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.70, 1.86) and more problems ( OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.20, 1.27). However, in-consultation information or advice was less likely to be sought ( OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88, 0.97), and consultations were briefer ( OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99, 1.00). Conclusion Our results suggest relatively limited GPR exposure to older patients coupled with less complex consultations than expected. Solutions will need to be carefully constructed not only to increase caseloads, but also to address training and supervision concerns.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in older people, with the prevalence increasing with age in both sexes. UTI is a frequent reason for emergency admission to hospital. There are many conditions that contribute to older people being more at risk of UTI and the main preventive strategy is to avoid the use of indwelling urethral catheters. Where an indwelling catheter is inserted its continued use should be regularly reviewed and the catheter removed, especially if the reason for insertion is incontinence and the person becomes additionally incontinent of faeces. Diagnosis of UTI can be complex because older people do not always exhibit the signs and symptoms commonly associated with UTI. Diagnosis can be further complicated by a person's inability to provide a comprehensive history and by difficulties obtaining an uncontaminated, 'clean catch' urine specimen. Antibiotic therapy should not be used routinely for people with asymptomatic bacteriuria and, where antibiotics are required, healthcare professionals should follow local prescribing guidelines.</ab>

        <ab>Efforts at preventing pneumococcal disease are a national health priority, particularly in older adults and especially in post-acute and long-term care settings The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that all adults ≥65 years of age, as well as adults 18–64 years of age with specific risk factors, receive both the recently introduced polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine against 13 pneumococcal serotypes as well as the polysaccharide vaccine against 23 pneumococcal serotypes. Nursing facility licensure regulations require facilities to assess the pneumococcal vaccination status of each resident, provide education regarding pneumococcal vaccination, and administer the appropriate pneumococcal vaccine when indicated. Sorting out the indications and timing for 13 pneumococcal serotypes and 23 pneumococcal serotypes administration is complex and presents a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Here, we discuss the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for older adults, detail AMDA—The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine (The Society)'s recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination practice and procedures, and offer guidance to postacute and long-term care providers supporting the development and effective implementation of pneumococcal vaccine policies.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives There is growing evidence of the potential effectiveness of advance care planning. Yet important knowledge gaps remain regarding the preconditions for successful implementation of advance care planning in the nursing home setting. We aim to identify the preconditions related to successful advance care planning in the nursing home setting. By specifying those, we would be able to make well-founded choices for the future design and planning of advance care planning intervention programs. Design A systematic review. Data sources PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL. Review methods Two authors independently screened publications. One author assessed methodological quality and extracted textual data, which was double-checked for a random sample. We extracted textual data and used thematic synthesis to identify “preconditions”, defined as requirements, conditions and elements necessary to achieve the desired outcome of advance care planning, i.e. attaining concordance between residents' preferences and actual care or treatment received at the end of life. Main findings Based on 38 publications, we identified 17 preconditions at five different levels: resident, family, health-care professional, facility and community. Most preconditions were situated on multiple levels but the majority addressed professionals and the nursing home itself. We summarized preconditions in five domains: to have sufficient knowledge and skills, to be willing and able to participate in advance care planning, to have good relationships, to have an administrative system in place, and contextual factors supporting advance care planning within the nursing home. Conclusion There are multiple preconditions related to successfully implementing advance care planning in the complex nursing home setting that operate at micro, meso and macro level. Future interventions need to address these multiple domains and levels in a whole-system approach in order to be better implementable and more sustainable, while simultaneously target the important role of the health-care professional and the facility itself.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To report a concept analysis of interprofessional collaboration in the context of chronic disease management, for older adults living in communities. Background Increasing prevalence of chronic disease among older adults is creating significant burden for patients, families and healthcare systems. Managing chronic disease for older adults living in the community requires interprofessional collaboration across different health and other care providers, organizations and sectors. However, there is a lack of consensus about the definition and use of interprofessional collaboration for community-based chronic disease management. Design Concept analysis. Data sources Electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, HealthStar, EMBASE, Psych INFO, Ageline and Cochrane Database were searched from 2000 - 2013. Methods Rodgers' evolutionary method for concept analysis. Results The most common surrogate term was interdisciplinary collaboration. Related terms were interprofessional team, multidisciplinary team and teamwork. Attributes included: an evolving interpersonal process; shared goals, decision-making and care planning; interdependence; effective and frequent communication; evaluation of team processes; involving older adults and family members in the team; and diverse and flexible team membership. Antecedents comprised: role awareness; interprofessional education; trust between team members; belief that interprofessional collaboration improves care; and organizational support. Consequences included impacts on team composition and function, care planning processes and providers' knowledge, confidence and job satisfaction. Conclusion Interprofessional collaboration is a complex evolving concept. Key components of interprofessional collaboration in chronic disease management for community-living older adults are identified. Implications for nursing practice, education and research are proposed.</ab>

        <ab>Background The increasingly complex nature of care home residents' health status means that this population requires significant multidisciplinary team input from health services. To address this, a multisector and multiprofessional enhanced healthcare programme was implemented in nursing homes across Gateshead Council in Northern England. Study Aims To explore the views and experiences of practitioners, social care officers, and carers involved in the enhanced health care in care home programme, in order to develop understanding of the service delivery model and associated workforce needs for the provision of health care to older residents. Methods A qualitative constructivist methodology was adopted. The study had two stages. Stage 1 explored the experiences of the programme enhanced healthcare workforce through group, dyad, and individual interviews with 45 participants. Stage 2 involved two workshops with 28 participants to develop Stage 1 findings (data were collected during February-March 2016). Thematic and content analysis were applied. Findings The enhanced healthcare programme provides a whole system approach to the delivery of proactive and responsive care for nursing home residents. The service model enables information exchange across organizational and professional boundaries that support effective decision making and problem solving. Clinical Relevance Understanding of the processes and outcomes of a model of integrated health care between public and independent sector care home services for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Delirium occurring in patients with dementia is referred to as delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD). People who are older with dementia and who are institutionalized are at increased risk of developing delirium when hospitalized. In addition, their prior cognitive impairment makes detecting their delirium a challenge. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision are considered the standard reference for the diagnosis of delirium and include criteria of impairments in cognitive processes such as attention, additional cognitive disturbances, or altered level of arousal. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision does not provide guidance regarding specific tests for assessment of the cognitive process impaired in delirium. Importantly, the assessment or inclusion of preexisting cognitive impairment is also not addressed by these standards. The challenge of DSD gets more complex as types of dementia, particularly dementia with Lewy bodies, which has features of both delirium and dementia, are considered. The objective of this article is to critically review key elements for the diagnosis of DSD, including the challenge of neuropsychological assessment in patients with dementia and the influence of particular tests used to diagnose DSD. To address the challenges of DSD diagnosis, we present a framework for guiding the focus of future research efforts to develop a reliable reference standard to diagnose DSD. A key feature of a reliable reference standard will improve the ability to clinically diagnose DSD in facility-based patients and research studies.</ab>

        <ab>Background More than one-half of nursing home residents experience a complex mix of pain. Despite this, assessment and treatment of pain remain inadequate. Methods Using techniques of the Cochrane Collaboration and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we assessed efficacy of interventions aimed at reducing chronic pain in nursing home residents &gt;65 years of age. We searched for controlled trials comparing and measuring pain interventions using standardized pain scales. Two reviewers independently selected included studies, abstracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses calculating standardized mean differences (SMDs) using random effect models. Results Fourteen trials (n = 2293) were included in the meta-analysis: 7 reported nonanalgesic treatments, 4 reported analgesic treatments, 5 reported system modifications, and 2 reported educational interventions. A variety of pain scales were used, reporting outcome measures from 1 week to 1 year. Pooled results at trial completion revealed a statistically significant small treatment effect [SMD −0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.51, −0.14]. Further subgroup analysis revealed that residents receiving analgesic interventions benefited most (SMD −0.65, 95% CI −1.07, −0.23), followed by those receiving educational interventions (SMD −0.40, 95% CI −0.59, −0.21), and those receiving system modification interventions (SMD −0.26, 95% CI −0.51, −0.02). Conclusions Nonanalgesic treatment and control groups showed no statistical differences. Our findings suggest that analgesics are the most effective pain intervention and should be considered first-line therapy. Caution should be used in interpreting findings as few trials were included, risk of bias was variable, sample sizes were small, and pooled treatment effects were small to moderate.</ab>

        <ab>Minimal research explores the impact of a career in dementia care on senior health professionals. This study sought positive and negative subjective interpretations from seven senior health professionals regarding their experiences in dementia care. Data from semi-structured interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). One superordinate theme, Honouring stigmatised self, overarched four sub-themes: Systemic stigma, Invalidated, Self-respect and Moral integrity and Growth. Stigma was interpreted as systemically entrenched minimisation of aged care and the aged-care workforce, including poor remuneration and training. Participants experienced peer invalidation particularly when attempting to resolve complex professional and moral challenges in dementia care. These often occurred in the context of efforts to individualise care, constrained within a medical model. Paradoxically, external invalidation motivated a search for redefining ‘self’ and moral integrity. By wisely acknowledging career experience, growthful domains of self-respect, optimism, humility and innovation defined professional practice and personal choices. Implications are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. Background Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. Design Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial ( AGe- FIT). Methods Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. Results Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. Conclusions Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To assess the association of the anticholinergic medication burden with hospitalization and mortality in nursing home elderly patients and to investigate the role of coronary artery disease (CAD). Design Longitudinal (5-year) retrospective observational study. Setting Nursing homes in Italy. Participants A total of 3761 nursing home older residents. Measurements A comprehensive clinical and functional assessment was carried out through the interRAI long-term care facility instrument. The anticholinergic burden was assessed through the anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scale. Occurrence of hospitalization/all-cause mortality was the primary composite outcome. First hospitalization and all-cause mortality were the secondary outcomes of the study. Hazard ratios (HRs) and subdistribution HRs were obtained through Cox and competing risk (death as competing event for hospitalization) models. Results Within the sample (mean age 83 ± 7 years; 72% females) the incidence rate of the primary outcome was 10/100 person-year. After adjusting for potential confounders and compared with participants with an ACB of 0, those with an ACB of 1 [HR 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–1.90] and ABC of 2+ (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.11–1.79) presented an increased risk of developing the primary outcome. After stratification, the risk for the primary outcome increased along with the anticholinergic burden, only for participants affected by CAD (HR 1.53; 95% CI 0.94–2.50 and HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.09–2.68 for the ACB of 1 and ACB of 2+ groups). An ACB score of 2+ was marginally associated with first hospitalization, considering death as a competing risk, only for those with CAD (subdistribution HR 3.47; 95% CI 0.99–12.3). Conclusions Anticholinergic medication burden is associated to hospitalization and all-cause mortality in institutionalized older adults. CAD increases such risk. The effectiveness and safety profile of complex drug regimens should be reconsidered in this population.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To investigate the association between polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity with time to first hospitalization, number of hospitalizations, and number of hospital days over a 12-month period. Design A 12-month prospective cohort study. Participants and Setting A total of 383 residents of 6 Australian long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Measurements The primary exposures were polypharmacy (≥9 regular medications) and the 65-item Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between polypharmacy and MRCI with time to first hospitalization. Poisson regression was used to compute incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs for the association between polypharmacy and MRCI with number of hospitalizations and number of hospital days. Models were adjusted for age, sex, length of stay in LTCF, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and dementia severity. Results There were 0.56 (95% CI 0.49–0.65) hospitalizations per person-year and 4.52 (95% CI 4.31–4.76) hospital days per person-year. In adjusted analyses, polypharmacy was associated with time to first hospitalization (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.21–2.79), number of hospitalizations (IRR 1.51; 95% CI 1.09–2.10), and hospital days per person-year (IRR 1.39; 95% CI 1.24–1.56). Similarly, in adjusted analyses a 10-unit increase in MRCI was associated with time to first hospitalization (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.06–1.29), number of hospitalizations (IRR 1.15; 95% CI 1.06–1.24), and hospital days per person-year (IRR 1.19; 95% CI 1.16–1.23). Conclusions Polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity are associated with hospitalizations from LTCFs. This highlights the importance of regular medication review for residents of LTCFs and the need for further research into the risk-to-benefit ratio of prescribing in this setting.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To explore communicative challenges in encounters between nurse assistants and older persons during home care visits. Background The older population is increasing worldwide. Currently, there is a shift in care for older people from institutional care to home care. Providing home care in a person's home involves several challenges, including the complexity of communication. Design A descriptive observational design with a qualitative approach was used. Methods The data consisted of audio recordings of real-life encounters during home care visits between nurse assistants and older persons, collected in 2014. A hermeneutic phenomenological analysis was conducted. Results Communicative challenges were identified: (a) in situations where the older persons had a different view than the nurse assistants on the care task and its content; and (b) when unexpected actions or turns occurred in the communication. Challenges included older person's existential issues, fragility and worries and concerns, which often appeared to be only vaguely expressed and difficult to verbally detect and tackle. This engendered a risk of misinterpretation or ignorance of these challenges. Conclusion The findings point to the importance of communication as the key to facilitate person-centred home care. Communication training should focus more on addressing needs and existential issues in older persons. Person-centred home care for older persons needs to be addressed at both an individual and an organizational level.</ab>

        <ab>Background Aging of the U.S. population is a major health challenge. Older adults have higher rates of hospitalization due to chronic disease, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and complex care needs (2). Asthma is the most common type of obstructive lung disease with a prevalence of 10% in patients &gt; 60 years of age and a mortality rate of 6%, the highest of all age groups. Asthma in older adults is rarely diagnosed. Health symptoms such as asthma are often blamed on age when there may be a treatable cause. Ohio has a high prevalence of asthma affecting &gt; 9% of adults and exceeds the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce asthma hospitalizations by 150% for geriatrics. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed obstructive lung disease in older adults, specifically asthma. Method This study was a descriptive correlational study using a convenience sample at senior health fairs. Inclusion criteria; age 65 and older, English speaking, and able to read and write. Participants completed a questionnaire, pulmonary function screening, and pulse oximetry reading. If a history of asthma was noted, the participant completed additional questions related to asthma control. Results N=117 42% screened positive for obstructive lung disease (OLD) defined as FEV1 &lt;80%. 28% of these had no previous diagnosis. 79% of the nondiagnosed OLD screening, screened positive for asthma. Conclusions Overall, 10% of older adults had or may have asthma correlating with current literature. Improvement in the diagnosis of OLD could lead to quality of life in older adults Disclosures IRB approval was on October 2nd, 2015. The authors have no associations with the industry.</ab>

        <ab>A complex relationship exists between pain, depression, and functional limitation. These conditions, which substantially impact health care spending and quality of life, remain under-addressed in the current system of health care delivery, particularly among low-income and minority populations. This analysis uses baseline assessment data from CAPABLE, an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT), to examine associations between pain, depression, and functional limitation among a sample of lowincome, community-dwelling elders with functional limitations. Linear regression revealed close associations between depression, pain, and activity of daily living (ADL) limitation. Mediation analyses indicated that depression fully mediated the relationship between pain intensity and functional limitation and partially mediated the relationship between pain interference and depression. Past research has shown that these conditions may be easily identified using validated assessment tools and effectively addressed through the introduction of interdisciplinary interventions. Several recommendations are presented for clinicians and health care organizations.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To test the relationship between greenery in gardens at residential facilities for older people and the self-perceived health of residents, mediated by experiences of being away and fascination when in the garden and the frequency of visitation there. To examine how these indirect effects vary with the number of physical barriers to visiting the garden. Background Many older people in residential facilities suffer from complex health problems. Access to a green outdoor environment may enable psychological distance, engage effortless attention, encourage more frequent visitation and promote resident health. Design A multi-level, cross-sectional, correlational design. Methods Questionnaires were administered June-August, 2011 to convenience samples of residents at 72 facilities for older people with complex healthcare needs. One to 10 eligible residents were sampled during self-motivated garden visits at each facility ( n = 290). They reported on their garden experiences and health. Facility staff reported on objective garden characteristics and barriers to access. A serial mediation model was tested with multiple linear regression analysis. Results The total indirect effect of greenery on self-perceived health was positive and significant. Garden greenery appears to affect health by enhancing a sense of being away, affording possibilities to experience the outdoor environment as interesting and encouraging visitation. Among residents in homes with multiple barriers, only fascination mediated the relationship between greenery and self-perceived health. Conclusion Ample greenery in outdoor space at residential facilities for older people appears to promote experiences of being away and fascination, more frequent visitation and better health.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patient participation is required by law in Norway and in several western countries. Current participation ideology is based on individualism, which may conflict with the older generation's commonly held values of solidarity and community. Hence, different values and ideologies may come in conflict when older patients receive treatment and rehabilitation in geriatric wards. Participation is a guiding principle in rehabilitation. Criteria for admission of older patients to geriatric wards are complex health problems, acute illness and/or acute physical and/or cognitive functional failure. The ideal is an active and engaged patient. The aim of the study was to describe the difficulties experienced by older patients on acute geriatric wards when involving themselves with their own treatment and care. Methods: In this qualitative study older patients were interviewed during hospitalization in geriatric wards and asked to tell about their experiences with participation. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. Results: The patients experienced difficulties in participating in decisions and care. They linked their difficulties to their own diminishing capabilities, and cited the ward's busy schedule as a reason for abstaining from participation. However, despite their reservations, they did participate in decisions in different ways. Their participatory practices appeared ambiguous and they employed various strategies to put themselves in a position of influence. The most important of these involved their relatives. The patients delegated to family the tasks of seeking, receiving and giving information to the nurses and the staff, and, to some extent, for the dialogues with hospital staff about their needs and plan of care. The family appeared to accept the responsibility willingly. Conclusions: The patients addressed their difficulties by authorizing family members to act and participate on their behalf. This underlines the family's important role in patient participation and the role that nurses and other staff must play in collaborating with the patient and their family to facilitate participation independently of the patients' performances of participation.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: to analyze the application context of the family care concept in studies developed in the nursing area of elderly health; to develop a theoretical model that incorporates elements found in the analysis. Method: a proposed conceptual analysis with the following steps was performed: concept selection; determination of objectives in the conceptual analysis; identification of possible uses of the concept; determination of critical attributes and antecedent and consequent events to the concept. Results: antecedents are related to family functionality because the consequents are the physical, emotional, social, financial, and spiritual implications in the family care. Conclusion: the concept of family care for the elderly is characterized as being ambiguous, ambivalent, and complex. It was possible to develop a theoretical model considering attributes, antecedents, and consequents.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this systematic review was to identify the best ways of supporting people with dementia to eat. Five electronic databases were searched, with a date range from January 2004 to July 2015. Following screening of the 233 studies identified, 22 were included in the final analysis. The study interventions focused on educational programmes, environmental or routine changes, and assistance with eating, with the strongest evidence shown in the more complex educational programmes for people with dementia. The evidence suggests that staff who support people with dementia to eat should undertake face-to-face education programmes and aim to give people enough time when helping them to eat. However, cultural change may be needed to ensure individual assessments are carried out to identify those having difficulty eating, and to ensure they are afforded enough time to eat their meals.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: identifying the state of the art of care genealogy through publications in national and international journals. Method: this is an integrative review of the process in health care and nursing, preceded between 10th February, 2014 and 20th February, 2014, in the Medline, Lilacs and SciELO of data portals VHL and CAPES. Article 17 was explored and the results were grouped into two categories: the Archeological and Genealogical methods proposed by Michel Foucault and Considerations knowledge and practices of health care and nursing. Results: the care and its relationships have transversality in ways of caring in different forms and spaces. The transversality becomes evident when it comes to body care with direct, indirect and contextual mode, evoking shared knowledge and complex actions. Conclusion: it is necessary to reflect on the production of self-care and implications for health activities, including the philosophy of power involved in this process.</ab>
        <ab>O bjetivo: identificar el estado de la arte acerca de genealogía de la atención a través de las publicaciones en revistas nacionales e internacionales. Método: se trata de una revisión integradora del proceso de atención de la salud en enfermería, procedida entre 10/02/2014 y 20/02/2014 en el Medline, Lilacs y SciELO de los portales BVS y CAPES. Exploró se a los 17 artículos, cuyos resultados se agruparon en dos categorías: Los métodos Aarqueológicos y Genealógicos propuestos por Michel Foucault y Consideraciones acerca de los conocimientos y prácticas de atención de la salud y de la Enfermería. Resultados: la atención y sus relaciones tienen transversalidad de maneras de cuidar en diferentes formas y espacios. La transversalidad se hace evidente cuando trata de cuidado corporal con modo directo, indirecto y contextual, evocando las acciones conocimientos y acciones complejas. Conclusión: es necesario reflexionar acerca de las producciones de auto-cuidado y las implicaciones para actividades de salud, incluyendo la filosofía de poder participar en este proceso.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the role of the General Practitioner Liaison Nurse (GPLN) in improving integration and coordination of services within Primary Health Care. This position can play a major role in care coordination and cultural change. The GPLN within HealthOne Mt Druitt (HOMD) identifies patients' needs and facilitates communication, case conferencing and care coordination between health and other providers. The priority areas of children and their families at risk or with significant unmet needs, and chronic aged and complex care, were identified as target areas. This paper focuses on the GPLN within the chronic aged and complex care service model. The GPLN within HOMD was able to improve coordination and integration of services for patients of the facility. Activities included organising multidisciplinary services and addressing psychosocial issues. Patients and community health staff identified the importance of the role for improving coordination and integration of services. Decision and policy makers saw the position as vital to the implementation, operation and sustainability of HOMD.</ab>

        <ab>Currently, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Common Format for nursing homes (NHs) accommodates voluntary reporting for 4 adverse events: falls with injury, pressure ulcers, medication errors, and infections. In 2015, AHRQ funded a technical brief to describe the state of the science related to safety in the NH setting to inform a research agenda. Thirty-six recent systematic reviews evaluated NH safety-related interventions to address these 4 adverse events and reported mostly mixed evidence about effective approaches to ameliorate them. Furthermore, these 4 events are likely inadequate to capture safety issues that are unique to the NH setting and encompass other domains related to residents' quality of care and quality of life. Future research needs include expanding our definition of safety in the NH setting, which differs considerably from that of hospitals, to include contributing factors to adverse events as well as more resident-centered care measures. Second, future research should reflect more rigorous implementation science to include objective measures of care processes related to adverse events, intervention fidelity, and staffing resources for intervention implementation to inform broader uptake of efficacious interventions. Weaknesses in implementation contribute to the current inconclusive and mixed evidence base as well as remaining questions about what outcomes are even achievable in the NH setting, given the complexity of most resident populations. Also related to implementation, future research should determine the effects of specific staffing models on care processes related to safety outcomes. Last, future efforts should explore the potential for safety issues in other care settings for older adults, most notably dementia care within assisted living.</ab>

        <ab>Objective “Lack of energy” or anergia is a common complaint associated with adverse outcomes in older people. There is a lack of knowledge on this symptom in the nursing home (NH) setting. The aim of this study was to investigate whether lack of energy was associated with hospitalization and mortality in NH residents. Design Longitudinal observational cohort study. Setting and Participants A total of 575 NH residents (72% women) in 13 French NHs from the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents (INCUR) study cohort. Measurements Lack of energy was measured at the baseline visit as part of the 10-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were performed to test the association of lack of energy with hospitalization events and mortality over 12 months of follow-up. Results The mean age of the study sample was 86.3 (SD = 7.5) years. At the baseline, 250 (43.5%) residents complained about lack of energy. Overall, 192 (33.4%) individuals experienced at least 1 hospitalization event and 98 (17.0%) died during the 12-month follow-up. Lack of energy was significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.02–1.80; P = .03), even after adjustment for potential confounders (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.04–1.91; P = .02). No statistically significant association was found between lack of energy and 12-month mortality. Conclusion Lack of energy is a predictor of hospitalization in older people living in NHs. It may be considered a relevant clinical feature for identifying individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes, thus potentially serving as a screening tool for subsequently conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment in this highly vulnerable and complex population.</ab>

        <ab>Background:As life expectancy and morbidity related to chronic disease increase, the baby boomers will be called upon to provide care to aging members of their family or to be care recipients themselves.Purpose:Through the theoretical lens of the life course perspective, this review of the literature provides insight into what characteristics of baby boomers separate them from previous caregiving cohorts and how these characteristics will affect family caregiving.Methods:A systematic process to identify literature was completed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Results:Findings suggest multiple emerging trends related to caregiving, including (1) increasing use of digital technology for information gathering and support, (2) more diversity among caregivers and care recipients, (3) strained finances and loss of entitlements, (4) more complex care and care management, (5) demand for public policies related to caregiving, and (6) balancing work, family, chronic disease, and caregiving.Discussion:Examining the literature related to family caregiving and baby boomers through a life course perspective offers a unique and more complete understanding of emerging trends related to chronic disease management.Translation to Health Education Practice:These emerging trends offer health educators implications for strategies and best practices intended to support those involved in family caregiving.</ab>

        <ab>Providing person-centered care (PCC) to older adults with dual diagnosis, co-occurring serious mental illness (SMI), and substance misuse is complex and requires an interprofessional team. Older adults, who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare (i.e., dual-eligibles) are overrepresented in the population of older adults with SMI and substance misuse. Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) exist to support community living needs of nursing home-eligible older adults and are increasingly in a position to serve older adults with SMI and substance misuse issues. PACE programs provide integrated person-centered mental health care to address the serious medical, social, and emotional complications posed by having SMI and substance misuse disorders. The case study presented illustrates PCC provided to a dualdiagnosis PACE participant, illustrating the impact of recent and past trauma on current psychopathology and substance misuse. Finally, recommendations for addressing PCC of dual diagnosis with in the PACE model are provided.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Home visits have been shown to improve quality of care and lower medical costs for complex elderly patients. We investigated trends in physician home visits and domiciliary care visits as well as physician characteristics associated with providing these services. Design: Longitudinal analysis of Medicare Part B claims data for a national sample of direct patient care physicians in 2006 and 2011. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the physician sample and to determine numbers of home visits and domiciliary visits in total and by physician specialty. Setting: Patient homes, nursing homes, and domiciliary care facilities. Participants: Direct patient care physicians (n = 22 186). Measurements: Physician demographics, specialty, practice characteristics (practice type, geographic location), number of home visits, and domiciliary visits in 2006 and 2011. Results: We found a small increase (n = 63 501) in total number of home visits made to Medicare beneficiaries between 2006 and 2011 performed by a decreasing percentage of physicians (5.1%, n = 18 165 in 2006; 4.5%, n = 15 296 in 2011). There was substantial growth in domiciliary care visit numbers (n = 218 514) and a small increase in percentage of physicians delivering these services (2.0% in 2006, 2.3% in 2011). Physicians who performed home visits were more likely to be older, in rural locations, specialists in primary care, and more likely to provide nursing home and domiciliary care compared with physicians who did not make any home visits (P &lt; .05). Conclusion: Home visits and domiciliary visits to Medicare beneficiaries are increasing. General internal medicine physicians provided the highest number of home and domiciliary care visits in 2006, and family physicians did so in 2011. Such delivery models show promise in lowering medical costs while providing high-quality patient care.</ab>

        <ab>Three thousand nine hundred thirty-one veterans aged 75 and older receive primary care ( PC) in two large practices of the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) Boston Healthcare System. Cognitive and functional disabilities are endemic in this group, creating needs that predictably exceed available or appropriate resources. To address this problem, Geriatrics in Primary Care ( GPC) embeds geriatric services directly into primary care. An on-site consulting geriatrician and geriatric nurse care manager work directly with PC colleagues in medicine, nursing, social work, pharmacy, and mental health within the VA medical home. This design delivers interdisciplinary geriatric care within PC that emphasizes comprehensive evaluations, care management, planned transitions, informed resource use, and a shift in care focus from multiple subspecialties to PC. Four hundred thirty-five veterans enrolled during the project's 4-year course. Complex, fragmented care was evident in a series of 50 individuals (aged 82 ± 7) enrolled during Months 1 to 6. The year before, these individuals made 372 medical or surgical subspecialty clinic visits (7.4 ± 9.8); 34% attended five or more subspecialty clinics, 48% had dementia, and 18% lacked family caregivers. During the first year after enrollment the mean number of subspecialty clinic visits declined significantly (4.7 ± 5.0, P = .01), whereas the number of PC-based visits remained stable (3.1 ± 1.5 and 3.3 ± 1.5, respectively, P = .50). Telephone contact by GPC (2.3 ± 2.0) and collaboration with PC clinicians replaced routine follow-up geriatric care. GPC facilitated planned transitions to rehabilitation centers (n = 5), home hospice (n = 2), dementia units (n = 3), and home care (n = 37). GPC provides efficient, comprehensive geriatric care and case management while preserving established relationships between patients and the PC team. Preliminary results suggest 'care defragmentation,' as reflected by a significant reduction in subspecialty clinic use. Model simplicity and flexibility facilitated ready implementation.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To examine transitions that individuals with dementia experience longitudinally and to identify points of care when transitions are highest and the factors that contribute to those transitions. Design Population-based 10-year retrospective cohort study from 2000 to 2011. Setting General community. Participants All individuals aged 65 and older newly diagnosed with dementia in British Columbia, Canada. Measurements The frequency and timing of transitions over 10 years, participant characteristics associated with greater number of transitions, and the influence of recommended dementia care and high-quality primary care on number of transitions. Results Individuals experience a spike in transitions during the year of diagnosis, driven primarily by hospitalizations, despite accounting for end of life or newly moving to a long-term care facility ( LTCF). This occurs regardless of survival time or care location. Regardless of survival time, individuals not in LTCFs experience a marked increase in hospitalizations in the year before and the year of death, often exceeding hospitalizations in the year of diagnosis. Receipt of recommended dementia care and receipt of high-quality primary care were independently associated with fewer transitions across care settings. Conclusion The spike in transitions in the year of diagnosis highlights a distressing period for individuals with dementia during which unwanted or unnecessary transitions might occur and suggests a useful target for interventions. There is an association between recommended dementia care and outcomes and evidence of the continued value of high-quality primary care in a complex population at a critical point when gaps in continuity are especially likely.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Currently, most rehabilitation services for individuals who sustain a hip fracture are not designed to meet the complex needs of those who also have cognitive impairment. The goal of this review was to identify current best practices for rehabilitation in long-term care settings and approaches to optimize outcomes among individuals with dementia and other cognitive impairments post-hip fracture. Procedures The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement was used to guide the review. Five electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), Medline (EBSCO), and PsycINFO (EBSCO), were searched for intervention studies published in English language journals. Studies were eligible if they focused on rehabilitation interventions post-hip fracture among older individuals (≥65 years) with cognitive impairment who were living in or transferred to long-term care or postacute/rehabilitation settings post-hip fracture. Studies were excluded if they did not enroll individuals with cognitive impairment, the study was descriptive without any intervention content, or the intervention components were only medication, surgical approach or medical treatment. Main Findings A total of 4478 records were identified, 1915 of which were duplicative, 2563 were relevant based on title, and after careful review 7 studies were included. Two included studies were randomized controlled trials, one was a single group pre- and post-test, one a descriptive comparison between those with and without cognitive impairment, one a case controlled matched trial, one a nonequivalent groups trial, and one a case report. The interventions varied between manipulating the type and amount of exercise or testing multifactorial issues including environmental interventions and the use of an interdisciplinary team to address psychosocial factors, medication management, use of assistive devices, and specific preferences or concerns of the individuals. Conclusions The evidence summarized in this review suggests that it is feasible to implement rehabilitation programs focused on individuals with cognitive impairment in postacute care settings. Moreover, there was evidence to suggest that intensive rehabilitation and exercise activities are beneficial, although innovative approaches may be needed to engage individuals with cognitive impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Health professional clinical education is commonly conducted in single discipline modes, thus limiting student collaboration skills. Aged care residential facilities, due to the chronic and complex health care needs of residents, provide an ideal placement to provide a collaborative experience. Interprofessional education is widely acknowledged as the pedagogical framework through which to facilitate collaboration. The aim of the evaluation was to assess student attitudes towards collaboration after active involvement in an interprofessional education program. Students studying nursing, occupational therapy, and aged care were invited to complete a version of the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale before and after participating in a three-week pilot interprofessional program. A positive change in student attitudes towards other health professionals and the importance of working in interprofessional teams was reported with significant differences between two statements indicated: Learning with health-care students before qualifications would improve relationships after qualifications ; and I learned a lot from the students from the other disciplines . The innovative pilot project was found to enhance student learning in interprofessional teams and the aged care environment. Further development of this and similar interprofessional programs is required to develop sustainable student projects that have health benefits for residents in aged care residential facilities.</ab>

        <ab>Objective:This study seeks to address how older adults influence their daily care when their preferences conflict with those of their adult daughter caregivers. Method:Using a sample of 10 dyads (N= 20) of an older adult and adult daughter, we utilize content analysis strategies to analyze in-depth, semi-structured interview data with QSR NVIVO to investigate how older adults influence their care, how daughters respond to such efforts of influence, and how dyads navigate differences in care goals. Results:When there is agreement in goals, dyads report tasks going well and both individuals’ requests are honored. When there are differences in care goals, daughters most frequently reason with their older parents, while parents walk away or ‘let go’ of their requests. Daughters report making decisions for their parents for health or safety-related needs. However, all dyads discuss differences in care goals, whereby parents are perceived as insisting, resisting, or persisting in care. Conclusion:Findings illustrate complex patterns of responses by families when navigating differences in daily care goals that carry important implications for research and the development of dyadic-based family interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Americans over the age of 65, the fastest growing group in the United States, are putting an increased demand on the healthcare system. As the population of persons 65 years and older grows in numbers, it becomes vital to have healthcare professionals educated to care for their complex needs. Because many pre-licensure nursing programs assign nursing students to geriatric patients for their first clinical experiences, it is important to understand how these experiences may be influencing their attitudes toward persons who are aged. The purpose of this research was to determine if nursing students' attitudes toward persons who are aged changed following their first clinical experiences and if there was a difference in students' attitudes based on the sequence of their clinical experiences. This quasi-experimental study surveyed consenting first semester prelicensure nursing students before, during, and after completing their first clinical experiences using the Refined Aging Semantic Differential instrument. Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory was used to guide the study. Results showed that all nursing students entered the program with positive attitudes toward persons who are aged. Although overall scores remained positive throughout the semester, there were differences in attitudes between groups based on sequencing of clinical assignments. These results indicate sequencing of geriatric care clinical assignments may influence student attitudes.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose With a shortage of primary care providers prepared to care for an aging U.S. population, nurse practitioner (NP) programs are integrating gerontological content. This qualitative descriptive study explored NP graduate perceptions on the adequacy of their education to prepare them to care for seniors. Methods Twenty-three graduates of NP program options at two universities in the western U.S. participated in focus group discussions or interviews. Participants shared their perceptions of their NP educational preparation and suggestions for enhancing gerontologic curriculum. Conclusions Four main domains emerged from analysis of qualitative data: (a) 'Getting your boots on and getting into the role'; (b) 'Older people are more complex than we were prepared to care for'; (c) 'It is very different as a provider, but I am so glad I was a nurse with experience first'; (d) 'NPs have a scope of practice, physician assistants (PAs) have a job description-but I wish we had their [procedural] preparation.' Implications for practice Graduates identified a need for more educational content and clinical experiences specific to the care of older adults. Some suggested a postgraduate residency or mentoring option to assist NP role transition and progression and limit role confusion.</ab>

        <ab>In interactions with clients or patients, human service workers are at risk of experiencing discrepancies between felt and organizationally mandated emotions (i.e. emotion-rule dissonance). Given the documented detrimental effects of such discrepancies on employee strain, the present study investigated whether job complexity mitigates the relation between emotion-rule dissonance and employee burnout using data from a two-wave panel study of eldercare workers (N = 583, 16-month time lag). Structural equation modelling revealed that emotion-rule dissonance at Time 1 preceded emotional exhaustion and depersonalization at Time 2. Beyond that, employees whose work offered job complexity were found to suffer less from emotional exhaustion and depersonalization when encountering discrepancies between felt and stipulated emotions compared to employees who conducted noncomplex work. Thus, designing complex tasks appears to be a crucial starting point for alleviating employee burnout in jobs that provoke emotion-rule dissonance.</ab>

        <ab>Physical therapists often treat older adults with marked deficits in physical function secondary to an acute hospitalization. These deficits are often collectively defined as hospital-associated deconditioning (HAD). However, there is a paucity of evidence that objectively demonstrates the efficacy of physical therapy for older adults with HAD. Older adults with HAD represent a highly variable and complex population and thus may be difficult to study and develop effective interventions for using our current rehabilitation strategies. This perspective article outlines an innovative framework to operationalize and treat older adults with HAD. This framework may help therapists apply emerging exercise strategies to this population and facilitate additional research to support the total value of physical therapy for older adults in postacute care settings--with value measured not only by improvements in physical performance but perhaps also by reduced rates of disability development, rehospitalization, and institutionalization.</ab>

        <ab>The author asserts the need for nurses to recall best patient education practices like easily accessible resources as tools for supporting quality patient care for older adults in the U.S. She says that older adults' transition from hospital to home settings can be complex situations due to possible safety issues and errors. She also discussed what nurses can do to promote positive patient outcomes and the importance of an effective patient education at hospital discharge.</ab>

        <ab>There is an identified need for more effective assessment processes in rural Australia, with prior research revealing little knowledge sharing and even duplication across existing services. This article aims to explore the challenges to more closely integrated assessment processes, drawing on interview data with practitioners from three agencies located in the same rural region. Findings highlight the challenges of rural assessment, both demand-driven (more older people with complex needs, geographic isolation) and supply issues (time and distance, funding formulae, workforce shortages). The need for closer collaboration is recognized but significant systemic issues require addressing if it is to be achieved.</ab>

        <ab>Interprofessional collaborative practice is increasingly recognized as an essential model in health care. This study lends preliminary support to the notion that medical students (including residents) and social work students develop a broader understanding of one another's roles and contributions to enhancing community-dwelling geriatric patients' health, and develop a more thorough understanding of the inherent complexities and unique aspects of geriatric health care. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests of participants' scores on the Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration (IIC) indicated the training made significant changes to the students' perception of interprofessional collaboration. Qualitative analysis of participants' statements illustrated (1) benefits of the IPE experience, including complementary roles in holistic interventions; and (2) challenges to collaboration. The findings suggest that interprofessional educational experiences have a positive impact upon students' learning and strategies for enhanced care of geriatric patients.</ab>

        <ab>Objective The objective of this study was to examine whether the capacity of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood) to predict mortality in a nursing home population. Design, Setting, and Participants Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 773 older persons (74.4% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. Measurements The FI was computed as the ratio between actual and 30 potential deficits the participant might have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 deficits]). Death events were monitored and detected over a 12-month follow-up. The risk of death was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results Mean age of participants was 86.2 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.35 (SD 0.11). At the end of the follow-up, 135 (17.4%) death events were recorded. A positive association between the FI and mortality (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.018, 95% confidence interval 1.002–1.035, P = .03) was reported. The use of the traditional 0.25 cut-point for detecting the frailty status is inadequate in this population. Conclusion The FI is able to predict mortality even in very old and complex elders, such as nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The Self-Transcendence is a connection with the being, an advance in optimizing of the human realization, on deeper contexts: the spiritual. Objective: Analyze the concept of "self-transcendence" and propose their use in nursing care for the elderly. Material and methods: It was analyzed the concept of "Self-transcendence" (method from Walker &amp; Avant). Identification of conceptual elements, review of literature and conceptual proposal; Descriptors: "Self-transcendence" "Nursing" (Spanish, English, Portuguese). Results: Conceptual elements: Capacity of human being, Go beyond self, Expand personal bounds, Spiritual path, Giving meaning to life, connection with self, others, the environment, connection with the spirit of the universe, Find meanings of own existence. Conceptual proposal: "It is the ability of the human being to go beyond the self and consequently expand the personal bounds by a spiritual path to give meaning to life and that links to a connection with self, others, the environment and the spirit of the universe; as a meaning of existence itself". Conclusions: Self-Transcendence is a complex phenomenon that varies from specific situations, like entering in process of improvement and personal aspirations; and complex as mourning or death.</ab>

        <ab>Background Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) cause significant distress and present a complex clinical challenge for treatment. Pharmacological treatment options are limited to antipsychotics, which carry extensive safety issues. There is emerging evidence to support the potential benefits of memantine, currently licensed for moderate to severe AD, in the prophylaxis of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Methods The MAIN-AD study is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled withdrawal trial comparing memantine with antipsychotics for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms over 24 weeks. A total of 199 people with probable AD living in care homes already receiving an antipsychotic were randomized to receive either memantine or to continue an antipsychotic. The primary outcomes were function (Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale [BADLS]) and agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]). Secondary outcomes were Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and mortality. Results There was no significant difference between groups on the BADLS or CMAI. At 24 weeks, there was a nonsignificant adjusted difference in favor of memantine on the BADLS of 0.23 (95% CI –1.80–2.27; P = .82) and in favor of antipsychotic on the CMAI of 0.09 (95% CI –0.35–8.53; P = .07). Although there were no significant differences in total NPI, there were 5.01 (95% CI –1.68–11.70; P = .05) and 3.63 (95% CI –1.40–8.67; P = .16) point advantages favoring antipsychotics at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. In addition, in an exploratory analysis, individuals allocated to antipsychotics were significantly less likely to experience relapse of neuropsychiatric symptoms at all time points. The group receiving memantine had a nonsignificant 1.3-point advantage on the MMSE at 24 weeks. Discussion This study indicates no benefits for memantine in the long-term treatment and prophylaxis of clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms. The results did indicate some benefits for antipsychotic medications in reducing the relapse of neuropsychiatric symptoms, but this must be balanced against increased mortality risk.</ab>

        <ab>Background: delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that is common among elderly inpatients. It has been associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, cognitive and functional decline and increased institutionalisation rates. Multicomponent interventions, a series of non-pharmacological strategies frequently handled by nursing staff, might be useful for prevention.Objectives: to assess the efficacy of multicomponent interventions in preventing incident delirium in the elderly.Methods: a systematic review of randomised trials was undertaken. Two independent reviewers performed iterative literature searches in seven databases without language restrictions. Grey literature repositories were considered as well. The quality of included trials was assessed by using the criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration. When possible, data were synthesised into a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 and I2 tests.Findings: a total of 21,788 citations were screened, and seven studies of diverse quality were included in the review, comprising 1,691 participants. Multicomponent interventions significantly reduced incident delirium (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63–0.85, P &lt; 0.001) and accidental falls during the hospitalisation (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21, 0.72, P = 0.003), without evidence of differential effectiveness according to ward type or dementia rates. Non-significant reductions in delirium duration, hospital stay and mortality were found as well.Interpretation: multicomponent interventions are effective in preventing incident delirium among elderly inpatients. Effects seemed to be stable among different settings. Due to the limited amount of data, potential benefits in survival need to be confirmed in further studies. Future research should be aimed at contrasting different multicomponent programmes to select the most useful interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background Most older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are frail and have complex care needs. Holistic understanding of residents' health status is key to providing good care. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a valid assessment method which aims to embrace complexity. Here we aimed to study a CGA that has been modified for use in long-term care (the LTC-CGA) and to investigate its acceptability and usefulness to stakeholders and users. Methods This mixed methods study, conducted in 10 LTCFs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, reviewed 598 resident charts from pre- and post-implementation of the LTC-CGA. Qualitative methods explored stakeholder perspectives (physicians, nurses, paramedics, administrators, residents and families) though focus groups. Results The LTC-CGA was present in 78% of LTCF charts in the post -implementation, period though it did not appear in acute care charts of transferred residents, despite the intention that it accompany residents between care sites. Some items had suboptimal completion rates (e.g., Advance Directives at 56.4%), though these were located in other sections of the LTCF chart (98.2%). Nevertheless, qualitative findings suggest the LTC-CGA describes a clinical baseline health status which enabled timely and informed clinical decision-making. Conclusions The LTC-CGA is a useful resource whose full capacity may not yet have been realized.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Nurses in Sweden have a high absence due to illness and many retire before the age of sixty. Factors at work as well as in private life may contribute to health problems. To maintain a healthy work–force there is a need for actions on work-life balance in a salutogenic perspective. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of resources in everyday life to balance work and private life among nurses in home help service. Methods. Thirteen semi-structured individual interviews and two focus group interviews were conducted with home help service nurses in Sweden. A qualitative content analysis was used for the analyses. Result. In the analyses, six themes of perceptions of recourses in everyday life emerged; (i) Reflecting on life. (ii) Being healthy and taking care of yourself. (iii) Having a meaningful job and a supportive work climate. (iv) Working shifts and part time. (v) Having a family and a supporting network. (vi) Making your home your castle. Conclusions. The result points out the complexity of work-life balance and support that the need for nurses to balance everyday life differs during different phases and transitions in life. In this salutogenic study, the result differs from studies with a pathogenic approach. Shift work and part time work were seen as two resources that contributed to flexibility and a prerequisite to work-life balance. To have time and energy for both private life and work was seen as essential. To reflect on and discuss life gave inner strength to set boundaries and to prioritize both in private life and in work life. Managers in nursing contexts have a great challenge to maintain and strengthen resources which enhance the work-life balance and health of nurses. Salutogenic research is needed to gain an understanding of resources that enhance work-life balance and health in nursing contexts.</ab>

        <ab>Objective To assess effect of a complex, multidisciplinary intervention aimed at reducing avoidable acute hospitalization of residents of residential aged care (RAC) facilities. Design Cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting RAC facilities with higher than expected hospitalizations in Auckland, New Zealand, were recruited and randomized to intervention or control. Participants A total of 1998 residents of 18 intervention facilities and 18 control facilities. Intervention A facility-based complex intervention of 9 months' duration. The intervention comprised gerontology nurse specialist (GNS)-led staff education, facility bench-marking, GNS resident review, and multidisciplinary (geriatrician, primary-care physician, pharmacist, GNS, and facility nurse) discussion of residents selected using standard criteria. Main outcome measures Primary end point was avoidable hospitalizations. Secondary end points were all acute admissions, mortality, and acute bed-days. Follow-up was for a total of 14 months. Results The intervention did not affect main study end points: number of acute avoidable hospital admissions (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.85–1.36; P = .59) or mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.76–1.61; P = .62). Conclusions This multidisciplinary intervention, packaging selected case review, and staff education had no overall impact on acute hospital admissions or mortality. This may have considerable implications for resourcing in the acute and RAC sectors in the face of population aging.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To explore published literature that describes what is known about the role of informal caregivers as they manage medications for older adults and/or people living with dementia residing in the community. Background The number of informal caregivers of older adults, including people living with dementia, is growing worldwide. Good medication management by informal caregivers contributes to improved health outcomes and reduced institutionalisations for the care recipient; however, little is known about this domain of care. Design Narrative review. Methods A literature search was conducted to identify relevant research articles written in English between January 2000-April 2013, sourced from online database searches using multiple keywords, reviewing reference lists and citations of key articles and Internet searches. Articles were included if they described informal caregiver medication management for older adults and/or people living with dementia. Results Ten articles were found that described this role from the perspective of the informal caregiver. The evidence suggests that this role is complex and is often made more difficult because of increasing medication regimen complexities, aspects of the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient, healthcare system practices and a lack of information and/or training available to the informal caregiver, especially when caring for people living with dementia. Conclusion Responsibility for managing medications for older adults and/or people living with dementia in the community often falls to informal caregivers. More information resources are required for this role, which requires specific medication management skills and knowledge and is further complicated by the cognitive decline of the care recipient. Relevance to clinical practice Informal caregivers are often expected to manage medications in a safe and effective manner for their older care recipient, who may also have cognitive impairment. Nurses, who may be in frequent contact with community-living older adults/people living with dementia, can be an important source of information, training and support for informal caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Unplanned admissions for older people can result in lengthy hospital stays. It has been recognised that many of these admissions are avoidable, often associated with adverse patient outcomes and potential resource misappropriation.There is a drive to seek novel processes to better assess and manage frail elderly people presenting to Emergency Departments (ED).Innovation: Within a busy London District General Hospital, an Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) service was designed. Based in the ED Observation Ward this service provides an in-reach service to the ED, and liaison to the Acute Medical Unit.This is a consultant-led service, with support from a trust grade junior doctor and Band 6 nurse. At present this is a weekday in-hours resource. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is delivered to patients over the age of 80, with complex problems or frailty, but who do not require inpatient care. Therapies and social care support is provided through existing teams operating in the ED.Evaluation: Between January and October 2013, 662 patients have been assessed by the ACE team, in whom 459 inappropriate admissions were avoided. To receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment and appropriate treatment to facilitate discharge of these patients only needed to stay an extra 4.76 hours on average in hospital.Since the introduction of the ACE service the rate of admission in older people from ED Observation Ward has reduced 61.2% in 2012 to 35.1% this year, despite similar levels of activity. Comparing similarly aged patients and episode diagnosis coding, in excess of 4,200 bed days could be saved per year.Conclusions: The ACE service has provided clear benefits to patients and the trust by avoiding un-necessary hospital admission, while providing focused consultant-delivered care in a timely manner. Expansion to a seven-day service is imminent, with expected further benefits.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex and disabling disorder. Ultimately, 20% to 40% of patients are admitted to a nursing home, and neurologists often lose track of these patients. Care and treatment of these institutionalized patients have not been addressed comprehensively, but anecdotal reports suggest it is suboptimal. We conducted a qualitative study to analyze the quality of PD care in Dutch nursing homes from the perspective of residents, caregivers, and health care workers. Methods Experiences and (unmet) needs of 15 nursing home residents with PD and parkinsonism (90% Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 and 5) and 15 informal caregivers were assessed using semistructured interviews. Furthermore, 5 focus group discussions were organized with 13 nurses and 22 other health care professionals to explore the experiences and barriers of PD care. Results Three core unmet needs were identified: (1) unsatisfactory empathy and emotional support, according to residents and informal caregivers; (2) insufficient staff knowledge on PD-related issues, such as motor fluctuations, leading to poorly timed administration of levodopa; (3) suboptimal organization of care with limited access to neurologists and specialized PD nurses. Conclusions PD care in Dutch nursing homes is suboptimal according to residents, informal caregivers, and health care workers. Three core areas for improvement were identified, including greater attention for psychosocial problems, improved PD-specific knowledge among nursing home staff, and better collaboration with hospital staff trained in movement disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To explore factors at the family caregiver and nursing home administrative levels that may affect participation in a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of hand feeding vs. percutaneous gastrostomy tube feeding in persons with late-stage dementia. Background Decision-making regarding use of tube feeding vs. hand feeding for persons with late-stage dementia is fraught with practical, emotional and ethical issues and is not informed by high levels of evidence. Design Qualitative case study. Methods Transcripts of focus groups with family caregivers were reviewed for themes guided by behavioural theory. Analyses of notes from contacts with nursing home administrators and staff were reviewed for themes guided by an organizational readiness model. Data were collected between the years 2009-2012. Results Factors related to caregiver willingness to participate included understanding of the prognosis of dementia, perceptions of feeding needs and clarity about research protocols. Nursing home willingness to participate was influenced by corporate approval, concerns about legal and regulatory issues, and prior relationships with investigators. Conclusion Participation in rigorous trials requires lengthy navigation of complex corporate requirements and training competent study staff. Objective deliberation by caregivers will depend on appropriate recruitment timing, design of recruitment materials and understanding of study requirements. The clinical standards and policy environment and the secular trends there-in have relevance to the responses of people at all levels.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In the U.S., there are federal requirements on how much training and annual continuing education a certified nursing assistant must complete in order to be certified. The requirements are designed to enable them to provide competent and quality care to nursing home residents. Many states also require additional training and continuing education hours as improved nursing home quality indicators have been found to be related to increased training. Objectives: This study investigated the associations among state level regulations, initial training quality and focus, and job satisfaction in certified nursing assistants. Design: Cross-sectional secondary data analysis. Settings: This study used the National Nursing Home Survey and National Nursing Assistant Survey as well as data on state regulations of certified nursing assistant training. Participants: 2897 certified nursing assistants in 580 nursing homes who were currently workingatanursinghomefacility, whorepresented680,846certifiednursingassistantsinUS. Methods: State regulations were related to initial training and job satisfaction among certified nursing assistants using chi square tests and binomial logistic regression models. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN to correct for complex sampling design effects in the National Nursing Home Survey and National Nursing Assistant Survey. Models were adjusted for personal and facility characteristics. Results: Certified nursing assistants reporting high quality training were more likely to work in states requiring additional initial training hours (p = 0.02) and were more satisfied with their jobs (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.09-2.09) than those with low quality training. In addition, those with more training focused on work life skills were 91% more satisfied (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.41-2.58) whereas no relationship was found between training focused on basic care skills and job satisfaction (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 0.99-1.84). Conclusions: Certified nursing assistants with additional initial training were more likely to report that their training was of high quality, and this was related to job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was also associated with receiving more training that focused on work life skills. Federal training regulations should reconsider additional hours for certified nursing assistant initial training, and include work life skills as a focus. As job satisfaction has been linked to nursing home turnover, attention to training may improve satisfaction, ultimately reducing staff turnover.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To examine the predictive value of the Mini Nutritional Assessment-short form (MNA-SF) and its individual items on the incidence of pneumonia. Design Prospective observational cohort study over 1-year of follow-up. Participants A total of 773 older persons (74.4% women) living in 13 French nursing homes from the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents (INCUR) study. Measurements Nutritional status was assessed using the MNA-SF questionnaire at baseline. Diagnosis of pneumonia was based on clinical conditions retrieved from a medical chart. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to test whether the MNA-SF score and its single components predict pneumonia events over 1 year of follow-up. Results After 1 year of follow-up, 160 (21%) incident cases of pneumonia were recorded. Mean age of participants was 86.2 (SD 7.5) years. Mean MNA-SF score was 9.8 (SD 2.4), with more than half of the participants (58.7%) being at risk of malnutrition (8-11 points). The total MNA-SF score and its categories did not predict the studied outcome. However, a single component of the MNA-SF score, specifically decreased mobility, was a significant risk factor for pneumonia (hazard ratio 2.289; 95% confidence interval 1.357-3.860; P = .002), independently of potential confounders. Conclusions The total MNA-SF score did not predict the incidence of pneumonia. However, decreased mobility was a significant risk factor, implying that individual components of the MNA-SF should be more carefully explored to verify whether they might be used for detecting specific declines of the health status in nursing home residents, thus potentially improving the risk profile estimation of such a complex population.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses research which investigated the palliative care needs of high-level care residents with complex needs living in elder hostels in Australia and examined whether a palliative approach was being used and, if so, how it was being incorporated into patient care. Researchers found that while staff in the hostels provided a combination of care, rehabilitation and end of life care, staffing levels were often inadequate to meet the needs of people requiring end of life care.</ab>

        <ab>Restorative home-care services, or re-ablement home-care services as they are now known in the UK, aim to assist older individuals who are experiencing difficulties in everyday living to optimise their functioning and reduce their need for ongoing home care. Until recently, the effectiveness of restorative home-care services had only been investigated in terms of singular outcomes such as length of home-care episode, admission to hospital and quality of life. This paper reports on a more complex and perhaps more significant measure - the use and cost of the home-care and healthcare services received over the 2-year period following service commencement. Seven hundred and fifty older individuals referred for government-funded home care were randomly assigned to a restorative or standard service between June 2005 and August 2007. Health and aged care service data were sourced and linked via the Western Australian Data Linkage System. Restorative clients used fewer home-care hours (mean [ SD], 117.3 [129.4] vs. 191.2 [230.4]), had lower total home-care costs ( AU$5570 vs. AU$8541) and were less likely to be approved for a higher level of aged care ( N [%], 171 [55.2] vs. 249 [63.0]) during follow-up. They were also less likely to have presented at an emergency department ( OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.50-0.94) or have had an unplanned hospital admission [ OR (95% CI), 0.69 (0.50-0.95)]. Additionally, the aggregated health and home-care costs of the restorative clients were lower by a factor of 0.83 (95% CI 0.72-0.96) over the 2-year follow-up ( AU$19,090 vs. AU$23,428). These results indicate that at a time when Australia is facing the challenges of population ageing and an expected increase in demand for health and aged care services, the provision of a restorative service when an older person is referred for home care is potentially a more cost-effective option than providing conventional home care.</ab>

        <ab>Improving hospital care for frail older people requires expertise, leadership and resources as these patients have multiple complex needs. One innovative solution to providing the skilled care necessary is to train experienced nurses to become advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs). Such roles encompass activity previously undertaken by medical staff, together with leadership, teaching, research and service development. Skills specific to caring for older people, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, are also required. This article discusses the need for ANPs in this clinical area, a pilot that is under way in one acute trust to develop these roles, and the potential benefits and challenges that may accompany this development.</ab>

        <ab>Experience with my mother over the past 3 years led me reflect on how we care for older adults. For those who do not have a nurse in the family to provide care coordination and oversight, how are the gaps in continuity of care and transitions in care addressed? Many specialized positions are emerging for nurses in care coordination. These positions tend to focus on the most complex patients and on selected transitions in care. There are pockets of excellence but nurses who provide direct care in inpatient and outpatient settings are the safety net for older adults like my mother. They need competencies in assessment of older adults and awareness of how illness may present differently in this population. They need to be aware of the entire continuum of care and provide care coordination for patients who are not receiving specialized care coordination services.</ab>

        <ab>The past several years have witnessed an upsurge in the focus on person-centered care for several populations, and especially for vulnerable elders with dementia who reside in nursing homes. The limited ability to accurately detect and quantify complex behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD) patterns has hampered the development and refinement of tailored interventions. This study's purpose was to characterize complex patterns of BSD and examine the association among different BSD patterns and cortisol profiles. Two groups of nursing home residents were analyzed (N = 28,N = 27) using THEME™. Behavioral and cortisol data were collected for four consecutive days. Random effects model was used to characterize BSD trajectories over time. There was a significant difference in BSD between the two groups from late afternoon to early evening. The groups differed significantly in age, comorbidities, antianxiety medication, and the number and complexity of patterns of vocalization and restlessness. THEME™analysis, a first step in developing and timing person-centered interventions, was able to identify BSD patterns that drove the overall time of day pattern.</ab>

        <ab>In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.</ab>

        <ab>Aim Review of intervention studies of associated factors with incontinence as the primary outcome in older people in care homes to identify and inform practice and future research. Background Incontinence is highly prevalent among care home populations. Previous reviews of descriptive and intervention studies have used urinary incontinence as the primary outcome. Design Systematic review and narrative summary. Data sources Electronic searches of English empirical studies undertaken using MEDLINE and CINAHL from January 1966-May 2010. All relevant empirical designs were selected from MEDLINE highly sensitive search strings from the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group, modified to exclude surgical and pharmacological studies Review methods The PRISMA statement was followed and established methods for systematic review to produce a narrative summary. Results Nine studies identified relating to associated factors with the management of incontinence in care homes. Factors included economic data, skin care, exercise studies, staff quality and prompted voiding adherence and the promotion of continence by the management of dehydration and incontinence. Conclusion Managing incontinence and promoting continence in care homes is complex, requiring time and cost-efficient management procedures to contain the problem and deliver quality, achievable care. When developing and designing systems of care in care homes, it is important to also recognize the impact of associated factors. As with any healthcare intervention programme, resources are required to implement the protocols. Economic evaluation studies are limited, with further studies warranted alongside preventative studies to maintain long-term continence in these populations.</ab>

        <ab>Chronically ill elders residing in long term care facilities are a medically and socially complex and vulnerable population. It has been noted that communication between providers who care for long term care facility residents, particularly telephone communication, has been problematic and difficult. Poor telephone communication has the potential to negatively impact the quality of care that is delivered. The purpose of this qualitative study was to elucidate, from the provider perspective, factors which affect telephone communication about long term care facility residents, and to develop a model of telephone communication in long term care on which to base quality improvement interventions or further study. Nineteen nurses (LPNs), physicians, and nurse practitioners participated in semi-structured interviews about their experiences communicating with other providers over the telephone in the nursing home setting. Utilizing grounded theory methodology, initial open and subsequent thematic coding of interview data yielded three core concepts of telephone communication that were common to all providers; however, the specific ways in which each concept was experienced varied by provider group. The results of this study suggest that a multifactorial approach which accounts for disciplinary perspective is needed when designing interventions to improve telephone communication in long term care, and that further study of telephone communication in long term care is necessary to further understand all factors which impact it.</ab>

        <ab>The author describes how a palliative approach to care addresses the complex issues that frail older people may face toward the end of their lives. She cites a report from the Care Quality Commission on the state of health care and adult social care in England which identified that end-of-life care for frail people needs improving. She discusses ways on how palliative nursing can make a positive contribution to the care of frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>International studies on the death of elderly nursing home residents show the complexity in the understanding of the professionals who care for the dying. The aim of this study is to explore the discourses about professional caregivers caring for those dying in Denmark in the last decade. A discourse analysis inspired by Foucault was constructed. The material consists of different source documents: research articles, newspaper articles, theses, books, websites - 35 sources in total. There are constructed six positions of speech, five discourses and three themes: (1) 'the work of the professional caregivers - a complex low-status work'; (2) 'the education of the professionals - the way to ensure a good death or possessing the right qualifications' and (3) 'the vulnerable professionals'. The study concludes that an economical/political discourse is dominating and sets up the frames within which the professionals care for dying residents, although the medical, the social/critical and the religious discourses attempt to speak against it. All positions articulate that the professional caregivers' job has a low status and that it is not possible to provide an optimal care due to lack of time, resources and education. Psychical or mental demands make the professionals vulnerable. The meaning of optimal care varies according to the positions of speech.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines specific to the medical care of frail older adults have yet to be widely disseminated. Because of the complex conditions associated with frailty, guidelines for frail older patients should be based on careful consideration of the characteristics of this population, balanced against the benefits and harms associated with treatment. In response to this need, the Diabetes Care Program of Nova Scotia (DCPNS) collaborated with the Palliative and Therapeutic Harmonization (PATH) program to develop and disseminate guidelines for the treatment of frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The DCPNS/PATH guidelines are unique in that they recommend the following: [1.] Maintain HbA1c at or above 8% rather than below a specific level, in keeping with the conclusion that lower HbA1c levels are associated with increased hypoglycemic events without accruing meaningful benefit for frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The guideline supports a wide range of acceptable HbA1c targets so that treatment decisions can focus on whether to aim for HbA1c levels between 8% and 9% or within a higher range (ie, &gt;9% and &lt;12%) based on individual circumstances and symptoms. [2.] Simplify treatment by administering basal insulin alone and avoiding administration of regular and rapid-acting insulin when feasible. This recommendation takes into account the variations in oral intake that are commonly associated with frailty. [3.] Use neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin instead of long-acting insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine (Lantus) or insulin detemir (Levemir), as insulin analogues do not appear to provide clinically meaningful benefit but are significantly more costly. [4.] With acceptance of more liberalized blood glucose targets, there is no need for routine blood glucose testing when oral hypoglycemic medications or well-established doses of basal insulin (used alone) are not routinely changed as a result of blood glucose testing. Although these recommendations may appear radical, they are based on careful review of research findings.</ab>

        <ab>Respite services have been established to support family carers by providing a break from the responsibilities of caregiving. However the literature and anecdotal evidence suggests that respite services offer carers much more than just providing a period of rest. This study was initiated to identify and describe the health and social care services that are offered to family carers and care-recipients by respite services in South Australia. The findings show that respite providers offer a service to both the family carer and care-recipient. Both groups are offered socialisation and engagement opportunities, and care-recipients have access to a diverse range of health care services. The description of respite that emerges from this study is that of a complex service offering much more than just a period of rest from caregiving duties.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and practice nurses regarding the U- CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. Background Care for older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. Design An explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. Methods The barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and expectations regarding the U- CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires sent to all participating general practitioners ( n = 32) and practice nurses ( n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. Results Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to provide structured care. Conclusion This explanatory mixed-methods study showed that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U- CARE programme as feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care towards a proactive and preventive care approach.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Loneliness is a contributing factor to various health problems in older adults, including complex chronic illness, functional decline, and increased risk of mortality. Objectives: A pilot study was conducted to learn more about the prevalence of loneliness in rural older adults with chronic illness and how it affects their quality of life. The purposes of the data analysis reported here were twofold: to describe loneliness, chronic illness diagnoses, chronic illness control measures, prescription medication use, and quality of life in a sample of rural older adults; and to examine the relationships among these elements. Methods: A convenience sample of 60 chronically ill older adults who were community dwelling and living in Appalachia was assessed during face-to-face interviews for loneliness and quality of life, using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale (version 3) and the CASP-12 quality of life scale. Chronic illness diagnoses, chronic illness control measures, and medication use data were collected through review of participants'electronic medical records. Results: Overall mean loneliness scores indicated significant loneliness. Participants with a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression had the highest mean loneliness scores, followed by those with lung disease and those with heart disease. Furthermore, participants with mood disorders, lung disease, or heart disease had significantly higher loneliness scores than those without these conditions. Loneliness was significantly related to total number of chronic illnesses and use of benzodiazepines. Use of benzodiazepines, diuretics, nitrates, and bronchodilators were each associated with a lower quality of life. Conclusions: Nurses should assess for loneliness as part of their comprehensive assessment of patients with chronic illness. Further research is needed to design and test interventions for loneliness.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. Methods The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. Findings Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. Conclusions Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice. Clinical Relevances The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objective: To test the effect of a complex guideline-based intervention on agitation and psychotropic prescriptions. Design, Setting, Participants: Cluster randomized controlled trial (VIDEANT) with blinded assessment of outcome in 18 nursing homes in Berlin, Germany, comprising 304 dementia patients. Intervention: Training, support, and activity therapy intervention, delivered at the level of each nursing home, focusing on the management of agitation in dementia. Control group nursing homes received treatment as usual. Measurements: Levels of agitated and disruptive behavior (Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory [CMAI]) as the primary outcome. Number of neuroleptics, antidepressants, and cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) prescribed in defined daily dosages (DDDs). Results: Of 326 patients screened, 304 (93.3%) were eligible and cluster-randomized to 9 intervention (n = 163) and 9 control (n = 141) nursing homes. Data were collected from 287 (94.4%) patients at 10 months. At 10 months, compared with controls, nursing home residents with dementia in the intervention group exhibited significantly less agitation as measured with the CMAI (adjusted mean difference, 6.24; 95% CI 2.03–14.14; P = .009; Cohen's d = 0.43), received fewer neuroleptics (P &lt; .05), more ChEIs (P &lt; .05), and more antidepressants (P &lt; .05). Conclusion: Complex guideline-based interventions are effective in reducing agitated and disruptive behavior in nursing home residents with dementia. At the same time, increased prescription of ChEIs and antidepressants together with decreased neuroleptic prescription suggests an effect toward guideline-based pharmacotherapy.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: To identify the factors associated with stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) among new enrollees who did not fully participate in therapy sessions. Methods: Data (n = 36,133) were obtained from the Minimum Data Set version 2.0 in the state of Michigan in 2009. Study participants were new SNF enrollees (n = 699) who did not fully participate in therapy sessions despite their desire to return to the community. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify factors contributing to remaining in a nursing home for 91 days or longer. Results: New SNF enrollees were more likely to remain in nursing home when they were depressed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–2.08; P = .01), experiencing delirium (OR = 3.20; 95% CI, 1.48–5.92; P &lt; .001), were not in pain (OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.60–0.95; P = .03), or in less complex care (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; P &lt; .01). Conclusions: A higher number of new SNF enrollees than previously reported were likely to stay in nursing homes (28.0%). Depression and delirium were associated with stay in an SNF, while pain and higher complexity of care were associated with returning to the community.</ab>

        <ab>Palliative medicine is a young specialty that is officially recognized in relatively few countries. The World Health Organization published an adapted definition in 2002, describing palliative care as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. When the accent is shifting from curative to palliative, the goal of management is the maintenance or improvement of the patient's quality of life. The different dimensions of palliative care and the multitude of types of care to be provided require a multidisciplinary, well-functioning team, effective communication and a clear task division between primary and hospital care. Considering the complexity of care for incurable patients, a multidisciplinary approach is a prerequisite to balance curative and palliative intervention options. Optimal functioning of a team requires excellent training, communication and a description of the tasks and responsibilities of each team member. More and more advanced care planning is introduced in palliative care, focusing on an early identification of patients in a palliative trajectory and on the prevention of annoying symptoms, hoping that this approach results in an improved quality of life for the individual patient, less useless technical investigations and a better end-of-life care on the place the patient and his family desires.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This integrative review aimed to appraise the evidence for case conferencing as an intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for older people living with advanced dementia in nursing homes. Design: An integrative review of English language citations from CINHAL, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO and CareSearch using a palliative care filter was undertaken. Two reviewers screened 238 titles to find 77 relevant articles which were reviewed in detail to identify nine studies that addressed the specific review questions. The analysis process allowed study characteristics, process and outcome measures along with implementation barriers and facilitators to be identified and the results synthesised. Results: The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by two randomised controlled case conferencing trials which demonstrated enhance medication management for people with dementia living in a nursing home. Several pre-post test studies suggest that case conferencing enhances palliative symptom management and care outcomes in nursing homes. Qualitative evidence suggests that case conferencing is feasible and worthwhile if the identified barriers are addressed and the facilitators optimised. Conclusions: Case conferencing provides opportunities to improve care palliative care outcomes for older people with dementia by engaging family and all relevant internal and external health providers in prospective care planning. More evidence is needed to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of case conferencing as a strategy for improving care outcomes for older people living with advanced dementia in nursing homes. The evidence generated by this integrative review will be of interest to policy makers, aged care organisations and clinicians alike, especially as services endeavour to meet the increasingly complex care needs of older people admitted to nursing homes with advanced dementia, and the needs of their families.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Healthy Ageing is a complex intervention aimed at reducing the prevalence of loneliness among elderly Dutch people. Purpose: This study aimed to assess how mass media communication materials, information meetings, and psychosocial courses were received by elderly people at high risk of loneliness. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with 17 independently living elderly persons at increased risk of loneliness were conducted. They provided information about factors influencing attention to and acceptability of the content of the intervention components. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed with Atlas. ti. Results: The mass media communication materials were not successful in attracting attention because interviewees' expectations about the communication channels differed from what was provided, the perceived personal relevance of the message was low, and the presentation was not attractive. The content of the intervention components was not well received because the objectives and components did not connect with the priority group's perception of their environment. Discussion: This study showed that the classical health education approach with one-way communication did not succeed in reaching the priority group. Translation to Health Education Practice: To select appropriate theoretical methods and practical strategies, such as using storytelling and personal invitation, we recommend involvement of the priority group.</ab>

        <ab>Migrant care workers make a substantial contribution to older adult care in Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK). However, little is known about the relational aspects of care involving migrant care workers and older people. Given that the care relationship is closely linked to quality of care, and that the Irish and UK sectors are increasingly restricted by economic austerity measures, this lack of information is a concern for care practice and policy. Our paper explores the relationship between migrant care workers and older people in Ireland and the UK and draws on data collected in both countries, including focus groups with older people (N = 41), interviews with migrant care workers (N = 90) and data from a survey of and interviews with employers. The findings illustrate the complexity of the migrant care worker–older person relationship; the prevalence of need orientated, friendship and familial-like, reciprocal, and discriminatory interlinking themes; and the role of individual, structural and temporal factors in shaping these relationships.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objective: To assess preliminary effects of a program of transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (TPTNS) on lower urinary tract symptoms and number of episodes of urinary and fecal incontinence in older adults in residential care homes and the feasibility of a full-scale randomized trial. Design: Pilot randomized single-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Seven residential care homes and 3 sheltered accommodation complexes in the United Kingdom. Participants: Thirty care home residents aged 65 and older with urinary or bowel symptoms and/or incontinence. Interventions: Twelve 30-minute sessions of TPTNS or sham stimulation (placebo). Measurements: Lower urinary tract symptoms using American Urological Society Symptom Index, urinary incontinence using International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF), postvoid residual urine volumes using portable bladder scanning, bowel symptoms and fecal incontinence using selected ICIQ questions. Results: Total American Urological Society Symptom Index scores improved, showing a median reduction of 7 (interquartile range [IQR] –8 to –3) in the TPTNS group and a median increase in the sham stimulation (placebo) group of 1 (IQR –1 to 4) (Mann-Whitney U 16.5000, Z –3.742, P &lt; .001). Total ICIQ-SF scores improved by a median of 2 (IQR –6 to 0) in the TPTNS group and 0 points (IQR –3 to 3) in the sham stimulation group (Mann-Whitney U 65.000, Z –1.508, P = .132). Significant reduction was found in postvoid residual urine of 55 mL in the TPTNS group (t = –2.215, df 11.338, P = .048). Bowel urgency improved in 27% of the TPTNS group compared with 8% of the sham group (χ2 2.395, df 2, P &gt; .302), fecal leakage improved in 47% of the TPTNS group compared with 23% of the sham group (χ2 4.480, df 2, P &gt; .106); however, these differences were not significant.

        <ab>The aim of this study was to illuminate the meaning of professional carers’ experiences in caring situations when a conflict of interest arises with the older person receiving care. The findings reveal the complexity of the carers’ ambivalence when facing a conflict of interest, weighing up between the older persons’ right to self-determination and external demands. The carers are alone in their ambivalence, and the conclusion is that they need help and support to be more present in the encounter. The implication for this study is to focus on care as a person-centered practice and to focus on people as interdependent on support carers to maintain older people’s right to self-determination in the relationship.</ab>

        <ab>Admission to a care home is a major event for many individuals and, for some, a time when they may lose their independence. It is at this juncture that they should be given the opportunity to participate in planning their future care. An advance care plan (ACP) is a means for people with capacity to document their preferences for their care and to enable providers to advocate on their behalf. Some people will have lost mental capacity before admission to a care facility, so it is essential for staff to be familiar with the complexities of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to support residents approaching the end of life. This article outlines the processes of ACP and identifies resources available to support the introduction of ACP into care homes.</ab>

        <ab>While palliative care is best delivered in an interdisciplinary format, courses teaching the interdisciplinary approach to palliative care are rare in healthcare education. This article describes a graduate-level course in palliative care for students in nursing, pharmacy, social work, and gerontology taught by faculty from each discipline. The overarching goals of this course are to convey core palliative care knowledge across disciplines, articulate the essential contribution of each discipline in collaborative care, and to define interdisciplinary processes learners need to understand and navigate interdisciplinary palliative care. Learning outcomes included increased knowledge in palliative care, enhanced attitudes in practice and application of skills to clinical practice settings, increased ability to contribute discipline-specific knowledge to their teams' discussions, and a sense of increasing confidence in participating in the care of complex patients, communicating with families, and contributing to the team as a member of their own discipline.</ab>

        <ab>Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common obstructive airway diseases, especially among older people. These conditions are associated with a significant and increasing disease burden. The diagnosis and management of asthma and COPD in older populations are complex, and consequently clinicians are faced with many therapeutic and diagnostic challenges. Both aging and obstructive airway diseases are associated with complex co-morbidities and these coexisting illnesses confound management. Moreover, the age-related physiological changes that occur in the lungs may lead to airflow limitation, and this may be difficult to distinguish from an active disease state. In practice, management of asthma and COPD is informed by disease-specific clinical practice guidelines; however, most older people with these conditions are excluded from clinical trials that are designed to inform practice, creating major evidence gaps. Furthermore, seldom do clinical practice guidelines consider the complexities of management in older populations. The problems experienced by older people are complex and multifactorial and our approach to management must reflect these challenges. Opportunities exist to improve the management and outcomes for older people with obstructive airway disease and there is an urgent need for clinical trials to test management approaches in this population; current research must consider the challenges and evidence gaps that exist.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: Qualitatively describe the use of team and group processes in intervention facilities participating in a study targeted to improve quality of care in nursing homes “in need of improvement.” Design/setting/participants: A randomized, two-group, repeated-measures design was used to test a 2-year intervention for improving quality of care and resident outcomes. Intervention group (n = 29) received an experimental multilevel intervention designed to help them: (1) use quality improvement methods, (2) use team and group process for direct-care decision-making, (3) focus on accomplishing the basics of care, and (4) maintain more consistent nursing and administrative leadership committed to communication and active participation of staff in decision-making. Results: The qualitative analysis revealed a subgroup of homes (“Full Adopters”) likely to continue quality improvement activities that were able to effectively use teams. “Full Adopters” had either the nursing home administrator or director of nursing who supported and were actively involved in the quality improvement work of the team. “Full Adopters” also selected care topics for the focus of their quality improvement team, instead of “communication” topics of the “Partial Adopters” or “Non-Adopters” in the study who were identified as unlikely to continue to continue quality improvement activities after the intervention. “Full Adopters” had evidence of the key elements of complexity science: information flow, cognitive diversity, and positive relationships among staff; this evidence was lacking in other subgroups. All subgroups were able to recruit interdisciplinary teams, but only those that involved leaders were likely to be effective and sustain team efforts at quality improvement of care delivery systems. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative analysis can help leaders and medical directors use the key elements and promote information flow among staff, residents, and families; be inclusive as discussions about care delivery, making sure diverse points of view are included; and help build positive relationships among all those living and working in the nursing home. Wide-spread adoption of the intervention in the randomized study is feasible and could be enabled by nursing home Medical Directors in collaborative practice with Advanced Practice Nurses.</ab>

        <ab>For residents of nursing homes, the possibility of death occuring within the facility is high, and most if not all end of life care are provided there, so it is vital to apply the philosophy of palliative care. Objective: To understand the nature of the end-of-life care in nursing homes and factors that hinder or facilitate the implementation of palliative care in these settings. Methods: A systematic literature review on end of life care in nursing homes between 2002 and 2012 of the databases consulted. The research protocol that was built allowed us to select 19 papers that constituted the corpus of analysis. Results: Through  a  process  of  meta-aggregation,  the  results  were  aggregated  based on similarity of meaning, in a total of 12 categories related to the nature of end of life care in nursing homes: identification of approach to death; holistic care, individualized and continuous care;  advance  planning;  appropriate  use  of  treatments;  symptom  control;  teamwork;  proper communication; no hasty transfers; good relationship with family; respect for personality and life story; including the experience of death; not dying alone. It  also  describes  the  factors  that  facilitate  (continuous  relationship  with  the  resident, continuing  relationship,  a  safe  and  “homely”  environment  in  which  death  is  experienced naturally)  or  hinder  the  end-of-life  care,  related  to  residents,  professionals,  with  the  care provided and the nursing home itself as an institution. Conclusions: Through the analysis and interpretation of results we understand that the nature of end-of-life care in nursing homes is complex and multifactorial related to residents, care team, family and the context in which care is provided.</ab>
        <ab>A possibilidade da morte, para os residentes de lares de idosos, ocorrer dentro das instalações é elevada, e a maioria, se não todos os cuidados de fim de vida são prestados aí, sendo por isso fundamental a aplicação da filosofia dos cuidados paliativos. Objetivo: Conhecer a natureza dos cuidados em fim de vida em lares de idosos e fatores que dificultam ou facilitam a implementação da filosofia dos cuidados paliativos nestes contextos. Método: Revisão sistemática da literatura sobre cuidados de fim de vida em lares de idosos entre 2002 e 2012 nas bases de dados consultadas. O protocolo de investigação construído permitiu selecionar 19 trabalhos que constituíram o corpus da análise. Resultados: através  de  um  processo  de  meta-agregação,  os  resultados  foram  agregados  com  base na  similaridade  de  sentido,  num  total  de  12  categorias  relacionadas  com  a  natureza  dos  cuidados  em  fim de  vida  em  lares  de  idosos:  identificação  da  aproximação  da  morte;  cuidados  holísticos,  individualizados e  contínuos;  planeamento  antecipado;  uso  adequado  de  tratamentos;  controlo  de  sintomas;  trabalho  em equipa;  comunicação  adequada;  sem  transferências  precipitadas;  boa  relação  com  a  família;  respeito  pela personalidade e história de vida; incluir a experiencia de morte; não morrer sozinho. Descrevem-se  também os  fatores  que  facilitam  (relacionamento  próximo  com  o  residente,  relação  de continuidade,  num  ambiente  seguro  e  “caseiro”  em  que  morte  é  vivida  com  naturalidade)  ou  dificultam  os cuidados  em  fim  de  vida,  relacionados  com  os  residentes,  com  os  profissionais,  com  os  cuidados  e  com  o próprio lar de idosos como instituição. Conclusões: Através da análise e interpretação dos resultados entendemos que a natureza dos cuidados em  fim  de  vida  em  lares  de  idosos  é  complexa  e  multifatorial  relacionada  com  os  residentes,  equipa  de cuidados, família e o próprio contexto onde se desenrolam os cuidados.</ab>

        <ab>The skin is a complex organ with multiple functions. It undergoes two distinct ageing processes -- intrinsic and extrinsic ageing -- leading to specific changes in the structure and function of an older person's skin. These changes reduce the effectiveness of the skin barrier and increase the vulnerability of the skin to breakdown. Knowledge of these changes enables a better understanding of the skin care needs of older people and how to promote healthy skin. Nurses are ideally placed to assess older people's skin holistically, and the adoption of skincare protocols comprising cleansing, protection, hydrating and replenishing can have a significant effect on patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Older adults are more susceptible to water imbalance and ensuring they drink sufficiently is a complex and challenging issue for nurses. The factors that promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older people from drinking are not well understood. Objective: This study aimed to understand the complexity of issues associated with the hydration and hydration care of older people. Design: A qualitative study using multiple methods. Settings: Two healthcare sites providing care for older people in the South West of England: a hospital ward in a major hospital and a care home providing personal and nursing care. Participants: Twenty-one older people aged 68–96 years, were recruited to the study from the hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older people to participate were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion criteria were being unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or distressed to take part in the study. The staff participants of nurses and health care assistants totalled 21. The inclusion criterion for staff was any nurse or health care assistant providing hydration care. Seven friends or relatives participated by making anonymous comments via a suggestion box available to all friends and relatives. Methods: Data were collected via interviews with older people, focus group discussions involving staff, suggestion box comments made by friends and relatives and twelve hours observation of hydration practice. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to promote drinking including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in older people''s hands and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their experience of drinking was diminished by a variety of factors including a limited aesthetic experience and a focus on fluid consumption rather than on drinking as a pleasurable and social experience. Conclusion: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with drinking were lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social interaction was underplayed in both settings. Hydration practice which supports the individual needs of older people is complex and goes beyond simply ensuring the consumption of adequate fluids.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objective: To determine the prevalence of dementia diagnoses and the use of antidementia drugs in a cohort of Italian older nursing home (NH) residents. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The NH residents participating in 2 studies: the U.L.I.S.S.E. study and the Umbria Region survey. Participants: A total of 2215 nursing home residents. Measurement: Each resident underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline by means of the RAI MDS 2.0. Dementia diagnosis was based on ICD-9 codes. Results: The prevalence of dementia diagnosis according to ICD-9 codes was 50.7% (n = 1123), whereas 312 subjects had cognitive impairment with a cognitive performance scale score ≥3 without a diagnosis of dementia. Only 56 NH residents were treated (5% of the sample) and the main drugs used were cholinesterase inhibitor, whereas only 1 subject was treated with memantine. Limiting our analysis to patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer''s disease, who are those reimbursed by the public health care system for receiving antidementia drugs, the percentage rose to 11.3%. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate a high rate of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of dementia in Italian NH residents. Potential explanations include the lack of systematic assessment of cognitive functions, the limitations to antidementia drug reimbursement, the complexity of the reimbursement procedure itself, and the high prevalence of patients with severe dementia. Older NH residents still lack proper access to state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment for a devastating condition such as dementia.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, the meaning and implications of dignity, integrity, and autonomy as core concepts in eldercare are illuminated and discussed. Elderly people who receive nursing care are vulnerable and dependent which appeal to care ethics and emphasise the importance of these concepts. However, dignity, integrity, and autonomy are complex concepts that are difficult to work with because on the one hand, they are used frequently in everyday language, and on the other hand, they are hard to define in a caring practice. Based on theoretical and empirical studies within the context of eldercare, the aim of this article is, from a caring perspective, to explore and describe the meaning of these concepts and illustrate their impact for a dignified care. Three key ethical challenges and five principles for eldercare are elucidated and discussed. The ethical issue is basically a concern for the vulnerability of the elderly and respecting the elderly person as an individual human being.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The study aimed at analyzing how the family organizes itself as a unit of care to oldest old at the domiciliary space, based on the model Calgary Family assessment. Method: A qualitative, descriptive. The collection of data occurred through interviews, evaluating three family nuclei. Results: Based on the categories that make up the model and content analysis were analyzed aspects of the structure, development and functioning of families, including the socioeconomic dynamics of family organization, the role of the elderly and their influence on the familial relationship, the need for care, emotional and affective ties that (re) organize the family structure. Conclusion: The complexity of family relationships and ties that keep the elderly are essential to the preservation of their health, especially in aspects of care dependency. It is important to greater integration of the nursing team in this space in order to adapt to health care to the family organization.</ab>

Metodo: Estudio descriptivo cualitativo. Los datos fueron recolectados a través de entrevistas, la evaluación de cada tres hogares. Resultados: En base a las categorías que componen el modelo y el análisis de contenido se analizaron aspectos de la estructura, el desarrollo y funcionamiento de las familias, incluyendo las dinámicas socioeconómicas de la organización familiar, el papel de los ancianos y su influencia enla relación familiar, la necesidad de cuidado, los lazos emocionales y afectivos que (re)organizar la estructura de la familia. Conclusión: La complejidad de las relaciones familiares y los lazos que mantienen a las personas de edad son esenciales para la preservación de su salud, especialmente en los aspectos de la dependencia de cuidados. Es importante una mayor integración del equipo de enfermería en este espacio con el fin de adaptarse a la atención médica a la organización de la familia.</ab>
        <ab>OBJETIVO: O estudo objetivou analisar como a família se organiza enquanto unidade de cuidado a idosos mais velhos no espaço domiciliar, com base no Modelo Calgary de Avaliação Familiar. MÉTODO: Estudo de caráter qualitativo, descritivo. A coleta dos dados ocorreu por meio de entrevistas, avaliando três núcleos familiares. RESULTADOS: Baseados nas categorias que compõe o Modelo e na análise de conteúdo analisaram-se os aspectos da estrutura, desenvolvimento e funcionamento das famílias, abrangendo a dinâmica socioeconômica da organização familiar, o papel do idoso e sua influência na relação familial, a necessidade de cuidado, aspectos emocionais e vínculo afetivo que (re)organizam a estrutura familiar. CONCLUSÃO: A relação familiar e a complexidade dos vínculos que o idoso mantém são fundamentais para a preservação de sua saúde, especialmente nos aspectos relativos à dependência de cuidados. Considera-se importante maior inserção da equipe de enfermagem nesse espaço visando adequar a assistência em saúde à organização familiar.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The phenomenon of elderly sexual offenders is poorly catalogued, and is especially complex. In institutions, elderly people are often unrecognized victims of sexual abuse but are also at great risk for doing abuse toward vulnerable victims like children. The lack of attention to an elder’s basic needs can endanger or impair not only his or her health or safety but also that of other people living close together. In this article, for the first time we describe an episode of sexual abuse realized by an institutionalized patient toward a young visitor. This specific risk factor in a residential care home for elderly may lead to a variety of negative behavioral outcomes, including the perpetration of child sexual offending. As the elderly population will increase tremendously in the next years, it is necessary to better understand the motivations and psychological factors relating to elderly sex offenders, to prevent these offenses, and to define standards for surveillance of residents who are potential perpetrators.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose -- The population of older people in the UK is expected to rise rapidly over the next 20 years and therefore identification of effective interventions that prevent functional decline and disablement is a public health priority This review summarises the evidence for interventions in community settings that aim to prevent or delay disablement in later life. Design/methodology/approach -- A search of review-level literature was conducted for the period September 1999 and 2009 of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases. It included interventions that aimed to prevent disablement of community dwelling older people (50 + years old). It excluded interventions carried out in institutional care and those focused on specific disease. The reviews were screened using the AMSTAR assessment tool. Findings -- The search identified 62 reviews of complex interventions (preventative home visits (n = 9), integrated service delivery/case management and comprehensive geriatric assessment (n = 6), falls prevention (n = 17), exercise (n= 15), nutritional needs (n= 3), medication review (n = 2), telecare/telehealth (n = 5), social integration interventions (n = 3) and vision screening (n = 2). Originality/value to Conclusion -- The review identified many areas of unknown effectiveness, partly due to unstandardised use of outcomes and poor experimental design. The most promising complex interventions include: assessment of risk factors; and direct referral to an easily accessible, comprehensive range of interventions that are tailored to need and include long-term follow up. There is consistent evidence that exercise can be beneficial, particularly in preventing falls, but overall, the evidence-base for other specific interventions is limited.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (&lt;4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (&lt;4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To understand the way in which the institutionalized elderly organize their living spaces for their daily life. METHODS: A qualitative study that used the strategy of a case study, conducted in a long-term institution for the elderly (LTCF), located in the city of Fortaleza - CE (Brazil). Participating as subjects were nine elderly residents of this institution, during the period between April and May, 2006. To collect data, we used direct nonparticipant observation, with the field notes on the interview kept in a journal based on the script of life history. RESULTS: The reconstruction of individualized spaces was marked by the institution's organizational structure, use of common spaces and such as the elderly rearranges his own universe. CONCLUSIONS: The (re)construction of the daily life of elderly in the LTCF context is a complex process that requires effort of the elderly. In this study, we observed that the elderly are able to restructure their lives.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives Beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are of increasing interest because of their clinical complexity and high costs. The objective of this study was to examine the incidence, costs, and factors associated with potentially avoidable hospitalizations ( PAH) in this population. Design Retrospective study of hospitalizations. Setting Hospitalizations from nursing facilities ( NF) including Medicare and Medicaid-covered stays, and Medicaid Home and Community- Based Services ( HCBS) waiver programs. Participants Dually eligible individuals who received Medicare skilled nursing facility ( SNF) or Medicaid NF services or HCBS waiver services in 2005. Interventions None. Measurements Potentially avoidable hospitalizations were defined by an expert panel that identified conditions and associated Diagnostic Related Groups ( DRGs) which can often be prevented or safely and effectively managed without hospitalization. Results More than one-third of the population was hospitalized at least once, totaling almost 1 million hospitalizations. The admitting DRG for 382,846 (39%) admissions were identified as PAH. PAH rates varied considerably among states, and blacks had a higher rate and costs for PAH than whites. Five conditions (pneumonia, congestive heart failure, urinary tract infections, dehydration, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma) were responsible for 78% of the PAH. The total Medicare costs for these hospitalizations were $3 billion, but only $463 million for Medicaid. A sensitivity analysis, assuming that 20%-60% of these hospitalizations could be prevented, revealed that between 77,000 and 260,000 hospitalizations and between $625 million and $1.9 billion in expenditures could be avoided annually in this population. Conclusion Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are common and costly in the dually eligible population. New initiatives are needed to reduce PAH in this population as they are costly and can adversely affect function and quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Heart rate variability (HRV) is the temporal beat-to-beat variation in successive RR intervals on an electrocardiographic (ECG) recording and it reflects the regulation of the heart rate (HR) by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). HRV analysis is a noninvasive tool for the assessment of autonomic function that gained momentum in the late 1980s when its clinical relevance as a predictor of mortality was established by a milestone study by Kleiger et al. in patients with postacute myocardial infarction. In the last few decades, the increasing availability of commercial ECG devices offering HRV analysis has made HRV a favorite marker for risk stratification in the setting of cardiovascular disease. The rapid aging of the world population and the growing popularity of HRV have also fueled interest for the prognostic value of HRV in the elderly, outside a specific cardiological context. However, the discussion of HRV measures in the elderly is still very much centered on the rather reductionistic model of sympathovagal balance, with the orthosympathetic and parasympathetic limbs of the ANS exercising opposing effects on the heart via autonomic tone. The expanding application of nonlinear dynamics to medicine has brought to the forefront the notion of system complexity, embedded in the mathematical concepts of chaos theory and fractals, and provides an opportunity to suggest a broader interpretation for the prognostic significance of HRV, especially in the elderly. Although the use of novel indices of HRV may be hampered by practical issues, a more holistic approach to HRV may still be safeguarded if traditional time- and frequency-domain measures are viewed in terms of autonomic modulation. This review focuses on HRV in geriatric populations. It considers studies on the prognostic value of HRV in elderly subjects, discussing the potential confounding effect of erratic rhythm, and concentrates on the conceptual distinction between autonomic tone and autonomic modulation. It also briefly addresses the question of the practicality of ECG recordings and identifies a promising area for future research in the effects of common noncardioactive drugs on HRV.

        <ab>When a patient's transition from the hospital to home is less than optimal, the repercussions can be far-reaching - hospital readmission, adverse medical events, and even mortality. Elderly, especially frail older patients with complex health care problems appear to be a group particularly at risk for adverse events in general, and during transitions across health providers in particular. We undertook a systematic review to identify interventions designed to improve patient safety during transitional care of the elderly, with a particular focus on discharge interventions. We searched the literature for qualitative and quantitative studies on the subject published over the past ten years. The review revealed a set of potential intervention types aimed at the improvement of communication that contribute to safe transitional care. Intervention types included professionoriented interventions (e.g. education and training), organisational/culture interventions (e.g. transfer nurse, discharge protocol, discharge planning, medication reconciliation, standardized discharge letter, electronic tools), or patient and next of kin oriented interventions (e.g. patient awareness and empowerment, discharge support). Results strongly indicate that elderly discharged from hospital to the community will benefit from targeted interventions aimed to improve transfer across healthcare settings. Future interventions should take into account multi-component and multi-disciplinary interventions incorporating several single interventions combined.</ab>

        <ab>At Leicester Royal Infirmary, the care of frail older people occupies a disproportionate amount of emergency department (ED) staff's time and resources. Too few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as possible. This article describes how the unit operates.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The Minimum Data Set 3.0 has introduced a higher set of expectations for assessment of residents’ psychosocial needs, including new interviewing requirements, new measures of depression and resident choice, and new discharge screening procedures. Social service staff are primary providers of psychosocial assessment and care in nursing homes; yet, research demonstrates that many do not possess the minimum qualifications, as specified in federal regulations, to effectively provide these services given the clinical complexity of this client population. Likewise, social service caseloads generally exceed manageable levels. This article addresses the need for enhanced training and support of social service and interdisciplinary staff in long term care facilities in light of the new Minimum Data Set 3.0 assessment procedures as well as new survey and certification guidelines emphasizing quality of life. A set of recommendations will be made with regard to training, appropriate role functions within the context of interdisciplinary care, and needs for more realistic staffing ratios.</ab>

        <ab>Considering the prevalence of arterial hypertension among the elderly, the present study analyzes their perception of health needs, in a qualitative way, from focal groups with elderly users of Family Health Units. Data analysis was performed according to the hermeneutic-dialectical perspective and resulted in three nuclei of meaning: recognizing the possibility of having access to basic health care together with the desire to consume services of greater complexity and understanding the shortcomings of the State; attachment and welcoming as fundamental elements in the feelings of support and security and autonomy permeated by the tranquility to deal with the disease and the difficulties imposed by conditions inherent to the subjects' life style. Therefore, it is understood that the Family Health Strategy has been complying with its role in terms of the access to the healthcare system and regarding the professional-user attachment. However, health care continues to be centered on the disease rather than the individual.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To explore factors at the family caregiver and nursing home administrative levels that may affect participation in a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of hand feeding vs. percutaneous gastrostomy tube feeding in persons with late-stage dementia. Background Decision-making regarding use of tube feeding vs. hand feeding for persons with late-stage dementia is fraught with practical, emotional and ethical issues and is not informed by high levels of evidence. Design Qualitative case study. Methods Transcripts of focus groups with family caregivers were reviewed for themes guided by behavioural theory. Analyses of notes from contacts with nursing home administrators and staff were reviewed for themes guided by an organizational readiness model. Data were collected between the years 2009-2012. Results Factors related to caregiver willingness to participate included understanding of the prognosis of dementia, perceptions of feeding needs and clarity about research protocols. Nursing home willingness to participate was influenced by corporate approval, concerns about legal and regulatory issues, and prior relationships with investigators. Conclusion Participation in rigorous trials requires lengthy navigation of complex corporate requirements and training competent study staff. Objective deliberation by caregivers will depend on appropriate recruitment timing, design of recruitment materials and understanding of study requirements. The clinical standards and policy environment and the secular trends there-in have relevance to the responses of people at all levels.</ab>

        <ab>Real uptake of recommendations is at the crux of community-based fall prevention. This mixed methods intervention study investigated how knowledge of one's own fall risk influenced self-reported behaviors and beliefs about falls and fall prevention in the home by older adults. Between one-on-one semi-structured interviews, participants received their individual scores compared to age-matched normative values for the Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, Biodex™ Fall Risk Test, and cut scores for the Timed Up and Go and Berg Balance Scale. Change scores on the Falls Behavioural Scale for Older Adults were reviewed as norm values were not found in the literature. Findings from the fall-related assessments and interviews reiterated the complexity of falls and fall prevention in a fluctuating curve of 'awareness' comprised of 'having concern, being careful,' 'accepting,' and 'action/behavior related to fall prevention.' Despite some uptake of recommended fall prevention advice, being perceived as susceptible to falls remained unacceptable to these participants, limiting real transfer or expressed belief in fall risk.</ab>

        <ab>The recurrent hospitalization of older people with heart disease, due to low compliance or leaving medication leads to the following question: Have the elderly, with heart disease, difficulties to keep medication which is prescribed when they go away from hospital? A qualitative, descriptive, and inductive research was done to try to understanding the participants about their medica· tion compliance. Data were collected through semisstructured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. The findings conclude that older people with heart disease have difficulty in maintaining the prescribed medication, mainly due to low knowledge, presence or absence of symptoms, lack of family support and complexity of the regimen.</ab>

        <ab>Elderly patients, including those with dementia, have more complex health care needs, which may be more effectively served by interdisciplinary teams. Yet, few health care students receive interdisciplinary education. This article describes the improved outcomes of a second annual symposium for health care students on interdisciplinary care for older adults with dementia. Students (n = 109) completed a pre/post assessment using the Attitudes Toward Healthcare Teams Scale. A t-test for paired samples indicated a statistically significant increase in pre-post test scores (p &lt; .001); we observed a larger effect size of change in student attitudes for this symposium than the first (η2 = .48). The results support the value of pedagogical changes in facilitating a greater change in student attitudes about interdisciplinary teamwork.</ab>

        <ab>perry l., bellchambers h., howie a., moxey a., parkinson l., capra s. &amp; byles j. (2011) Examination of the utility of the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework for implementation of evidence based practice in residential aged care settings. Journal of Advanced Nursing 67(9), 2139-2150. Abstract Aim.  This study examined the relevance and fit of the PARiHS framework (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) as an explanatory model for practice change in residential aged care. Background.  Translation of research knowledge into routine practice is a complex matter in health and social care environments. Examination of the environment may identify factors likely to support and hinder practice change, inform strategy development, predict and explain successful uptake of new ways of working. Frameworks to enable this have been described but none has been tested in residential aged care. Methods.  This paper reports preliminary qualitative analyses from the Encouraging Best Practice in Residential Aged Care Nutrition and Hydration project conducted in New South Wales in 2007-2009. We examined congruence with the PARiHS framework of factors staff described as influential for practice change during 29 digitally recorded and transcribed staff interviews and meetings at three facilities. Findings.  Unique features of the setting were flagged, with facilities simultaneously filling the roles of residents' home, staff's workplace and businesses. Participants discussed many of the same characteristics identified by the PARiHS framework, but in addition temporal dimensions of practice change were flagged. Conclusion.  Overall factors described by staff as important for practice change in aged care settings showed good fit with those of the PARiHS framework. This framework can be recommended for use in this setting. Widespread adoption will enable cross-project and international synthesis of findings, a major step towards building a cumulative science of knowledge translation and practice change.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To comprehensively evaluate the quality of care provided in special needs plans ( SNPs; Medicare Advantage plans that aim to provide specialized care for complex older adults) and specifically the nurse care management model in the community setting. Design We adapted 107 process-of-care quality measures across 12 conditions from the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders set to obtain a clinically detailed evaluation of the quality of care received by complex older enrollees in a dual eligible Evercare SNP. We abstracted 13 months of primary care medical records to delineate quality of care provided by physicians and whether there was value added from the nurse care manager model. Setting Dual eligible Evercare SNP located in central Florida. Participants Two-hundred thirty-one vulnerable older enrollees in the SNP who had complex disease. Results Based on physician medical records alone, the 231 high-risk participants (mean age 77, 67% women) received recommended care for 53% of 5,569 evaluated clinical circumstances, ranging from 12% for end-of-life care to 78% for diabetes mellitus. In fewer than 40% of these clinical circumstances was recommended care provided for dementia, falls, and urinary incontinence. In a second analysis accounting for care provided by both the Evercare nurse and the physician, recommended care was provided to patients in 69% of the 5,684 evaluated clinical circumstances. Conclusion Comprehensive quality measurement applied to vulnerable older adults enrolled in one mature SNP showed that the Evercare nurse model addresses important deficits in physician care for geriatric conditions. Such measurement should be applied to other SNP models and to compare SNP care with that for complex, older, fee-for-service Medicare cohorts.</ab>

        <ab>Medical Education 2011: 45: 1006-1015 Objectives Doctors make many transitions whilst they are training and throughout their ensuing careers. Despite studies showing that transitions in other high-risk professions such as aviation have been linked to increased risk in the form of adverse outcomes, the effects of changes on doctors' performance and consequent implications for patient safety have been under-researched. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of transitions upon medical performance. Methods The project sought to focus on the inter-relationships between doctors and the complex work settings into which they transition. To this end, a 'collective' case study of doctors was designed. Key transitions for foundation year and specialist trainee doctors were studied. Four levels of the case were examined, pertaining to: the regulatory and policy context; employer requirements; the clinical teams in which doctors worked, and the doctors themselves. Data collection methods included interviews, observations and desk-based research. Results A number of problems with doctors' transitions that can all adversely affect performance were identified. (i) Transitions are regulated but not systematically monitored. (ii) Actual practice (as observed and reported) was determined much more by situational and contextual factors than by the formal (regulatory and management) frameworks. (iii) Trainees' and health professionals' accounts of their actual experiences of work showed how performance is dependent on the local learning environment. (iv) The increased regulation of clinical activity through protocols and care pathways helps to improve trainees' performance, whereas the less regulated aspects of work, such as rotas, induction and the making of multiple transitions within rotations, can impede performance during a period of transition. Conclusions Transitions may be reframed as critically intensive learning periods (CILPs) in which doctors engage with the particularities of the setting and establish working relationships with other doctors and other professionals. Institutions and wards have their own learning cultures which may or may not recognise that transitions are CILPS. The extent to which these cultures take account of transitions as CILPs will contribute to the performance of new doctors. Thus, these findings have implications for practice and for policy, regulation and research.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to determine which intervention used to assist people with dementia from sitting to a standing position was the most effective approach to aid movement. Method: Focus groups were held with care and therapy staff working in dementia settings to find out the difficulties they encountered when helping someone with dementia to a standing position, and the interventions to overcome these difficulties. Suggested interventions were substantiated against the literature and efficacy of intervention attempts was recorded in a diary. Participants also completed a post-intervention questionnaire to establish their views on how results should be used. Results: Appropriate interventions led to a positive outcome for participants as they were able to assist people with the minimum of fuss and complexity, and for patients because they received the care they required. No single intervention emerged as being particularly effective and other factors must be considered when interpreting the results. Conclusion: Participants agreed that interventions should be included in patient handling training programmes.</ab>

        <ab>New models of interprofessional working are continuously being proposed to address the burgeoning health and social care needs of older people with complex and long-term health conditions. Evaluations of the effectiveness of these models tend to focus on process measures rather than outcomes for the older person. This discussion paper argues that the concept of frailty, and measures based on it, may provide a more user-centred tool for the evaluation of interprofessional services -- a tool that cuts across unidisciplinary preoccupations and definitions of effectiveness. Numerous frailty scales have been developed for case identification and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes. We suggest that they may also be particularly suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of interprofessional working with community-dwelling older people. Several exemplars of frailty scales that might serve this purpose are identified, and their potential contributions and limitations are discussed. Further work is required to establish which is the most suitable scales for this application. The development of an appropriate frailty scale could provide an opportunity for interprofessional debate about the forms of care and treatment that should be prioritised to improve the health and well-being of this population.</ab>

        <ab>The prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances within long-term care facilities is an important and complex issue from both the clinical and the public policy perspectives. This article reviews the regulatory background and clinical concerns regarding the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration within the institutional pharmacies serving long-term care facilities. The article argues that the processes implemented since 2009 in response to concerns about Drug Enforcement Administration enforcement are suboptimal at many levels. A robust solution that meets the needs of all parties involved will require multiple levels of collaboration and respect for several legitimate agendas pertinent to this issue. The comprehensive solution must address at least 4 concerns. It must ensure that (1) residents and patients of long-term care facilities receive appropriate and timely administration of controlled substances when they are part of their individualized plans of care; (2) long-term care facilities have rigorous processes in place to prevent diversion of controlled substances; (3) required processes for prescribing controlled substances are reasonable and not overly burdensome to the clinicians caring for this population; and (4) all parties are in compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. The solution, however, will likely require legislative amendments to the Controlled Substances Act and regulatory revisions for optimal outcomes. The debate surrounding the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act within long-term care facilities is ongoing and the parameters are in flux. This article provides a historical perspective and policy framework for understanding the topic, reviews various proposed solutions, and suggests a collaborative process for resolution.</ab>

        <ab>Health leaders from across Suffolk joined together in a collaborative action-learning project to identify ways of offering more productive and personalised care for patients with dementia and their carers. The project revealed a range of factors necessary for success, notably professional collaboration and effective facilitation. The outcome was a range of evidenced-based recommendations to improve care and efficiency, as well as ensuring that the quality, innovation, productivity and prevention (QIPP) agenda was met. The lessons can be applied not just in dementia care, but to other long-term and complex care situations.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the complexities of discussing end-of-life care with people with dementia. Twelve people with dementia were interviewed to complete values histories. During the interviews participants were asked to describe their feelings and values related to the end their lives. A minority appreciated the opportunity to discuss their feelings, while others were evasive and one was frightened, indicating they did not want to pursue the topic further. Many had no strong views, choosing to leave future decisions up to medical staff or thought they could decide in the future, indicating a lack of awareness of the prognosis. A practice reflection, describing issues of potential benefit to practitioners undertaking similar therapeutic engagement, is included.</ab>

        <ab>Although it is widely acknowledged that the complex health problems of chronically ill and elderly persons require care provision across organisational and professional boundaries, achieving widespread multidisciplinary co-operation in primary care has proven problematic. We developed an explanation for this on the basis of the concepts of routines (patterns of behaviour) and rules, which form a relatively new yet promising perspective for studying co-operation in health-care. We used data about primary care providers situated in the Dutch region of Limburg, a region that, despite high numbers of chronically and elderly persons, has traditionally few healthcare centres and where multidisciplinary co-operation is limited. A qualitative study design was used, in which interviews and documents were the main data sources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with providers from six primary care professions in the Dutch region of Limburg; relevant documents included co-operation agreements, annual reports and internal memos. To analyse the evidence, several data matrices were developed and all data were structured according to the main concepts under study, i.e. routines and rules. Although more research is needed, our study suggests that the emergence of more extensive multidisciplinary co-operation in primary care is hampered by the organisational rules and regulations prevailing in the sector. By emphasising individual care delivery rather than co-operation, these rules stimulate the perseverance of diversity between the routines by which providers perform their solo care delivery activities, rather than the creation of the amount of compatibility between those routines that is necessary for the current, rather limited shape of multidisciplinary co-operation to expand. Further research should attempt to validate this explanation by utilising a larger research population and systematically operationalising the rules existing in the legal and - more importantly - organisational environment of primary care.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a study identifying the care issues experienced by older people in the acute setting that could be improved through a collaborative approach to action. Background. Actively involving consumers in the governance of healthcare organizations is viewed positively, although there is less agreement on how to do this. Co-operative inquiry is a useful approach to involve consumers and clinicians in structured dialogue about understanding and changing care, whereas traditional quality improvement methodologies are often singular in their dimensions of change. Method. Using a co-operative inquiry approach, five workshops were facilitated over a 4-month period in 2008 with four volunteer older people, four clinicians and three facilitators (n = 11). All participants were actively involved in generating ideas and actions using a range of facilitation techniques and data collection methods. Findings. There was increased awareness, understanding and acceptance of clinicians' and consumers' experiences and expectations of care. The complexity behind changing so-called simple care (providing warm drinks, appetizing food), which were the key concerns for consumers, relied on the active management and broader transformation of the system, including teamwork, communication processes and organizational and individual values and beliefs. Conclusion. Consumers and clinicians put different emphasis on perspectives related to improving care of older people in the acute hospital setting. The disconnect between what consumers viewed as 'simple' organizational behaviours to change and what the clinicians viewed as complex, led to a recognition that the approach to organizational change needs to be reconceptualized.</ab>

        <ab>In 2000, the Institute of Nursing Science in Basel started with a clinically oriented Master programme in Advanced Nursing Practice (ANP). The nursing expertise achieved with this degree includes enhanced skills and know-how in a specialised area. Together with their nurse colleagues, the clinically, scientifically, and practice-orientated Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) support and develop nursing practice in Switzerland further, especially for chronically ill and geriatric patients. It is estimated that 25 % of older adults aged 80-years and older experience at least one hospitalisation per year. Beside the acute diagnosis, they suffer from several chronic illnesses. These highly complex and fragile patients need to be cared for by nurses with enhanced practice skills in gerontology. At the acute geriatric ward of the University Hospital Basel a practice development project is ongoing under the guidance of an APN to support person-oriented, geriatric care. The practice development project is led by the principles of action research. The circular process of 'look-think-act' facilitates the critical examination of nursing practice. First results show shorter length of hospital stay for patients and improved job-satisfaction and self-efficacy for nurses. This article shortly reveals the history of ANP and highlights the development, implementation, and first results of the practice development project.</ab>

        <ab>Family caregivers play a key role at the end of life. They provide high levels of assistance and are often called on to make complex medical decisions. This is a period where there is potential for conflict, particularly when the patient lacks decision-making capacity. This case report describes how an interdisciplinary team helped an end-of-life caregiver to find closure while advocating for the patient''s wishes to be carried out. The intervention of appropriate advanced care planning and frequent communication resulted in a positive outcome.</ab>

        <ab>This study aimed to describe and interpret autonomy and presence as determinants and signifiers of intergenerational care to the elderly. It is a qualitative and ethnographic research, with data collected through interviews and participant observation. The subjects were ten elderly and their respective caregivers. Two thematic categories emerged: autonomy as determinant of care and presence as signifier of care. The relation of elderly with their caregivers is based on ensuring their autonomy's preservation, which makes them feel cared. Presence meant care for most seniors, determined by availability and being near, which represented security. Thus, intergenerational care to the elderly should be guided by respect for and preservation of their autonomy, considering also the importance of the presence conditioned on respect of people's totality and complexity to their lifestyles and cultural values.</ab>

        <ab>Scand J Caring Sci; 2010; 24; 533–540 Clinical prioritizations and contextual constraints in nursing homes - a qualitative study Aim: The aim of the study was to describe nurses’ and physicians’ experiences of prioritization factors in nursing homes. Background: What are the experiences of health care personnel when prioritizing treatment and care for elderly residents in nursing homes? Little research has been done in this area, yet with the growing elderly population and limited health care budgets there can be little doubt about its relevance. Method: The study was conducted through semi-structured interviews with 13 physicians and nurses in six nursing homes. The interviews were analysed by manifest content analysis based on first- and second-level categories describing relevant factors. The categories were developed after preliminary readings of the texts. Results: This study revealed that there was a complex set of contextual constraints which influenced the care provided. There were three main findings: (i) some overall challenges related to providing good care to nursing home residents; these in turn influenced (ii) prioritizing dilemmas and (iii) factors influencing prioritization decisions. Discussion: Contextual constraints and higher level prioritizations seem to play a key role in clinical prioritizations in nursing homes. The combination of implicit rationing and the factors described as most predominant in the clinical prioritizations in nursing homes may result in inadequate and unjust health care services for some of the nursing home residents. In particular, those patients who do not speak up or do have comprehensive needs are at risk of being neglected.</ab>

        <ab>Lack of access to quality health care has been a long-standing risk for rural Americans. Multiple factors are emerging that may increase this risk in the future. The National Association for Home Care continuously keeps rural access on the radar and supports legislation that will preserve home care access to vulnerable rural areas. Of special interest are the rural elderly. Rural residents older than the age of 65 years represent a large portion of the nation's home care recipients. Although people older than 65 years are living longer, healthier lives, they frequently require quality health care to make that possible. This population is also more likely to have complex medical issues requiring health care interventions. A review of current literature shows that there are many emerging trends posing a significant risk to the future of home care in rural America. This article discusses resources as well as initiatives undertaken to identify successful rural care delivery models.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to explore the barriers that the uninsured elderly population encounter when accessing health care in the United States. These barriers include, but are not limited to lack of transportation, insurance, or family support; the daunting complexity of the health care system; poverty; culture; poor patient-health care provider communications; race/ethnicity; and lack of health care professionals such as nurses and doctors with adequate geriatric preparation, or generalists who are undereducated in geriatrics. The number of health care professionals currently available to treat elderly persons in the United States is inadequate. The Federal government should take steps to develop solutions to improve access to health care and decrease health disparities for older adults. As a nation, we should be proactive in addressing these concerns instead of waiting for new barriers to arise that further limit access to health care for elderly patients and their families. In this article, we provide an assessment of the barriers that limit access to health care in the uninsured elderly population and suggest recommendations and possible solutions to eliminate or reduce these barriers.</ab>

        <ab>The increasing need for specialist residential aged care services to support older people with complex behaviors resulting from dementia and alcohol-related brain injury was the impetus for the development of an exploratory action research trial. Affected individuals are commonly characterized by a unique set of needs and life circumstances that are not adequately or appropriately supported by currently available mainstream services. We discuss the synthesis, design, and key features of the research trial's specialized model, which commenced in 2008 in Wintringham, Australia. The trial was recently completed in November 2009. Through the development of a specialized residential care model, we aim to move one step closer to providing appropriate support to one of the most needing yet highly marginalized group of people.</ab>

        <ab>The Care is a complex activity, in evolution, and which produce new working opportunities for immigrant woman. This fact, and different care models, are different among cultures and we must to know them. Objetives: [sic] to characterize immigrant caregivers in a concrete population, to know if cultural differences are impediment for an adequate care. We use qualitative methodology based in interviews with open answers. The caregivers analyzed results to be all Latin-American woman. The house cleaning, cooking and management of chronic patients with specific cares, were difficult to learn, furthermore, the particular linguistic expression was another problem for the caregiving. The lack of knowledge of traditions no was problem for the caregivers. The caregivers had scarce qualification for dependent elders with associated pathologies, and they demand specific training. Overall, the caregivers perceive that they are well estimated, with an emotional and intercultural change between inmigrant [sic] caregivers and dependent elders. Notwithstanding, their differences must be knew for a adequate care.</ab>

        <ab>The rise in assisted living facilities (ALFs), coupled with residents with increasingly complex conditions, leads to unanticipated problems linked to medication management. The purpose of this study was to describe one western state's scope of medication-related problems, the relationship of problems to facility characteristics, and the nature of the problems using state surveyors' reports from routine inspections and complaint investigations. Of the 1,335 ALFs surveyed for 2007-2008, 61.8% received a medication-related citation. Of the 1,558 allegations, 60.3% involved individual residents, with 25.2% of these being medication related. The variability in state regulations obscures an accurate understanding of the problem. Complex medication regimens delivered by unlicensed assistive personnel place residents at risk for negative health consequences. More nursing oversight is critically needed to ensure the health and safety of the new generation of ALF residents.</ab>

        <ab>In 2007, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority introduced a full-time Nurse Practitioner into a 116-bed non-profit nursing home in downtown Winnipeg. This appointment provided an opportunity for the authors to explore the relationship between a Nurse Practitioner, acting as the primary care provider, and a single physician serving as the consultant for complex care issues. Outcomes were measured in terms of resident and family satisfaction, quality of care indications and cost effectiveness. Data were collected from preexisting quality indicators, including a resident/family satisfaction survey, as well as transfers to acute care and statistics on medication use. Unstructured interviews were also conducted with nursing staff and members of the interdisciplinary team. The following is an edited rendering of an article published in Canadian Nurse (Vol. 105, No.9; November, 2009) that describes the relationship that was established.</ab>

        <ab>The unique requirements of residents with diabetes in long-term care (LTC) facilities necessitate a protocol-driven, individualized approach to care. Established treatment guidelines for the management of diabetes are written with the general population in mind and, although the principles remain the same in LTC patients, clinical priorities and strategies may need to be modified, and glycemic goals should be balanced against quality of life. This article identifies and explores the institutional, staff, patient and medication-related factors that contribute to the complexity of delivering optimal diabetes care in the LTC setting, and focuses on how insulin analogs, and the pens used for their delivery, can simplify and improve care delivery while, in many cases, reducing institutional costs.</ab>

        <ab>This transverse, observational study of 119 elderly diabetics of both sexes enrolled in a diabetics program at a medium-complexity clinic of Brazil's national health system was carried out from September 2007 to August 2008, with a view to characterizing the participants according to the variables studied. It was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Piaui. Data were calculated using the EPI-INFO program, version 6.04d. The chisquare test was used to analyze the association between variables. It was found that 11.8% of the subjects lived alone; and 33.6% had been diabetic for more than 15 years. Most were women (69.7%), aged between 60 and 69 (58.0%) and overweight (60.5%). The respective rates of high and very high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) were 28.8% and 45.8%. The risk for CVD was associated with the values of weight, BMI, waist circumference and male sex.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Identifying occupational performance issues is an essential component of the occupational therapy process. Little attention has been paid to therapists' management of this aspect of geriatric practice. Purpose. This study explored therapists' approach to identifying occupational performance issues (OPI) with older adults. Methods. Information gathered from semistructured interviews was analyzed using Polkinghorne's (1995) analysis of narrative method. Findings. The study demonstrated how therapists prepare clients to engage in the OPi identification process; use interviewing strategies to build trust; and tap into client narratives to foster hope in occupational possibilities. Implications. Findings suggest that therapists require a complex set of highly skilled strategies to engage clients in OPI identification through tapping into aspects of the client's motivational influences, occupational histories, therapy expectations, and generational attitudes about aging. Further study is required to identify ways to overcome structural barriers to more occupational and narrative-based approaches to Identifying occupational performance issues.</ab>

        <ab>Background Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a worldwide approach to improving health care. There is, however, a shortage of studies examining whether or not newly graduated health care professionals are actually applying EBP in their daily work. Objectives To examine the application of EBP in clinical practice by registered nurses (RNs) 2 years post graduation and to explore whether the application of EBP differed with regard to the clinical settings where RNs were working. Method A cross-sectional design using a national sample. Data were collected in 2007 from 987 RNs (response rate 76%). Six items measuring respondents' self-reported extent of applying EBP were used. Results Of the 987 RNs, 19% formulated questions and performed searches in data bases, 56% used other information sources, 31% appraised the literature, 30% participated in practice development and 34% participated in evaluating clinical practice. A greater proportion of the RNs working in elder care applied EBP compared with the RNs working in hospitals, psychiatric care and primary care. Conclusions The RNs applied the components of EBP to a rather low extent 2 years post graduation despite EBP being an important objective in Swedish health care and educational programmes since the 1990s. These findings support other studies reporting the implementation of EBP in organizations as a complex and often slow process. The differences in the RNs extent of applying EBP in relation to their workplace indicate that contextual factors and the role of the RN in the organization are of importance for getting EBP into practice.</ab>

        <ab>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's introduction of a full-time nurse practitioner in a 116-bed non-profit nursing home provided an opportunity to explore a collaborative relationship between an NP acting as the primary care provider and a single physician serving as the consultant for complex care and after-hours care.The outcomes were measured in terms of resident and family satisfaction, quality of care indicators and cost effectiveness. Data were collected from pre-existing quality indicators, including a resident/family satisfaction survey, transfers to acute care, and medication use statistics. Unstructured interviews were also conducted with nursing staff and members of the interdisciplinary team.Dramatic improvements in medication use were observed, including a 17 per cent reduction in overall drug costs, a 55 per cent decrease in polypharmacy rates and a 63 per cent reduction in antipsychotic drug use. Transfers to emergency decreased by 20 per cent. Family satisfaction with the quality of health care provided to residents increased by 24 per cent.The collaborative practice of an NP with physician consultation is an effective way of delivering quality care to nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have complex management needs, and older people experience additional challenges in accessing care and maintaining function. Community nurses have a cital role in supporting older people with RA. Along with a description of the presentation, diagnosis and management of RA, this article outlines the particular challenges associated with RA in older people and how community nurses can contribute to assessing patients and helping to meet their needs for care.</ab>

        <ab>This quantitative study aimed to get to know the reasons that made aged people seek care at a basic health care outpatient clinic in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The data was collected in the patient files of 401 aged people attended by the health team. Initial reading of these records evidenced 4634 reasons that, after qualitative analysis, were grouped under complaints and requests for attention. In a second analysis, these data were classified as Rand Z, according to ICD-10. The R category -complaints expressed by signs and symptoms-equals 64% of the reasons, with 'pain' as the most common one. The other reasons, 36%, corresponded to the Z category, called requests for attention, represented by medicine prescription requests and attendance for health control. The study evidenced the complexity of this population's health care demands in the study region, showing the need for that service to develop specific and interdisciplinary care.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and can present with atypical signs and symptoms in elderly residents of nursing homes who often have altered functional and cognitive capacity representing a particularly challenging population to manage. Researchers conducted this study to better understand the current status of DM management in the long-term care facility from the perspective of the facility (use of guidelines, policies, and so forth) as well as that of a resident. METHODS: Thirteen nursing home facilities in 6 states were studied. A 13-question survey instrument was used to collect data from interviews of the directors of nursing and medical directors. A 26-question data collection form was also used to perform a retrospective chart review of studied residents. RESULTS: Data from the interview surveys showed that only 15% of facilities studied had a policy for the use of treatment algorithms to manage residents with DM. In addition, only 1 of 13 facilities had a quality improvement tool to evaluate compliance with current policies. In regard to hemoglobin A1C (A1C) testing, only 7.1% of facilities had a house policy in place. Furthermore, only 1% of studied residents had an established target for their A1C despite American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Geriatrics Society (AGS), and American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) guidelines recommending target values and monitoring frequency for A1C testing. The survey instrument also found that just 30.8% of facilities had a policy in place for blood glucose monitoring. Data from the chart review shows that only 57% of residents in this study were taking aspirin or clopidogel bisulfate, although prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and ADA in persons with diabetes who are older than 40. Data from this study indicate serious hypoglycemia occurs only occasionally in the nursing home because hypoglycemic episodes requiring hospitalization occurred in only 1% of studied residents. Furthermore, researchers found each of these residents were sent to the hospital only once in the preceding 6 months. One unanticipated finding of the study reports the incidence of delusions from patients' Minimum Data Set (MDS) was 87.63% compared with the national average of 3.7%. CONCLUSION: Data obtained through this study demonstrates numerous opportunities for improvement in the quality of care for nursing home residents with DM. A multidisciplinary approach is required to properly manage this complex disease in a challenging elderly population. The development of protocols and tools that embrace the latest strategies and treatment algorithms for the management of DM in the geriatric resident are necessary, while implementation of a quality improvement tool can help facilities to further improve on management of DM in the long-term care setting.</ab>

        <ab>The clinical approach toward elderly patients is often very complex and associated with an increased risk of medical errors. This case report is an example of how various objective (related to patient) and subjective (related to physicians) factors may influence the optimal diagnostic approach in elderly frail patients. We also discuss geriatric practice, which must be characterized by the intellectual honesty to refuse any sort of prejudices (such as ageism) and by the skill to navigate between the Scylla (ie, viewing clinical problems as unrelated to each other) and the Charibdy (ie, applying the Occam's razor principle) of the patient's complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Institutionalized responses to human care have been prone to developing unhelpful practices. Inquiries into malpractice often generate recommendations focusing on improving protocols or procedures, while neglecting the emotional experiences of both clients and staff. In this study, we aimed to address why and how complex and challenging emotions enter into care work. We explored the emotional world of a residential home for older people, using a psychosocial observational approach based on the Tavistock method. We have presented four themes: attacking-defending, living-dying, paralysis-movement and emptiness-fullness, which illustrate the complex existential challenges faced both by residents and staff in such a context. Our observations revealed how a range of defensive processes operated to protect the observer from experiencing painful feelings and emotions. Throughout the observation period an increasingly complex understanding developed of the emotional life of the home. This process was made possible by reflective supervision sessions. Our findings generate implications for the type of support that may be needed by care staff in such environments.</ab>

        <ab>We aimed to investigate the factors related to the ineffective control of the individual therapeutic regime in seniors presenting hypertension, relating them to some of their social-demographic characteristics. The descriptive research was developed with 30 elderly people from elderly nursing homes, with the application of a form check-list. It was verified that most was single, had no children, advanced age, catholic, low education degree and had no profession. The most present factors were the knowledge deficit (63,3%), complexity of the system health's attendance (43, 3%), distrust in relationship to the regime and/or health team (23, 3%) and noticed barriers (23,3%). We hope to motivate larger reflection on that problem, making possible the development of plans of more appropriate cares to the elderly reality, contributing to the effective control of their therapeutic regime.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To describe the social network of support for stomized elderly people, represented by eco-maps of the multiple supporting relationships according to the Complexity referential. METHODS: Case study, carried out in a stomatherapy service at a university hospital in the Southern region of Brazil. Patients were four elderly stomized people, three women and one man, interviewed at their homes. RESULTS: The importance of family support, friend/neighbor network, stomatherapy service with its workers/interns of other stomized people in the care for elderly stomized people became evident. Although the Basic Health Unit is the entry door for the Single Health System service, the subjects of this study sought care for their health needs in the hospital itself. CONCLUSION: The social network of support reveals itself through relationships and interactions inserted in the complex social system. Care relationships are present in this social network of support to elderly stomized people and their families.</ab>

        <ab>Consistent with the aging population, neuropsychologists are being asked with increased frequency to evaluate older adults. These assessments are often complicated by medical and psychiatric co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and complex psychosocial and legal issues that are frequently encountered in this population. The aim of this review article is to address the challenges neuropsychologists and other frontline clinicians often confront when evaluating older individuals. Specifically, we review psychiatric and medical co-morbidities, testing accommodations, diagnostic versus descriptive testing approaches, normative issues, polypharmacy, and reimbursement rates. Finally, future implications are discussed for advancing the neuropsychologist's role in evaluating and treating older individuals.</ab>

        <ab>Because long-term care residents often have chronic illnesses and complex care regimens, nutritional issues are common in these populations. Furthermore, management is complicated because some residents are terminally ill and under palliative care treatment plans that allow for dehydration and low oral intake. As a result, the medical management of nutrition is complex and challenging for medical providers caring for residents of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care settings. Quality nutritional practice in long-term care involves careful assessment of barriers to adequate nutrition; reduction of risk factors; attention to specialized diets, food presentation, and supplements, when appropriate; awareness of the importance of psychosocial and environmental issues; and consideration of the role of medication both as a cause and a therapeutic adjunct. Optimal practice at a facility level would involve a systematic approach to applying the best evidence-based approaches, with a focus on individualizing each resident's nutritional management.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: Assisted living (AL) residents are older and frailer than the patient population industry first envisioned they would be. As a result, these individuals require stronger medical care by the industry. It is believed that there is inadequate clinical guidance, systems, and protocols for these clinically complex residents. The AMDA-led Assisted Living Consensus Conference was organized to discuss the scope of this problem and conclude with steps to address those problems. PARTICIPANTS: This article is an edited review of the presentations and discussions held by the attendees, consisting of medical experts and assisted living representatives including consumer advocate groups, together with physicians, practitioners, and nurses caring for frail elders within the long-term care continuum. This conference was held in Washington, DC, on October 26, 2006. RECOMMENDATIONS: There are a growing number of AL residents who are frail and have multiple chronic conditions. Effective ways to address these issues and protect the safety and quality of life for these individuals are needed. While AL has moved from a hospitality model to a model that includes significant medical components, there is a need to further flesh out and standardize these components in AL. Identification of specific projects in each area were discussed at the conference, such as the development of standard assessment tools and clinical protocols to improve the clinical care residents receive in this setting. VALIDATION: All of the prevalidating opinions were summarized and are included in this article.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: Behavior problems are common in dementia, yet little is known about how physicians deal with these problems in practice. This article reports on a survey asking physicians to describe, with respect to the last nursing home resident with dementia they treated for behavior problems, the behaviors observed, assessment methods used, suspected etiology of the problem, types of intervention, and their reaction to the intervention process. DESIGN: This is a descriptive study presenting responses to a Web-based questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 110 physicians providing services to nursing home residents. MEASUREMENTS: Physicians answered a close-ended questionnaire with open-ended 'other' options concerning symptoms, methods of assessment, suspected etiological factors, and interventions to describe the last nursing home resident they treated for behavior problems associated with dementia. RESULTS: Resisting care was the most frequently reported symptom (71%). Physicians were most likely to attribute the behavior problems to the indirect effects of dementia on the ability to remember, communicate, and comprehend (67%). Most (87%) reported using more than one method for treating these problems. Rate of reported use of psychotropic drugs (80%) was slightly higher than that for nonpharmacological methods (75%), with the majority (61%) reporting use of both of these methods. Standardized instruments were not used in assessment. Forty percent of the participants reported feeling satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention they provided, and close to a third (32%) reported feeling frustrated with the intervention process. CONCLUSION: The data underscore the complexity in the treatment of behavior problems. Despite federal regulations limiting their use, the potential for side effects, and ambivalence toward such treatment, psychotropic drugs are still used for the majority of nursing home residents with behavior problems associated with dementia. On the other hand, physicians report employing nonpharmacological methods to a closely similar extent, although their role in the implementation of these treatments is less clear. Further work is needed to clarify physicians' involvement in and decision to use nonpharmacological interventions.</ab>

        <ab>The complexity and diversity of the needs of older people in care homes presents challenges to those responsible for caring for residents, in particular nursing and care assistant staff providing the majority of direct care. This study examines the degree of knowledge and confidence of these staff in caring for people with dementia and seeks to identify factors which can contribute to greater confidence. It reveals that although staff knowledge of dementia is reasonable, confidence in dealing with related situations is lower. Results also suggest that training can positively influence staff confidence in dealing with behaviour associated with the condition, recognizing that it is one of many factors influencing performance as a paid carer. These findings are discussed in terms of the quality of care provided to residents with dementia, the forms such training might take and the importance of a work environment which facilitates on-the-job training.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: There is a large population of elderly medical inpatients with co-existent medical and mental health disorders who pose a significant management challenge for medical, nursing and allied staff. Our hospital has a joint elderly medicine-psychiatry unit to cater for this patient group; this article reviews how this unit was set up and presents a representative sample of inpatients. Results: The mean age was 81 years with a female preponderance. The mean length of stay was 44 days. The commonest medical conditions were cerebrovascular disease, urinary tract infections, chest infections and falls. The commonest mental health diagnoses were cognitive impairment, delirium and depression. The mortality rate was 21%; of the remainder, 55% were discharged to long-term care, 40% returned home and 5% were transferred to the local psychiatric hospital. Discussion: This cohort of elderly patients has complex medical, nursing and therapy needs in addition to complex discharge planning needs. Our unit has a shared care approach, with joint responsibility shared by a consultant in Medicine for the Elderly and a Consultant in Old Age Psychiatry. This, in combination with a multidisciplinary team approach, provides an effective means of delivering care to this patient group. Conclusion: A joint elderly medicine-old age psychiatry ward provides a high standard of care for elderly patients with co-existent physical and mental health needs. We hope that the information presented in this article will be of use to those hoping to set up a similar unit in their own hospitals.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Translating research into practice and policy is a complex process that links the research enterprise and health care delivery system of the United States. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Partnerships for Quality (PFQ) initiative expanded the scope of research translation beyond clinical practice, highlighting the role of strategic partners. A work group of AHRQ grantees developed a framework for systematic evaluation of the impact of strategic partnerships on research translation.Methods:The evaluation framework posits a hierarchy of impacts that cumulatively lead to observable patient outcomes. The evaluation framework captures (1) health care outcomes improvement, (2) clinical practice changes, (3) policies, procedures, and protocols, and (4) research and knowledge. After the framework and tool were subjected to face-validity critique among PFQ investigators, the concept of synergy was added. PFQ investigators pilot-tested the evaluation framework, and the PFQ tool was refined further.Results:Early feedback from PFQ grantees suggested that the framework is generalizable and potentially useful to guide investigators in capturing impacts of their work that might otherwise go unrecognized or trivialized.Discussion:The PFQ Evaluation Tool, a pragmatic approach for evaluating the impact of partnership-driven translation projects, provides a comprehensive evaluation of impacts, including synergistic outcomes.</ab>

Some argue that these challenges, exacerbated by limited funding, maintaining increased community expectations and the need for quality health care outcomes, may be overcome by exploring alternate models of care. These ideas have led health planners to re conceptualise contemporary philosophies of care with the current emphasis on multidisciplinary teams and a person-centred approach to care. This paper presents a model for the care of older people in the acute care setting. The concepts for the development of the model were derived from the international literature. In the model the care of older people is underpinned by a philosophy of person-centredness. The complex nature of care is represented along with those factors that enable a person-centred approach to be taken. The functions of the model in practice are highlighted and discussion of how it is being implemented within the acute care sector outlined.</ab>

        <ab>The Australian prison population, like the population in general, is ageing. Services in both areas have had to evolve to care for the increased proportion of aged people, especially those with complex challenges to their health and well being.The proposed construction of hostel services for aged inmates in New South Wales is a recent innovation. Although not reported in the literature to have previously occurred in Australia, such hostels are becoming increasingly common in North America, although there has been no reported rigorous evaluation of outcomes.This paper discusses a proposed study to evaluate a prison aged care hostel in New South Wales and provides a plausible research framework within which to evaluate prison hostel outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Emergent care is a prominent feature in the complex matrix of care transitions for vulnerable elders. This article evaluates local patterns of emergent care transport using ambulance transport data for the year 2003, analyzed by residential setting (independent senior apartments, licensed residential care and nursing homes). Significant differences were found between categories and between facilities within categories (p &lt; .001). The more than three-fold difference in ambulance transport rate between nursing homes reinforces the need to recognize these transitions as quality indicators. Differences between senior apartments and licensed residential care settings provide initial insight suggesting opportunities for quality improvement in these community settings.</ab>

        <ab>Planning for care of the older adult is especially important during critical illness states when recovery can be uncertain. Patients often present to the ICU with complex illness; therefore, targeting measures to prevent functional status decline is important for hospitalized elders, who are at risk for prolonged recovery from critical illness. Addressing and planning for the needs of hospitalized elders, including the integration of strategies to target independence, is a key area of focus for nursing care. This article provides a review of the literature on strategies for promoting independence during acute illness and includes recommendations for practice, education, research, and policy to promote optimal care for hospitalized elders in acute care.

        <ab>Caring for the elderly in today's acute care setting can be a challenging and complex process. Regardless of whether the interventions provided by caregivers are physical or psychosocial, one of the basic tenets of caring for elderly is to uphold their dignity. The concept of dignity is defined and challenges to maintaining dignity for elderly in the acute care setting are described. Strategies and recommendations for education, practice, research, and policy development are outlined to assist nurses in ensuring that elders receive the dignified care that they deserve.

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to assist nurse researchers around the world in addressing data quality issues by guiding them through an example of a complex multicultural study of caregivers who take care of elders in their home. Using data flow diagrams for visualization, methods of data quality management are outlined in the stages of subject recruitment, data gathering, and data monitoring. Various strategies are used to improve the quality of such data as the sample, information on consent forms, raw interview data, and the electronic data file. These strategies are aimed at avoiding various sources of human error, error in sampling, non-response and coverage error, as well as error of measurement and processing. Ultimately, this exemplar demonstrates an approach to realistic decision making and may offer nurse researchers incentives for discussion of their own data quality plans. Since immigrant population groups are expanding in many countries across the world, nurse researchers who seek to include such ethnic groups in their studies may find the multiethnic considerations included in the discussion of additional value.</ab>

        <ab>Two-thirds of patients requiring inpatient acute hospital care are aged over 65. Older people also have a greater need for the use of health and social care (Department of Health (DH) 2001). It is therefore no surprise that the majority of patients cared for by nurses care in general wards are older people. It is vital that health professionals caring for patients, in all ward settings, have the knowledge and skills to care for the complex needs of older people. This article describes a project carried out at East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, to address aspects of general hospital care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>As the complexity of care increases for hospitalized older adults, the clinical nurse specialist is essential for ongoing development of nursing practice and care standards. This article describes the Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) model for interdisciplinary management of older adults and clinical specialist responsibilities within this interdisciplinary team. Within the model, clinical care specialists utilize clinical expertise and consultation skills reflecting three spheres of practice related to care of high-risk community-dwelling older adults admitted an acute medical unit. The goal for this patient group is to achieve medical stability while preserving maximum functioning. The Acute Care of the Elderly team members include primary nurses (staff nurses), physicians, clinical care specialists, therapies, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, and a discharge planner. Under the leadership of the primarily nurse, the team develops a comprehensive care and discharge plan, implemented across a care continuum. Using protocols and working together, the team delivers cost-effective, coordinated care that promotes process improvement resulting in practice that is in alignment with current standards of care.</ab>

        <ab>This review demonstrates essential issues to consider when caring for older trauma patients, including baseline physical status, mental health, comorbidities, and risk factors for sequelae and future injuries. The impact of a traumatic injury on older adults is complex. Issues of normal aging, functional status, chronic health conditions, and response to treatment affect health care and related decisions. Studies that have examined outcomes for older trauma patients to date have been mainly descriptive or confined to a single institution, limiting our ability to generalize. Other studies, using large data sets, have provided some information regarding possible primary prevention strategies, yet have limitations in the individual level detail collected. Nevertheless, this review also demonstrates the dearth of available evidence-based recommendations that provides support to treatment protocols in this complex and diverse patient population. The lack of an evidence base to use in the management of older trauma patients demonstrates the critical need for research in this rapidly growing population. An example of one such area includes the use of pulmonary artery catheters in older trauma patients. Although evidence to date suggests that pulmonary artery catheters are of benefit in the management of patients with physiologic compromise, it is unclear whether using these published cardiac output management recommendations leads to improved outcomes. In light of newly published data suggesting equivocal benefit from use of pulmonary artery catheters, with increased side effects, this controversy is an important area for future research. Critical care nurses, with their emphasis on multidisciplinary, holistic practice, can expand their influence as essential members of the interdisciplinary team caring for older trauma patients by cultivating geriatric specialty knowledge. Older trauma patients would benefit greatly from this type of specialty nursing care during all phases of the recovery trajectory, particularly in terms of adequate symptom management and prevention of sequelae, as well as with timely and appropriate initiation of consultative services. Using the intersection of primary and secondary prevention as the overall guide for practice, critical care nurses and other health care providers who possess an understanding of aging processes and comorbid conditions can significantly improve outcomes for older adults with traumatic injuries.

        <ab>Success stories of disease management programs have heightened the interest of healthcare payors and providers in the adoption of disease management principles for their aging members. However, caution is needed for rapid adoption, as several crucial characteristics within the aging population may clash with disease management principles.When developing disease management programs, the characteristics of the frail elderly must be considered, otherwise there may be a potential for misapplication of disease management principles. For example: (i) frailty is a state rather than a condition; (ii) the complex needs of frail elders are less straightforward and therefore make it more difficult to apply a formalized set of treatment guidelines; (iii) the mental health and cognitive issues may challenge the reliance on self-management; and (iv) the involvement of caregivers may broaden the scope well beyond clinical care.This article summarizes several successes of disease management programs and examines the critical components leading to their success, including patient self-management and education, better provider coordination, risk stratifying tools, and the use of evidence-based guidelines.In considering the possibility of using disease management principles to care for the frail elderly population, this article demonstrates that more research, discussions, and practical applications are needed prior to widespread program implementation. The frail condition experienced by many older adults is not just the sum of several disease conditions; therefore, merely combining several disease management programs to serve this population may prove to be less effective than is hoped. Hence the pursuit of more effective approaches to providing care for an aging population continues. Disease management for the frail is most effective when the treatment integrates both the social and medical needs of the patient and caregivers. It is also essential to manage the patient's multiple diseases even though the patient selection and primary focus may be on the primary disease.</ab>

        <ab>The community-based internist and geriatric primary care physicians (PCPs) or medical doctors (MDs) have long been the most prevalent providers of primary care to populations who have chronic illness and/or are elderly in the United States. This article addresses the strategies for disease management (DM) that physicians in nonmature health care markets are utilizing to address unmet needs and suggestions for improved collaboration to provide improved evidence-based care. Other primary care providers are involved in the care of populations who have chronic illness and/or are elderly (e.g., advanced practice nurses and physician assistants). This article focuses on physician practice and current market realities affecting physicians to provide DM in populations that have chronic illness and/or are elderly (need complex care management).</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent of agreement between nursing home residents' (or their proxies') reports of pain presence and intensity as derived from an interview questionnaire and the Minimum Data Set (MDS) nearest to the interview date. DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of the 2 data sources on pain measurements. SETTING: Nursing homes included in evaluation projects of EverCare program and Minnesota Senior Health Options. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents (n = 3100) were grouped based on the type of respondent answering the interview questionnaire: resident, family proxy, or staff proxy. MEASUREMENTS: We used kappa statistics and multinomial logit regression to examine agreement between the interview questionnaire and the MDS on pain presence and intensity. RESULTS: Presence of pain was reported 1.3 to 1.8 times more often on the questionnaire, depending on the respondent group. Agreement on the presence of pain was slight to fair (kappa = 0.17 to 0.28) between the MDS and the questionnaire. There was slight agreement on pain intensity (kappa = 0.13 to 0.18). The family proxy respondent group showed the largest discrepancy between questionnaire and the MDS in reporting of pain presence and intensity. The staff proxy respondent group had better agreement on pain intensity than did the other respondent groups, but it achieved only slight agreement (kappa = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Detecting and quantifying pain in nursing home residents is complex. Pain information is best obtained directly from residents; observations should be standardized. The MDS should be revised accordingly.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To assess general practitioners' (GPs') attitudes to urinary incontinence in elderly patients and their experiences in the application of the Dutch College of General Practitioners' guideline in daily practice. DESIGN: Two existed groups of six GPs working in villages and seven GPs working in urban practices. METHOD: Two focus-group discussions with recording of discussions and transcription. Transcripts were analysed by two independent researchers. RESULTS: During the discussions three main themes of attitudes came forward: (1) therapeutic nihilism of GPs and low motivation of patients, (2): GPs experienced lack of time because of difficulties in explaining the therapy and because of impaired mobility of older patients, (3) because of the complexity of the problem and co-morbidity, GPs as well as patients were reluctant to treat the UI. The most remarkable findings in the application of the guideline were: (1) because of the barriers mentioned above, physical examination did not take place in spite of GPs' conviction as to the benefit of it; (2) GPs' knowledge of treatment options in the elderly with UI is substandard. CONCLUSION: Several patient (comorbidity, impaired mobility, low motivation, and acceptance of the problem) and GP factors (therapeutic nihilism, lack of time and knowledge) interfere with good management of UI in the elderly.</ab>

        <ab>This project had these objectives: 1) understand the reality of the family care system for an elderly person suffering from cerebral-vascular accident (CVA), 2) implement an aid to the family care system for an elderly person suffering from cerebral-vascular accident (CVA) from a holistic perspective on health. The sample for this investigation was composed by five families which were intentionally selected, with whom the authors shared the care of an elderly person suffering from CVA in their homes over a six month period. Based on concepts having a holistic reference about health formulated by Capra, the authors drew p the development of a methodology for research and action which has a participatory observation and a Drawing-Record procedural technique for the production of data. These data were subjected to a thematic analysis which made it possible to identify three main themes: 1) the main caretaker as the focus of the family care system; 2) the family care system as a context which has complexities and singularities; 3) the holistic nature of the family care system for an elderly per-son suffering from cerebral-vascular accident (CVA).</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, I expand the scope of the two preceding papers and suggest emerging opportunities and needs relevant to future inquiry about place and older people. I cover these in three sections. The first section suggests several topical areas for inquiry: stress and health, social epidemiology and healthy ageing. The second section focuses on theoretical developments that could be extended to further inform research on place and older people. I discuss the concepts of therapeutic landscapes and home as well as actor-network theory and pragmatism. The last section briefly addresses methodological needs. I contend that while place is a complex object of inquiry, it is vital to older adults' well-being and offers many interesting and interdisciplinary avenues for important scholarly endeavour in nursing and related fields.</ab>

        <ab>Deconditioning is a complex process of physiological change following a period of inactivity, bedrest or sedentary lifestyle. It results in functional losses in such areas as mental status, degree of continence and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. It is frequently associated with hospitalization in the elderly. The most predictable effects of deconditioning are seen in the musculoskeletal system and include diminished muscle mass, decreases of muscle strength by two to five per cent per day, muscle shortening, changes in periarticular and cartilaginous joint structure and marked loss of leg strength that seriously limit mobility. The decline in muscle mass and strength has been linked to falls, functional decline, increased frailty and immobility. The authors describe a three-pronged strategy to combat deconditioning that includes a model of care appropriate to the growing population of elderly clients, the creation of an 'elder-friendly' hospital environment and an exercise program.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this review is to discuss how healthcare professionals, and particularly nursing practice, impact upon pain management with older people (65 years and over), following surgery. The review commences with an introduction presenting why this is an important area to consider. Current available literature and findings from an ethnographic study which was designed to examine peri-operative pain-management practices with older people will then be discussed to highlight the key issues of pain assessment and management. Three overarching themes; (1) pain assessment (2) knowledge/strategies to cope with pain and (3) organization of care (culture and context), will guide the discussion. It is suggested that comprehensive pain assessment, proficient communication and multidisciplinary working, are essential to improve pain-management practices. The paper demonstrates some of the multiple and complex factors that affect the older person's pain experience and identifies possible developmental work in this field.</ab>

        <ab>This article describes the Prescription Intervention and Lifelong Learning (PILL) program, a three-year pilot project to develop in-home pharmacy care services to clients of a community-based social service agency. Clients who were homebound, at least 62 years of age, and taking at least five medications were eligible for inclusion. Potential participants were referred by care managers to the pharmacist, who conducted an in-home evaluation of the medication regimen and assessed the risk for medication-related problems. The pharmacist provided instruction for hypertension and diabetes mellitus self-monitoring, extensive medication counseling for clients with complex medications regimens, and conducted other activities to promote positive medicationrelated outcomes. The clients served were primarily female, between 70 and 90 years of age, and almost one-half lived alone. They were taking an average of more than nine medications daily, and had at least one chronic disease. The clients of the social service agency were highly vulnerable to medication-related problems and were in need of in-home pharmacy care services.</ab>

        <ab>Effective post-hospital home medication management among older adults is a convoluted, error-prone process. Older adults, whose complex medication regimens are often changed at hospital discharge, are susceptible to medication-related problems (e.g. Adverse Drug Events or ADEs) as they resume responsibility for managing their medications at home. Human error theory frames the discussion of multi-faceted, interacting factors including care system functions, like discharge medication teaching that contribute to post-hospital ADEs. The taxonomy and causes of post-hospital ADEs and related risk factors are reviewed, as we describe in high-risk older adults a population that may benefit from targeted interventions. Potential solutions and future research possibilities highlight the importance of interdisciplinary teams, involvement of clinical pharmacists, use of transitional care models, and improved use of informational technologies.</ab>

        <ab>At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.</ab>

        <ab>In England, the theme of promoting collaborative working between social and primary health care remains high on the policy agenda. The underlying assumption, largely untested, is that a greater degree of structural integration benefits service users. This paper reports the findings from a feasibility study comparing two models of joint working and examining the relative impact of personal characteristics, service use and co-location on the likelihood of older people remaining in the community. Baseline standardised interviews with 79 older people aged 75 + with complex needs in two social services departments were carried out following referral, covering social circumstances, physical and mental health and services received, with follow-up interviews after six months. Contacts between social workers and primary care were tracked. The findings suggest that co-location does not necessarily lead to substantially closer interprofessional working in terms of greater contact between social workers and GPs or social workers and community nurses. Factors affecting outcome were degree of cognitive impairment, intensity of home care received and whether the older person lived alone. Whatever the model of collaborative working, its effects on remaining in the community must be assessed in the wider context of the characteristics and services received by older people.</ab>

        <ab>This study sought to develop and test a set of criteria to distinguish elders at high risk of an untoward medication event within community nursing caseloads. A descriptive correlational design was used to identify relevant risk factors for elders. Data on medication knowledge, regime, management abilities, and adherence were obtained from 111 elders receiving community nursing care. Four predictors-12 or more doses of medications per day, more than one prescriber, caregiver available, and sometimes forgetting to take medications-of complexity (R(2) explaining 39% of the variance) and adherence (R(2) explaining 49% of the variance) were identified as potential factors that subsequently confirmed a discrete group of high risk elders. The use of these four risk factors or screening criteria is recommended for older people within community nursing caseloads.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Multiple hospital admissions, especially those related to chronic disease, represent a particular challenge to the acute health care sector in Australia. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a nurse-led chronic disease management model of transitional care reduced readmissions to acute care. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental controlled trial. SETTING: A large tertiary metropolitan teaching hospital. Participants: 166 general medical patients aged &gt; or = 65 years with either a history of readmissions to acute care or multiple medical comorbidities. INTERVENTION: Implementation of a chronic disease management model of transitional care aimed at improving patient management and reducing readmissions to acute care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Readmission rates and emergency department presentation rates at 3-and 6-month follow up. Secondary outcome measures include quality of life, discharge destination, and primary health care service utilisation. RESULTS: There was no difference in readmission rates, emergency department presentation rates, quality of life, discharge destination or primary health care service utilisation. The difficulties inherent in evaluating this type of multifactorial intervention are discussed and consideration is given to patient factors, the difficulty of influencing readmission rates, and local system issues. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study reflect the tension that exists between implementing multifaceted integrated health service programs and attempting to evaluate them within complex and changing environments using robust research methodologies.</ab>

        <ab>The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure population.</ab>

        <ab>This series of articles has examined how health care organizations (ie, organized or integrated care systems or large provider groups that receive payment under either a capitated or fee-for-service basis) can improve the quality of transitions among care venues for patients with complex care needs. Part III addresses the need to align financial and structural incentives to improve patient flow across care venues, and recommends some steps organizations can take to initiate a quality improvement strategy for transitional care.</ab>

        <ab>Research-based information about the prevalence of other serious medical conditions in people with dementia has become available only recently, and the true prevalence is not known, primarily because many people with dementia do not have a diagnosis. The existing information is sufficient, however, to show that these other conditions are common in people with dementia. It is also clear that coexisting medical conditions increase the use and cost of health care services for people with dementia, and conversely, dementia increases the use and cost of health care services for people with other serious medical conditions. Nurses and other healthcare professionals should expect to see these relationships in their elderly patients. They should know how to recognize possible dementia and assess, or obtain an assessment of, the patient's cognitive status. They should expect the worsening of cognitive and related symptoms in acutely ill people with dementia and try to eliminate factors that cause this worsening, to the extent possible, while assuring the family that the symptoms are likely to improve once the acute phase of illness or treatment is over. Families, nurses, and other health care professionals are challenged by the complex issues involved in caring for a person with both dementia and other serious medical conditions. Greater attention to these issues by informed and thoughtful clinicians will improve outcomes for the people and their family and professional caregivers.

        <ab>Alzheimer's disease and other chronic dementing conditions remain formidable challenges for individuals, their families, and health care providers. In addition to the challenges inherent in the sheer numbers affected, the complex and relatively unpredictable progression of these disorders complicates the delivery of interventions for health care providers. Identifying genetic and environmental etiologic factors and understanding their relationship to the natural history of dementia brings health care providers closer to more effective pharmacologic treatments and perhaps cure. In the meantime, genomics research brings professional nurses closer to providing more specific, perhaps individualized, anticipatory guidance and to providing nonpharmacologic interventions in a genotype-directed way to patients with chronic dementing conditions. The emergence of a genomics-based health care environment presents an opportunity and a challenge for gerontological nurse clinicians, educators, and researchers--an opportunity to evolve practice toward a higher level of specificity and effectiveness and a challenge to do so in a equitable and sensitive manner that improves health and quality of life for all served.

        <ab>With the intense focus on Internet-based applications and other high-tech tools, the value of face-to-face encounters can get overlooked. However, Baltimore, MD-based XLHealth has made the 'in-person' visit a cornerstone of its disease management approach to geriatric care. Newer remote monitoring tools are made use of as well, but XLHealth developers clearly believe that face-to-face contact is an important component of their overall success -- particularly in the case of complex older patients.</ab>

        <ab>Family carers are a major source of help and assistance to the persons they provide care for. They are also major contributors to the welfare system, balancing the national health care expenditure. Increasing attention, in research as well as government policy, is being paid to their role as informal caregivers. Support to family carers seems to be a new 'buzzword' in Swedish Government policy. However, supporting family carers may prove to be a more complex endeavour than one initially might be led to believe. Support could here be understood as any services, assistances, education, information, attitudes, and lay or professional person's provision for the benefit of the family carer. The aim of this systematic review was to identify modes of, and scientific evidence on, support for family carers of cohabiting elderly persons. The method followed a seven-step model: a focused research question was formulated creating a base for deriving search words and inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies. Systematic database searches identified several studies some of which were retrieved, critically appraised and classified by two independent reviewers. A total of 26 articles were finally included, revealing that family carers fear social isolation and wish to network in groups with peers, either for social or for learning needs purposes. Family carers also desire respite care. However, it is unclear whether they actually benefit from any of the above or how service provision should be attempted.</ab>

        <ab>This work wants to discuss the experiencies lived in the Nursing Consults to the elders developed in a Public University, from the conception that the elders has about the care of themselves. The subjects were 37 elders from the Programa Interdisciplinar de Geriatria e Gerontologia (Interdisciplinary Program of Geriatrics and Gerontology) of the Federal Fluminense University - Brasil. The data collection techniques were the semi structured interview and the free association of ideas. The results indicated wich care are fundamental for the elders, and it were categorized in four groups: Professional care; maintainer care; expressive care; care with the self-image and the self-valorization. It concluded that the elders established their own priority of care that not always respect the hierarchy offered by Mas/ow for the basic human needs. It emphasizes the importance of the nurse identify and understand the relations between the different basic needs for the elders and that is, in fact, fundamental care for this group. The old clients' assessment involve complex and varied aspects. The important is identify the positive aspects, the limitations and the subjective aspects that interfere in the care of oneself, so that result in fundamental nursing care for the elder.

        <ab>Frail older patients-unlike younger persons in the health care system or even well elders-require complex care. Most frail older patients have multiple chronic illnesses. Optimum care cannot be achieved by following the paradigm of ongoing traditional health care, which emphasizes disease and cure. Because no one health care professional can possibly have all of the specialized skills required to implement such a model of health care delivery, interdisciplinary team care has evolved. This paper describes the roles of the participating team members in the context of interdisciplinary care for frail older adults. In addition, the challenges that occur when Geriatric Interdisciplinary (ID) Teams involved in providing care to frail older patients are identified and discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Managing the care of geriatric patients with one disease management program alone often does not actually improve medical or financial outcomes. Experts who treat geriatric patients say the complexity of medical arid psychosocial needs is nearly always greater than the sum of individual medical problems. In a unique model of care, geriatric patients and their caregivers are finding support for medical and daily living creeds -- a combination that ultimately allows the patient to maintain functional ability for longer periods of time and remain in the home.</ab>

        <ab>The care of older adults offers many challenges and many rewards. As we move into the twenty-first century, health care providers will increasingly be called on to provide high-quality, comprehensive care for seniors. Health care professionals, including physicians, nurses, podiatrists, and therapists, need to remain current in the breadth of special issues facing the elderly. Though many seniors are fully functional, healthy, and active, a growing number, especially of the very old, suffer from multiple chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and functional dependency. Though younger patients typically present for medical care, which is focused on a single problem, seniors often have multiple, interacting conditions and competing agendas for their medical care. Professionals need to be prepared to recognize the complex interplay of aging, illness, medications, and social stressors that affect the health of their patients. Today's health care providers, more than ever, must learn to function as members of health care teams, assembled around the specific needs of individual patients in a variety of settings. Foot care is a critical part of the health of older adults, primarily to maintain an active lifestyle and secondarily as a marker of a variety of systemic diseases. Podiatrists are important members of this team and have a special role to play in the diagnosis and treatment of disease as well as helping seniors maintain a high quality of life and maximum function.

        <ab>This paper examines the marginalisation of nursing discourse, which followed the enactment of the Aged Care Act 1997. This neo-reform period in aged care, dominated by theories of economic rationalism, enshrined legislation based upon market principles and by implication, the provision of care at the cheapest possible price. This paper exposes some of the gaps in the neo-reform period and challenges the assertion that the amalgamation of nursing homes and hostels in such an environment can provide better quality of care and life for residents. It argues that this amalgamation entails a transformation towards a social model of care and fails to address the professional healthcare needs of the acutely sick and complex extreme old person and makes evident new gaps in the provision of aged care services. The paper proceeds to present strategies where the future for nursing practice in aged care necessarily involves a judicious balancing of individual cases alongside economic prescriptions of care and ever-changing public policy initiatives. It concludes that this can be achieved through a more interactive public, professional and advocacy discourse. The methodology involves extensive analysis of public documents including media, academic journals, government reports and interviews with recognised leaders in the field of aged care. The study utilises a critical interpretative framework consistent with the logic of Michel Foucault.</ab>

        <ab>The aging of the baby boomers comes at a time of a growing nursing workforce shortage: registered nurses, nurse aides, and nursing faculty. Older adults have multiple physical, social, and psychological conditions, making the assessment, planning, and delivery of health care more complex than that of younger adults. Not surprisingly, this age group also utilizes the majority of health services in the country. Thus, most nurses will provide care to older adults in a variety of settings. However, the majority of nurses have little to no background in geriatric nursing. These multiple forces: aging population with complex needs, nursing work force shortage, and lack of geriatric knowledge, along with fewer resources, will have a grave impact on health care in this country in the near future. This article reviews issues related to an aging population, the projected nursing workforce shortage, and the lack of geriatric nursing education; it concludes with suggestions for future health care delivery to the geriatric population in the US Copyright (c) 2003 Online Journal of Issues of Nursing.

        <ab>Disruptive behavior in nursing home residents such as noncompliance, aggression, demanding and dependent behavior, and wandering consumes an inordinate amount of administrative and staff time. Frequently, staffs behave in a reactive manner that exacerbates symptoms. This chapter argues for a nonreactive approach that views disruptive behavior from a systemic perspective. This in turn leads to more strategic solutions that better fit the complex forces that shape the behavior. At times these solutions are counterintuitive. Clinical situations discussed include demanding behavior, hypochondriacal behavior and dementia.</ab>

        <ab>The care of older people in Sweden has undergone several major reorganisations during the past decade. The healthcare organisation, governed by the county councils, previously had the responsibility of providing care services for elderly people. However, the local municipalities have taken over that duty since 1992. The obligation of the health services is now restricted solely to medical issues. The present study focused on the understanding that politicians and managers have about caring for older people. A section of Stockholm with a population of 320 000 inhabitants was studied. The authors hypothesised that differences in understanding might have an impact on the services of care which older people receive. Interviews were conducted with eight leading politicians and 12 managers responsible for elderly care services. The main focus of inquiry concerned the participants' understanding of caring for older people. The results indicate that politicians and managers in elderly care sometimes have divergent views on how the care should be developed and produced to best serve older people. Five themes of understanding elderly care services and eight contradictory statements among the respondents were identified. A follow-up group session with the respondents was conducted to discuss the results of the interviews. The different ways of understanding elderly care services showed a complex and fragmented organisation lacking clear goals, structures and leadership. However, the authors found a willingness among respondents to collaborate with one another, as well as indications of positive attitudes toward improving healthcare, domiciliary and nursing care of older people.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: With an aging population and public policies that limit accessible and affordable formal care services, informal caregivers, largely women, will continue bearing the overwhelming responsibility for home and long-term care services provision. OBJECTIVES: This study examined gender differences among informal caregivers in caregiving activities, intensity, challenges, and coping strategies and assessed the differential effects of caregiving on their physical and emotional well-being. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted between May and September 1998. SUBJECTS: Telephone interviews were conducted with a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 1002 informal caregivers. MEASURES: Caregivers' sociodemographic, and physical and emotional health characteristics; caregiving type and intensity; formal care support; difficulty with care provision; unmet needs; coping strategies; and the care recipients' health and relationship with caregiver were examined between the genders using descriptive and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Compared with men caregivers, women caregivers were significantly more likely to be 65 years of age or older, black, married, better educated, unemployed, and primary caregivers; provide more intensive and complex care; have difficulty with care provision and balancing caregiving with other family and employment responsibilities; suffer from poorer emotional health secondary to caregiving; and cope with caregiving responsibilities by forgoing respite participation and engaging in increased religious activities. CONCLUSIONS: Informal caregivers, particularly women, are under considerable stress to provide a large volume of care with little support from formal caregivers. Program planners, policy makers, and formal care providers must act together to provide accessible, affordable, and innovative support services and programs that reduce family caregiving strain.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND:increasing numbers of elderly patients are admitted to hospital. Ensuring that they are given appropriate and timely access to the range of hospital and community medical, rehabilitation and social care facilities has become more difficult due to the complexity of management options now available, and limited senior medical staff time. METHODS:we established a scheme in which specialist nurses made first assessments of all inter-departmental referrals to a hospital department of geriatric medicine. We evaluated the scheme prospectively using process and outcome data. RESULTS:2825 new patients were seen by two nurses in the first two years, an average of 5.4 per weekday (range 0-17). Mean time from admission to referral was 9 days. Most referrals were seen within 1 day. Mean total length of hospital stay was 43 days (range 1-351). Seven percent died on the referring ward, and 31% were discharged directly from the referring ward. Almost half were accepted for in-patient rehabilitation. Sixty percent of these were discharged home. Thirteen percent were transferred to an acute geriatric medical or stroke ward. One-quarter of these died. Senior medical review was requested in 8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:nurses could select patients suitable for rehabilitation, identify those requiring on-going acute in-patient care, and make arrangements for supported direct discharges where appropriate. This model facilitated access to a wide array of discharge and community support schemes, and supported the efficient use of consultant time.</ab>

        <ab>Most people in developed countries will live with a serious, eventually fatal, chronic condition for months or years before dying; yet, the delivery of health care services has only just recently begun adapting to this reality. Quality improvement methods have been effective in helping clinical services to make substantial changes quickly. Quality improvement requires stating an aim, measuring success, and testing possible improvements. The testing of changes requires a clinical team to Plan, Do, Study, and Act on new insights (the "PDSA cycle"). Repeated PDSA cycles generate deep understanding of complex systems and make sustainable improvements rapidly. This paper discusses a composite case study in a nursing home setting, which builds on experience with multisite collaborative efforts and introduces quality improvement methods in the context of end-of-life care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: African-American elders were recruited from a transitional unit after hospitalization and tracked for 6 months in the community after discharge to (a) examine functional outcomes on the unit and in the community and (b) identify patterns of participation in daily life activities. The International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH-2) framework provided the structure to examine the connections among body systems, functional outcomes, and social participation for this population that has been underrepresented in past research. METHOD: A mixed design combined qualitative and quantitative methods, including qualitative interviews to document personal adaptive experience, a standardized functional assessment to identify functional outcomes, and a structured format to record activity participation. RESULTS: Findings revealed that 11 of the 17 participants improved their functional outcomes after discharge. Three patterns of activity participation identified were self-care, self-care and household management, and mixed activities. Contextual influences were diverse family support arrangements. CONCLUSION: Complex relationships were identified among body systems, functional outcomes, and daily life activities that were influenced by individual values and support arrangements.</ab>

        <ab>In the present study 50 old women interned in a medical treatment unity and their respective caregivers were studied. It was verified that most of the women preseted various dependencies and, thErefore, they needed the presence of a caregiver for their survival. The caregivers, most of them female, belonged to the old women's family, had some scholarship degree and pointed out several difficulties en caring for the women. It is verified, consequently, that during hospitalization there is the need to take measures aiming at preparing the caregiver to take on the complex aid required by the old person, especially after hospital discharge.</ab>

        <ab>Interdisciplinary collaboration between physical and occupational therapists is an important aspect of geriatric treatment, in part due to time and reimbursement constraints. A geriatric client is used to discuss methods of effective collaboration. The client, who was five years post cerebral aneurysm, presented with problems, including deconditioning, decreased self-care skills, and maladaptive psychosocial behaviors that limited her participation in activities. The case was also complicated by complex family dynamics. The therapists addressed the issues through co-treatment, family and client education, and the use of a cognitive treatment technique. Benefits of collaboration included time efficiency, decreased duplication of services, and increased functional outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Long-term care needs are evolving in unforeseen ways. Successful aging in place is a primary concern for baby boomers and their parents. Medical advances, coupled with the complex health care delivery systems, present unique challenges for the consumer. Increasingly, the changing demographics of our society are placing new demands on these systems. Seniors and their families are taking a proactive stance, seeking health care advocates to assist them with need assessments, treatment recommendations, planning, and support services.</ab>

        <ab>When all citizens have the right to live free from threat or harm, the abuse of residents in long term aged care facilities is a tragedy which should never happen.Resident abuse is a term used to describe harm to a resident that is an outcome of staff or organisational actions or failure to act. Self-neglect or harm caused by another resident or a relative are also abusive behaviours but they lie outside the scope of this discussion. Caring for dependent, challenging or dying residents can be stressful, and managing a nursing home is complex and costly. These factors illustrate some of the difficulties in aged care but they never excuse abuse by staff, nor do they justify organisations failing to provide the necessary facilities and services to ensure resident safety and wellbeing.Considerable excellent care is given in nursing homes by most staff, most of the time. Nevertheless, some care, some of the time, is less than high quality, with residents being neglected or even abused by staff who are charged with a duty to give safe quality care.An issue in resident abuse, therefore relates to the caregivers. Personal characteristics, attitudes and behaviours of staff can have a positive impact on resident health, safety, and quality of life. However these same staff factors have also been linked to resident abuse with evidence suggesting that it is the young, untrained, inexperienced and stressed workers who are most likely to harm residents. What resident abuse is, why it happens and some strategies for its prevention are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Elderly people are at great risk of poor nutritional status. Identifying those at nutritional risk is complex owing to its multifactorial nature and highlights the need for an easily administered nutritional screening tool. AIM: To test the robustness of a tool used to identify those patients who require further dietetic assessment. METHOD: The tool was tested on an 'acute elderly' ward to assess its statistical robustness, i.e. test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, internal consistency and factor structure, concurrent and construct validity. The research was carried out by a dietitian and two nurses on an overall sample of 185 consecutive admissions. RESULTS: Test-retest results reflect that the tool is capable of yielding consistent assessments over time. Inter-rater reliability results revealed that when comparisons of agreement between nurses and dietitians were examined there was consistent disagreement. Internal consistency was found to be low but the rotated factor analysis suggested a relationship between the items in the tool. Concurrent validity was exhibited with body mass index, albumin and American Nutrition Risk Index only. Construct validity was not sufficiently exhibited with any of the measures used. CONCLUSION: The tool has not demonstrated reliability as determined by the statistical measures and hence validity at this stage. Issues which need to be addressed to allow this tool to be used appropriately are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The value of the nurse case manager's role as a health educator, supportive advocate and coordinator of continuity in health care is widely accepted. Yet, the effectiveness of using this intensive form of client-professional relationship to achieve complex objectives, such as improving health status, and medication adherence while reducing health care utilization, has not been comprehensively explored and/or revealed in the literature. This project examined the comparative effectiveness, of (1) an in-home based comprehensive case management services provided by psychiatric nurse case managers versus (2) a clinic-based, medically managed program on rural elders' functional competence, adherence to prescribed medication regimes, responses to the impact/severity of health care problems (cognitive, affective and psychomotor) and utilization of health care services. More specifically, this study tested whether or not nurse case managers implementing direct services, in addition to the traditional case management services, in the home setting could positively influence health-related outcomes when compared with those receiving customary services provided by a community-based health clinic.This study focused on a high risk, relatively unstudied group, consisting of community dwelling rural elders who were greater than 60 years of age and experiencing depressive symptomatology. The sample consisted of twenty-one pairs of subjects matched on the criteria of age grouping, gender, race, living situation, and percentage of financial responsibility for self-payment of medications. A quasi-experimental, pretest/post test design was used. Each group was exposed to one type of health care service (in-home or clinic-based programs). The difference between the two groups was tested using the statistical procedures of Mann Whitney U, t-test, and analysis of covariance.The in-home case management intervention significantly improved subjects adherence to all prescribed medications; while, also reducing depressive symptomatology. Although improvements in group mean scores for other health-related outcomes were noted in the case managed subjects, these were not significant at the p = .05 level.The study was conducted in two health care agencies in the Piedmont region of central Virginia. The Jefferson Area Rural Elder Health Outreach Program, a W. K. Kellogg Foundation funded demonstration project, which provided case management services to five counties in central Virginia, contributed subjects and data for the in-home group. The second site, the clinic setting, was a federally supported community health center (CHC) staffed by physicians. It provided Medicare and Medicaid mandated health care services to one Central Virginia county immediately adjacent to the counties covered by in-home program.</ab>

        <ab>Current Social Security reform proposals in the United States presume that, as long as the cash income of future retirees is secure, private businesses will take care of producing just the goods and services an aging population requires. However, the performance of private nursing homes, assisted-living complexes, pharmaceuticals, health, insurance, and transportation services for the elderly raises serious questions about the ability of markets to cater to the needs of a vulnerable population. Industries that specialize in goods and services for the old face repeated accusations of fraud, overcharging, poor service, and deceptive practices. The article reports on research on the performance of a number of industries that serve the aged. A careful look at these markets should caution us against relying too heavily on private markets to serve an aging population. The surplus funds flowing into Social Security might be better employed financing the kinds of public services for the elderly that private markets have so far failed to deliver.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to obtain an increased understanding of the experiences of elderly people in geriatric care, with special reference to integrity. Data were collected through qualitative interviews with elderly people and, in order to obtain a description of caregivers' integrity-promoting or non-promoting behaviours, participant observations and qualitative interviews with nursing students were undertaken. Earlier studies on the integrity of elderly people mainly concentrated on their personal and territorial space, so Kihlgren and Thorsen opened up the possibility of considering the concept of integrity from a broader view by recognizing its relationship to the larger framework of the self-concept. Based on this, findings in the present study indicate that elderly people's integrity relating to their corporal self were the least violated. On the other hand, their psychological, information and cultural selves were the most exposed. The study also identified a further dimension (i.e. one relating to social self), which should be included in the concept of integrity because respecting elderly people's social self reduces their feelings of loneliness, isolation and seclusion. In summary, the results indicate that the concept of integrity is complex and has several dimensions.</ab>

        <ab>Population trends show an increasing proportion of people older than 65 years of age. This report aims to describe the facilities/services accessible to the older adult living in Glasgow, Scotland and in San Francisco, United States of America. This comparative study serves to develop a broader understanding of what is involved in the process of ageing, and describes how these two cities are responding to the needs of older people. Long-term caring provision is complex and involves multiple agencies, often leaving both lay and professional individuals ill-informed as to which services exist and how best to use them. The nurse can be instrumental in providing information, viable alternatives and services. In this article, options available for caring of the older adult and financing of care are discussed along with a number of recommendations based on observation described, data collected and literature researched. With the advent of care being provided in the community, there is now a continuum of services ranging from independent living at home to dependent care in hospital. Whether an individual remains at home depends on the availability and affordability of, and access to, other resources/facilities. Creative alternatives are needed for care of the older adult in this millennium. This report describes the need for an integrated system of care, which can adjust to variations in clients' needs. Progressive care facilities, intergenerational sharing, community volunteer service programmes for the older person and Edenizing are a few recommendations discussed by the authors.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: In 1996 the Health Care Financing Administration implemented a second generation of the Social HMO demonstration. This model retained the chronic care benefits of the original Social HMOs while attempting to develop a geriatric service model integrated into primary care and a screening and assessment process focused directly on healthcare risk factors. Other refinements included risk-adjusted capitation payment, broadened eligibility for expanded care benefits, low co-payments for these benefits, and no caps on the expanded care benefits expenditures. OBJECTIVES: The geriatric approach is designed to facilitate integration among providers and levels of care. This includes timely application of primary care monitoring and treatment to reduce illness and disability as well as a geriatric education and consultation program to provide specialty support for complex cases. Care management is designed for those requiring home-based care, those discharged from hospitals or nursing homes, and those having difficulty with treatment regimens. DESIGN: A case study of the Social HMO implementation through the Fall of 1999. SETTING: Health Plan of Nevada (HPN), with locations in Las Vegas, Reno, and surrounding areas. PARTICIPANTS: More than 25,000 Medicare beneficiaries participated during the study period. MEASUREMENTS: Administrative reports, charts, and interviews with administrators and clinicians. RESULTS: Within 12 months of operation under this authority, HPN succeeded in putting in place most of the components of the planned geriatric approach: a screening program to identify patients 'at risk' for high service costs and disability and timely application of primary care treatment to reduce illness and disability. Geriatric education and a consultation program for complex cases were available, but full implementation was delayed until the plan was able to hire a full time geriatrician. CONCLUSIONS: Health Plan of Nevada's Social HMO program reflects current perspectives on how to integrate chronic care into an HMO. The accomplishments affirm that the provision of risk-adjusted reimbursement, along with the 5 % supplement to the normal Medicare capitation payment, are sufficient incentives for a health plan to restructure itself so that it places a priority on retaining and serving populations at risk for high expenditures.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Even under the new long-term care mantra for increased home- and community-based care options, attention to and an understanding of the ways that family caregivers are managing complex care for dependent elderly persons, for example, with medication administration, have been slow to materialize.Methods: Twenty-three family caregivers completed semistructured, face-to-face interviews to capture the shared and idiosyncratic experiences of individuals responsible for all aspects of medication administration regimens for elderly, dependent family members. Data analysis consisted of content analysis of the verbatim interview transcripts. This article reports an emerging typology of caregiver medication administration hassles derived from the interviews.Results: Based on 122 separate accounts, three categories of medication administration hassles were identified. The categories (with the percentage of all accounts represented by the category) include (i) scheduling logistics (29.5%), (ii) administration procedures (31.9%), and (iii) safety issues (38.6%).Conclusions: Primary care providers must continually reevaluate and simplify medication regimens for dependent elderly persons in the care of family members, and the family caregivers must be given adequate training and access to ongoing information support systems to help them perform safe and effective medication administration responsibilities.</ab>

        <ab>Careful assessment and vigilance to the issue of elder mistreatment can prevent serious, untoward outcomes. This paper discusses background to the problem of elder mistreatment and case law that has come out of court decisions. These cases reflect the complex nature of elder mistreatment, and ways in which caregiving behavior can be correctly or erroneously interpreted. Elder mistreatment reporting laws have been in place in most states since the early 1980's. Nurses across the health care continuum are in a position to assess and report elder mistreatment. Further, the nurses can educate the public regarding this problem and help patients and clients make sound decisions regarding potentially dangerous situations. For cognitively impaired elderly persons, the role of the nurse as a patient advocate cannot be underscored enough.</ab>

        <ab>While enormous progress has been made in improving the quality of care and the decision-making process for patients at the end of life, as a society we still have far to go to ensure that dying patients and their families have a comfortable and dignified death. In particular, reexamination and reconfiguration of our current decision framework is essential as our elderly population with chronic disease and slowly fatal conditions expands. With less certain disease paths and more complex and ambiguous choices, the growth of this geriatric population challenges us to develop a broader conceptualization of end of life care planning, so that end of life considerations are integrated into a larger anticipatory framework addressing options and needs as patients gradually decline. Within this framework hospice becomes a natural, integrated option along a continuum of care planning, rather than an abrupt alternative at a late stage of illness. End of life care planning must positively anticipate a robust array of needs and concerns well beyond the dramatic decisions to withhold or withdraw life-prolonging technologies usually found in advance directives. To embrace this broader framework it is critical that primary care physicians as well as disease specialists receive training in fundamental aspects of both geriatric and palliative care. Professionals from both of these disciplines must share expertise with each other, and should collaborate in advocacy efforts to effectuate changes in the clinical, policy and legislative arenas.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study builds on previous research by constructing a model that tests many of the characteristics that have been found to be important predictors of formal service utilization in the past. Additional characteristics that have the potential to improve the model were tested, including care recipient characteristics, characteristics of the family caregiver, and the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient. DESIGN: Secondary analysis, logistic regression. SETTING: Survey. POPULATION: The sample used for this study was derived from the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey. This survey was the third round of a national sample of people over age 65 with functional impairments. The criterion for caregiver/care recipient dyads to be included in the sample was that the primary caregiver had to be a family member who was not paid for caregiving. The majority of the care recipients in the study were women, with ages ranging from 65 to 106 years. Seventy-two percent of the caregivers resided with the care recipient. INTERVENTIONS: The questionnaire for the survey included a screening section, a community survey, an institutional survey, and an informal caregivers questionnaire. Interviews were completed on 4,463 elders residing in the community, with 1,006 of their informal caregivers completing the informal caregivers survey portion of the interview. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of formal service utilization in the home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Eight care recipient variables were important predictors of formal care in the home. Limitations in ADLs, as expected, emerged as an important predictor, with elders having a 1.5 increased odds of utilizing formal services for each limitation in ADL. Living arrangement was an important predictor of formal care; elders who lived in elderly housing had a 3.5 times greater odds of utilizing formal services than those who did not. Other care recipient variables that had a significant positive effect on the utilization of formal services included increasing age, being female, and whether or not the elder had been hospitalized within the past year. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study help to define the complexity of predicting formal home service utilization by family caregivers and care recipients. Clearly, the most important characteristics to consider are those related to the care recipient, but characteristics of the caregiver also are important. It is interesting to note that medical diagnoses, physical impairments, and use of assistive devices had no effect on the use of formal care. Further research is needed to improve the model of formal service use presented. Despite changes that have occurred in the health care delivery system since these data were collected in 1989, the characteristics of caregivers and elder care recipients are not expected to have changed drastically since that time. Future efforts should be focused on identifying additional characteristics of the caregiver and care recipient, as well as descriptors that better capture the complexity of the family relationship, for the purpose of improving the model.

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: In this study the theoretical caregiver functional learning model (CFLM) was tested to identify factors that predict a caregiver's continued involvement with a dependent elder in the home environment. DESIGN: Convenience sample. SETTING: Dependent elder's home. POPULATION: The sample consisted of 70 caregivers actively caring for a dependent elder in the community for a minimum of 5 hr a week. The sample of lay caregivers was recruited by telephone by health care professionals from a home health agency located in the southwestern United States. Caregivers age ranged from 20 to 89 years. Sixty percent of the sample were spouses of the dependent elder. Ages of the dependent elders ranged from 60 to 95 years. Sixty percent of the elders were women. INTERVENTIONS: The Total Physical Self-Maintenance Tool measured seriousness of illness. Caregiver overload was measured by the Burden Index. The Caregiving Scaling Index measured self-assurance in caregiving. Other scales were used to measure understanding of maintenance needs, caregiver's perception of the power relationships with a dependent elder, and quality of care. Data were collected in the dependent elder's home where the study and questionnaires were presented and explained. The researcher picked up the questionnaires 1 week later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Two of the predicted relationships in the theoretical model were supported by the analysis. Seriousness of illness increased caregiver overload. That is, as elders became more disabled and ill, caregivers perceived that the therapeutic requirements of the elders negatively affected the quality of their lives. Three other relationships predicted in the theoretical model were not supported. Caregiver overload did not influence the quality of care received by the dependent elder, nor was the quality of care related to the caregiver's self-perceived ability to perform the necessary caregiving tasks. Nor was the caregiver's perceived power related to the amount of time the caregiver spent performing the therapeutic activities for the homebound elder. The most surprising finding was the relationship between caregiver's perception of power and caregiver overload. This relationship runs counter to the idea that access to resources and decision making would prevent a variety of burdens, and is especially interesting when considering the sample's makeup (60% women). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Stinchcomb's causal functional model was used to explain how the socially established phenomenon of caregiving can maintain itself. Results from this study did validate the influence of the tension variable, seriousness of illness, on the reinforcer variable, caregiver overload, as well as the influence of the discriminant stimulus, self-assurance in caregiving, on the behavior variable, extent of the maintenance role. Ultimately, employing a causal functional format to evaluate behaviors that generate an infinite number of self-replicating causal loops could be useful in understanding some complex nursing problems, such as the maintenance of dependent elders in the home environment.

        <ab>Discharge of older people from hospital has been an area of concern for over 20 years. The present emphasis on rapid throughput of patients in acute care settings is likely to exacerbate existing problems. Improving current practice will mean addressing a number of complex issues to do with communication between agencies and professions. Despite different welfare systems, many of the challenges of discharge planning are shared in different countries. This paper describes attempts to involve patients and carers in discharge planning in Sweden and the UK and identifies a number of areas which require attention if the ideals of patient and carer empowerment are to be achieved.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to analyze questions on a complex ethic, medical and caring dilemma about reasons to continue or suspend compelled alimentation in really old patients carrying progressive acute dementia. Traditionally, the principle of life holiness supports the idea that life should be extended at all costs and the decision to continue feeding the patients is not questioned. However, revolutionary ideas are arising about attitudes, concepts and value of treatment, conducting an urgent need to discuss this problem deeply. Until when should we compel demented patients to eat, as they do not accept food and have to be fed through a catheter or intraveined alimentation, tying back their hands or using other measures? This discussion occurred in a geriatric institution at Israel, when a doctor's order was not accepted by nurses, as they had a different way of seeing the problem. A national conference on this theme was organized with the attendance of doctors, nurses, social workers and psychologists.</ab>

        <ab>This article illuminates the difficulties involved in conducting a multisite case study of different health services. It confines itself to describing the initial phase of such an inquiry. It argues that both the methodological and the content-related complexity of such research places great theoretical constraints on the researcher. Such constraints should not be resolved by simply applying some pregiven theory. It is shown how theoretical constraints arise in the need to formulate some notion of comparability for the different sites under investigation. Because such comparability is conceptualized mainly in a confrontation with the empirical data, the description of the process contains several reformulations of the research problem, taking note of various pitfalls and stumbling blocks. Finally, the general results of the pilot study are reported.</ab>

        <ab>The great new demands created by the increasing average age of our population are by medicine in general, social medicine and the science of rehabilitation medicine in a broad sense not yet addressed and perhaps not even recognized in their respective fields. The older people get, the larger becomes the grey zone between the 'pathology' and 'physiology' of old age. There are also specific diseases which are over-represented in older age groups. It is illogical as well as inhuman to expend large amounts of effort and money on acute medicine and then leave the survivors without help to optimize their quality of life further. However, both the rehabilitationist and the rehabilitees must accept their responsibility to society, in the way of economic feasibility, otherwise an increasing need for rehabilitation will become unbearable. Responsible scientific evaluation must become one of the most important factors in this field, together with a well-defined rehabilitation science and the increasing presence of rehabilitation in medical education. Our main practical postulate for geriatric rehabilitation is to be holistic and permanent. This includes a fluent transition from the acute phase to the rehabilitation phase under one specialist's care and in one institution. We could show that the main useful instruments for this are mixed age groups in one ward (in contrast to isolated 'senior ghettos'), systematic education of relatives and a follow-up rehabilitation service, and a complex and concerted rehabilitation group including integrated psychotherapy. Overlapping of geriatric and nursing sciences should not be opposed by terminological and professional disputes. The same counts for the motivation of the institutions responsible for the costs. This should not be a discussion on costs, or on professional prestige. What we want is rational distribution of the resources available. Only such a viewpoint can be adequate to a medicine that wants to call itself 'human'.</ab>

        <ab>A Cluster Care Aide Model of home care was implemented within a senior apartment complex in New York City. Many unforeseen difficulties arose when traditional home health aides were teamed with newly dependent elderly. Cooperation between the administrators of the two agencies created a specialized orientation and in-service program with positive outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of the meta-analysis was to examine the state of the science of empirical nursing research in gerontology. Although the quantity and quality of nurse investigated phenomena have increased, the scattered findings of statistical significance/nonsignificance are often incomprehensible. Effect size theory grounded the project's conceptual, analytical, and interpretive approach and provided scale-free estimates of intervention effect. The study included published research and unpublished dissertations reported between 1981 and 1992. Forty-three experimental and quasi-experimental studies involving samples with a mean age of 65 contributed data to the research synthesis of nurse implemented intervention on four client referenced outcomes. The Data Coding Form and Protocol were developed, pilot tested, revised, and interrater reliability affirmed. Agreement rate (AR) was .85 for two independent coders on combined categorical and continuous variables. Nursing's impact on elder health status was apparent in the mean cumulative unweighted n adjusted, d index of 0.56, SD = 0.39, EM = 0.06, N = 43. Significance tests (p &lt;/= .05) and effect magnitudes confirmed that diverse strategies yielded positive outcomes across a wide range of persons, settings, and health conditions. Intervention efficacy was reflected in the four intervention domain unweighted mean effect sizes as follows: Physiological: d = 0.71, SD = 0.29, EM = 0.08, n = 14); Behavioral: d = 0.56, SD = 0.38, EM = 0.08, n = 25; Health System: d = 0.40, SD = 0.28, EM = 0.20, n = 2; and Safety: d = -0.18, SD = 0.47, EM = 0.33, n = 2. Weighted mean effect sizes for homogeneous outcome categories were: Overall effect: d = 0.53, v = .002, SE = .04, N = 41; Behaviors/Competencies: d = 0.54, v = .004, SE = .06, n = 18; Signs/Symptoms: d = 0.71, v = .008, SE = .08, n = 14; Feelings/Knowledge: d = 0.37, v = .013, SE = .12, n = 8; Health care delivery: d = 0.25, v = .013, SE = .12, n = 2. Although small subsamples limit conclusions for health care delivery, robust findings of the meta-analysis of gerontologic intervention research contribute to nursing's knowledge base. Current knowledge was organized. Discipline specific phenomena were identified and nursing sensitive outcomes were measured. Moreover, health care providers, researchers, and policy makers require science-based evidence of effective intervention linked to client health outcomes. Studies of family care, crisis intervention, and some complex physiological interventions were not represented in the data base, suggesting areas for further research.

        <ab>The diverse goals of nursing home care, the heterogeneity of nursing home residents, and the varied circumstances under which physicians care for them make their evaluation and care complex and challenging. When evaluating and caring for nursing home residents, physicians must address many issues besides treatment of multiple chronic diseases (including impairments in cognitive and physical functioning, sensory deficits, depression, and behavioral disorders associated with dementia) and concerns of family members. The physician should be integrated with an interdisciplinary team composed of nurses, rehabilitation therapists, social workers, and others. Recently implemented federal rules for nursing home care, which include the Minimum Data Set and Resident Assessment Protocols, provide a useful framework for interdisciplinary assessment and care planning and should improve the care nursing home residents receive. Better data are needed on the most cost-effective strategies for evaluating and caring for nursing home residents. Reimbursement for physician services, availability of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and overall quality of nursing home care must be improved so physicians can better achieve the recommendations outlined.</ab>

        <ab>Current Canadian health policy is based on the implicit assumption that women are available to provide care in the home to the dependent, the ill, the elderly, and the physically and mentally disabled. Women are socialized from birth to accept caring roles within a traditional family structure, and current societal expectations and social policy reinforce this value system. Women's health can only be understood within the context of their lived experience of social inequity, medicalization, and family caregiving. Health care professionals are complicit in sustaining women's oppression by reinforcing these institutions of social control. For health policy to be responsive to women's needs, it must be based on research that considers the social complexity of ordinary women's lives.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to investigate the continuing education needs of gerontological nurses in South Carolina, a state that has experienced a large increase in the elderly population in recent years. Demographic trends relative to the aging population are predicted to continue. Increasingly, well prepared nurses will be required to meet the diverse and often complex health care needs of older people. Despite some improvement in gerontology education in recent years, knowledge gaps exist for many nurses who provide care for the elderly. Assessment of continuing education needs of nurses in gerontological practice has been neglected. A needs assessment of this specialized area of clinical practice was warranted to provide information that may enhance program planning of educational offerings for gerontological nurses. This research investigated the self-expressed instructional needs of nurses from the perspective of personal needs, instructional needs of gerontological nurses in general, and nurse experts who rated the instructional needs of gerontological nurses in general. Participants rated the need for each instructional topic and identified their perceptions of the top priorities as well as additional topics perceived as instructional needs in gerontology. Mean ratings of instructional needs were compared, and results examined relative to the biographic variables age, gender, level of education, and years experience working with the elderly. Null hypotheses #1, stated that no difference would exist between gerontological instructional needs (clinical, general, and administration) based on perceptions of personal needs, needs in general, and needs perceived by nurse experts. Hypothesis 1 was rejected for the following comparisons: personal perceptions and perceptions in general, fourteen items; expert and personal perceptions, seven items; expert perceptions and general perceptions, three items. With one exception, all of the instructional needs for which mean ratings were rejected were categorized as clinical instructional needs. The exception was a general instructional need for which a statistically significant difference was found between expert perceptions and general perceptions. Null hypothesis 2, stating there would be no difference between perceptions of instructional needs and the biographic variables was not rejected for variables age, gender, or level of education, but was rejected for the variable total years experience working with the elderly for the following instructional needs. For groups with less than 10 years experience and groups with 10-19 years experience, ratings were statistically significant for two clinical needs and one general information need. For groups with less than 10 years experience and greater than 19 years experience, there was a statistically significant difference between mean ratings of one clinical instructional need and one general instructional need.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to present a multidisciplinary model for use with elderly families in crisis and decision making. The application of systems in family assessment theory is outlined in order to understand the complexities of family assessment and decision making. A schematic family assessment and decision-making model is discussed. These models identify what the problem is, the family structure and supports, and possible interventions and evaluation. Ineffective processing strategies such as regression and premature closure are reviewed, and strategies for effective decision making are outlined.</ab>

        <ab>Australian health and welfare services have developed in an ad hoc fashion. In response to demands by interested groups within the community, governments have relied on fiscal control and political expediency to regulate the growth of services and benefits. The lack of comprehensive policies and adequate planning has resulted in legislative complexity and administrative fragmentation, which has adversely affected the development of effective health and welfare services for the elderly Australian. The nature of these difficulties is discussed and recommendations are made for their resolution.</ab>
