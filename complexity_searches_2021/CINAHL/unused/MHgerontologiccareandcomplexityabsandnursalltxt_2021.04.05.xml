        <ab>Existing research on spousal care focuses on one spouse receiving care from the other, which fails to address the complexity that is created when both spouses experience some impairments. Our study included situations in which one or both spouses have functional impairments when examining the extent to which spouses from the same couple hold a (dis)similar level of functional impairment and whether such within‐couple (dis)similarity has an impact on the spousal care arrangement. A subsample of 1170 older married couples was selected from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study. Descriptive statistics were used for describing the level of each spouse's functional impairment regarding the number of limitations in activities (activities of daily living [ADL]) or instrumental ADL (IADL). Logistic regressions were used to examine whether spousal dissimilarity in functional impairment (dissimilar, similarly low, similarly high) was associated with spousal care arrangement. Within couples with one functionally impaired spouse, the impaired spouse was more likely to receive spousal care when reporting a higher level of ADL/IADL impairment. Within couples with two functionally impaired spouses, the more impaired person was more likely to receive spousal care (without giving back) when spouses reported dissimilar level of IADL impairment; spouses were more likely to report mutual care when they had similarly high levels of IADL impairment. By documenting the role of spousal dissimilarities in functioning for determining spousal care arrangement, our study can inform couple‐based interventions that capitalize on each spouse's capabilities and resources.</ab>

        <ab>To describe long-term care services and supports (LTSS) in the United States, note their limitations in serving older adults post-incarceration, and offer potential solutions, with special consideration for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. Narrative review. LTSS for older adults post-incarceration. Literature review and policy analysis. Skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, adult foster homes, and informal care from family and friends compose LTSS for older adults, but their utilization suffers from access and payment complexities, especially for older adults post-incarceration. A combination of public-private partnerships, utilization of health professional trainees, and unique approaches to informal caregiver support, including direct compensation to caregivers, could help older adults reentering our communities following prison. Long-standing gaps in US LTSS are revealed by the coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic. Older adults entering our communities from prison are particularly vulnerable and need unique solutions to aging care as they face stigma and access challenges not typically encountered by the general population. Our review and discussion offer guidance to systems, practitioners, and policy makers on how to improve the care of older adults after incarceration.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence (UI) is a burdensome condition for older adults with diabetes receiving home-care services, yet little is known about the prevalence and correlates of UI in this population. The objective of this cross-sectional study, informed by a complexity model, was to determine the prevalence and correlates of UI in older adults with diabetes receiving home care in Ontario, Canada. In this study, we analyzed population-level data of the most recently completed Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care from 2011 to 2016 for older (≥65 years) home-care clients with diabetes. Older adults with daily or multiple daily episodes of UI were compared with adults who were continent or had less than daily UI on sociodemographic, functional, psychosocial and clinical variables. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine correlates of UI in this population. Of 118,519 older adults with diabetes, 39,945 (33.7%) had daily or multiple daily episodes of UI. Correlates of UI included: impaired function in activities of daily living (odds ratio [OR], 5.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.14‒5.50), cognitive impairment (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 2.28‒2.47), female sex (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.82‒1.93), multiple (≥2) chronic conditions (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.74‒1.93), presence of a distressed caregiver (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.27‒1.35), making economic trade-offs (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11‒1.34) and falls (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19‒1.26). Urinary incontinence is common among older adults with diabetes using home-care services. Targeted interventions are required to address the social, functional and clinical factors associated with UI in this population.</ab>
        <ab>L'incontinence urinaire (IU) est un état de santé contraignant chez les personnes âgées atteintes du diabète qui reçoivent des services de soins à domicile. On en connaît encore peu sur la prévalence et les corrélats de l'IU au sein de cette population. L'objectif de la présente étude transversale, fondée sur un modèle de complexité, était de déterminer la prévalence et les corrélats de l'IU au sein des personnes âgées atteintes du diabète qui reçoivent des soins à domicile en Ontario, au Canada. Dans la présente étude, nous avons analysé les données populationnelles du dernier RAI-HC© (Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care) effectué de 2011 à 2016 auprès de clients âgés (≥ 65 ans) atteints du diabète qui reçoivent des soins à domicile. Nous avons comparé les variables sociodémographiques, fonctionnelles, psychosociales et cliniques des personnes âgées qui avaient des épisodes quotidiens ou des épisodes quotidiens multiples d'IU aux adultes qui étaient continents ou qui avaient des épisodes d'IU moindres que quotidiens. Nous avons utilisé la régression logistique multiple pour déterminer les corrélats de l'IU dans cette population. Parmi les 118 519 personnes âgées atteintes du diabète, 39 945 (33,7 %) avaient des épisodes quotidiens ou des épisodes quotidiens multiples d'IU. Les corrélats de l'IU étaient les suivants : la détérioration du fonctionnement dans les activités de la vie quotidienne (ratio d'incidence approché [RIA], 5,31; intervalle de confiance à 95 % [IC], 5,14‒5,50), la détérioration cognitive (RIA, 2,37; IC à 95 %, 2,28‒2,47), le sexe féminin (RIA, 1,87; IC à 95 %, 1,82‒1,93), les maladies chroniques multiples (≥ 2) (RIA, 1,83; IC à 95 %, 1,74‒1,93), la présence d'un soignant en détresse (RIA, 1,31; IC à 95 %, 1,27‒1,35), les compromis sur le plan économique (RIA, 1,23; IC à 95 %, 1,11‒1,34) et les chutes (RIA, 1,22; IC à 95 %, 1,19‒1,26). L'IU est fréquente chez les personnes âgées atteintes du diabète qui reçoivent des services de soins à domicile. Des interventions ciblées sont nécessaires pour remédier aux facteurs sociaux, fonctionnels et cliniques associés à l'IU dans cette population.</ab>

        <ab>By 2030 more people in the United States will be older than age sixty-five than younger than age five. Our health care system is unprepared for the complexity of caring for a heterogenous population of older adults--a problem that has been magnified by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, as part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we identify six vital directions to improve the care and quality of life for all older Americans. The next administration must create an adequately prepared workforce; strengthen the role of public health; remediate disparities and inequities; develop, evaluate, and implement new approaches to care delivery; allocate resources to achieve patient-centered care and outcomes, including palliative and end-of-life care; and redesign the structure and financing of long-term services and supports. If these priorities are addressed proactively, an infrastructure can be created that promotes better health and equitable, goal-directed care that recognizes the preferences and needs of older adults.</ab>

        <ab>• We report the "hidden" characteristics that influence geriatric model implementation. • Leadership, planning, and champions are associated with successful implementation. • Staff turnover, lack of resources, and competing demands are implementation barriers. • Reported contextual and organizational attributes may guide future implementers. • Findings highlight complexities of geriatric model uptake, adaptation, and sustainability. Systems Addressing Frail Elders (SAFETM) Care is a geriatric model of care that identifies high-risk hospitalized older adults, and provides targeted interprofessional interventions for risk factors associated with frailty. This post, mixed methods study sought to evaluate SAFETM Care implementation retrospectively at one public academic medical center and describe practical "real-world" considerations for implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). In addition to barriers and facilitators, hidden characteristics to consider for implementation include initiating conditions, skills and experiences of implementers, interpersonal challenges, unique facilitators and barriers, surprising conditions, and threats to and requirements for sustainability. Implementation of SAFETM Care demonstrated effective adoption and implementation, but faced multiple threats that led to failed sustainability. The public sharing of these successes and failures will help implementers understand and make progress in adapting such important geriatric programs and quality improvement initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Agitation in older people is commonly associated with cognitive decline, complex medical diagnoses and polypharmacy. Impaired communication and comprehension within a dementia trajectory adds complexity to assessment and management. Despite high prevalence, agitated behaviours remain challenging to manage in residential aged care settings. Aim: To explore staff perceptions of agitation in residents of aged care facilities, including the influence of dementia, when selecting management strategies to reduce agitated behaviour. Design: Qualitative descriptive. Methods: Semi‐structured interviews with 11 aged care staff were conducted at two aged care sites. Transcripts were examined using content analysis to identify common issues and categories. The study complied with COREQ guidelines (see. Appendix S1). Results: Participants reported managing resident agitation at least once per shift; most frequently manifesting as wandering, restlessness or aggression. Management strategies included distraction, providing space, knowing the resident, identifying causative factors, spending individual time and if necessary medication administration. Agitation management was more challenging for residents with dementia due to impaired communication or comprehension of instruction. Conclusions: While participants strived to deliver individualized person‐centred care, this was difficult given time and resource constraints. Contemporary management of agitation therefore remains variable in everyday practice, with resident preference used when causative factors were known. Conversely, for residents with impaired communication and/or comprehension, distraction and chemical restraint were commonly used. Nuanced education for assessment and management is recommended to better address this unmet need for some residents. Relevance to clinical practice: For optimal care, appropriate allocation of time and resources is necessary to identify causative and contextual factors for individual residents. Recommendations are for additional staff training in communication and attitude, and collaborating with frontline staff to develop a practical guide for management of agitation in aged care. These simple initiatives may help to improve consistency of care delivery and resident outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Advances in healthcare have contributed to population longevity with many older adults living with complex comorbidities, including those in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Nursing staff require knowledge of gerontology, normal ageing processes and expected physiological, psychosocial, function and cognitive changes in addition to health promotion in order to provide individualised care. The complexity inherent in the medical, palliative and basic care needs of the residents makes RACFs excellent places for learning for undergraduate student nurses who undertake clinical placement as part of a Bachelor of Nursing course. Previous research has identified that knowledge of care staff is relatively poor. To explore the knowledge and misconceptions of ageing among first year undergraduate nursing students and aged care staff facilitating a placement during a clinical learning experience. Descriptive cross-sectional design. Three clinical RACFs in Australia. First year nursing students and staff of three different RACFs. Pre and post-test clinical placement surveys. Students and staff completed Palmore's Facts on Ageing Quiz, a 25-item tool to assess knowledge and attitudes of ageing, before commencing the clinical placement and on the last day of a two week placement. Physiological questions were answered correctly. A knowledge deficit was evident from a sociological perspective. Negative attitudes have been found to devalue care and can directly affect the quality of practice in an undesirable way, forming a barrier to effective and therapeutic relationships with older adults, potentially impacting on patient care. From an education provider perspective, the inclusion of activities to enrich the learning activities of nurses within RACF- inclusive of reflective activities and guidance from an expert clinical facilitator - may assist in dispelling negative attitudes and stereotypes of the older adult and increase recognition of the value of working with older adults. • Misconceptions of the older adult were related to sociological aspects of ageing. • Stereotyping older adults devalues care and affects the quality of practice. • Education should focus on learning strategies that promote a positive view of the older adult.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. The aim of this study was to describe emergent approaches to integrated care for older people with complex care needs and investigate the viability of measuring integrated care. Methods. A case study approach was used. Sites were recruited following discussion with senior staff in health and social care agencies. Service arrangements were categorised using a framework developed by the researchers. To investigate joint working within the sites, the development model for integrated care was adapted and administered to the manager of each service. Data were collected in 2018. Results. Six case study sites were recruited illustrating adult social care services partnerships in services for older people with home care providers, mental health and community nursing services. Most were established in 2018. Service arrangements were characterised by joint assessment and informal face-to-face discussions between staff. The development of an infrastructure to promote partnership working was evident between adult social care and each of the other services and most developed with home care providers. There was little evidence of a sequential approach to the development of integrated working practices. Conclusion. Components of partnerships promoting integrated care have been highlighted and understanding of the complexity of measuring integrated care enhanced. Means of information sharing and work force development require further consideration.</ab>

In the current study, 12 interdisciplinary members of a Program of All-Inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE) completed the Assessment Questionnaire from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit. Once the questionnaire was complete, organizational priorities were identified and the AHRQ Toolkit was used to develop next steps. Of the five subsets included in the Toolkit, the organization identified three as priorities: (a) development of a health literacy team; (b) improving spoken communication with patients and caregivers; and (c) improving written information given via letters and home instructions. Organizations, nurses, and quality care leaders may find these results useful as they seek to assess organizational literacy and develop improvement plans.

        <ab>Background and Objectives Poor identification of sensory impairments in care homes can be due to multiple factors. This scoping review identifies and synthesizes the literature into the detection of hearing and vision loss in the care home environment, and the management of these sensory losses once identified. Research Design and Methods A scoping review methodology was used to identify primary research of any design published from 1985 to September 2018. Six electronic databases were searched, and articles were also sourced from reference lists, relevant charity organizations and published experts. Results Six electronic databases and multiple gray literature sources identified 51 articles for inclusion. The evidence confirmed that lack of knowledge in care home staff, poor management of assistive aids, unsuitable environment, lack of connections with optometrists and audiologists, underuse of effective screening tools, and the added complexity of assisting those with dementia are all barriers to effective practice. Conversely, flexible training programs, availability of a variety of assistive aids, simple screening tools, and adaptions to the environment are effective facilitators. Discussion and Implication This review acknowledges that the barriers to identification and management of hearing and vision loss in care homes are multifaceted and that collaboration of multiple stakeholders is required to implement change and improve the residents' ear and eye care. Recommendations are offered to support more effective service provision tailored to meet the needs of people with sensory impairments living in care homes, and this could subsequently improve best practice.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing a healthcare workforce able to respond to the growing complexity of health issues facing older adults is a critical issue for interprofessional educators. Students are in need of experiences promoting confidence and skill in communicating with older adults with cognitive issues. Student emotional and cognitive responses to an interprofessional Music and Memory® project in long term care facilities were evaluated. Forty-eight students met with assigned adults weekly to develop personalized music playlists and complete a journal entry. Student participants demonstrated improved interpersonal connections, enhanced professional skills, and increased empathy toward clients. Results are explored within the context of Kolb's Learning Theory and application of the evaluation outcomes for interprofessional education.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores care practices of older people outside formal care and without appealing to predefined relationships. We conducted interviews with 30 independent‐living men and women aged 67–93 in three municipalities in Sweden. The interviews explored how they cared for themselves and other older people who were not family. Interviews were conducted between December 2017 and May 2018 and later transcribed and analysed using grounded theory. Our paper presents one of the first studies on informal care practices among older people that looks beyond the definition of formal care to understand how such care complements formal care services. The findings show that older people participate in several care arrangements to care for themselves as well as for others. The arrangements feature different types of mutuality and include distant relations to other older people and larger more or less formalised groups. The findings highlight the importance of looking beyond conceptualisations of care based on understandings of formal care and specific relationships as a frame for understanding informal care. To promote older people's health by cultivating and supporting older people's care for themselves and others, research and healthcare practitioners need to explore and acknowledge the significance and complexity of older people's everyday care practices.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: We will provide insights in the theoretical background and key concepts of a Narrative Care approach, such as narrative cultures, narrative curiosity, narrative co‐composition and narrative reflective practice. Background: Care understood as narrative practice underscores the importance of experiences and how these shape identities. Important to the quality of care in institutional care settings is the ability of care providers to cope with complexities and uncertainties in older adults' stories, which can be realised by attending to ways that foster and co‐compose evolving and forward‐looking narratives. Recognising these ongoing co‐compositions means that persons living in institutional care settings and care providers live, tell, retell and relive their experiences. A change in the current institutional culture is necessary to implement care as narrative practice. To support such a change, approaches are needed that foster a focus on experiences and relationships and make relational ethics central to care. Methods: The proposed Narrative Care approach is the result of an iterative development process involving a literature review, interviews with, and observations of, care providers, dialogues with an advisory committee, and consultation with experts. Main contributions: The proposed Narrative Care approach aims to help care providers (a) to recognise the importance of curiosity in a person's verbal and embodied narratives—especially for those living with dementia; (b) to take note of individual experiences in all of their complexity and uncertainty; (c) to respect these narratives; (d) to open up spaces to co‐compose new narratives; and (e) to allow care providers to engage in narrative reflective practices that shape who they are and are becoming. Conclusion: The introduced approach responds to the need of implementing strategies to think and work narratively in institutional care settings. Implications for practice: Narrative Care has the potential to reshape task‐oriented, technical notions of care. Concepts such as embodied narratives, relational ethics, narrative co‐composition and narrative reflective practice must be integrated in the education of all care providers.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to explore family members' perceptions of assisted bodily care in a nursing home. Background: Many older people living in nursing homes need assisted bodily care, provided by assistant nurses. This means exposedness, as the assistance is often provided under stress, but also brings pleasure. Family members, who may wish to and often benefit from continuing to provide assisted bodily care, are perceived as visitors and are expected to relinquish the assisted bodily care to the assistant nurses. Design: This study has a qualitative design with a phenomenographic approach. Methods: Data were collected through semi‐structured interviews (n = 13) with family members of older people who were aged &gt; 80, permanently living in a nursing home, suffering from multimorbidity, and in daily need of assisted bodily care. The data were analysed using a phenomenographic method. Results: Three categories of description presenting an increasing complexity were identified. The family members perceived that assisted bodily care is built upon a respect for the older person's self‐determination, practically supported by assistant nurses, and complemented by family members. Conclusions: In the family members' perceptions, assisted bodily care signifies ambiguity, as they find themselves balancing between the older persons' need for self‐determination and need for help, and, further, between their trust in the assistant nurses' skills and their own perceived inadequacies in intimate assisted bodily care. Implications for practice: Policies that address the family members' role in nursing homes are needed. Furthermore, time for collaboration is needed for assistant nurses to inform and explain care decisions, become aware of the family members' perceptions of their situation and learn from them.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Managing patients in advanced age is complex, especially when it comes to multi-morbidities and polypharmacy. The purpose of this qualitative study is to investigate challenges, opportunities and potential solutions from a primary healthcare provider perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Fifty-seven participants joined in group discussions on challenges and opportunities of working with advanced age. Participants included general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, students and administration staff working in ten general practices. A thematic analysis was developed, supported by NVivo software. Findings: Poor lines of communication and fragmentation of services between differing levels of health care services available for older people were highlighted. This has implications for quality of care and equity of services. Participants also reported challenges in treatment and funding regimes. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size and regional nature of the study, along with the semi-structured nature of the group discussions and rigorous thematic analysis, indicate that this qualitative data is transferable, dependable, confirmable and credible. Comparing the views of tertiary and community services would be useful. Practical implications: A range of potential strategies and solutions to the current fragmented services was offered by GPs. For example, adequately funded and staffed community-based health hubs; IT platforms enabling timely flow of patient information between primary and tertiary health providers and creation of medical, nursing and allied health roles aimed at improving synergy between GP and tertiary services. Originality/value: Obtaining the perspectives of general practice highlights the challenges and complexities of caring for those in advanced age brings. These insights have not been previously been explored in-depth within this setting in New Zealand.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many family care partners are involved in making help‐seeking choices. The aim of this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still maintaining their own dignity. Methods: Data were collected in 2009–2010 in open semi‐structured interviews and follow‐up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an in‐depth data analysis. Results: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the follow‐up of policy for older people.</ab>

        <ab>This commentary highlights the importance of health system responsiveness to older people living with complex health needs. Age-related changes and associated morbidity can present barriers to identifying an individual's health needs, expectations, values and preferences, and so sufficient time, skill and resource is required to inform the development of a tailored plan for each individual. A focus on responsiveness moves thinking beyond the responsibilities of the individual clinician in the single encounter, and allows us to identify elements of the wider system that may constrain how well the clinician is able to respond. Setting the goal of responsive health care requires us to assess the suitability of wider health system features and processes for meeting the diverse needs of individual people throughout their journey, and the extent to which the system can adapt dynamically as needs change. Standardised approaches to care prescribed across organisations (such as time-based targets or routinised approaches to inpatient nursing care) are likely to result in low responsiveness as individual complexity grows, disadvantaging patients with needs that do not fit the prescribed approach. Responsiveness is high when individual practitioners and clinical teams have the resources, decentralised authority, flexibility and autonomy to provide the care required. Building a more responsive health system requires a greater understanding of how these conditions can be achieved.</ab>

        <ab>NHS continuing healthcare is a package of care that is arranged and funded solely by the NHS where an individual has been found to have a 'primary health need'. Individuals who may be eligible have a right to be assessed for NHS continuing healthcare, and this assessment is undertaken by healthcare professionals using a national framework. However, there is a lack of literature on continuing healthcare and its assessment process. The aim was to review the literature on undertaking and providing continuing healthcare in terms of workforce roles, education and training, and competencies. A literature search was undertaken to identify relevant literature on continuing healthcare. Primary searching of electronic internal databases and indices at the Royal College of Nursing and King's College London was used, alongside a further database search and hand searching. A narrative synthesis of the literature was used to synthesise the findings, and a thematic analysis was undertaken to identify themes from the literature. The literature search identified 100 articles, of which 84 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or provided insufficient details in the abstract. A total of 18 articles were included and examined in detail. Four themes were identified in the literature: complexity of care in transitioning care from hospital to home; different care models; importance of education of healthcare professionals; and role of continuing healthcare. Healthcare professionals – including nurses – should receive further training in caring for older people, especially in relation to continuing healthcare. Since there is an increasing ageing population, there is an increasing requirement for continuing healthcare, and thus further research examining all aspects of this care is required.</ab>

        <ab>Background The average application processing time for the National Nursing Home Support Scheme (NHSS) has seen drastic improvement from 15 weeks in 2014 to 4 weeks in 20161. There is no available data of the duration of stay in rehabilitation beds after approval of NHSS application and reasons for delay in transition to nursing home. Aims (1) To examine average length of stay in rehabilitation before multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision is made for nursing home care. (2) To examine average length of stay in rehabilitation bed from the time of NHSS approval to discharge into nursing home. (3) To examine reasons for delay in discharge to nursing home after NHSS approval. Methods A retrospective chart review of patients discharged into nursing homes between January to June, 2018 from geriatric rehabilitation units. Data collected include age, length of stay in rehabilitation unit before multidisciplinary decision was made in conjunction with patients/family to seek nursing home care (LOS1), Length of stay in rehabilitation bed following decision for nursing home care (LOS 2). Reasons for the delay in the transition from rehabilitation bed to nursing home bed were also documented. Results Seventeen patients were discharged into nursing homes, LOS1 of 43.12 days and LOS2 of 50 days. Complexity of application in terms of financial evaluation especially for patients who were deemed cognitively incapable of managing their finances, lack of suitable nursing homes for patients with complex needs/challenging behaviours, family dynamics with regards to choice of nursing homes and medical stability to facilitate such transfers were reasons for delay in transition to nursing home beds. Conclusion Transitional care beds, which are generally acknowledged to be more appropriate to these patients' care needs and are less expensive than rehabilitation beds, need to be utilized more. Education of healthy adults over 65 years to proactively plan for future care needs and promote awareness of legislatures regarding capacity and decision making.</ab>

        <ab>This multi-perspective study focuses on how a service robot for the elderly should behave when interacting with potential users. An existing service robot and a scenario were used as a concrete case, which was discussed and analyzed during focus group sessions with older adults (n = 38), informal caregivers (n = 24), and professional caregivers (n = 35) in the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom. A total of seven topics—privacy, task execution, environment, appearance, behavior, visitors, and communication—were explored. The results showed that some of the characteristics mentioned were unique to a user group, but several were cross-cutting. Overall, potential users expected the service robot to be customizable in order to match the users' needs and preferences. Also, high expectations concerning its functioning and behavior were expressed, which sometimes could even be compared to the qualities of a human being. This emphasizes the complexity of service robot development for older adults, and highlights the need for a personalized and flexible solution. One size does not fit all, and specific attention should be paid to the development of the robot's social behavior and skills beyond a mere functional support for the person.</ab>

        <ab>Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Multi-morbidity and polypharmacy are common among older people. It is essential to provide a better understanding of the complexity of prescription drug use among older adults to optimise rational pharmacotherapy. Population-based utilisation data in this age group is limited. Using the Danish nationwide health registries, we aimed to characterise drug use among Danish individuals ≥ 60 years. Methods: This is a descriptive population-based study assessing drug prescription patterns in 2015 in the full Danish population aged ≥ 60 years. The use of specific therapeutic subgroups and chemical subgroups and its dependence on age were described using descriptive statistics. Profiles of drug combination patterns were evaluated using latent class analysis. Results: We included 1,424,775 residents (median age 70 years, 53% women). Of all the older adults, 89% filled at least one prescription during 2015. The median number of drug groups used was five per person. The most used single drug groups were paracetamol and analogues (34%), statins (33%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (24%). Eighteen drug profiles with different drug combination patterns were identified. One drug profile with expected use of zero drugs and 11 drug profiles expected to receive more than five different therapeutic subgroup drugs were identified. Conclusion: The use of drugs is extensive both at the population level and increasing with age at an individual level. Separating the population into different homogenous groups related to drug use resulted in 18 different drug profiles, of which 11 drug profiles received on average more than five different therapeutic subgroup drugs.</ab>

        <ab>It is well documented that Health care assistants (HCAs) provide the most hands‐on care to residents in aged care facilities, and play a critical role in the provision of care to dementia residents. Over the last 25 years, a philosophy of person‐centred care has become the preferred approach to care and this has meant that HCAs are encouraged to get to know the resident very well. This paper reports the experiences of HCAs in caring for people at end‐of‐life, identifies the skills required for their work and examines the education provided against these skills. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted in 49 facilities (n = 34) across New Zealand and data analysed thematically, with the aim of critically examining the adequacy of education for health care assistants which meets their needs within a person‐centred environment. The results confirm that the skills include traditional tasks of care (showering, feeding, toileting, and dressing) but the increasingly important communication and de‐escalation skills, both verbal and non‐verbal, have become central to their care skills. Education provided has not sufficiently shifted focus to include these more complex skills. Provision of educations that acknowledges the increased complexities of their role needs to be provided. As well, facilities need to be challenged to reconsider the HCA's position in the facility care tem.</ab>

        <ab>Given limited available geriatric specialists and complexity of dementia care, there is a need for greater collaboration between primary care and specialists to better meet the needs of persons with dementia. Meaningful family physician—specialist collaboration has the potential to improve health outcomes, timely access to care and more appropriate healthcare resource utilisation. Primary Care Collaborative Memory Clinics (PCCMCs), which include specialist support, provide a significant opportunity for studying the family physician–specialist interface. This study aimed to explore the nature of collaborative relationships between memory clinic family physicians and specialists caring for persons with memory concerns in PCCMCs across Ontario, Canada. Family physicians (N = 71) attending an education session and specialists (N = 21) completed a survey in the fall of 2017 that measured frequency and amount of collaboration, perceptions of their relationship and identified factors that enable and challenge collaboration. Descriptive statistics were generated for quantitative data and themes for responses to open‐ended questions were explored using descriptive qualitative content analysis. Specialists and memory clinic family physicians valued their collaboration particularly as related to capacity building for dementia care and desired more time devoted to collaboration. Identified enablers and barriers to collaboration have implications for further integration of specialist support to potentially support improved patient care and further build capacity in primary care to manage dementia care. Opportunities exist for expanding and more intentionally supporting how family physicians and specialists interact with the creation of more formalised processes to support optimal collaboration, including a clear delineation of roles, responsibilities and expectations, more formally planned and structured relationship building and monitoring, identifying and addressing unique barriers to collaboration and use of a variety of methods of communication. Study findings have implications for how specialists and family physicians communicate and collaborate in other programmes for complex chronic conditions.</ab>

        <ab>Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Background: The burden of pain in nursing homes is substantial; however, pain assessment for both acute and chronic conditions remains inadequate, resulting in inappropriate or inadequate treatment. Complexities in assessing resident pain have been attributed to factors (barriers and facilitators) arising at the resident, healthcare provider, and healthcare system levels. Objectives: In this systematic review protocol, we identify our research approach that will be used to critically appraise and synthesize data in order to assess barriers and facilitators to pain assessment in nursing home residents aged ≥65 years. Methods: This is a Cochrane style systematic review protocol adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols reporting standards. This review will include primary (original) qualitative literature concerning either barriers or facilitators to pain assessment in older adult nursing home residents. A thematic analysis approach will be employed in collating and summarizing included data and will be categorized into resident, healthcare provider, and system-level factors. Database searches will include Abstracts in Social Gerontology, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Discussion: The identification of barriers and facilitators to pain assessment in older adult nursing home residents may assist healthcare providers across all platforms and levels of education to improve pain assessment among nursing home residents. Improving the assessment of pain has the potential to improve quality of care and ultimately quality of life for older adult nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>With the predicted growth in the number of people with dementia living at home across the globe, the need for home-based care is expected to increase. As such, it will be primarily family carers who will provide this crucial support to family members. Designing appropriate support for family carers is thus essential to minimise risks to their health, to prevent premature institutionalisation or poor care for persons with dementia, as well as to sustain the effective functioning of health and social care systems. To date, the high volume of research related to care at home and acknowledged low impact of interventions suggests that a re-examination of the nature of care at home, and how we come to know about it, is necessary if we are to advance strategies that will contribute to better outcomes for families. This paper describes findings from an ethnographic study that was designed to support an analysis of the complexity and materiality of family care arrangements – that is, the significance of the actual physical, technological and institutional elements shaping care-giving situations. In this paper, we describe the arrangements made by one family to show the necessary collectivity of these arrangements, and the consequences of the formal care system's failure to respond to these.</ab>

        <ab>The health care aide position embodies one of the most basic paradoxes of long-term care for older adults: those who have the most contact and most intensive interaction with nursing-home residents are also those having the least training, authority, and status within the system. They therefore hold one of the keys to quality care in many settings, especially nursing homes. In the absence of agreement on the position's roles, responsibilities, and authority, it is important to examine how the position is perceived by the key members in the long-term-care framework. The current study examined and compared health care aides' and nurses' perceptions of the position in nursing-home settings in Israel, using a standardized tool developed for this inquiry. The comparison accounted for potential intervening factors that may help better understand the job requirements and boundaries. A comparative survey design. 30 nursing homes (of at least 20 beds) in northern Israel. We used convenience sampling to recruit 369 health care aides and 261 nurses (a total of 630 participants). The main instrument of data collection was specially designed and validated for this study. It was based on a qualitative study that defined basic content units representing tasks importance, knowledge, and personal characteristics for the job. Participants found it difficult to prioritize the job components or to differentiate between core tasks and characteristics and the secondary aspects of their job. General care, profession-specific knowledge, and emotional abilities were endorsed the most by participants. Cleaning, communication, and safety were ranked lower (although rankings were still considerably high). However, previous experience as a health care aide undermined incumbents' perceptions of their own responsibilities and professionalism. Incumbent health care aides rated most factors higher than nurses did, with the exception of the importance of communication. Our results may help decision makers understand the complexity around the health care aide position, manage and develop it more effectively while setting standards (training and certification, performance appraisal, and more) for professionalization processes and better defining the division of nursing work between health care aides and nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: This study explores the intersection of marriage and caregiving amongst older spousal caregivers in regional Australia. Specifically, we address the research question: 'How do expectations of informal care impact spousal caregivers in later life?' Methods: These comprise interpretive qualitative in‐depth interviews in order to understand the lived experience of caregiving within the context of long‐term marriage. Results: Findings highlight the complexity and diversity of marital relationships as the context of informal care. Individual and social obligations were evident in key themes, demonstrating how spouses automatically assume and continue in caregiver roles in later life. Conclusion: Caregiving is an expectation of couples in long‐term marriages, regardless of the relationship quality and willingness to care. Normative expectations also impact decision‐making around future care planning and transitions away from home‐based care. These are important considerations for both policy and practice with older adults and their caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Healthy ageing is a multi-dimensional concept which appertains to all older adults. This study reviewed the intervention characteristics, intervention content and effectiveness of multi-dimensional healthy ageing interventions (MHAIs) addressing physical, mental and social health among independent community-dwelling older adults. A search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO for studies published from Jan 2007 to October 2016. 18 publications were included, accounting for 15 studies. The review reflected the complexity, variations and methodological considerations of developing a comprehensive MHAI. It demonstrated the possibility of integrating person-focused to environment-focused content topics in future MHAIs, beyond the physical, mental and social health dimensions. Among the reviewed studies, health education programs reported improvements in quality of life and life satisfaction while health assessment and education programs promoted positive health behaviors. Future MHAIs studies need to employ more robust research methods and greater contextual information reports to build stronger evidence base.</ab>

        <ab>In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

        <ab>Objective: Mealtimes directly impact the quality of life of residents in aged care. The objective of The Lantern Project is to improve the dining experience of aged care residents to reduce malnutrition risk through improving dietary intake, meal. Methods: A transdisciplinary team of aged care professionals and resident advocates was formed as a collaboration collectively known as The Lantern Project. Results: This paper outlines the journey and timeline of The Lantern Project collaboration since its inception and the interplay between the monthly stakeholder meetings and inter‐related research projects demonstrating improved outcomes. Conclusion: Transdisciplinary collaboration offers well‐grounded benefits and realistic strategies sensitive to the complexity of the aged care setting.</ab>

        <ab>As the population ages, the risk of becoming malnourished increases. Research has shown that poor oral health can be a risk factor for malnutrition in institutionalized elderly. However, it remains unclear whether oral health problems, edentulousness and health-related quality of life also pose a risk for malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults. In this cross-sectional observational study, 1325 community-living elderly (≥75 years) were asked to complete questionnaires regarding nutritional status, oral status (edentulous, remaining teeth, or implant-supported overdentures), oral health problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, activities of daily living (ADL) and complexity of care needs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with nutritional status as dependent variable. Of the respondents, 51% (n = 521) were edentulous, 38.8% (n = 397) had remaining teeth and 10.2% (n = 104) had an implant-supported overdenture. Elderly with complex care needs were malnourished most frequently, followed by frail and robust elderly (10%, 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively). Malnourished elderly reported more frequent problems with chewing and speech when compared with well-nourished elderly (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analysis did not show an association between malnutrition and oral health problems and edentulousness, although HRQoL was associated with malnutrition (odds ratio (OR) 0.972, confidence interval (CI) 0.951–0.955). Based on the results of this cross-sectional study, it can be concluded that poor HRQoL is significantly associated with malnutrition; however, edentulousness and oral health problems are not.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of self-care on the prevalence of loneliness among elderly people living in retirement homes and older people living in their homes/communities.Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted through standardized SELSA-L assessment loneliness questionnaires and the Self Care Assessment Worksheet for self-care assessment. The results were processed using the Kruskal–Wallis test.Findings The obtained results have shown that impaired self-care ability affects the prevalence of loneliness among the elderly almost the same in both groups of participants. However, regarding the relationship between the state of health and self-care, only a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of loneliness is found in the case of the participants living in their homes, with the worst health condition affecting the poorer psychological care.Research limitations/implications It is necessary to point out the limitations of the research, primarily sample limitations and the selected design of the study. The sample consisted of two different and relatively small groups of participants which could adversely affect the representativeness of the sample and reduce the possibility of generalising the results. The next limiting factor is the age distribution the authors used in the research, where the age of the participants as a very important variable was collected by age range and not precisely which consequently resulted in inequality in subgroup sizes. Thus, the middle age (75–85) covers up to ten years, which is a huge range at an older age and can mean major differences in functional ability, and can impact the self-care assessment.Practical implications Nurses are indispensable in care for the elderly and they need to promote and encourage self-care of the elderly through health care. Elderly people living in retirement homes should be allowed to participate equally in health care in order to preserve their own autonomy and dignity. However, to benefit those who live in their homes, nurses should be connected to the local community and thus stimulate various forms of preventative (testing blood sugar levels, blood pressure and educating on the importance of preventive examinations) or recreational activities in the environment of elderly people with the goal of preserving their functional abilities.Originality/value The impact of self-care on loneliness was not sufficiently researched, and this paper contributed to understanding the complexity of loneliness phenomena among the elderly with the aim of developing a model of prevention.</ab>

        <ab>The prison population is aging at an alarming rate and many older persons have the potential to develop dementia while in prison. This case report aims to explore the needs of older people living with dementia in prison and discusses the interventions that exist to address these needs. As the condition progresses, persons with dementia become increasingly reliant on the support of others for their health and well-being because of the increasing complexity of physical healthcare and psychosocial needs. Very few interventions are cited in the research literature regarding the use, acceptability, and/or effectiveness of programming for people living with dementia in prison. To support the unique and complex needs of these persons, research is needed to guide the development of evidence-informed dementia programs and services as well as consideration of interdisciplinary collaboration with community organizations.</ab>

        <ab>Delivering person-centered care (PCC) is no longer an option for nursing homes (NH) that receive funding from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. NH staff need evidence-based protocols to guide efforts in honoring preferred choices of residents, especially those that are perceived to be risky. The Rothschild Care Planning Process for Resident Choice was created to honor such choices. The current article provides a case exemplar to demonstrate the use of the Rothschild Care Planning Process for Resident Choice with one NH resident who was perceived by staff to be making a risky choice. The scenario outlines six steps to the process, highlighting areas for focus and documentation that addresses complexities and best practices in delivering PCC. Three recommendations are offered to address residents' choices that carry risk: (a) adapt care community policies, (b) engage direct care staff in care planning, and (c) provide staff training in facilitating resident choice.</ab>

        <ab>In the context of an aging population, both the need for home care services and its complexity of care have increased in many high-income countries. Yet, the definition of what constitutes complex care is largely elusive. This systematic review examined the conceptual definition of complex care within the home care environment using several social and health science databases for research published from 2000 to 2017. Of the 25 articles and reports identified, only 16 addressed complex care specifically and included older adults, aging, and/or home care. The results showed that complex care for older adults is primarily defined from a biomedical approach focusing on chronic disease and management and less commonly from the perspective of the social determinants of health. Future studies should consider the importance of the continuum of care needs from both the biomedical and the social determinants to adequately plan and provide care for older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate decision-making around hospital transfer and/or referral of residents to a Residential InReach (RiR) service in north-eastern metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, from the perspectives of residential aged care facility (RACF) staff, general practitioners (GPs) and RiR registered nurses (RNs). Methods: Thirty-one staff from eight RACFs, five GPs and four RiR RNs participated in individual or group interviews. Results: Residential aged care facility staff and GPs valued and relied upon RiR to manage unwell residents. Thematic analysis identified RiR utilisation was driven by the following: (i) complexity of decision-making processes in RACFs; (ii) variability in facility-based medical and nursing care; and (iii) impact of RiR service outcomes on patients and referrers. Conclusion: Availability of timely and appropriate medical and nursing care in RACFs was reported to influence transfers to the hospital and/or referrals to RiR. RiR was used to complement or substitute usual care available to residents. Further research and improvements in RACF and RiR resources are required.</ab>

        <ab>RÉSUMÉ: Malgré la complexité croissante des soins en foyers de soins de longue durée, le rôle des médecins dans la prestation des soins aux résidents a été peu étudié. Cette étude exploratoire internationale visait à mieux comprendre les rôles des médecins, leurs responsabilités et leurs tâches, ainsi qu’à explorer les caractéristiques uniques de la pratique médicale dans les foyers de soins de longue durée. Des entrevues ont été menées avec 18 médecins. Ces médecins ont mentionné qu’ils contribuaient fortement à la qualité des soins pour les résidents, en clarifiant les objectifs des soins, en prenant des mesures pour réduire les hospitalisations et les prescriptions de médicaments non nécessaires, et en contribuant à la formation du personnel. Les pratiques en foyers de soins de longue durée impliquaient les médecins au centre de réseaux de relations qui assuraient non seulement une meilleure qualité des soins médicaux, mais aussi une satisfaction professionnelle chez les médecins. L’importance de ces relations est telle qu’elle permettait d’aller au-delà des démarcations traditionnelles entre le domaine médical et le domaine social, et mettait en évidence qu’une bonne pratique médicale implique de bonnes pratiques sociales. Considérant la nature exploratoire de l’étude, les auteurs recommandent que de futures recherches soient menées pour mieux comprendre les dimensions relationnelles associées à la pratique de la médecine en foyers de soins de longue durée. Despite the increasing complexity of nursing home care, the role of physicians caring for residents is largely unexplored. This international, exploratory study sought to learn about physicians’ roles, responsibilities, and tasks as well as investigate the unique qualities of medical practice in nursing homes. We conducted interviews with 18 physicians, who reported making important contributions to the quality of resident care, including clarifying the goals of care, working to reduce unnecessary medication and hospitalization, as well as contributing to staff education. Nursing home practice involved physicians in networks of relations that were instrumental to the quality of medical care and physicians’ job satisfaction. The importance of these relationships disrupts the oft-drawn boundary between the medical and the social, suggesting that good medical practice depends on good social practice. Reflecting the exploratory nature of the study, we recommend research to better understand and support the relational dimensions of nursing home medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To examine nursing student placement preferences submitted as online comments to a university's placement management system, to inform strategies for positive residential aged care experiences. Background There are predicted shortages of nurses to service an ageing population. Clinical placements undertaken by undergraduate nursing students help shape their attitudes and are a key determinant of career decision-making, yet there is little research about why students prefer particular placement areas. Design Analysis of qualitative data from a placement management system. Methods Of 6,610 comments received between 2007-2014, 607 related to aged care and were coded according to preferences for being placed in a residential aged care facility, with reasons for this preference thematically coded and quantified. Results Four hundred and one comments (66.1%) related to students requesting not to be allocated residential aged care for the upcoming placement, primarily due to previous experience in the sector; 104 (17.1%) referred to aged care in a neutral manner, focusing on conflict of interest; 102 (16.8%) related to a request for an aged care placement. Conclusions The student nurse comments characterise students as being focused on maximising their learning, while considering prior experience. In some cases, increased exposure to aged care is considered to offer limited learning opportunities, which is concerning and suggests that both the tertiary and aged care sectors have a joint responsibility to pursue recognition of aged care nursing as a specialised, highly skilled role. Relevance to clinical practice Nursing programme providers should ensure curriculum content and exposure to aged care placement clearly identify the complexities of care and provide genuine opportunities for knowledge acquisition and skill development based on multifaceted resident care needs. This will support both those interested in a future aged care career and those undecided.</ab>

        <ab>In high-income countries, migrant live-in caregivers are increasingly in demand to provide health and social care in the home. While there is a wide range of research on the perspectives of live-in caregivers (including domestic workers) in destination countries, few studies address the perspective of families who hire them. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, range and nature of international literature on the needs and experiences of employers/families and care recipients of live-in caregivers. We undertook a scoping review of the literature on this topic using Arksey and O'Malley's five stages. With the assistance of a health science librarian, a comprehensive search of nine databases was undertaken from April to July 2014. Two research assistants independently reviewed 2493 articles. The data were analysed through data charting, numerical summary and thematic analysis. Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria for the scoping review. Many of these studies ( n = 7) were conducted in Israel, and the majority ( n = 8) focus on elderly care recipients. The findings reveal the diverse roles live-in caregivers perform, including emotional and physical care; changes in family dynamics and roles upon hiring a live-in caregiver; the negative experiences, including abuse, of live-in caregivers and elderly care recipients; the positive outcomes for families with a live-in caregiver; and families' common perception that live-in caregivers are like kin, a part of the family. Furthermore, evidence points to some degree of bi-directional emotional support between caregivers and employers/families, which adds complexity to their relations and the negotiation of power.</ab>

        <ab>Enhancing support workers’ (SW) role is timely given increasing demands on human and financial health care resources. This article presents outcomes of a program, delivered to 140 participants from five community aged care providers in Australia, designed to enhance knowledge, skills, and confidence of community aged care SWs, building their practical skills in understanding, recognizing, and responding to complexity. Evaluation training modules on communication, complexity, behavior change, and chronic condition self-management support involved pre/post surveys with SWs and their supervisors. SWs reported greater awareness, skills, and confidence in working with complexity, reinforcing the value of their existing practices and skills. Coordinators reported greater appreciation of SWs’ skills, and greater awareness of gaps in SWs’ support and supervision needs. Educators, policy makers, and services should account for these contributions, given growing fiscal restraint and focus on reablement and consumer-directed care.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare assistants provide the majority of direct care to the residents living in aged residential care. In New Zealand, the delivery of care is under the supervision of the registered nurse. The purpose of this article is to examine the New Zealand policy landscape and care demands in aged residential care. Within the current care environments, registered nurses are challenged by the responsibility of ensuring quality care delivered under supervision by healthcare assistants in an increasingly complex and contract driven environment. The complexity and acuity of a client population requiring specialised care challenges the constraints of care contract expectations and creates significant difficulties for both registered nurses and healthcare assistants. Variability in role identification and scope is a significant barrier to understanding the healthcare assistant workforce as a whole. Individual employment contracts between the employers and healthcare assistants promote further variability with differing role and certification requirements for hourly rates of pay. National contracts used by District Health Boards do not address the acuity creep that is occurring at all levels in aged residential care and the workload increases that directly impact registered nurse supervision of care. The overall funding of aged residential care is caught between a client population predominately funded by the State and the sweeping economic reforms that depend on privatization. Registered nurses need to have an understanding of the socio-political, economic and educational factors that influence care delivery in aged residential care.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Quality of care in the residential aged sector has changed over the past decade. The purpose of this paper is to examine these changes from the perspectives of staff to identify factors influencing quality of residential aged care, and the role and influence of an aged care accreditation programme.Design/methodology/approach Focus groups were held with 66 aged care staff from 11 Australian aged care facilities. Data from semi-structured interviews were analysed to capture categories representing participant views.Findings Participants reported two factors stimulating change: developments in the aged care regulatory and policy framework, and rising consumer expectations. Four corresponding effects on service quality were identified: increasing complexity of resident care, renewed built environments of aged care facilities, growing focus on resident-centred care and the influence of accreditation on resident quality of life. The accreditation programme was viewed as maintaining minimum standards of quality throughout regulatory and social change, yet was considered to lack capacity of itself to explicitly promote or improve resident quality of life.Research limitations/implications For an increasingly complex aged care population, regulatory and societal change has led to a shift in service provision from institutional care models to one that is becoming more responsive to consumer expectations. The capacity of long-established and relatively static accreditation standards to better accommodate changing consumer needs comes into question.Originality/value This is the first study to examine the relationship between accreditation and residential aged care service quality from the perspectives of staff, and offers a nuanced view of “quality” in this setting.</ab>

        <ab>Background: our orthopaedic trauma unit serves a large elderly population, admitting 400-500 hip fractures annually. A higher than expected mortality was detected amongst these patients, prompting a change in the hip fracture pathway. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a change in orthogeriatric provision on hip fracture outcomes and care quality indicators. Patients and Methods: the hip fracture pathway was changed from a geriatric consultation service to a completely integrated service on a dedicated orthogeriatric ward. A total of 1,894 consecutive patients with hip fractures treated in the 2 years before and after this intervention were analysed. Results: despite an increase in case complexity, the intervention resulted in a significant reduction in mean length of stay from 27.5 to 21 days (P &lt; 0.001), a significant reduction in mean time to surgery from 41.8 to 27.2 h (P &lt; 0.001) and a significant 22% reduction in 30-day mortality (13.2-10.3%, P = 0.04). After controlling for the effects of age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Grade and abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), the effect of integrating orthogeriatric services into the hip fracture pathway significantly reduced the risk of mortality (odds ratio 0.68, P = 0.03). Conclusions: changing our hip fracture service from a geriatric consultation model of care to an integrated orthogeriatric model significantly improved mortality and performance indicators. This is the first study to directly compare two accepted models of orthogeriatric care in the same hospital.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. Background Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. Design Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial ( AGe- FIT). Methods Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. Results Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. Conclusions Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To investigate the association between polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity with time to first hospitalization, number of hospitalizations, and number of hospital days over a 12-month period. Design A 12-month prospective cohort study. Participants and Setting A total of 383 residents of 6 Australian long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Measurements The primary exposures were polypharmacy (≥9 regular medications) and the 65-item Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between polypharmacy and MRCI with time to first hospitalization. Poisson regression was used to compute incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs for the association between polypharmacy and MRCI with number of hospitalizations and number of hospital days. Models were adjusted for age, sex, length of stay in LTCF, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and dementia severity. Results There were 0.56 (95% CI 0.49–0.65) hospitalizations per person-year and 4.52 (95% CI 4.31–4.76) hospital days per person-year. In adjusted analyses, polypharmacy was associated with time to first hospitalization (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.21–2.79), number of hospitalizations (IRR 1.51; 95% CI 1.09–2.10), and hospital days per person-year (IRR 1.39; 95% CI 1.24–1.56). Similarly, in adjusted analyses a 10-unit increase in MRCI was associated with time to first hospitalization (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.06–1.29), number of hospitalizations (IRR 1.15; 95% CI 1.06–1.24), and hospital days per person-year (IRR 1.19; 95% CI 1.16–1.23). Conclusions Polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity are associated with hospitalizations from LTCFs. This highlights the importance of regular medication review for residents of LTCFs and the need for further research into the risk-to-benefit ratio of prescribing in this setting.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To explore communicative challenges in encounters between nurse assistants and older persons during home care visits. Background The older population is increasing worldwide. Currently, there is a shift in care for older people from institutional care to home care. Providing home care in a person's home involves several challenges, including the complexity of communication. Design A descriptive observational design with a qualitative approach was used. Methods The data consisted of audio recordings of real-life encounters during home care visits between nurse assistants and older persons, collected in 2014. A hermeneutic phenomenological analysis was conducted. Results Communicative challenges were identified: (a) in situations where the older persons had a different view than the nurse assistants on the care task and its content; and (b) when unexpected actions or turns occurred in the communication. Challenges included older person's existential issues, fragility and worries and concerns, which often appeared to be only vaguely expressed and difficult to verbally detect and tackle. This engendered a risk of misinterpretation or ignorance of these challenges. Conclusion The findings point to the importance of communication as the key to facilitate person-centred home care. Communication training should focus more on addressing needs and existential issues in older persons. Person-centred home care for older persons needs to be addressed at both an individual and an organizational level.</ab>

        <ab>Currently, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Common Format for nursing homes (NHs) accommodates voluntary reporting for 4 adverse events: falls with injury, pressure ulcers, medication errors, and infections. In 2015, AHRQ funded a technical brief to describe the state of the science related to safety in the NH setting to inform a research agenda. Thirty-six recent systematic reviews evaluated NH safety-related interventions to address these 4 adverse events and reported mostly mixed evidence about effective approaches to ameliorate them. Furthermore, these 4 events are likely inadequate to capture safety issues that are unique to the NH setting and encompass other domains related to residents' quality of care and quality of life. Future research needs include expanding our definition of safety in the NH setting, which differs considerably from that of hospitals, to include contributing factors to adverse events as well as more resident-centered care measures. Second, future research should reflect more rigorous implementation science to include objective measures of care processes related to adverse events, intervention fidelity, and staffing resources for intervention implementation to inform broader uptake of efficacious interventions. Weaknesses in implementation contribute to the current inconclusive and mixed evidence base as well as remaining questions about what outcomes are even achievable in the NH setting, given the complexity of most resident populations. Also related to implementation, future research should determine the effects of specific staffing models on care processes related to safety outcomes. Last, future efforts should explore the potential for safety issues in other care settings for older adults, most notably dementia care within assisted living.</ab>

        <ab>In interactions with clients or patients, human service workers are at risk of experiencing discrepancies between felt and organizationally mandated emotions (i.e. emotion-rule dissonance). Given the documented detrimental effects of such discrepancies on employee strain, the present study investigated whether job complexity mitigates the relation between emotion-rule dissonance and employee burnout using data from a two-wave panel study of eldercare workers (N = 583, 16-month time lag). Structural equation modelling revealed that emotion-rule dissonance at Time 1 preceded emotional exhaustion and depersonalization at Time 2. Beyond that, employees whose work offered job complexity were found to suffer less from emotional exhaustion and depersonalization when encountering discrepancies between felt and stipulated emotions compared to employees who conducted noncomplex work. Thus, designing complex tasks appears to be a crucial starting point for alleviating employee burnout in jobs that provoke emotion-rule dissonance.</ab>

        <ab>Interprofessional collaborative practice is increasingly recognized as an essential model in health care. This study lends preliminary support to the notion that medical students (including residents) and social work students develop a broader understanding of one another's roles and contributions to enhancing community-dwelling geriatric patients' health, and develop a more thorough understanding of the inherent complexities and unique aspects of geriatric health care. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests of participants' scores on the Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration (IIC) indicated the training made significant changes to the students' perception of interprofessional collaboration. Qualitative analysis of participants' statements illustrated (1) benefits of the IPE experience, including complementary roles in holistic interventions; and (2) challenges to collaboration. The findings suggest that interprofessional educational experiences have a positive impact upon students' learning and strategies for enhanced care of geriatric patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background Most older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are frail and have complex care needs. Holistic understanding of residents' health status is key to providing good care. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a valid assessment method which aims to embrace complexity. Here we aimed to study a CGA that has been modified for use in long-term care (the LTC-CGA) and to investigate its acceptability and usefulness to stakeholders and users. Methods This mixed methods study, conducted in 10 LTCFs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, reviewed 598 resident charts from pre- and post-implementation of the LTC-CGA. Qualitative methods explored stakeholder perspectives (physicians, nurses, paramedics, administrators, residents and families) though focus groups. Results The LTC-CGA was present in 78% of LTCF charts in the post -implementation, period though it did not appear in acute care charts of transferred residents, despite the intention that it accompany residents between care sites. Some items had suboptimal completion rates (e.g., Advance Directives at 56.4%), though these were located in other sections of the LTCF chart (98.2%). Nevertheless, qualitative findings suggest the LTC-CGA describes a clinical baseline health status which enabled timely and informed clinical decision-making. Conclusions The LTC-CGA is a useful resource whose full capacity may not yet have been realized.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Nurses in Sweden have a high absence due to illness and many retire before the age of sixty. Factors at work as well as in private life may contribute to health problems. To maintain a healthy work–force there is a need for actions on work-life balance in a salutogenic perspective. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of resources in everyday life to balance work and private life among nurses in home help service. Methods. Thirteen semi-structured individual interviews and two focus group interviews were conducted with home help service nurses in Sweden. A qualitative content analysis was used for the analyses. Result. In the analyses, six themes of perceptions of recourses in everyday life emerged; (i) Reflecting on life. (ii) Being healthy and taking care of yourself. (iii) Having a meaningful job and a supportive work climate. (iv) Working shifts and part time. (v) Having a family and a supporting network. (vi) Making your home your castle. Conclusions. The result points out the complexity of work-life balance and support that the need for nurses to balance everyday life differs during different phases and transitions in life. In this salutogenic study, the result differs from studies with a pathogenic approach. Shift work and part time work were seen as two resources that contributed to flexibility and a prerequisite to work-life balance. To have time and energy for both private life and work was seen as essential. To reflect on and discuss life gave inner strength to set boundaries and to prioritize both in private life and in work life. Managers in nursing contexts have a great challenge to maintain and strengthen resources which enhance the work-life balance and health of nurses. Salutogenic research is needed to gain an understanding of resources that enhance work-life balance and health in nursing contexts.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To explore published literature that describes what is known about the role of informal caregivers as they manage medications for older adults and/or people living with dementia residing in the community. Background The number of informal caregivers of older adults, including people living with dementia, is growing worldwide. Good medication management by informal caregivers contributes to improved health outcomes and reduced institutionalisations for the care recipient; however, little is known about this domain of care. Design Narrative review. Methods A literature search was conducted to identify relevant research articles written in English between January 2000-April 2013, sourced from online database searches using multiple keywords, reviewing reference lists and citations of key articles and Internet searches. Articles were included if they described informal caregiver medication management for older adults and/or people living with dementia. Results Ten articles were found that described this role from the perspective of the informal caregiver. The evidence suggests that this role is complex and is often made more difficult because of increasing medication regimen complexities, aspects of the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient, healthcare system practices and a lack of information and/or training available to the informal caregiver, especially when caring for people living with dementia. Conclusion Responsibility for managing medications for older adults and/or people living with dementia in the community often falls to informal caregivers. More information resources are required for this role, which requires specific medication management skills and knowledge and is further complicated by the cognitive decline of the care recipient. Relevance to clinical practice Informal caregivers are often expected to manage medications in a safe and effective manner for their older care recipient, who may also have cognitive impairment. Nurses, who may be in frequent contact with community-living older adults/people living with dementia, can be an important source of information, training and support for informal caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>The past several years have witnessed an upsurge in the focus on person-centered care for several populations, and especially for vulnerable elders with dementia who reside in nursing homes. The limited ability to accurately detect and quantify complex behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD) patterns has hampered the development and refinement of tailored interventions. This study's purpose was to characterize complex patterns of BSD and examine the association among different BSD patterns and cortisol profiles. Two groups of nursing home residents were analyzed (N = 28,N = 27) using THEME™. Behavioral and cortisol data were collected for four consecutive days. Random effects model was used to characterize BSD trajectories over time. There was a significant difference in BSD between the two groups from late afternoon to early evening. The groups differed significantly in age, comorbidities, antianxiety medication, and the number and complexity of patterns of vocalization and restlessness. THEME™analysis, a first step in developing and timing person-centered interventions, was able to identify BSD patterns that drove the overall time of day pattern.</ab>

        <ab>In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.</ab>

        <ab>International studies on the death of elderly nursing home residents show the complexity in the understanding of the professionals who care for the dying. The aim of this study is to explore the discourses about professional caregivers caring for those dying in Denmark in the last decade. A discourse analysis inspired by Foucault was constructed. The material consists of different source documents: research articles, newspaper articles, theses, books, websites - 35 sources in total. There are constructed six positions of speech, five discourses and three themes: (1) 'the work of the professional caregivers - a complex low-status work'; (2) 'the education of the professionals - the way to ensure a good death or possessing the right qualifications' and (3) 'the vulnerable professionals'. The study concludes that an economical/political discourse is dominating and sets up the frames within which the professionals care for dying residents, although the medical, the social/critical and the religious discourses attempt to speak against it. All positions articulate that the professional caregivers' job has a low status and that it is not possible to provide an optimal care due to lack of time, resources and education. Psychical or mental demands make the professionals vulnerable. The meaning of optimal care varies according to the positions of speech.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: To identify the factors associated with stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) among new enrollees who did not fully participate in therapy sessions. Methods: Data (n = 36,133) were obtained from the Minimum Data Set version 2.0 in the state of Michigan in 2009. Study participants were new SNF enrollees (n = 699) who did not fully participate in therapy sessions despite their desire to return to the community. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify factors contributing to remaining in a nursing home for 91 days or longer. Results: New SNF enrollees were more likely to remain in nursing home when they were depressed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–2.08; P = .01), experiencing delirium (OR = 3.20; 95% CI, 1.48–5.92; P &lt; .001), were not in pain (OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.60–0.95; P = .03), or in less complex care (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; P &lt; .01). Conclusions: A higher number of new SNF enrollees than previously reported were likely to stay in nursing homes (28.0%). Depression and delirium were associated with stay in an SNF, while pain and higher complexity of care were associated with returning to the community.</ab>

The World Health Organization published an adapted definition in 2002, describing palliative care as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. When the accent is shifting from curative to palliative, the goal of management is the maintenance or improvement of the patient's quality of life. The different dimensions of palliative care and the multitude of types of care to be provided require a multidisciplinary, well-functioning team, effective communication and a clear task division between primary and hospital care. Considering the complexity of care for incurable patients, a multidisciplinary approach is a prerequisite to balance curative and palliative intervention options. Optimal functioning of a team requires excellent training, communication and a description of the tasks and responsibilities of each team member. More and more advanced care planning is introduced in palliative care, focusing on an early identification of patients in a palliative trajectory and on the prevention of annoying symptoms, hoping that this approach results in an improved quality of life for the individual patient, less useless technical investigations and a better end-of-life care on the place the patient and his family desires.</ab>

        <ab>Migrant care workers make a substantial contribution to older adult care in Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK). However, little is known about the relational aspects of care involving migrant care workers and older people. Given that the care relationship is closely linked to quality of care, and that the Irish and UK sectors are increasingly restricted by economic austerity measures, this lack of information is a concern for care practice and policy. Our paper explores the relationship between migrant care workers and older people in Ireland and the UK and draws on data collected in both countries, including focus groups with older people (N = 41), interviews with migrant care workers (N = 90) and data from a survey of and interviews with employers. The findings illustrate the complexity of the migrant care worker–older person relationship; the prevalence of need orientated, friendship and familial-like, reciprocal, and discriminatory interlinking themes; and the role of individual, structural and temporal factors in shaping these relationships.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to illuminate the meaning of professional carers’ experiences in caring situations when a conflict of interest arises with the older person receiving care. The findings reveal the complexity of the carers’ ambivalence when facing a conflict of interest, weighing up between the older persons’ right to self-determination and external demands. The carers are alone in their ambivalence, and the conclusion is that they need help and support to be more present in the encounter. The implication for this study is to focus on care as a person-centered practice and to focus on people as interdependent on support carers to maintain older people’s right to self-determination in the relationship.</ab>

        <ab>Admission to a care home is a major event for many individuals and, for some, a time when they may lose their independence. It is at this juncture that they should be given the opportunity to participate in planning their future care. An advance care plan (ACP) is a means for people with capacity to document their preferences for their care and to enable providers to advocate on their behalf. Some people will have lost mental capacity before admission to a care facility, so it is essential for staff to be familiar with the complexities of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to support residents approaching the end of life. This article outlines the processes of ACP and identifies resources available to support the introduction of ACP into care homes.</ab>

        <ab>Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common obstructive airway diseases, especially among older people. These conditions are associated with a significant and increasing disease burden. The diagnosis and management of asthma and COPD in older populations are complex, and consequently clinicians are faced with many therapeutic and diagnostic challenges. Both aging and obstructive airway diseases are associated with complex co-morbidities and these coexisting illnesses confound management. Moreover, the age-related physiological changes that occur in the lungs may lead to airflow limitation, and this may be difficult to distinguish from an active disease state. In practice, management of asthma and COPD is informed by disease-specific clinical practice guidelines; however, most older people with these conditions are excluded from clinical trials that are designed to inform practice, creating major evidence gaps. Furthermore, seldom do clinical practice guidelines consider the complexities of management in older populations. The problems experienced by older people are complex and multifactorial and our approach to management must reflect these challenges. Opportunities exist to improve the management and outcomes for older people with obstructive airway disease and there is an urgent need for clinical trials to test management approaches in this population; current research must consider the challenges and evidence gaps that exist.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: Qualitatively describe the use of team and group processes in intervention facilities participating in a study targeted to improve quality of care in nursing homes “in need of improvement.” Design/setting/participants: A randomized, two-group, repeated-measures design was used to test a 2-year intervention for improving quality of care and resident outcomes. Intervention group (n = 29) received an experimental multilevel intervention designed to help them: (1) use quality improvement methods, (2) use team and group process for direct-care decision-making, (3) focus on accomplishing the basics of care, and (4) maintain more consistent nursing and administrative leadership committed to communication and active participation of staff in decision-making. Results: The qualitative analysis revealed a subgroup of homes (“Full Adopters”) likely to continue quality improvement activities that were able to effectively use teams. “Full Adopters” had either the nursing home administrator or director of nursing who supported and were actively involved in the quality improvement work of the team. “Full Adopters” also selected care topics for the focus of their quality improvement team, instead of “communication” topics of the “Partial Adopters” or “Non-Adopters” in the study who were identified as unlikely to continue to continue quality improvement activities after the intervention. “Full Adopters” had evidence of the key elements of complexity science: information flow, cognitive diversity, and positive relationships among staff; this evidence was lacking in other subgroups. All subgroups were able to recruit interdisciplinary teams, but only those that involved leaders were likely to be effective and sustain team efforts at quality improvement of care delivery systems. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative analysis can help leaders and medical directors use the key elements and promote information flow among staff, residents, and families; be inclusive as discussions about care delivery, making sure diverse points of view are included; and help build positive relationships among all those living and working in the nursing home. Wide-spread adoption of the intervention in the randomized study is feasible and could be enabled by nursing home Medical Directors in collaborative practice with Advanced Practice Nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Older adults are more susceptible to water imbalance and ensuring they drink sufficiently is a complex and challenging issue for nurses. The factors that promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older people from drinking are not well understood. Objective: This study aimed to understand the complexity of issues associated with the hydration and hydration care of older people. Design: A qualitative study using multiple methods. Settings: Two healthcare sites providing care for older people in the South West of England: a hospital ward in a major hospital and a care home providing personal and nursing care. Participants: Twenty-one older people aged 68–96 years, were recruited to the study from the hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older people to participate were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion criteria were being unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or distressed to take part in the study. The staff participants of nurses and health care assistants totalled 21. The inclusion criterion for staff was any nurse or health care assistant providing hydration care. Seven friends or relatives participated by making anonymous comments via a suggestion box available to all friends and relatives. Methods: Data were collected via interviews with older people, focus group discussions involving staff, suggestion box comments made by friends and relatives and twelve hours observation of hydration practice. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to promote drinking including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in older people''s hands and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their experience of drinking was diminished by a variety of factors including a limited aesthetic experience and a focus on fluid consumption rather than on drinking as a pleasurable and social experience. Conclusion: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with drinking were lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social interaction was underplayed in both settings. Hydration practice which supports the individual needs of older people is complex and goes beyond simply ensuring the consumption of adequate fluids.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objective: To determine the prevalence of dementia diagnoses and the use of antidementia drugs in a cohort of Italian older nursing home (NH) residents. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The NH residents participating in 2 studies: the U.L.I.S.S.E. study and the Umbria Region survey. Participants: A total of 2215 nursing home residents. Measurement: Each resident underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline by means of the RAI MDS 2.0. Dementia diagnosis was based on ICD-9 codes. Results: The prevalence of dementia diagnosis according to ICD-9 codes was 50.7% (n = 1123), whereas 312 subjects had cognitive impairment with a cognitive performance scale score ≥3 without a diagnosis of dementia. Only 56 NH residents were treated (5% of the sample) and the main drugs used were cholinesterase inhibitor, whereas only 1 subject was treated with memantine. Limiting our analysis to patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer''s disease, who are those reimbursed by the public health care system for receiving antidementia drugs, the percentage rose to 11.3%. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate a high rate of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of dementia in Italian NH residents. Potential explanations include the lack of systematic assessment of cognitive functions, the limitations to antidementia drug reimbursement, the complexity of the reimbursement procedure itself, and the high prevalence of patients with severe dementia. Older NH residents still lack proper access to state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment for a devastating condition such as dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (&lt;4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives Beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are of increasing interest because of their clinical complexity and high costs. The objective of this study was to examine the incidence, costs, and factors associated with potentially avoidable hospitalizations ( PAH) in this population. Design Retrospective study of hospitalizations. Setting Hospitalizations from nursing facilities ( NF) including Medicare and Medicaid-covered stays, and Medicaid Home and Community- Based Services ( HCBS) waiver programs. Participants Dually eligible individuals who received Medicare skilled nursing facility ( SNF) or Medicaid NF services or HCBS waiver services in 2005. Interventions None. Measurements Potentially avoidable hospitalizations were defined by an expert panel that identified conditions and associated Diagnostic Related Groups ( DRGs) which can often be prevented or safely and effectively managed without hospitalization. Results More than one-third of the population was hospitalized at least once, totaling almost 1 million hospitalizations. The admitting DRG for 382,846 (39%) admissions were identified as PAH. PAH rates varied considerably among states, and blacks had a higher rate and costs for PAH than whites. Five conditions (pneumonia, congestive heart failure, urinary tract infections, dehydration, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma) were responsible for 78% of the PAH. The total Medicare costs for these hospitalizations were $3 billion, but only $463 million for Medicaid. A sensitivity analysis, assuming that 20%-60% of these hospitalizations could be prevented, revealed that between 77,000 and 260,000 hospitalizations and between $625 million and $1.9 billion in expenditures could be avoided annually in this population. Conclusion Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are common and costly in the dually eligible population. New initiatives are needed to reduce PAH in this population as they are costly and can adversely affect function and quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Heart rate variability (HRV) is the temporal beat-to-beat variation in successive RR intervals on an electrocardiographic (ECG) recording and it reflects the regulation of the heart rate (HR) by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). HRV analysis is a noninvasive tool for the assessment of autonomic function that gained momentum in the late 1980s when its clinical relevance as a predictor of mortality was established by a milestone study by Kleiger et al. in patients with postacute myocardial infarction. In the last few decades, the increasing availability of commercial ECG devices offering HRV analysis has made HRV a favorite marker for risk stratification in the setting of cardiovascular disease. The rapid aging of the world population and the growing popularity of HRV have also fueled interest for the prognostic value of HRV in the elderly, outside a specific cardiological context. However, the discussion of HRV measures in the elderly is still very much centered on the rather reductionistic model of sympathovagal balance, with the orthosympathetic and parasympathetic limbs of the ANS exercising opposing effects on the heart via autonomic tone. The expanding application of nonlinear dynamics to medicine has brought to the forefront the notion of system complexity, embedded in the mathematical concepts of chaos theory and fractals, and provides an opportunity to suggest a broader interpretation for the prognostic significance of HRV, especially in the elderly. Although the use of novel indices of HRV may be hampered by practical issues, a more holistic approach to HRV may still be safeguarded if traditional time- and frequency-domain measures are viewed in terms of autonomic modulation. This review focuses on HRV in geriatric populations. It considers studies on the prognostic value of HRV in elderly subjects, discussing the potential confounding effect of erratic rhythm, and concentrates on the conceptual distinction between autonomic tone and autonomic modulation. It also briefly addresses the question of the practicality of ECG recordings and identifies a promising area for future research in the effects of common noncardioactive drugs on HRV.

        <ab>Abstract: The Minimum Data Set 3.0 has introduced a higher set of expectations for assessment of residents’ psychosocial needs, including new interviewing requirements, new measures of depression and resident choice, and new discharge screening procedures. Social service staff are primary providers of psychosocial assessment and care in nursing homes; yet, research demonstrates that many do not possess the minimum qualifications, as specified in federal regulations, to effectively provide these services given the clinical complexity of this client population. Likewise, social service caseloads generally exceed manageable levels. This article addresses the need for enhanced training and support of social service and interdisciplinary staff in long term care facilities in light of the new Minimum Data Set 3.0 assessment procedures as well as new survey and certification guidelines emphasizing quality of life. A set of recommendations will be made with regard to training, appropriate role functions within the context of interdisciplinary care, and needs for more realistic staffing ratios.</ab>

        <ab>Real uptake of recommendations is at the crux of community-based fall prevention. This mixed methods intervention study investigated how knowledge of one's own fall risk influenced self-reported behaviors and beliefs about falls and fall prevention in the home by older adults. Between one-on-one semi-structured interviews, participants received their individual scores compared to age-matched normative values for the Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, Biodex™ Fall Risk Test, and cut scores for the Timed Up and Go and Berg Balance Scale. Change scores on the Falls Behavioural Scale for Older Adults were reviewed as norm values were not found in the literature. Findings from the fall-related assessments and interviews reiterated the complexity of falls and fall prevention in a fluctuating curve of 'awareness' comprised of 'having concern, being careful,' 'accepting,' and 'action/behavior related to fall prevention.' Despite some uptake of recommended fall prevention advice, being perceived as susceptible to falls remained unacceptable to these participants, limiting real transfer or expressed belief in fall risk.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to determine which intervention used to assist people with dementia from sitting to a standing position was the most effective approach to aid movement. Method: Focus groups were held with care and therapy staff working in dementia settings to find out the difficulties they encountered when helping someone with dementia to a standing position, and the interventions to overcome these difficulties. Suggested interventions were substantiated against the literature and efficacy of intervention attempts was recorded in a diary. Participants also completed a post-intervention questionnaire to establish their views on how results should be used. Results: Appropriate interventions led to a positive outcome for participants as they were able to assist people with the minimum of fuss and complexity, and for patients because they received the care they required. No single intervention emerged as being particularly effective and other factors must be considered when interpreting the results. Conclusion: Participants agreed that interventions should be included in patient handling training programmes.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the complexities of discussing end-of-life care with people with dementia. Twelve people with dementia were interviewed to complete values histories. During the interviews participants were asked to describe their feelings and values related to the end their lives. A minority appreciated the opportunity to discuss their feelings, while others were evasive and one was frightened, indicating they did not want to pursue the topic further. Many had no strong views, choosing to leave future decisions up to medical staff or thought they could decide in the future, indicating a lack of awareness of the prognosis. A practice reflection, describing issues of potential benefit to practitioners undertaking similar therapeutic engagement, is included.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a study identifying the care issues experienced by older people in the acute setting that could be improved through a collaborative approach to action. Background. Actively involving consumers in the governance of healthcare organizations is viewed positively, although there is less agreement on how to do this. Co-operative inquiry is a useful approach to involve consumers and clinicians in structured dialogue about understanding and changing care, whereas traditional quality improvement methodologies are often singular in their dimensions of change. Method. Using a co-operative inquiry approach, five workshops were facilitated over a 4-month period in 2008 with four volunteer older people, four clinicians and three facilitators (n = 11). All participants were actively involved in generating ideas and actions using a range of facilitation techniques and data collection methods. Findings. There was increased awareness, understanding and acceptance of clinicians' and consumers' experiences and expectations of care. The complexity behind changing so-called simple care (providing warm drinks, appetizing food), which were the key concerns for consumers, relied on the active management and broader transformation of the system, including teamwork, communication processes and organizational and individual values and beliefs. Conclusion. Consumers and clinicians put different emphasis on perspectives related to improving care of older people in the acute hospital setting. The disconnect between what consumers viewed as 'simple' organizational behaviours to change and what the clinicians viewed as complex, led to a recognition that the approach to organizational change needs to be reconceptualized.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to explore the barriers that the uninsured elderly population encounter when accessing health care in the United States. These barriers include, but are not limited to lack of transportation, insurance, or family support; the daunting complexity of the health care system; poverty; culture; poor patient-health care provider communications; race/ethnicity; and lack of health care professionals such as nurses and doctors with adequate geriatric preparation, or generalists who are undereducated in geriatrics. The number of health care professionals currently available to treat elderly persons in the United States is inadequate. The Federal government should take steps to develop solutions to improve access to health care and decrease health disparities for older adults. As a nation, we should be proactive in addressing these concerns instead of waiting for new barriers to arise that further limit access to health care for elderly patients and their families. In this article, we provide an assessment of the barriers that limit access to health care in the uninsured elderly population and suggest recommendations and possible solutions to eliminate or reduce these barriers.</ab>

        <ab>The unique requirements of residents with diabetes in long-term care (LTC) facilities necessitate a protocol-driven, individualized approach to care. Established treatment guidelines for the management of diabetes are written with the general population in mind and, although the principles remain the same in LTC patients, clinical priorities and strategies may need to be modified, and glycemic goals should be balanced against quality of life. This article identifies and explores the institutional, staff, patient and medication-related factors that contribute to the complexity of delivering optimal diabetes care in the LTC setting, and focuses on how insulin analogs, and the pens used for their delivery, can simplify and improve care delivery while, in many cases, reducing institutional costs.</ab>

        <ab>This quantitative study aimed to get to know the reasons that made aged people seek care at a basic health care outpatient clinic in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The data was collected in the patient files of 401 aged people attended by the health team. Initial reading of these records evidenced 4634 reasons that, after qualitative analysis, were grouped under complaints and requests for attention. In a second analysis, these data were classified as Rand Z, according to ICD-10. The R category -complaints expressed by signs and symptoms-equals 64% of the reasons, with 'pain' as the most common one. The other reasons, 36%, corresponded to the Z category, called requests for attention, represented by medicine prescription requests and attendance for health control. The study evidenced the complexity of this population's health care demands in the study region, showing the need for that service to develop specific and interdisciplinary care.</ab>

        <ab>The clinical approach toward elderly patients is often very complex and associated with an increased risk of medical errors. This case report is an example of how various objective (related to patient) and subjective (related to physicians) factors may influence the optimal diagnostic approach in elderly frail patients. We also discuss geriatric practice, which must be characterized by the intellectual honesty to refuse any sort of prejudices (such as ageism) and by the skill to navigate between the Scylla (ie, viewing clinical problems as unrelated to each other) and the Charibdy (ie, applying the Occam's razor principle) of the patient's complexity.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To describe the social network of support for stomized elderly people, represented by eco-maps of the multiple supporting relationships according to the Complexity referential. METHODS: Case study, carried out in a stomatherapy service at a university hospital in the Southern region of Brazil. Patients were four elderly stomized people, three women and one man, interviewed at their homes. RESULTS: The importance of family support, friend/neighbor network, stomatherapy service with its workers/interns of other stomized people in the care for elderly stomized people became evident. Although the Basic Health Unit is the entry door for the Single Health System service, the subjects of this study sought care for their health needs in the hospital itself. CONCLUSION: The social network of support reveals itself through relationships and interactions inserted in the complex social system. Care relationships are present in this social network of support to elderly stomized people and their families.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: Behavior problems are common in dementia, yet little is known about how physicians deal with these problems in practice. This article reports on a survey asking physicians to describe, with respect to the last nursing home resident with dementia they treated for behavior problems, the behaviors observed, assessment methods used, suspected etiology of the problem, types of intervention, and their reaction to the intervention process. DESIGN: This is a descriptive study presenting responses to a Web-based questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 110 physicians providing services to nursing home residents. MEASUREMENTS: Physicians answered a close-ended questionnaire with open-ended 'other' options concerning symptoms, methods of assessment, suspected etiological factors, and interventions to describe the last nursing home resident they treated for behavior problems associated with dementia. RESULTS: Resisting care was the most frequently reported symptom (71%). Physicians were most likely to attribute the behavior problems to the indirect effects of dementia on the ability to remember, communicate, and comprehend (67%). Most (87%) reported using more than one method for treating these problems. Rate of reported use of psychotropic drugs (80%) was slightly higher than that for nonpharmacological methods (75%), with the majority (61%) reporting use of both of these methods. Standardized instruments were not used in assessment. Forty percent of the participants reported feeling satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention they provided, and close to a third (32%) reported feeling frustrated with the intervention process. CONCLUSION: The data underscore the complexity in the treatment of behavior problems. Despite federal regulations limiting their use, the potential for side effects, and ambivalence toward such treatment, psychotropic drugs are still used for the majority of nursing home residents with behavior problems associated with dementia. On the other hand, physicians report employing nonpharmacological methods to a closely similar extent, although their role in the implementation of these treatments is less clear. Further work is needed to clarify physicians' involvement in and decision to use nonpharmacological interventions.</ab>

        <ab>The complexity and diversity of the needs of older people in care homes presents challenges to those responsible for caring for residents, in particular nursing and care assistant staff providing the majority of direct care. This study examines the degree of knowledge and confidence of these staff in caring for people with dementia and seeks to identify factors which can contribute to greater confidence. It reveals that although staff knowledge of dementia is reasonable, confidence in dealing with related situations is lower. Results also suggest that training can positively influence staff confidence in dealing with behaviour associated with the condition, recognizing that it is one of many factors influencing performance as a paid carer. These findings are discussed in terms of the quality of care provided to residents with dementia, the forms such training might take and the importance of a work environment which facilitates on-the-job training.</ab>

        <ab>As the complexity of care increases for hospitalized older adults, the clinical nurse specialist is essential for ongoing development of nursing practice and care standards. This article describes the Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) model for interdisciplinary management of older adults and clinical specialist responsibilities within this interdisciplinary team. Within the model, clinical care specialists utilize clinical expertise and consultation skills reflecting three spheres of practice related to care of high-risk community-dwelling older adults admitted an acute medical unit. The goal for this patient group is to achieve medical stability while preserving maximum functioning. The Acute Care of the Elderly team members include primary nurses (staff nurses), physicians, clinical care specialists, therapies, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, and a discharge planner. Under the leadership of the primarily nurse, the team develops a comprehensive care and discharge plan, implemented across a care continuum. Using protocols and working together, the team delivers cost-effective, coordinated care that promotes process improvement resulting in practice that is in alignment with current standards of care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To assess general practitioners' (GPs') attitudes to urinary incontinence in elderly patients and their experiences in the application of the Dutch College of General Practitioners' guideline in daily practice. DESIGN: Two existed groups of six GPs working in villages and seven GPs working in urban practices. METHOD: Two focus-group discussions with recording of discussions and transcription. Transcripts were analysed by two independent researchers. RESULTS: During the discussions three main themes of attitudes came forward: (1) therapeutic nihilism of GPs and low motivation of patients, (2): GPs experienced lack of time because of difficulties in explaining the therapy and because of impaired mobility of older patients, (3) because of the complexity of the problem and co-morbidity, GPs as well as patients were reluctant to treat the UI. The most remarkable findings in the application of the guideline were: (1) because of the barriers mentioned above, physical examination did not take place in spite of GPs' conviction as to the benefit of it; (2) GPs' knowledge of treatment options in the elderly with UI is substandard. CONCLUSION: Several patient (comorbidity, impaired mobility, low motivation, and acceptance of the problem) and GP factors (therapeutic nihilism, lack of time and knowledge) interfere with good management of UI in the elderly.</ab>

        <ab>At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.</ab>

        <ab>This study sought to develop and test a set of criteria to distinguish elders at high risk of an untoward medication event within community nursing caseloads. A descriptive correlational design was used to identify relevant risk factors for elders. Data on medication knowledge, regime, management abilities, and adherence were obtained from 111 elders receiving community nursing care. Four predictors-12 or more doses of medications per day, more than one prescriber, caregiver available, and sometimes forgetting to take medications-of complexity (R(2) explaining 39% of the variance) and adherence (R(2) explaining 49% of the variance) were identified as potential factors that subsequently confirmed a discrete group of high risk elders. The use of these four risk factors or screening criteria is recommended for older people within community nursing caseloads.</ab>

        <ab>The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure population.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND:increasing numbers of elderly patients are admitted to hospital. Ensuring that they are given appropriate and timely access to the range of hospital and community medical, rehabilitation and social care facilities has become more difficult due to the complexity of management options now available, and limited senior medical staff time. METHODS:we established a scheme in which specialist nurses made first assessments of all inter-departmental referrals to a hospital department of geriatric medicine. We evaluated the scheme prospectively using process and outcome data. RESULTS:2825 new patients were seen by two nurses in the first two years, an average of 5.4 per weekday (range 0-17). Mean time from admission to referral was 9 days. Most referrals were seen within 1 day. Mean total length of hospital stay was 43 days (range 1-351). Seven percent died on the referring ward, and 31% were discharged directly from the referring ward. Almost half were accepted for in-patient rehabilitation. Sixty percent of these were discharged home. Thirteen percent were transferred to an acute geriatric medical or stroke ward. One-quarter of these died. Senior medical review was requested in 8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:nurses could select patients suitable for rehabilitation, identify those requiring on-going acute in-patient care, and make arrangements for supported direct discharges where appropriate. This model facilitated access to a wide array of discharge and community support schemes, and supported the efficient use of consultant time.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study builds on previous research by constructing a model that tests many of the characteristics that have been found to be important predictors of formal service utilization in the past. Additional characteristics that have the potential to improve the model were tested, including care recipient characteristics, characteristics of the family caregiver, and the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient. DESIGN: Secondary analysis, logistic regression. SETTING: Survey. POPULATION: The sample used for this study was derived from the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey. This survey was the third round of a national sample of people over age 65 with functional impairments. The criterion for caregiver/care recipient dyads to be included in the sample was that the primary caregiver had to be a family member who was not paid for caregiving. The majority of the care recipients in the study were women, with ages ranging from 65 to 106 years. Seventy-two percent of the caregivers resided with the care recipient. INTERVENTIONS: The questionnaire for the survey included a screening section, a community survey, an institutional survey, and an informal caregivers questionnaire. Interviews were completed on 4,463 elders residing in the community, with 1,006 of their informal caregivers completing the informal caregivers survey portion of the interview. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of formal service utilization in the home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Eight care recipient variables were important predictors of formal care in the home. Limitations in ADLs, as expected, emerged as an important predictor, with elders having a 1.5 increased odds of utilizing formal services for each limitation in ADL. Living arrangement was an important predictor of formal care; elders who lived in elderly housing had a 3.5 times greater odds of utilizing formal services than those who did not. Other care recipient variables that had a significant positive effect on the utilization of formal services included increasing age, being female, and whether or not the elder had been hospitalized within the past year. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study help to define the complexity of predicting formal home service utilization by family caregivers and care recipients. Clearly, the most important characteristics to consider are those related to the care recipient, but characteristics of the caregiver also are important. It is interesting to note that medical diagnoses, physical impairments, and use of assistive devices had no effect on the use of formal care. Further research is needed to improve the model of formal service use presented. Despite changes that have occurred in the health care delivery system since these data were collected in 1989, the characteristics of caregivers and elder care recipients are not expected to have changed drastically since that time. Future efforts should be focused on identifying additional characteristics of the caregiver and care recipient, as well as descriptors that better capture the complexity of the family relationship, for the purpose of improving the model.

        <ab>This article illuminates the difficulties involved in conducting a multisite case study of different health services. It confines itself to describing the initial phase of such an inquiry. It argues that both the methodological and the content-related complexity of such research places great theoretical constraints on the researcher. Such constraints should not be resolved by simply applying some pregiven theory. It is shown how theoretical constraints arise in the need to formulate some notion of comparability for the different sites under investigation. Because such comparability is conceptualized mainly in a confrontation with the empirical data, the description of the process contains several reformulations of the research problem, taking note of various pitfalls and stumbling blocks. Finally, the general results of the pilot study are reported.</ab>

        <ab>Current Canadian health policy is based on the implicit assumption that women are available to provide care in the home to the dependent, the ill, the elderly, and the physically and mentally disabled. Women are socialized from birth to accept caring roles within a traditional family structure, and current societal expectations and social policy reinforce this value system. Women's health can only be understood within the context of their lived experience of social inequity, medicalization, and family caregiving. Health care professionals are complicit in sustaining women's oppression by reinforcing these institutions of social control. For health policy to be responsive to women's needs, it must be based on research that considers the social complexity of ordinary women's lives.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to present a multidisciplinary model for use with elderly families in crisis and decision making. The application of systems in family assessment theory is outlined in order to understand the complexities of family assessment and decision making. A schematic family assessment and decision-making model is discussed. These models identify what the problem is, the family structure and supports, and possible interventions and evaluation. Ineffective processing strategies such as regression and premature closure are reviewed, and strategies for effective decision making are outlined.</ab>

        <ab>Australian health and welfare services have developed in an ad hoc fashion. In response to demands by interested groups within the community, governments have relied on fiscal control and political expediency to regulate the growth of services and benefits. The lack of comprehensive policies and adequate planning has resulted in legislative complexity and administrative fragmentation, which has adversely affected the development of effective health and welfare services for the elderly Australian. The nature of these difficulties is discussed and recommendations are made for their resolution.</ab>
