        <ab>Nurses working in the long-term care (LTC) setting provide increasingly complex patient care, often without formal training on the specific needs of LTC patients, which can lead to burnout and high turnover rates. Nurse residency programs (NRPs) have been used effectively to orient novice RNs to their work setting, address transition-to-practice challenges, and promote retention, yet few LTC NRPs have been developed. The University of Utah Geriatric Education Consortium Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program created an online LTC NRP to provide LTC nurses with the knowledge and skills to succeed in the LTC environment. RNs with &lt;1 year of LTC experience were paired with experienced nurse mentors working within the same LTC facility. Synchronous and asynchronous curricular modules addressed leadership and communication, caring for older adult patients, quality improvement, and the LTC regulatory environment. A distance-based LTC NRP allows nurses flexibility in gaining gerontological nursing and leadership expertise that supports their professional goals.

        <ab>• We report the "hidden" characteristics that influence geriatric model implementation. • Leadership, planning, and champions are associated with successful implementation. • Staff turnover, lack of resources, and competing demands are implementation barriers. • Reported contextual and organizational attributes may guide future implementers. • Findings highlight complexities of geriatric model uptake, adaptation, and sustainability. Systems Addressing Frail Elders (SAFETM) Care is a geriatric model of care that identifies high-risk hospitalized older adults, and provides targeted interprofessional interventions for risk factors associated with frailty. This post, mixed methods study sought to evaluate SAFETM Care implementation retrospectively at one public academic medical center and describe practical "real-world" considerations for implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). In addition to barriers and facilitators, hidden characteristics to consider for implementation include initiating conditions, skills and experiences of implementers, interpersonal challenges, unique facilitators and barriers, surprising conditions, and threats to and requirements for sustainability. Implementation of SAFETM Care demonstrated effective adoption and implementation, but faced multiple threats that led to failed sustainability. The public sharing of these successes and failures will help implementers understand and make progress in adapting such important geriatric programs and quality improvement initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Why you should read this article: • To gain insight into the complexity of NHS continuing healthcare (CHC) assessments • To reflect on what skills and knowledge are required for the optimal assessment of an older person's eligibility for CHC • To understand the training and development needs of nurses involved in CHC-associated work Background: Nurses in England play a prominent role in NHS continuing healthcare (CHC) assessments, but there are no overview data on their knowledge and educational needs. Aim: An online survey was conducted to identify the educational status and development needs of nurses involved in CHC assessments. Method: The survey was informed by a literature review and focus group discussions, and distributed via email to the members of the Royal College of Nursing older people's forum. Descriptive data analysis was undertaken. Results: Overall, respondents were confident about their ability to undertake CHC-associated work and manage each aspect of the CHC process. However, respondents were less confident about how to determine whether a primary health need exists based on the four main criteria – nature, complexity, intensity and unpredictability – of a person's health and social care needs. This was one of the respondents' priorities for training and development. Conclusion: The survey demonstrates the importance of face-to-face and multidisciplinary CHC training delivered locally. It also confirms the need for a standardised approach and more consistency in the CHC assessment process. A CHC competency framework would contribute to standardise the process and benefit all involved.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To explore 'missed care' in relation to primary and community settings, including nursing homes, and to build an understanding of implications for patients, public, politicians and policymakers. Background: Missed care occurs when any aspect of required patient care is omitted or delayed. Little attention has examined missed care in primary, community and nursing home settings. Methods: Systematic review of the literature. Searches were conducted of PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar (July 2018). The quality of empirical studies was appraised using CASP and SURE tools. Results: The search identified 15 metrics papers (2004–2019) and eight empirical papers (2015–2018) (five studies). Empirical studies were rated as good quality. Missed care impacts on safety in community/primary care contexts and differs from acute care. Causes of missed care include acuity, complexity of cases, volume of care and organisational factors. Metrics have been adapted to community/nursing home settings but not in a standardised way. Tools are required to evaluate missed care within a culture of personal reflection and quality improvement. Conclusion: The prominence of missed acute care should not distract from its impact in primary, community and nursing home settings. Nurse leaders should consider causes for missed care, and how it is conceptualized and evaluated. Implications for Nursing Management: This review offers evidence for exploring, measuring and evaluating missed care locally.</ab>

        <ab>Nursing students' positive attitudes towards ageing and older people are central to developing person-centred care. Perceptions about older people are influenced by social and generational values and beliefs, including a general understanding that older people need to be cared for. Nursing students often undertake early clinical placements in aged care settings, where residents' needs are complex, yet the nursing experience is often considered 'basic' care. Illustrating that older people have rich personal histories and are valuable contributors to society can balance students' perceptions and expectations and outcomes of clinical placements. Educational interventions using photo-elicitation and in-depth dialogue may surface students' assumptions and challenge their misperceptions of older people before the first clinical placement. To examine the impact of the innovative Depth of Field : Exploring Ageing © (DOF) resource as preparation for nursing students' clinical placement in residential aged care facilities. Mixed methods, block randomised controlled study with first year students. Students attending clinical laboratory groups received either usual preparation (control, n = 108) or DOF plus usual preparation (intervention, n = 99). Pre/post surveys included: Geriatric Attitudes Scale (GAS) and demographics. Eight students from the intervention group participated in focus groups post-clinical. Groups were similar at baseline. There were statistically significant changes following the intervention (p ≤.05) for 9/13 individual GAS items and difference in overall mean scores (intervention group: M = 0.26; SD = 0.27; control group: M = 0.01; SD = 0.27). Focus group themes included: preconceptions toward older people ; feelings of being emotionally unprepared ; and perceptions of the DOF intervention in preparing students to connect with the older person. The DOF vignette provided opportunity for students to preflect on ageing. Translation to practice was evidenced with students seeing beyond residents' physical care requirements to the value of connecting with the older person's story to facilitate person-centred care. The DOF intervention assisted students to adopt positive attitudes and a broader perspective of older people, as preparation for placement in residential aged care facilities.</ab>

        <ab>Despite efforts to incorporate information about older people in pre-licensure nursing programs, there are inconsistent results from studies examining student nurses' perceptions towards the aging population. There is research suggesting that healthcare settings and nursing practice is perpetuating negative perspectives towards older people. To gain an understanding of how social contexts are influencing student nurses' experiences when learning to work with older people. Descriptive case study guided by the theoretical framework of social learning theory. A university in Western Canada that offers a pre-licensure nursing program. 28 student nurses and 13 faculty in the nursing program. Participant interviews and focus groups were conducted with nursing faculty and students. Key findings from this study are that students' previous experiences with older people, through family or work experiences, and their first clinical experience in long- term care negatively influenced their perceptions about working with older people. Clinical nurses and faculty influenced students' perceptions about nursing practice with older people, sometimes in subtle ways, underscoring that students are learning from what they see and hear in practice. Students were ill-prepared for the complexity of the aging population, particularly those with cognitive impairment. Learning activities that engage students in active learning, such as simulation, providing students with a positive lexicon of how to describe older patients, and more overt attention to the perspectives students and faculty bring to the learning environment need to be carefully explored. Meaningful learning experiences with older people in multiple contexts are needed to thoughtfully plan how to disrupt negative perceptions that might emerge through the nursing education program.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To profile changes in older women accessing home nursing between 2006 and 2015, focussing on living circumstances. Methods: Data pertaining to Australian women aged 55+ who accessed a home nursing service between 2006 and 2015 were analysed, stratified by living status. Comparisons were made between the years 2006 and 2015; rates and relative rates of use per 1000 clients were calculated. Results: Fewer women lived alone in 2015 compared with 2006. Women were older, less likely to be born in Australia, speak English at home, had more diagnoses and higher average Charlson Comorbidity Index scores in 2015. Relative rates of service use for older women living with others increased slightly over the 10 years, while decreasing by 13% for those living alone. Conclusion: Women using home nursing services are older than previously, more medically complex, more likely to be born from countries other than Australia and speak a preferred language other than English.</ab>

        <ab>To revitalize nursing science, there is a need for a new approach to guide nurse scientists in addressing complex problems in health care. By applying theoretical concepts from a revolutionary philosopher of science, Paul K. Feyerabend, new nursing knowledge can be produced using creativity and pluralistic approaches. Feyerabend proposed that methods within and outside of science can produce knowledge. Despite the recognition of Feyerabendian philosophy within science, there is currently a lack of literature regarding the relevance of Feyerabendian philosophy for nursing science. We aim to (a) describe and critique Feyerabendian concepts, (b) discuss the potential application of Feyerabendian philosophy for knowledge production within gerontological nursing and (c) describe theoretical possibilities for nurse scientists in using Feyerabendian philosophy to guide nursing knowledge development. We begin by introducing Feyerabend's life and his inspirations for his theoretical concepts, epistemological anarchism, theoretical pluralism and humanitarianism, and conclude by offering suggestions of how to apply Feyerabendian philosophy in nursing research.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults use the Emergency Department (ED) more than any other age group besides infants. Despite high utilization, both the physical environment and care processes in the traditional ED are poorly suited to address the complex needs of older adults. As a result, older adults often experience poor outcomes in the ED. Geriatric nursing has been at the forefront of efforts to develop Geriatric Emergency Department Interventions (GEDI's) to try to address these deficits and improve care. As frontline providers with frequent patient contact, nursing brings critical viewpoints to these issues. This article provides some resources and other ideas for how frontline nurses can improve care for older adults in the ED. Ultimately, to have meaningful impacts on care of older adults in the ED, there is a dire need for greater financial investment specific to geriatric nursing education, training, and research in the ED.</ab>

        <ab>Pragmatic trials occur within the complexity of real-world care delivery, and when effective, contribute to more rapid translation into practice because of their greater generalizability. Research with older adults is complex when participants have chronic conditions and multiple comorbidities. Often pragmatic trials introduce a novel intervention and try to determine whether it offers a benefit beyond the usual or routine care provided. Researchers commonly focus attention on describing the intervention, yet the comparator condition of usual or routine care can be anything but standard, reducing the effect size of the intervention and introducing threats to the overall validity of the study. The current article describes clinical trial guidelines, then illustrates the complexity of characterizing usual care for interventions addressing type 2 diabetes. The authors provide recommendations for improving description of usual care and discuss implications for gerontological nursing research.

        <ab>With the increase in the elderly population, the need for emergency services also increases. Geriatric patients in the emergency room are important in terms of having more complex problems than other patients, being more fragile and requiring longer follow-up. Geriatric syndrome refers to the clinical conditions and symptoms that are common in elderly patients, mostly manifested by atypical symptoms and which cannot be fully explained by the definition of the disease, which can negatively affect the quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. Many clinical conditions such as malnutrition, sarcopenia, delirium, fall, incontinence, polypharmacy, osteoporosis and pressure wound are defined under the title of geriatric syndromes. The purpose of this review is for the nurses working in the emergency department, in the geriatric age group who applied to the emergency departments; is to raise awareness about geriatric syndromes, which are often the reason for emergency referral, in order to recognize and evaluate the frequency of geriatric syndrome. In summary, the emergency nurse takes an important place in detecting and noticing conditions such as falls, delirium, incontinence, pressure sores that geriatric patients may frequently encounter. By monitoring the geriatric patients in the emergency room and carefully observing the possible health risks only because of staying in the emergency room, better care results can be obtained in geriatric patients.</ab>
        <ab>Yaşlı nüfusun artmasıyla birlikte acil hizmetlere gereksinim de artmaktadır. Acil serviste geriatrik hastalar; diğer hastalardan daha kompleks sorunlara sahip olması, daha kırılgan olması ve daha uzun süre izlem gerektirmesi açısından önemlidir. Geriatrik sendrom; yaşlı hastalarda sık görülen, çoğunlukla atipik semptomlarla kendini gösteren ve hastalık tanımı ile tam olarak açıklanamayan, yaşam kalitesini olumsuz etkileyerek morbidite ve mortaliteyi artırabilen klinik durumları ve semptomları ifade etmektedir. Geriatrik sendromlar başlığı altında malnütrisyon, sarkopeni, deliryum, düşme, inkontinans, polifarmasi, osteoporoz ve basınç yarası gibi birçok klinik durum tanımlanmaktadır. Bu çalışmanın amacı; acil serviste çalışan hemşirelerin, acil servislere başvuran geriatrik yaş grubundaki hastalarda; geriatrik sendrom sıklığını tanımaları, fark etmeleri ve değerlendirmeleri için sıklıkla acile başvuru nedeni olan geriatrik sendromlarla ilgili farkındalık oluşturmaktır. Özetle, acil servis hemşiresi, geriatrik hastaların sıklıkla karşılaşabilecekleri düşme, deliryum, inkontinans, bası yaraları gibi durumların saptanması ve fark edilmesinde önemli bir noktada yer almaktadır. Hemşirelerin, acil serviste izlenen geriatrik hastaların sadece acil servis ortamında bulunması nedeni ile bile, gelişebilecek olası riskler açısından daha dikkatli olması ile geriatrik hastalarda daha kaliteli bakım sonuçları elde edilebilir.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: There are over 400,000 people over 65 in UK care homes, three times the number than that in acute hospitals. They are amongst the frailest in our community, with average life expectancy of 15 months once in the home. Their needs are often complex and challenging, which when unmet, often result in unwanted and unnecessary hospital admissions. Imperial College Healthcare Trust (ICHT), along with funding from Health Education England (HEE), have introduced a care home liaison nurse. The aim is to bridge the boundaries, making a significant difference to cross organisation communication and support. Methods: The care home liaison nurse manages a frailty liaison service with the largest local nursing care home. This home has 140 residents with complex needs. The care home liaison nurse provides a point of contact for advice, guidance and support for individual patient pathways, she provides face to face assessment and treatment or verbal advice. In addition, the nurse supports discharge from the acute setting. This direct contact allows rapid access to specialist advice, and aims to build confidence both within the care home team and within the acute team, that the patients’ needs can be met in their own surroundings. Results: The preliminary data demonstrates a positive impact this role is having both to the acute trust and most importantly patient’s experience. Comparing ICHT data from April-May 2018 to April-May 2019 it showing that the number of avoidable admissions has decreased from 54.3% to 37.5%, length of stay when patients are admitted has decreased from 11.7 days to 6.5 days, and the number of patients with an advanced care plan has risen 14.9%. Feedback from nursing staff at the care centre as well as that from patients and families has been overwhelmingly positive. Conclusions: The role is still in the pilot phase. Given the already positive impact it is hoped that it will continue and expand into other care homes and extra sheltered accommodations.</ab>

        <ab>• Our health care system is facing unprecedented challenges in caring for older adults. • Nurses are called to assume leadership roles in implementing evidence-based care. • Educational enhancements and system-level infrastructure are needed. Our health care system is facing unprecedented and complex challenges in caring for older adults and their families. A paradigm shift is needed that recognizes new roles and competencies for nurses to play a leadership role in the design and implementation of high value care models. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a series of recommendations for leveraging nurses to generate innovative tools and solutions for the delivery of value-based care for older adults living with complex health and social needs and their families. These recommendations were generated by a Think-Tank of national experts based on review of current evidence and focus groups with older adults. The generated recommendations focus on positioning nurses to assume leadership roles in implementing evidence-based care models, preparing nurses to serve as health innovators and catalysts of system transformation, and fostering system-level infrastructure that leverages the contributions of nurses for current and emerging roles. Nurses as innovators can address the challenges in providing high quality care for older adults with complex needs and their families. System-level infrastructure, including resources for training and implementation of well-established programs, is necessary to leverage the contributions of nurses and facilitate innovative approaches to care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The implementation of complex interventions, such as kinaesthetics, presents challenges for long-term care institutions. Implementation models, e.g. the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), have been shown to help institutions with the implementation; however, the use of the CFIR requires a certain degree of openness in terms of possible additional influencing factors. Objective: Based on expert interviews the aim was to examine whether the influencing factors named in the CFIR are applicable to the implementation of kinaesthetics or whether additional aspects must be taken into consideration in the implementation due to the complex nature of kinaesthetics. Method: The qualitative study analyzed guided interviews with experts using the qualitative content analysis according to Schreier. Results: Overall, the CFIR highlights comprehensive influencing factors which should be considered when implementing kinaesthetics in long-term care institutions. The experts identified significantly fewer influencing factors than contained in the CFIR. In particular they neglected factors related to the implementation process and the intervention itself; however, some of the influencing factors described in the CFIR could be substantiated by the results of the expert opinions. Conclusion: The results provided an initial impression regarding the implementation of kinaesthetics in long-term care institutions in Switzerland. Due to the discrepancy in identifying influencing factors, it can be recommended that leaders and stakeholders need to be trained in strategies for the successful and sustainable implementation of kinaesthetics.</ab>
        <ab>Zusammenfassung: Hintergrund: Die Implementierung komplexer Interventionen, z. B. Kinästhetik, stellt stationäre Langzeitpflegeinstitutionen vor Herausforderungen. Implementierungsmodelle, wie der Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), sollen Institutionen bei diesen Implementierungsprozessen unterstützen. Allerdings erfordert deren Anwendung ein gewisses Maß an Offenheit in Bezug auf mögliche zusätzliche Einflussfaktoren. Ziel: Ziel ist, mittels Experteninterviews zu prüfen, ob die im CFIR genannten Einflussfaktoren umfassend den Implementierungsprozess von Kinästhetik abdecken, oder ob aufgrund der komplexen Eigenschaften von Kinästhetik zusätzliche Aspekte bei der Implementierung beachtet werden müssen. Methodik: Die qualitative Studie analysiert leitfadengestützte Interviews mit Expertinnen und Experten mittels der qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse nach Schreier. Ergebnisse: Insgesamt zeigt sich, dass der CFIR umfassend mögliche Einflussfaktoren, die bei der Implementierung von Kinästhetik berücksichtigt werden sollten, abdeckt. Die Expertinnen und Experten benennen deutlich weniger als die im CFIR aufgeführten Einflussfaktoren, insbesondere solche, die sich auf den Implementierungsprozess und Kinästhetik als Intervention beziehen. Trotzdem konnten manche im CFIR beschriebenen Einflussfaktoren durch die Interviewaussagen konkretisiert werden. Schlussfolgerung: Die Interviews liefern einen ersten Eindruck bezüglich der Implementierung von Kinästhetik in Schweizer Langzeitpflegeeinrichtungen. Der Vergleich mit dem CFIR weist jedoch darauf hin, dass Personen in leitenden Positionen stärker hinsichtlich Implementierungsstrategien und deren Anwendung in Bezug auf die erfolgreiche und nachhaltige Implementierung von Kinästhetik geschult werden sollten.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: Nursing home (NH) residents with complex care needs ask for attentive monitoring of changes and appropriate in‐house decision making. However, access to geriatric expertise is often limited with a lack of geriatricians, general practitioners, and/or nurses with advanced clinical skills, leading to potentially avoidable hospitalizations. This situation calls for the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative, contextually adapted nurse‐led care models that support NHs in improving their quality of care and reducing hospitalizations by investing in effective clinical leadership, geriatric expertise, and care coordination. DESIGN: An effectiveness‐implementation hybrid type 2 design to assess clinical outcomes of a nurse‐led care model and a mixed‐method approach to evaluate implementation outcomes will be applied. The model development, tailoring, and implementation are based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). SETTING: NHs in the German‐speaking region of Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven NHs were recruited. The sample size was estimated assuming an average of.8 unplanned hospitalizations/1000 resident days and a reduction of 25% in NHs with the nurse‐led care model. INTERVENTION: The multilevel complex context‐adapted intervention consists of six core elements (eg, specifically trained INTERCARE nurses or evidence‐based tools like Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation [ISBAR]). Multilevel implementation strategies include leadership and INTERCARE nurse training and support. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes are unplanned hospitalizations/1000 care days. Secondary outcomes include unplanned emergency department visits, quality indicators (eg, physical restraint use), and costs. Implementation outcomes included, for example, fidelity to the model's core elements. CONCLUSION: The INTERCARE study will provide evidence about the effectiveness of a nurse‐led care model in the real‐world setting and accompanying implementation strategies.

        <ab>Background: Depressive symptoms and/or depression are commonly experienced by older people. Both are underdiagnosed, undertreated and regularly overlooked by healthcare professionals. Healthcare facilities for people aged ≥75 years have been in place in Sweden since 2015. The aim of these care centres, which are managed by registered nurses (RNs), is to offer care adjusted to cater to the complex needs and health problems of older people. Although the mental health of older people is prioritised in these centres, research into the experience of RNs of depressive symptoms and/or depression in older people in this setting is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to illuminate RNs, working at care centres for older people, experience of identifying and intervening in cases of depressive symptoms. Methods: The data for this qualitative descriptive study were collected through interviews (n = 10) with RNs working at 10 care centres for older people in southern Sweden. The transcribed texts were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results: The participants' experiences could be understood from four predominant themes: (1) challenging to identify, (2) described interventions, (3) prerequisites for identification, and (4) contextual influences. Key findings were that it was difficult to identify depression as it often manifested as physical symptoms; evidence-based nursing interventions were generally not the first-line treatment used; trust, continuity and the ability of RNs to think laterally; and the context influenced the ability of RNs to manage older people's depressive symptoms and/or depression. Conclusions: The process of identifying depressive symptoms and performing an appropriate intervention was found to be complex, especially as older people were reluctant to present at the centres and provided obscure reasons for doing so. A nurse-patient relationship that was built on trust and was characterised by continuity of care was identified as a necessary prerequisite. Appropriate nursing interventions—afforded the same status as pharmacological treatment—are warranted as the first-line treatment of depression. Further research is also needed into efficacious nursing interventions targeting depressive symptoms and/or depression.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Unexplained absences (UAs) contribute to the mortality and morbidity rates in the nursing home (NH) population. Valuing expert professional knowledge and skills is central to the achievement of improved care in NHs. This study developed and prioritised recommendations to prevent deaths of NH residents (NHRs) with UAs. Methods: Two expert consultation forums using the modified nominal group technique to develop recommendations were conducted, followed by an online survey to prioritise the most important recommendations for implementation. A framework applying the temporal dimension ("pre‐event," "event" and "post‐event") of an internationally accepted injury prevention framework, Haddon's Matrix, was applied to the recommendations. Participants were purposively sampled and identified via aged care organisations; and were selected based on their experience in aged care practice, policy, research, elder rights, seniors' law, or missing persons search and rescue (SAR). Results: Forum one comprised six, and forum two comprised nine experts from mixed disciplines. Seven participants completed the online survey. Twenty recommendations to prevent future injury and death were developed, five of which were prioritised for implementation in the aged care sector. In order of priority, these include: universal UA definition; mandated SAR plan, early assessment of NHRs; unmet needs behavioural assessments; and participation in decision‐making. Conclusions: The recommendations cover the broad spectrum of complex issues raised in managing unexplained absences, and are a vital first step towards informing care providers, governments and SAR teams about how to prevent injury and death of NHRs in residents with UAs. Future research should explore how to translate and evaluate the recommendations into practice.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The work situation for first‐line managers in elderly care is complex and challenging. Little is known about these managers' work situation from a structural and psychological empowerment perspective. Aim: To describe first‐line managers' experiences of their work situation in elderly care from a structural and psychological empowerment perspective. Method: Interviews from 14 female first‐line managers were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The theme described the managers' work situation as "It's not easy, but it's worth it." In the four subthemes, the managers described their work in terms of "Enjoying a meaningful job," "A complex and demanding responsibility that allows great authority within set boundaries," "Supported by other persons, organisational preconditions and confidence in their own abilities" and "Lacking organisational preconditions, but developing strategies for dealing with the situations." Conclusion: The managers described having various amounts of access to structural empowerment and experienced a feeling of meaning, competence, self‐determination and impact, that is, psychological empowerment in their work. Implications for nursing management: It is vital that first‐line managers have access to organisational support. Therefore, upper management and first‐line managers need to engage in continuous dialogue to customize the support given to each first‐line manager.</ab>

        <ab>People in nursing and residential homes are more likely to suffer frailty. Registered nurses are a crucial component of the care delivery service and can offer support to patients who have complex care needs and comorbidities and are at risk of unplanned admissions to secondary care. This article explores frailty and the role of the nurse in assessing for frailty. Three aspects of patient care—nutrition status, polypharmacy and exercise and cognitive function—are discussed as areas where nurses can target their interventions in order to support those considered as frail, aiming to reduce the impact of frailty and negative health outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older people are frequent users of primary health care (PHC) services. PHC services have been critiqued, mainly regarding limited accessibility and continuity of care. In many countries, investment in nurse practitioners (NPs) has been one strategy to improve PHC services. In the North of Europe, the NP role is still in its infancy. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of introducing geriatric nurse practitioners (GNPs) in PHC in Scandinavia, from multiprofessional and older persons' perspectives. Methods: The study had a qualitative design, including 25 semi-structured interviews with nurses, nurse leaders, physicians, politicians and older persons from several communities in Scandinavia. The material was analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. Results: The results highlight current challenges in health services for the older population, i.e. comorbid older patients with complex care needs aging in place, lack of competent staff, and organisational challenges. The results present an envisioned GNP scope of practice in health services for the older population, including bringing advanced competence closer to the patient, an autonomous role including task-shifting, and a linking role. The results also present factors influencing implementation of the GNP role, i.e. GNP competence level, unclear role and scope of practice, and openness to reorganisation. Conclusions: The results indicate that it is feasible to implement the GNP role in primary health care in Scandinavia. Notwithstanding, there are factors influencing implementation of the GNP role that should be considered.</ab>

        <ab>Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, p =.048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p =.016). A significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p =.002), and a significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p =.040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current practice model.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To explore nurse and nursing assistant reflections on the care of older patients with cognitive impairment who have experienced a fall. Background: While there are evidence‐based clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of falls and for the care of older people with cognitive impairment, the falls rates for older people with cognitive impairment are three times as high as those without. Design: Critical incident technique. Methods: Eleven registered and two enrolled nurses and four assistants in nursing working in one subacute and two acute wards within two hospitals of a tertiary level health service in south‐east Queensland. Individual semistructured interviews focused on two past events when a patient with cognitive impairment had fallen in hospital: one when there was minimal harm and the second when there was significant harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken. The COREQ checklist was followed. Results: Three themes emerged from 23 reflective accounts of fall events: "direct observation is confounded by multiple observers" and "knowing the person has cognitive impairment is not enough," and "want to rely on the guideline but unsure how to enact it." While participants were aware of the falls prevention policy and techniques available to prevent falls, the implementation of these was challenging due to the complexity of care required by the older person with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Falls prevention for older people with cognitive impairment is complex and belies the simple application of policy. Relevance to clinical practice: To reduce falls, nurses can involve the family to support "knowing the patient" to enable prediction of impulsive actions; shift the focus of in‐service from lectures to specific case presentations, with collaborative analysis on person‐focused strategies to prevent falls in older people with cognitive impairment; and reconsider the sitter role from simple observer to assistant, focused on ambulation and supporting independence in activities of daily living.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Nursing teams work with hospitalised older people in institutions, which prioritise a biomedical model of care. This model does not fit the needs of older people because it emphasises efficacy and a narrow definition of patient safety, but does not prioritise functional needs. Nursing care is provided around the clock within the context of fiscal restraints as well as negative societal and nursing perspectives about ageing and old people. Yet, nursing perceptions of managing safety and potential harms to older patients within these hospital institutions are not well understood. Methods: An integrative review was conducted to examine nursing perspectives of safety and harm related to hospitalised older people. Results: The majority of included papers focused on restraint use. Findings reveal that nurses are using restraints and limiting mobility as strategies to manage their key priority of keeping older patients safe, reflecting a narrow conceptualisation of safety. Policy, administrative support and individual nurse characteristics influence restraint use. Safety policies that nurses interpret as preventing falls can encourage the use of restraints and limiting mobility, both of which result in functional losses to older people. Conclusions: This complex issue requires attention from clinical nurses, leaders, policy makers and researchers to shift the focus of care to preservation and restoration of function for older people in hospital as a safety priority. Implications for Practice: Clinical leaders and nursing teams should engage in developing processes of care that incorporate maintaining and restoring older people's function.</ab>

        <ab>The CARE Act, law in 40 states and territories in the United States, requires hospitals to identify and include family caregivers during admission and in preparation for discharge. Although the number of family caregivers has been steadily increasing, health care providers are ill-prepared to address their needs, and caregiving remains a neglected topic in health care providers' education. A market analysis was performed to explore the availability of and interest in interprofessional courses and programs focused on preparing health professionals to support family caregivers. Although nurses and chief nursing officers agreed on the importance of supporting caregivers, they were less likely to endorse formal educational preparation for this complex role. The current study elucidates a gap between what caregivers report they need and the preparation of health care professionals to advance family-centered approaches to care.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Healthy ageing is a multi-dimensional concept which appertains to all older adults. This study reviewed the intervention characteristics, intervention content and effectiveness of multi-dimensional healthy ageing interventions (MHAIs) addressing physical, mental and social health among independent community-dwelling older adults. A search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO for studies published from Jan 2007 to October 2016. 18 publications were included, accounting for 15 studies. The review reflected the complexity, variations and methodological considerations of developing a comprehensive MHAI. It demonstrated the possibility of integrating person-focused to environment-focused content topics in future MHAIs, beyond the physical, mental and social health dimensions. Among the reviewed studies, health education programs reported improvements in quality of life and life satisfaction while health assessment and education programs promoted positive health behaviors. Future MHAIs studies need to employ more robust research methods and greater contextual information reports to build stronger evidence base.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with frailty among the young‐old elderly (YOE) and old–old elderly (OOE). METHODS: This longitudinal study with a 3‐year follow‐up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS: Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3‐year period. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent frailty, we suggest weight‐loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower‐limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. Implications for Nursing Practice: The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.</ab>

        <ab>Objective Nurses working in aged care facilities need to be adequately prepared to manage the increasingly complex care needs of older people. This paper reports on the views of nurses on the barriers and enablers to conducting nursing assessments with older people in residential aged care, six weeks after attending a four day education and training workshop on this topic. Design Descriptive evaluation. Setting Data were collected in a range of venues in which the education was delivered. Subjects Registered (RNs) and enrolled (ENs) nurses (n= 345) working in residential aged care facilities in Victoria, Australia. Findings Fourteen barriers and eight enablers, which affect the capacity of nurses to conduct assessments with older people, were identified. The most common cited barriers included lack of time (78%), residents' poor state of health (41%) and the absence of equipment (33%). Common enablers were organisational support (38%); staff education and training (29%); having the appropriate equipment (22%); positive staff attitudes (17%) and the resident's condition and cooperation (16%). Conclusion Nursing assessments are vital to the delivery of quality and evidence based aged care. The issues identified provide aged care services and managers with a basis for ensuring that nurses have the necessary preparation, training and ongoing support to perform the appropriate and required assessments to provide the best possible care.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Emergency services are faced with people over the age of 75 whose frailty leads to states of agitation. Objective: To improve the quality of the care of this situation through the invention of an advanced practice nurse. Method: A phenomenological and monocentric study from interviews with professionals intervening in emergencies about the difficulties they encountered. A thematic tree was constructed once the interviews were transcribed and coded. Results: Five themes emerged from nine interviews, including: definition of agitation, its causes, and contributing factors. The consequences, the risks for the elderly, and the impact on care. The significance of this phenomenon. The link between agitation and frailty. Difficulties and possible measures to improve care. Discussion: The data collected correspond to the data featuring in the literature and allow advanced practice nurses to pinpoint their actions. Conclusion: Advanced practice nurses can contribute to improving the care of the agitated elderly through primary and secondary prevention.</ab>
        <ab>Introduction : les personnes âgées fragiles de plus de 75 ans ont de plus en plus recours aux services d'urgence ; leur état de fragilité conduit souvent à des situations d'agitation qui soulèvent des questions de prise en soins particulièrement complexes. Objectif : comprendre la situation des personnes âgées, fragiles et agitées dans les services d'urgence et examiner la possibilité d'améliorer la qualité des soins avec l'intervention d'une infirmière de pratique avancée. Méthode : étude exploratoire, descriptive qualitative, s'appuyant sur la réalisation de neuf entretiens semidirectifs auprès de professionnels intervenant aux urgences et sur l'observation de situations de soins dans ces services. L'analyse est fondée sur l'élaboration d'un arbre thématique et l'examen de la signification des phénomènes observés. Résultats : cinq thèmes émergent des entretiens : définition de l'agitation, causes et facteurs favorisants, conséquences, risques pour la personne âgée et impact sur les soins. Les contenus des entretiens permettent d'identifier la signification du phénomène, le lien entre agitation et fragilité, les difficultés et les mesures possibles permettant d'améliorer la prise en charge. Discussion : les résultats rejoignent ceux de la littérature et permettent à l'infirmière de pratique avancée d'identifier sa contribution à la gestion de ces situations complexes. Conclusion : la fragilité étant un processus réversible, la pratique infirmière avancée pourra améliorer la qualité des soins dispensés aux personnes âgées fragiles et agitées aux urgences.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: The aim of this literature review is to synthesise and analyse the literature pertinent to the RN's competence and confidence to undertake the leadership role when working in residential aged care facilities after‐hours and to determine any association of leadership with quality resident outcomes. Background: Registered nurses (RNs) working in Residential Aged Care Facilities are required to undertake complex management tasks including leading nursing care teams, supervising non‐nursing staff and allocating workloads according to residents' care needs, staff skills and experience. Registered nurses plan, assess, manage medication, evaluate each resident's care, liaise with doctors and allied health professionals and are responsible for evidence‐based practice in accordance with the Nursing Standards for Practice (2016). Researchers have commented that effective nurse leadership can improve quality of care, improved resident outcomes and reduce adverse events. Design: A review of original research papers based on the structured methodology described by Kable, Pich, and Maslin‐Prothero (Nurse Education Today, 32, 2012, 878‐886). Methods: The review was conducted according to the 12‐step structured framework by Kable et al. (Nurse Education Today, 32, 2012, 878‐886). The search included peer‐reviewed papers published between 2002–2017 on RN leadership after‐hours, factors contributing to or with relationships to nursing leadership. Nineteen papers were found that researched the impact of leadership in aged care settings. Results: The literature review concluded that nursing leadership has been linked to the quality of care and clinical outcomes in the aged care setting. However, RNs in the aged care setting have limited opportunities to develop key leadership competencies and confidence in order to meet the many challenges found in this environment due to lack of access to aged‐care‐specific leadership education. Minimal publications address the importance of the leadership of after‐hours RNs. Results from this literature review will inform future research in this area. Conclusion: Nineteen papers identified the leadership required of RNs in aged care settings. However, limited research investigating the association between nursing leadership and clinical outcomes was found. The findings from this literature review suggest that leadership in the aged care setting may be facilitated through specific educational activities such as RN shadowing shifts, continuing professional development, working with peers and by demonstrating and practising leadership competencies. Based on the literature reviewed, a need for more research in this area is required. In a specific manner, research into RN leadership, competence and confidence in aged care facilities after‐hours is needed. Relevance to clinical practice: Registered nurses working in the aged care setting after‐hours need access to leadership education. Better quality of care, improved resident outcomes and reduced adverse events are associated with sound leadership.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Care of older adults in the community is becoming increasingly complex. However, nursing staff often has insufficient knowledge and skills to adequately address the needs of frail older adults. There is therefore a need for nurses with advanced qualifications. To meet this need, advanced geriatric nursing has been introduced in Norway. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses with their new role as advanced geriatric nurses in care of older adults and to determine what strategies the nurses considered important in the development of their new role. Design: This study applied a descriptive, exploratory design. Methods: In‐depth interviews were conducted with 21 nurses who had undergone an educational programme to become advanced geriatric nurses in Norway in 2016. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The participants described a complex and extensive nursing role, which they related to a new understanding of the patients, relatives and the system in which they worked. This new gaze had developed based on a combination of their new knowledge, their skills, experiences and professional interests. The opportunities to use their role depended on their workplace conditions. They related to contextual challenges at their workplace in different ways to optimise the use of their new gaze. Conclusions: Common for all participants was a broader and deeper understanding of the patient's health and life situation, which guided participants' actions. The key issue in developing the new role was developing effective strategies to foster role integration. Implications for Practice: Advanced geriatric nurses should collaborate with their managers to create a role that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills, as well as collaborate with colleagues to enhance understanding of utilisation of their role.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Due to the high morbidity and disability level among diabetes patients in nursing homes, the conditions for caregivers are exceedingly complex and challenging. The patient safety culture in nursing homes should be evaluated in order to improve patient safety and the quality of care. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the perceptions of patient safety culture of nursing personnel in nursing homes, and its associations with the participants' (i) profession, (ii) education, (iii) specific knowledge related to their own residents with diabetes, and (iv) familiarity with clinical diabetes guidelines for older people. Methods: Cross-sectional survey design. The study included 89 nursing home personnel (38 registered nurses and 51 nurse aides), 25 (28%) with advanced education, at two nursing homes. We collected self-reported questionnaire data on age, profession, education and work experience, diabetes knowledge and familiarity with diabetes guidelines. In addition, we applied the Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture instrument, with 42 items and 12 dimensions. Results: In general, those with advanced education scored higher in all patient safety culture dimensions than those without, however statistically significant only for the dimensions "teamwork" (mean score 81.7 and 67.7, p = 0.042) and "overall perceptions of resident safety" (mean score 90.0 and 74.3, p = 0.016). Nursing personnel who were familiar with diabetes guidelines for older people had more positive perceptions in key areas of patient safety culture, than those without familiarity with the guidelines. Conclusions: The findings from this study show that advanced education and familiarity with current diabetes guidelines was related to adequate evaluations on essential areas of patient safety culture in nursing homes.</ab>

        <ab>The challenge of caring for patients with fragility fractures is particularly acute for nursing teams who are in short supply and work with patients following fracture on a 24 h basis, coordinating as well as providing complex care. This paper considers the role of nurses within the orthogeriatric team and highlights the value of effective nursing care in patient outcomes. It explores the nature of nursing for patients with fragility fracture with a focus on the provision of safe and effective care and the coordination of care across the interdisciplinary team. It also highlights the need for specific skills in orthopaedic and geriatric nursing as well as specialist education.</ab>

        <ab>A venous leg ulcer (VLU) is defined as the loss of skin below the knee on the leg or foot in the presence of venous disease, which takes more than two weeks to heal. The prevalence of VLUs is increasing, especially in older people, which will increase the demand for nursing care. Development of a lower leg ulcer should trigger immediate assessment of risk factors for chronic venous disease followed by action to identify the cause and initiate treatment, which should prevent progression to more complex and chronic problems. Justification for choice of appropriate wound management and application of compression therapy should be based on the assessment and diagnosis. Management of patients with VLUs can be cyclical and lifelong, which highlights the importance of helping patients to understand the rationale for management strategies so that cooperation in self-care is achieved.</ab>

        <ab>Current international research suggests universities providing nursing education should focus on shifting students' attitudes towards valuing clinical learning derived from aged care settings, offering support and education for aged care facility staff supervising nursing students’ learning in the aged care setting, and encouraging nursing graduates to consider pursuing careers in gerontology nursing. Against this international backdrop, one Australian School of Nursing designed a structured clinical learning experience to offer final year nursing students an opportunity to further their knowledge and understanding of the complexities of the role of the gerontology registered nurse. Additionally, this clinical learning experience included provision for nursing academics to offer support and expertise to the aged care facility staff around the role of supervising and assessing final year nursing students’ clinical learning. The aim of this paper is to present fifteen final year nursing students' and nine registered nurse supervisors’ evaluations of the gerontology clinical learning experience and the success of the learning experience towards meeting the project aims. Mostly participants reported positive experiences and agreed the experience illuminated the role of the gerontology registered nurse. Participants in this study also provided suggestions about the benefits and barriers of the clinical learning experience.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Elderly people with dementia present complex needs and the challenges in their care may make the caring staff in long term caring settings vulnerable to the development of burnout because of the emotional and physical drainage they undergo. Purpose: of this study was to examine the factors that contribute towards the development of burnout of professional caregivers of elderly people with dementia so that effective programs for its prevention and management will be designed. Methodology: Review and research studies of the last decade were searched in international databases such as PubMed, Google scholar, CINAHL and Healink as well as in the references of the papers found and the papers were evaluated for their validity, they were thematically categorized and presented in this review. Results: The International literature presents as the main factors related to burnout, the working environment of the nursing home, the personal characteristics of the nurses, the education and the behavioral problems of the demented patients. An important finding of this review is the fact that professional caregivers experience burnout due to mistaken beliefs about the patients as well as negative beliefs and emotional reactions towards dementia. High levels of stress contribute to diminished quality of care, missed care, increased frequency of inadequate safety and higher frequency of mistakes in the everyday practice of nursing homes. Conclusions: It is important to find new directions for the improvement of the design of programs which aim at the reduction of professional burnout so as to include not only the organizational factors that contribute to the burnout but also focus to the cognitive and emotional reactions of the professionals towards the disease of their patients with regard to the specific and unique characteristics of nurses.</ab>
        <ab>Η αύξηση της δημογραφικής γήρανσης παγκοσμίως αναδεικνύεται ως ένα από τα κύρια οικονομικά, κοινωνικά αλλά και πολιτικά προβλήματα σε όλες τις αναπτυγμένες και αναπτυσσόμενες χώρες του πλανήτη, επιβάλλοντας την προσαρμογή των κοινωνικών συστημάτων στις δημογραφικές μεταβολές. Σκοπός: της εργασίας ήταν να διερευνήσει τις επιπτώσεις της δημογραφικής γήρανσης, την αναγκαιότητα στήριξης της υγιούς γήρανσης και το πλαίσιο των ενεργειών προώθησης της υγείας. Μεθοδολογία: Στην παρούσα εργασία έγινε ανασκόπηση βιβλιογραφίας της τελευταίας δεκαετίας σε ηλεκτρονικές βάσεις δεδομένων. Αποτελέσματα: Η κατάσταση υγείας ενός πληθυσμού αποτελεί τη συνισταμένη μιας συλλογικής προσπάθειας και είναι αποτέλεσμα της υγειονομικής οργάνωσης, του βιοτικού επιπέδου και της μορφωτικής και πολιτιστικής ανάπτυξης του πληθυσμού. Το κοινωνικό κεφάλαιο ως πολυδύναμο εκπαιδευτικό και πολιτισμικό κέντρο διαδραματίζει σημαντικό ρόλο στην πρόληψη των νοσημάτων και στην προαγωγή της υγείας. Το κοινωνικό κεφάλαιο θεωρείται ότι συμβάλει στον τομέα της προαγωγής της υγιούς γήρανσης με την προσθήκη νέων γνώσεων και παρεμβάσεων. Παρέχει ένα χρήσιμο πλαίσιο και σημείο εκκίνησης για τη προώθηση των παραγόντων της υγιούς γήρανσης και δραστηριοποιεί αρμόδιους φορείς σε τοπικό αλλά και σε διεθνές επίπεδο στην επίτευξη στόχων. Υπάρχουν ενδείξεις ότι, το κοινωνικό κεφάλαιο μπορεί να επηρεάσει συμπεριφορές υγείας με ένα τρόπο θετικό μέσα από την κοινωνική στήριξη, την κοινωνική επιρροή, την κοινωνική συμμετοχή και την πρόσβαση σε υλικούς πόρους. Η βελτίωση και η διατήρηση της υγείας εξαρτάται τόσο από τις ατομικές συμπεριφορές ή συμπεριφορές των άλλων όσο και από τη δυνατότητα για γόνιμη επικοινωνία σε κοινωνικά δίκτυα. Συμπεράσματα: Το υψηλό κοινωνικό κεφάλαιο συνεισφέρει θετικά στην υγεία του πληθυσμού σε ότι αφορά το γενικό σύνολο.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the health/functioning of the older adult who consumes psychoactive substances through the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, considering the theory of complexity. Method: Qualitative case study, with 11 older adults, held between December 2015 and February 2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, using interviews, documents and non-systematic observation. It was approved by the ethics committee. The analysis followed the propositions of the case study, using the complexity of Morin as theoretical basis. Results: We identified older adults who consider themselves healthy and show alterations -- the alterations can be exacerbated by the use of psychoactive substances -- of health/functioning expected according to the natural course of aging such as: systemic arterial hypertension; depressive symptoms; dizziness; tinnitus; harmed sleep/rest; and inadequate food and water consumption. Final consideration: The assessment of health/functioning of older adults who use psychoactive substances, guided by complex thinking, exceeds the accuracy limits to risk the understanding of the phenomena in its complexity.</ab>
        <ab>Objetivo: Evaluar la salud/funcionalidad de la persona anciana que consume sustancias psicoactivas desde de la Clasificación Internacional de Funcionalidad, Incapacidad y Salud, bajo la mirada de la complejidad. Método: Estudio de caso cualitativo, con 11 ancianos, realizado entre diciembre de 2015 y febrero de 2016, en Rio Grande do Sul, utilizándose encuesta, documentos y observación asistemática. Tuvola aprobación del comité de ética. El análisis siguió las proposiciones del estudio de caso, teniendo como el eje teórico la complejidad de Morín. Resultados: Se identificaron a personas ancianas que se consideran saludables y que presentan alteraciones -- Las cuales pueden ser agravadas por el uso de sustancias psicoactivas -- de salud/funcionalidad esperadas con el recurrido natural del envejecimiento, como: la hipertensión arterial sistémica; los síntomas depresivos; el mareo; el zumbido; el sueño/reposo perjudicado; la alimentación y la ingesta hídrica inadecuada. Consideraciones finales: La evaluación de la salud/funcionalidad de personas ancianas que consumen sustancias psicoactivas, guiada por el pensamiento complejo, sobrepasa los límites de la precisión para arriesgar comprender los fenómenos en su complejidad.</ab>

        <ab>Background People living with dementia experience progressive difficulty in expressing physical and emotional needs. Health care staff including student nurses require training to develop compensatory communication strategies. However, there is no standardised foundation level dementia communication training within pre-registration curricula. Aim This article describes the theoretical underpinnings and development of a foundation level dementia communication skills training based on the VERA (Validation, Emotion, Reassurance, Activity) framework. Method The training strategies drew on behavioural change theory using the COM-B model and Gagné's 9 Events of Instruction. The VERA framework was operationalised using a multicomponent teaching strategy. The intervention was refined based on quality improvement Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles with feedback from people living with dementia, facilitators and student nurses. Data collection used semi-structured questionnaires ( n  = 51) and four focus group ( n  = 19) interviews with students. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results The intervention was a 2.5-hour face-to-face training session delivered at the start of students' older adult unit placement with follow-up reflection sessions during placement. Training was delivered to 51 students, all students described the training as useful and would recommend it to their peers. Elements of the training that were highly valued were: opportunities to express concerns in caring for people with dementia, applying the VERA framework using role play and outlining realistic expectations of VERA. Students recognised the need for on-going training especially for more complex patients. Conclusion Combining behaviour change and education theory with stakeholder feedback strengthened the development of VERA as a foundation level dementia communication training for pre-registration nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The use of teaching-learning strategies that emphasize critical reflection aids students in making sense of complex clinical placement settings, such as those in long-term care (LTC) settings. Method: A qualitative descriptive research design was used to explore the assumptions, anticipations, and realizations of six undergraduate nursing students regarding aging, gerontological nursing, and LTC as they engaged in facilitated critical reflection activities during a 12-week LTC placement. Results: The content analysis process revealed four main categories describing the student learning experience: Exploring the Therapeutic Nurse-Resident Relationship, Navigating Preceptor Relationships, Expanding Awareness of Context, and Embracing Many Feelings. Conclusion: Students placed in LTC were challenged by the realization of LTC as a complex setting, especially with minimal support from preceptors. Educators should present LTC as a challenging environment, rich with complex issues. There is potential in easing the strain on preceptors by leveraging the faculty educator role in facilitating student learning through critically creative approaches.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To explore an innovative primary healthcare gerontology nurse specialist role from the perspectives of older people and health professionals. Background: Primary care is struggling to meet the needs and demands of complex older people. New models which incorporate holistic assessment and care coordination are necessary. Design: A qualitative descriptive general inductive design was used. Methods: Older people at risk of health and functional decline were identified and received a comprehensive gerontology assessment and care coordination. Older adults (75 years+) enrolled within one of three primary healthcare practices in Auckland, New Zealand were eligible. Healthcare professionals directly involved with the primary healthcare gerontology nurse specialist model were invited for study participation. Face-to-face interviews were held with five older people and six health professionals were interviewed by telephone. A semistructured interview guide was used for all interviews. A general inductive approach was undertaken for analysis to systematically identify codes and themes. Results: Data analysis revealed two central themes from the older people perspective: “holistic expertise” and “communication.” Two main themes were identified from the health professional perspective: “competency” and “service delivery.” Results showed the gerontology nurse specialist role was highly regarded by both older people and the health professionals. The in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment was identified as greatly beneficial. Conclusions: The competence and care coordination of the gerontology nurse specialist reduced fragmentation and were deemed immensely valuable. Care coordination should be recognised as a key component to meeting the complex needs of at risk older people in the community. Relevance to clinical practice: The expert knowledge of the gerontology nurse specialist and in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment were crucial aspects of the new model. Equally important was the assimilation of primary and secondary care infrastructure to upskill and deliver mentorship to the gerontology nurse specialist.</ab>

        <ab>Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Caring for people with dementia and responsive behaviours is challenging; however, little is known of nurses' experiences of responsive behaviours., What does this paper add to existing knowledge? To demonstrate understanding nurses need to be aware of their own actions, thoughts, attitudes and reactions., Time, education and management support are essential in enabling a person-centred approach., A decision regarding the place of care is difficult to come to, and given the drive to a person-centred approach, there is a need to consider the views of people with dementia., What are the implications for practice? Nursing staff supporting people with dementia should engage more frequently in reflective practice, ongoing education and decision-making., Service providers/managers need to have an understanding of the complexities of caring for a person with dementia and responsive behaviours and provide their staff with relevant supports and education that is accessible to all staff., Abstract Introduction Caring for people with dementia and responsive behaviours can challenge nurses, and little is known of their experiences. Aims To explore nurses' views of supporting people with dementia and responsive behaviours in long-stay facilities. Methods A qualitative descriptive study utilizing in-depth audio-recorded interviews of nine nurses, recruited from private and public care facilities. Qualitative content analyses conducted involving iterative comparisons of transcripts, summaries and memos, where coding, key quotes and tables were developed to determine themes. Results Four themes emerged: recognizing and understanding responsive behaviour, resources and interventions to support people with dementia and responsive behaviour, the impact of education on nursing practice and the care environment. Discussion Availability of staff, adequate time and financial restraints hinder nurses' ability to provide care. Access to ongoing education and being able to provide one-to-one care was valued as dementia-specific education changed nursing practice. Implications for practice Place of care was seen as dependent on the type of responsive behaviour in question, the duration of the behaviour and the impact of the behaviour on the person, other residents and staff. Dementia education needs to be accessible to all staff, and a collaborative approach is necessary in order to develop management guidelines and support strategies.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The bedridden elderly with moderate-to-severe dementia account for a large proportion of the residents in nursing homes and form a specialized group requiring customized care in order to encourage their remaining functions, which determine the quality of their residual life. The purpose of this study was to search for ways to invigorate and foster the remaining functions of this complex-disability group, based on practical nursing strategies in nursing homes. Methods The qualitative thematic analysis was done by conducting in-depth interviews with 29 nurses working at 11 different nursing homes in South Korea. Results This study proposed four main themes and 19 sub themes as keys for providing specialized nursing care to the elderly with physical and cognitive disabilities. The main themes encourage the residents' remaining functions: (i) accurate identification of an elderly resident's physical, cognitive, and behavioral baseline is necessary in order to determine their functional levels; (ii) nurses provide meticulous management to support the remaining functions in order to prevent further deterioration; (iii) optimized know-how, based on accumulated experience and knowledge, is reflected in nursing strategies that maximize the effects of nursing interventions; and (iv) steady compliance with nursing guidelines and standards in nursing homes creates the best therapeutic environment and brings unexpected positive changes in the elderly's status. Conclusion A practical nursing strategy to target the group with a demented and complex disability in nursing homes was developed through thematic analysis of the empirical knowledge of nurses. The findings provide new insights for developing specialized nursing interventions and practical nursing models in long-term care facilities.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Elderly people with dementia present complex needs and the challenges in their care may make the caring staff in long term caring settings vulnerable to the development of burnout because of the emotional and physical drainage they undergo. Purpose: of this study was to examine the factors that contribute towards the development of burnout of professional caregivers of elderly people with dementia so that effective programs for its prevention and management will be designed. Methodology: Review and research studies of the last decade were searched in international databases such as PubMed, Google scholar, CINAHL and Healink as well as in the references of the papers found and the papers were evaluated for their validity, they were thematically categorized and presented in this review. Results: The International literature presents as the main factors related to burnout, the working environment of the nursing home, the personal characteristics of the nurses, the education and the behavioral problems of the demented patients. An important finding of this review is the fact that professional caregivers experience burnout due to mistaken beliefs about the patients as well as negative beliefs and emotional reactions towards dementia. High levels of stress contribute to diminished quality of care, missed care, increased frequency of inadequate safety and higher frequency of mistakes in the everyday practice of nursing homes. Conclusions: It is important to find new directions for the improvement of the design of programs which aim at the reduction of professional burnout so as to include not only the organizational factors that contribute to the burnout but also focus to the cognitive and emotional reactions of the professionals towards the disease of their patients with regard to the specific and unique characteristics of nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To explore the inter-play between external facilitation and nursing home contexts relative to intervention outcomes. Background The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework is frequently used to theoretically inform implementation and research in nursing and recent reviews indicate high face validity for health services. However, the inter-play and relationship between framework sub-elements of evidence, context and facilitation and the prospective utility in non-English speaking contexts warrant further illumination. Design In an overarching single-blind cluster-randomized controlled trial, we applied participatory action research and ethnography from August 2011-June 2015 to evaluate a standardized education intervention to reduce restraint and agitation in nursing home residents living with dementia. The trial results are published elsewhere. Methods Prospectively informed by the PARIHS framework, a research team and eight facilitators participating in dual roles as action researchers designed, implemented, and evaluated the intervention. How contextual factors influenced the facilitation processes were explored in focus group interviews (1), reflection notes (84) written by the facilitators' after each education session, ethnographic field studies (6 homes), and co-analysis workshops (5). Directed content analysis was used to analyse data. Results Clinical leaders taking roles of internal facilitator influenced the success of implementation, while complex and fluctuating context elements determined whether restraint use was reduced- or not. The PARIHS framework was found to be relevant in a non-English nursing home setting, albeit some elements merit further conceptualization. Conclusions Our findings confirm the prospective utility of the PARIHS framework for implementation in a non-English context, particularly the notion of implementation processes as dynamic and multifaceted.</ab>

        <ab>Evidence suggests that delivery of good nursing care in long-term care (LTC) facilities is reflected in nurses' descriptions of the factors and structures that affect their work. Understanding the contemporary nature of nursing work in aged care will influence policies for improving current work structures in this practice setting. The current review aims to present a contemporary perspective of RNs' work in LTC facilities. A comprehensive search and purposeful selection of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Nine studies were eligible for review. Common themes revealed that nursing work in aged care settings is characterized by RNs providing indirect care tasks--primarily care coordination, engaging in non-nursing activities, and having an expanded and overlapping role. As care providers, aged care RNs do not always provide direct care as part of their nursing work. The scope of RN work beyond its clinical nature or performance of non-nursing tasks adds complexity in clarifying RN work roles in aged care.</ab>

        <ab>Transitioning to long-term care environments presents a significant challenge for new nurses and their directors of nursing. The complexity of this environment, instability of the workforce, and the lack of support structures frequently affect a new nurse's decision not to apply to long-term care, but to look for positions in acute care hospitals. To address these issues, a long-term care new nurse residency program was developed, implemented, and evaluated in New Jersey through the work of the New Jersey Action Coalition. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the residency program on new nurses' confidence, competence, retention, job satisfaction, and perceptions of organizational safety.</ab>

        <ab>Distress is commonly experienced by those caring for someone with dementia, and can occur whether the carer is living with a person with dementia, or supporting a person with dementia who lives alone to maintain their independence. It is essential for health and social care professionals to support family carers to balance their needs with those of the person they care for. However, this might be challenging because many influencing factors can affect these needs, and identifying the needs of the family carer and balancing them with the needs of the person with dementia is often complex. This article uses a case study to explore the role of one Admiral Nurse (KG) in supporting the main family carer of a person with dementia, and the model of reflection used by the Admiral Nurse to undertake critical thinking and analysis in relation to their role.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To explore the meaning of home among older Hispanic immigrants who are 'aging out of place.' Background Emerging evidence supports the concept of older persons ageing in place. Nurse researchers have demonstrated that older person who age in place have better physical, psychological and cognitive outcomes. Less, however, is known about older persons who are 'aging out of place,' meaning out of their country of origin. With the growth of home health care, there is a need to understand the older immigrants' meaning of home when ageing out of their country of origin. Design and Method An inductive, qualitative descriptive research design was used. Seventeen Hispanic participants, ranging in age from 65 to 83 years were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol. Findings Two major finding of the study focused on participants' descriptions of home in their country of origin and in the USA. The majority of participants described their home in their native country as the community, countryside or town (pueblo) and in the U.S.A. as family. The level of social isolation and loneliness among participants was evident. Conclusions Older Hispanic immigrants who are 'aging out of place' integrate their past experiences of sense of place in their native country with their present experiences of home in the USA. The need to understand the role of the community and the family in the provision of nursing care in the home may be more important than the physical structure or setting in which it is delivered. Further intra- and cross-national studies are needed to provide a framework for understanding the issues of ageing and immigration globally. Implications for Practice Gerontological nurses need to recognise the complexity of family relationships for older Hispanic persons who are ageing out of place of origin and their risk of depression, social isolation, and loneliness.</ab>

        <ab>Background People living in care and nursing homes are vulnerable individuals with complex needs; therefore, a wide array of nursing competence is needed to ensure their well-being. When developing the quality of care in these units, it is essential to know what type of competence is required for older people nursing. Aims and objectives The aim of this integrative review was to identify the competence needed for older people nursing in licensed practical nurses' and registered nurses' work in care and nursing homes. Design Integrative literature review. Methods We performed an integrative review using Whittemore and Knafl's method. The CINAHL, MEDLINE, Psyc INFO, Soc INDEX and Scopus databases were searched for studies published from 2006 to April 2016. We assessed the quality of the studies using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools and analysed the data by applying qualitative content analysis. Results Ten articles were included in the review. Most of the studies focused on registered nurses' work. We identified five competence areas that are needed for older people nursing in registered nurses' work in care and nursing homes: attitudinal and ethical, interactional, evidence-based care, pedagogical, and leadership and development competence. Empirical evidence of competence requirements related to licensed practical nurses' work in these facilities was scarce. Conclusions The competence required for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses should be clearly identified to support competence management in the care and nursing home context. Implications for practice Well-educated nursing staff are needed in care and nursing homes to provide high-quality care because comprehensive and advanced nurse competence is required to meet the needs of older people.</ab>

        <ab>In 2012 an innovative graduate nurse program was implemented within the Australian aged care context. This program ran for two consecutive years in 2012 and 2013. This descriptive paper outlines a case study of the development and implementation of a Graduate Nurse Program focusing on advancing the specialty-nursing workforce in aged care. The disciplines of Gerontology and Geriatrics are relatively new but remain underrepresented in nursing curriculum and are frequently not valued in practice. The aim of the program itself was to allow graduate nurses to gain the knowledge and skills for competence to practice within the aged care environment. The complexities of this practice extended beyond the usual bedside nursing of most graduate programs within acute healthcare settings. Aged care graduates were required to also develop management and team leadership skills. This program, though developed for the Australian context, has relevance internationally with the growth of the ageing population and the concomitant increasing healthcare needs. The program and curriculum was developed closely with a steering committee composed of industry representatives and the academic education provider and used innovative pedagogies. The development of key areas of the curriculum and the underlying philosophy of the program are described. The practice changes to the aged care workplaces with the introduction of infrastructures to support the graduates are also discussed. With the international growth in the aged care population, education programs like this Graduate Program will be pivotal in the development of an appropriately trained and sustainable nursing workforce within aged care.</ab>

        <ab>Sexual health is a key public health issue. The older woman faces a number of changes to her sexual health, wellbeing and sexuality. These changes result in many older women having to adapt to a series of complex transitions that can be challenging. This article aims to identify and explore some of these changes and how they can have a significant impact on women’s quality of life. Nurses play an important role in assessing and helping women to manage normal and pathological age-related changes in order to improve the sexual health of older women and ensure they receive the advice and support needed at this stage of their life.</ab>

        <ab>The author argues the need for care homes and their residents to have a coherent leadership that can develop efficient policies, programmes and systems. He describes the importance of having sustainable health and care economies. He also mentions the drivers to the growth of care home beds in England in the 1980s. In addition, the author discusses the factors leading to the increasing crisis in care particularly for publically funded older people with complex needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Healthcare organisations are facing large demands in recruiting employees with adequate competency to care for the increasing numbers of elderly. High degrees of turnover and dissatisfaction with working conditions are common. The gendered notion of care work as 'women's work', in combination with low salaries and status, may contribute to negative work experiences. There is abundant information about the negative aspects of elderly care health services, but little is known about positive aspects of this work. The study aim was to investigate work satisfaction from a gender perspective among Swedish registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, focusing specifically on healthcare services for the elderly.Methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted in which we combined statistics and open-ended responses from a national survey with qualitative research interviews with healthcare professionals in elderly care organisations. The survey was administered to a random sample of 1578 registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. Qualitative interviews with 17 professionals were conducted in six elderly care facilities. Qualitative and quantitative content analyses, chi2 and constructivist grounded theory were used to analyse the data.Results: There was a statistically significant difference in overall work satisfaction between those who worked in elderly care and those who did not (64 and 74,4% respectively, p &lt;0.001). Nine themes were derived from open-ended responses in the questionnaire. The qualitative interviews revealed four prominent storylines: 'Team social cohesion', 'Career development and autonomy', 'Client-centeredness', and 'Invisible and ignored power structures'.Conclusions: The results show the complexity of elderly care work and describe several aspects that are important for work satisfaction among health professionals. The results reveal that work satisfaction is dependent on social interrelations and cohesion in the work team, in possibilities to use humour and to have fun together, and in the ability to work as professionals to provide client-centered elderly care. Power relations such as gendered hierarchies were less visible or even ignored aspects of work satisfaction. The storylines are clearly linked to the two central discourses of professionalism and gender equality.</ab>

        <ab>As life expectancy increases so people often develop a range of conditions and disabilities in the years before death. Multimorbidity represents the most common 'disease pattern' found among the elderly and is characterised by complex interactions of co-existing diseases where a medical approach focused on a single disease does not suffice. People with dementia who also have other comorbidities do not always have their comorbid conditions managed as those without dementia which often lead to a high number of hospital admissions with longer lengths of stay and greater treatment costs. This case study presents the case management approach taken by Admiral Nursing in managing the complexities where there is comorbidity of a long-term condition and a diagnosis of dementia. By empowering the person and their carer with information and choices and through good case management and communication, people can be supported to live well and avoid inappropriate hospital admissions.</ab>

        <ab>Older people are at increased risk of developing pressure ulcers. They are also more likely to have comorbidities that increase the challenges of managing such a wound. This article reviews a complex case in which a 77-year-old woman with dementia and incontinence developed an ulcer on her coccyx. The ulcer became infected several times and proved resistant to several types of treatment before negative pressure wound therapy with Nanova™ was instigated.</ab>

        <ab>Nursing older people in acute settings involves the provision of complex care, including the maintenance of good hydration. Dehydration is a serious condition that may contribute to the development of pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections, acute kidney injury and venous thromboembolism. If oral hydration methods are not successful, the alternatives are intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous fluid hydration therapy. These are invasive methods and may not be tolerated by all patients. This article uses a case study to explore an innovative approach to oral hydration. The intervention was developed for Roy, a patient with advanced Alzheimer's disease, who had a reduced fluid intake and who became agitated when staff or family members attempted to assist him with nutrition and hydration. It involved consultation with Roy's family and the introduction of a flavoured drink to encourage the patient to drink. His weekly fluid intake doubled as a result and the intervention avoided the use of alternative invasive rehydration therapy. Although this was a local initiative developed for one patient, it is an example of how a person--entred, collaborative approach can have a positive effect for patients.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT Background Nursing plays a central role in facilitating care transitions for complex older adults, yet there is no consensus of the components of nurse-led care transitions interventions to facilitate high quality care transitions among complex older adults. A structured expert panel was established with the purpose of identifying effective nurse-led care transition interventions. Methods A modified Delphi consensus technique based on the RAND method was employed. Panelists ( n = 23) were asked to individually rate a series of statements derived from a realist synthesis of the literature for relevance, feasibility and likely impact. Statements receiving an aggregate score of ≥75% (7/9) were reviewed and revised at a face-to-face consensus meeting. A second round of rating following the same process as round one was used, followed by a final ranking of the statements. Results The five highest ranked intervention components and contextual factors were: (a) educating and coaching patients, their family members and caregivers about self-management skills; (b) ensuring patients, their family members and caregivers are aware of follow-up medical appointments and postdischarge care plan; (c) using standardized documentation tools and comprehensive communication strategies during care transitions; (d) optimizing nurses' roles and scopes of practice across the care transitions spectrum; and (e) having strong leadership, strategic alignment and accountability structures in organizations to enable quality care transitions for the complex older person population. Linking Evidence to Action Key insights on optimizing the nurses' roles and scope of practice during care transitions included having nurses provide 'warm hand-offs' and serve as the 'go-to person.' The panel also identified current challenges to optimizing the nurses' roles and scope of practice across care transition points. Future research is required to determine effective nurse-led intervention components and in which context do they work or do not.</ab>

        <ab>The aging population with complex health needs is growing. Nursing programs are challenged to educate student nurses competent and willing to meet this specific population's needs. Research on ageism supports the presence of aging bias. Possible negative attitudes towards older persons by nursing students is a concern for nurse educators. Nursing education literature describes how nursing students' attitudes on aging may affect career choices and the quality of health care provided to older adults. The older adult population requires specialized nursing knowledge, skills, and attitudes to achieve positive outcomes and prevent serious geriatric syndromes. Further research in the area of student nurses' knowledge and attitudes of older persons is crucial to prevent a shortage of nurses prepared to care for the increasing number of older adults. The researcher examined the relationship between knowledge of aging and attitude on aging in final semester nursing students following multiple, national gerontology initiatives. The impact of demographic and educational factors on knowledge and attitude was also investigated. Understanding these relationships may facilitate the creation of nursing programs better designed to attract and prepare nursing students for gerontological nursing, This study utilized a quantitative, correlational, cross-sectional design and was guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior using the following tools: Kogan's Attitude Toward Old People, the Palmore's Facts on Aging, and a researcher created demographic and educational tool. Findings from the national sample of 168 final semester nursing students showed a positive correlation between knowledge of aging and attitude toward older adults, more positive attitudes, improved knowledge, and a desire to work with older adults. Other statistically significant relationships were found between race, educational degree and attitude toward older adults which may impact nursing practice, nursing education, and future gerontological research. The findings of the current study have the potential to assist nurse educators in the context of curriculum design and delivery, to impact how nurses in health care practice can be influenced to behave toward older patients, and to guide subsequent research in areas of attitude and knowledge of older adults in nursing and other healthcare professionals.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To understand nurses' perceptions of the impact of the aged care reform on care and services for residents in multi-purpose services (MPS) and residential aged care facilities (RACF) in rural South Australia. Methods An interpretative study using semi-structured interviews. Participants comprised registered and enrolled nurses working with aged care residents in rural South Australia. Eleven nurses were interviewed, of these seven worked in MPS and four in RACF. Results Data were analysed for similarities and differences in participants' experiences of care delivery between MPS and RACF. Common issues were identified relating to funding and resource shortfalls, staffing levels, skill mix and knowledge deficits. Funding and staffing shortfalls in MPS were related by participants to the lower priority given to aged care in allocating resources within MPS. Nurses in these services identified limited specialist knowledge of aged care and care deficits around basic nursing care. Nurses in RACF identified funding and staffing shortfalls arising from empty beds due to the introduction of the accommodation payment. Dependence upon care workers was associated with care deficits in complex care such as pain management, medication review and wound care. Conclusion Further research is needed into the impact of recent reforms on the capacity to deliver quality aged care in rural regions.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this study was to explore how nurses and care-assistants (nursing staff) working in six Flemish nursing homes experience and describe their involvement in grief care. Background Although grief in older people is widely described in literature, less is known about how nursing staff in nursing homes offer and perceive grief care. Design A qualitative research design with elements of constructivist grounded theory was used. Methods Loosely structured face-to-face interviews were done with fourteen nurses and care-assistants. Data were collected from October 2013-March 2014. Interview transcripts were analysed using the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven ( QUAGOL) method with support of NVivo 10. Findings Grief care in nursing homes is characterized by a complex tension between two care dimensions: (1) being involved while keeping an appropriate distance; and (2) being while doing. Nursing staff described key enablers and influencing factors for grief care at the level of both the individual and the organizational context. Conclusion Findings suggest an established personal sensitivity for grief care considered from the nursing staff points of view. Nevertheless, a common denominator was the necessity to further develop a supportive and multidisciplinary grief care policy ingrained in the existing care culture. Suggested components of this grief care policy are: (a) centring attention on non-death-related loss and the cumulative nature of loss in residents; (b) building capacity by means of reflective practices; and (c) the importance of self-care strategies for nursing staff. Furthermore, the findings from this study point towards a need for education and training.</ab>

        <ab>Specific changes to the national clinical nurse specialist (CNS) certification are necessitating a move away the psychiatric/mental health (P/MH) CNS population focus. However, a rapidly increasing older adult population with P/MH comorbidities such as depression and anxietymeans that the adult-gerontology CNS (AGCNS) will likely be coordinating much of the complex care needs of this vulnerable population. Therefore, strategies are needed to ensure AGCNSs are competent in advanced practice P/MH nursing. In addition, at this critical time in the redesign of healthcare, the Institute of Medicine has made interprofessional practice center stage for healthcare professional education. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript is to propose aligning the current AGCNS population-focused competencies with the CNS geropsychiatric nursing competency enhancements and interprofessional collaborative practice education competencies. Examples of the proposed alignment and educational application strategies are presented. When AGCNS educational curricula encompass P/MH nursing at an advanced level from an interprofessional perspective, future AGCNSs will continue to be positioned tomake significant contributions to the design of care systems and monitor and trend important outcomes, while ensuring safe and efficient, high-quality healthcare for older adults with P/MH comorbidities.</ab>

        <ab>Care homes are an increasingly important part of the UK's healthcare system. Despite their importance, particularly in providing care for older people with complex needs, the sector is often disadvantaged and overlooked by commissioners, policymakers and researchers. The authors provide an overview of some important challenges for the sector. These challenges relate to funding, education and research, overseas staff, career pathways and staff recruitment and retention. They conclude that recruitment and retention of registered nurses is arguably the greatest challenge, as high staff turnover is the catalyst for other challenges identified. The care home sector should be considered as equal to hospitals, community settings and hospices. Care homes offer registered nurses many opportunities for development of clinical and organisational skills.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To explore the expertise of Registered Nurses in residential care for older people. Background As older people in residential care have many complex dependencies, nursing expertise is an essential component of care excellence. However, the work of these nurses can be invisible and, therefore, unrecognized. Thus, additional attention is required to illuminate such nursing expertise. Design A mixed method design was used in this study. Methods The research took place in 2012 in the Republic of Ireland. Twenty-three case study nurses were recruited from nursing homes. Each case study nurse involved five data collection methods: shadowing, interview with a colleague, interview with a resident, a demographic profile and a director of nursing survey. The study was also informed by a modified focus group. Qualitative data were analysed using directed content analysis using a conceptual framework generated from the literature on nursing expertise. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS and presented in descriptive statistics. Findings The findings from the case studies and the modified focus group are presented in seven themes, which represent nursing expertise in residential care of older people: transitions, context of the nursing home, saliency, holistic practice knowledge, knowing the resident, moral agency and skilled know how. Conclusion Nursing expertise in residential care of older people is a complex phenomenon which encompasses many aspects of care delivery in a person-centred framework. By rendering this expertise visible, the need for appropriate and adequate skill mix for a growing residential care population is presented.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines the reflective discourses of medical, nursing, and paramedic students participating in interprofessional education (IPE) activities in the context of aged-care clinical placements. The intent of the research is to explore how students engage with their interprofessional colleagues in an IPE assessment and care planning activity and elucidate how students configure their role as learners within the context of a non-traditional aged-care training environment. Research participants included cohorts of volunteer medical (n = 61), nursing (n = 46), and paramedic (n = 20) students who were on clinical placements at two large teaching aged-care facilities in Tasmania, Australia, over a period of 18 months. A total of 39 facilitated focus group discussions were undertaken with cohorts of undergraduate student volunteers from three health professions between February 2013 and October 2014. Thematic analysis of focus group transcripts was assisted by NVIVO software and verified through secondary coding and member checking procedures. With an acceptable level of agreement across two independent coders, four themes were identified from student focus group transcripts that described the IPE relations and perceptions of the aged-care environment. Emergent themes included reinforcement of professional hierarchies, IPE in aged care perceived as mundane and extraneous, opportunities for reciprocal teaching and learning, and understanding interprofessional roles. While not all students can be engaged with IPE activities in aged care, our evidence suggests that within 1 week of clinical placements there is a possibility to develop reciprocal professional relations, affirm a positive identity within a collaborative healthcare team, and support the health of vulnerable older adults with complex care needs. These important clinical learnings support aged-care-based IPE as a potentially powerful context for undergraduate learning in the 21st Century.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: This study had two aims: to describe the dialogue between district nurses (DNs) and older people in preventive home visits (PHVs) from the perspective of the DNs, and to identify barriers to and facilitators of this dialogue as perceived by the DNs. Background: The number of older people is rapidly increasing in all western countries, and as people's age increases, the probability that they will have multiple diseases also increases. Planned actions are therefore needed to promote health and prevent diseases among older people so they can remain in good health and live in their homes for as long as possible. In Sweden, PHVs to 75-year-olds by DNs are one such action. Methods: This qualitative study included five group interviews with 20 DNs. Data were analysed with qualitative content analysis. Findings: DNs' experiences of barriers to and facilitators of a successful health dialogue were sorted into five domains. Together, these domains provided a systematic description of the interaction between the DN and the older person in the PHV. The domains included: establishing trustful contact, conducting a structured interview, making an overall assessment, proposing health-promoting activities and offering follow-up. The barriers and facilitators could be related to the older person, the DN or the home environment. The latent content of the interviews was evident in three themes that were related to the DNs' experiences of barriers and facilitators. These themes illustrated professional dilemmas that the DNs had to resolve to achieve the purpose of the PHV. The study demonstrates that the interaction between a DN and an older person in a PHV can be described as a complex social process in which the DN balances a personal and professional approach, combines a person-oriented and a task-oriented approach and employs both a salutogenic and pathogenic perspective.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Care home residents in England have variable access to health care services. There is currently no coherent policy or consensus about the best arrangements to meet these needs. The purpose of this review was to explore the evidence for how different service delivery models for care home residents support and/or improve wellbeing and health-related outcomes in older people living and dying in care homes.Methods: We conceptualised models of health care provision to care homes as complex interventions. We used a realist review approach to develop a preliminary understanding of what supported good health care provision to care homes. We completed a scoping of the literature and interviewed National Health Service and Local Authority commissioners, providers of services to care homes, representatives from the Regulator, care home managers, residents and their families. We used these data to develop theoretical propositions to be tested in the literature to explain why an intervention may be effective in some situations and not others. We searched electronic databases and related grey literature. Finally the findings were reviewed with an external advisory group.Results: Strategies that support and sustain relational working between care home staff and visiting health care professionals explained the observed differences in how health care interventions were accepted and embedded into care home practice. Actions that encouraged visiting health care professionals and care home staff jointly to identify, plan and implement care home appropriate protocols for care, when supported by ongoing facilitation from visiting clinicians, were important. Contextual factors such as financial incentives or sanctions, agreed protocols, clinical expertise and structured approaches to assessment and care planning could support relational working to occur, but of themselves appeared insufficient to achieve change.Conclusion: How relational working is structured between health and care home staff is key to whether health service interventions achieve health related outcomes for residents and their respective organisations. The belief that either paying clinicians to do more in care homes and/or investing in training of care home staff is sufficient for better outcomes was not supported.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To gain a better understanding of nurses' perspectives on factors that influence their readiness to provide appropriate care for hospitalised older people. Background Hospitals have consistently been criticised for failing to address the unique, complex needs of older people. Research suggests that multiple issues have led to this situation, including a lack of educational preparation for nurses, limited attention to environmental factors, and an absence of organisational preparedness that ensures hospitals are adapted to meet the needs of older people. Design An exploratory, qualitative approach was used. Methods Forty-one Registered Nurses participated (24 point-of-care nurses; 17 organisational leaders). Six focus groups and one individual interview were conducted. Thematic data analysis was employed to generate the main study findings. Results An overarching theme of 'Poor Fit' emerged. While participants identified the shifting needs of patients towards more complex and relational care, the broader organisational and societal contexts were, largely, unchanging. This resulted in nurses recognising the factors needed to be ready to care for older patients and their families, but working in hospitals that were not suited to these needs. Conclusions The findings identify factors at the point-of-care, the organisational level, and in broader societal attitudes that shape nurses' readiness to care for hospitalised older people. However, many of these factors are modifiable and care for older people could be improved through quality improvement initiatives and nursing leadership. This study offers insight into ways to re-imagine nursing care that can be responsive to older people's complex needs in hospitals. Implications for practice With a growing contingent of hospitalised older people, it is imperative that nurses, who comprise the largest workforce in this setting, be included in the planning and delivery of healthcare services to ensure readiness to meet the needs of this population.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives The focus of this study is to explore how nursing staff experience safety promotion and fall prevention in residential care settings for older adults. The article calls for attentiveness to fall prevention within a broader lifeworld context of well-being and health promotion. Background There is limited research on fall prevention and safety promotion where the lifeworld and well-being provide a direction for care. Design This interview study has a hermeneutic phenomenological design. Methods Fourteen interviews with nursing staff were carried out. The ethics of care and vulnerability within a lifeworld approach provide the theoretical framework and guide the interpretive process. Results The findings can indicate that there is a generalised understanding of the needs of older persons in residential care. The focus of the staff was more on protection and prevention than safety promotion and well-being. Conclusion Risk prevention is not enough. The residents need protection against falls but they also need to be protected from situations that can be detrimental to their well-being and compromise their dignity. Acknowledging the complexities of safety promotion amongst older persons living in assisted care settings can prevent fall accidents and ensure attentiveness to a more fundamental sense of security that can promote the older person's well-being and health. Relevance to clinical practice This study is relevant to clinical nursing practice as it shows that risk management in fall prevention is not enough. The findings show the need for educated nursing home staff that can incorporate contemplative and scientific knowledge into injury prevention practice.</ab>

        <ab>This is the third in a short series that presents case study examples of the application of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic assessment model, which is designed to determine a frail older person's medical and mental health status, as well as functional, social and environmental issues. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised care planning. The case study presented explores the application of CGA with an 89-year-old patient with complex health and social care needs. It demonstrates how a hospital admission was avoided and the patient's health outcomes improved, by using a nurse-led systematic approach to assessment and by careful consideration of CGA domains.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To classify and identify the main characteristics of the tools used in practice to assess the impact of elderly caregiving on the informal carers' life.Methods: A systematic review of literature was performed searching in Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, IBECS, LILACS, SiiS, SSCI and Cochrane Library from 2009 to 2013 in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, and in reference lists of included papers.Results: The review included 79 studies, among them several in languages other than English. Their inclusion increased the variety of identified tools to measure this impact (n = 93) and allowed a wider analysis of their geographical use. While confirming their overlapping nature, instruments were classified according to the degree of integration of dimensions they evaluated and their specificity to the caregiving process: caregiver burden (n = 20), quality of life and well-being (n = 11), management and coping (n = 21), emotional and mental health (n = 29), psychosocial impact (n = 10), physical health and healthy habits (n = 2), and other measures. A high use in practice of tools not validated yet and not caregiver-specific was identified.Conclusions: The great variety and characteristics of instruments identified in this review confirm the complexity and multidimensionality of the effects of elderly caregiving on the informal carer's life and explain the difficulties to assess these effects in practice. According to the classification provided, caregiver burden and emotional and mental health are the most evaluated dimensions. However, further work is required to develop integrated and caregiving focused procedures that can appraise this complexity across different countries and cultures.</ab>

        <ab>Objective To enhance pain practices in nursing homes (NHs) using pain assessment and management algorithms and intense diffusion strategies. Design A cluster, randomized controlled trial. The intervention consisted of intensive training and support for the use of recommended pain assessment and management practices using algorithms (ALGs). Control facilities received pain education (EDU) only. Setting Twenty-seven NHs in the greater Puget Sound area participated. Facilities were diverse in terms of size, quality, and ownership. Participants Data were collected from 485 NH residents; 259 for the intervention and 226 for the control group. Measurements Resident outcomes were nursing assistant (proxy) report and self-reported resident pain intensity. Process outcomes were adherence to recommended pain practices. Outcomes were measured at baseline, completion of the intervention (ALG) or training (EDU), and again 6 months later. Results Among 8 comparisons of outcome measures between ALG and EDU (changes in 4 primary pain measures compared at 2 postintervention time points) there was only 1 statistically significant but small treatment difference in proxy- or self-reported pain intensity. Resident-reported worst pain decreased by an average of 0.8 points from baseline to 6 months among the EDU group and increased by 0.2 points among the ALG ( P = .005), a clinically nonsignificant difference. There were no statistically significant differences in adherence to clinical guideline practice recommendations between ALG and EDU following the intervention. Conclusions Future research needs to identify and test effective implementation methods for changing complex clinical practices in NHs, including those to reduce pain.</ab>

        <ab>As the population ages and the number of people living with a long-term condition grows, it is likely that community nurses may be presented with increasing numbers of people requiring assessment, support, and advice for complex needs. Many of the long-term conditions affect the patient's ability to live and manage aspects of daily life independently and may affect the ability to manage a stoma. The purpose of this article is to consider how long-term conditions affect daily living and stoma care, and make practical suggestions for stoma management. Sources of further help and information for people living with a stoma (ostomates) and a long-term condition have also been included. It is hoped that by reading this article, the nurse will become more familiar with the dificulties with dexterity associated with long-term conditions experienced by ostomates, and how they can be assisted in managing and living as independently as possible.</ab>

        <ab>Older people are at risk of experiencing functional decline and related complications during hospitalization. In countries with projected increases in age demographics, preventing these adverse consequences is a priority. Because most Canadian nurses have received little geriatrics content in their basic education, understanding their learning needs is fundamental to preparing them to respond to this priority. This two‐phased multi‐method study identified the geriatrics learning needs and strategies to address the learning needs of acute care registered nurses (RNs) and registered practical nurses (RPNs) in the province of Ontario, Canada. In Phase I, a survey that included a geriatric nursing knowledge scale was completed by a random sample of 2005 Ontario RNs and RPNs. Average scores on the geriatric nursing knowledge scale were in the “neither good nor bad” range, with RNs demonstrating slightly higher scores than RPNs. In Phase II, 33 RN and 24 RPN survey respondents participated in 13 focus group interviews to help confirm and expand survey findings. In thematic analysis, three major themes were identified that were the same in RNs and RPNs: (a) geriatric nursing is generally regarded as simple and custodial, (b) older people's care is more complex than is generally appreciated, and (c) in the current context, older people's care is best learned experientially and in brief on‐site educational sessions. Healthcare providers, policy‐makers, and educators can use the findings to develop educational initiatives to prepare RNs and RPNs to respond to the needs of an aging hospital population. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment leave many old patients in a frail condition with a high risk of adverse outcomes if proper health care is not provided. Knowledge about available competence is necessary to evaluate whether we are able to offer equitable and balanced health care to older persons with acute and/or complex health care needs. This study investigates the sufficiency of nursing staff competence in Norwegian community elderly care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1016 nursing staff in nursing homes and home care services with the instrument "Nursing Older People -- Competence Evaluation Tool". Statistical analyses were ANOVA and multiple regression. Results: We found that nursing staff have competence in all areas measured, but that the level of competence was insufficient in the areas nursing measures, advanced procedures, and nursing documentation. Nursing staff in nursing homes scored higher than staff in home care services, and older nursing staff scored lower than younger nursing staff. Conclusions: A reason for the relatively low influence of education and training on competence could be the diffuse roles that nursing staff have in community elderly care, implying that they have poor standards against which to judge their own competence. Clearer role descriptions for all groups of nursing staff are recommended as well as general competence development in geriatric nursing care.</ab>

        <ab>Background. The increased incidence of health challenges with aging means that nurses are increasingly caring for older adults, often in hospital settings. Research about the complexity of nursing practice with this population remains limited. Objective. To seek an explanation of nursing practice with hospitalised older adults. Methods. Design. A grounded theory study guided by symbolic interactionism was used to explore nursing practice with hospitalised older adults from a nursing perspective. Glaserian grounded theory methods were used to develop a mid-range theory after analysis of 375 hours of participant observation, 35 interviews with 24 participants and review of selected documents. Results. The theory of orchestrating care was developed to explain how nurses are continuously trying to manage their work environments by understanding the status of the patients, their unit, mobilising the assistance of others and stretching available resources to resolve their problem of providing their older patients with what they perceived as 'good care' while sustaining themselves as 'good' nurses. They described their practice environments as hard and under-resourced. Orchestrating care is comprised of two subprocesses: building synergy and minimising strain. These two processes both facilitated and constrained each other and nurses' abilities to orchestrate care. Conclusions. Although system issues presented serious constraints to nursing practice, the ways in which nurses were making meaning of their work environment both aided them in managing their challenges and constrained their agency. Implications for practice. Nurses need to be encouraged to share their important perspective about older adult care. Administrators have a role to play in giving nurses voice in workplace committees and in forums. Further research is needed to better understand how multidisciplinary teams influence care of hospitalized older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. Located in two care homes in Lebanon, the study explores the perspectives of quality of life for a sample of older residents, care staff and family caregivers. Background. Quality of life for older people living in care homes is traditionally reported in the literature as a Westernised construct and so far little is known about its meanings from an Arabic cultural perspective and context. There is also a knowledge gap about the conditions of older people living in care homes in Lebanon. Method. The study was a qualitative exploration of perspectives of quality of life of older residents, care staff and family caregivers. Two care homes for older people situated in Beirut took part in the study. Between 2010 and 2011 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a sample of 20 residents, eight family caregivers and 11 care staff. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Findings. Four categories emerged from this analytical process: (i) maintaining family connectedness; (ii) engaging in worthwhile activities; (iii) maintaining and developing significant relationships; and (iv) holding and practicing spiritual beliefs. The emergence of these categories confirmed the complex, interrelated and multidimensional nature of quality of life for residents and other stakeholders. Conclusion. The findings supplement an emerging body of knowledge about the composition of quality of life for older residents in Lebanon. Improving the quality of life of older residents will require action in respect of all of the domains identified in study. Implications for practice. Moving nursing practice from task-based care to relationship-centred approaches was seen as pivotal in helping to develop quality of life for residents living in the participating care homes. The findings have implications for education, nursing practice and research in Lebanon and help start an evidence base for care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mid ‐  to late ‐ stage dementia is often characterized by behavioural and psychological symptoms, including, but not limited to physical and verbal aggression. Introduction: Although there is a considerable research about the prevalence, aetiology, and management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, there is limited research about the experience of caring for people with such symptoms in long ‐ term aged care facilities. Aim: The aims of the study were to describe: (i) nurses' experiences of caring for people with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in long ‐ term aged care facilities, and (ii) strategies nurses used to deal with these symptoms. Methods: A qualitative exploratory and descriptive design, involving focus group interviews with 30 nurses from three long ‐ term aged care units in Australia. The transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results: The findings revealed five interrelated themes: (i) working under difficult conditions, (ii) behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: an everyday encounter, (iii) making sense of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, (iv) attempting to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and (v) feeling undervalued. Conclusion: This study highlighted the difficult conditions under which nurses worked and the complexity of caring for individuals who have behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Implications for nursing and health policy: Organizational efforts to enhance the quality of care for individuals with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in long ‐ term aged care facilities should extend beyond staff education to heed nurses' concerns about organizational barriers to interpersonal care.</ab>

        <ab>As the population ages, more complex care is required to manage multiple comorbidities. In response, a nurse-led service was developed to care for patients with 'red legs'. This chronic inflammatory condition is often misdiagnosed as acute cellulitis and can result in unnecessary hospital admission and inappropriate treatment, with substantial resource and financial implications for trusts. Setting up the service required a multi-agency group to analyse current provision and identify gaps in care. Integrated care pathways were developed to focus on patient experience through referral, diagnostics and treatment. Evaluation showed that much of the prescribed care for patients with red legs could be carried out by patients at home and only a small number required a follow-up appointment. High levels of patient satisfaction were recorded.</ab>

        <ab>The aim is to describe nursing home nurses' perceptions around emergency transfers to hospital. Transfers are costly and traumatic for residents, and efforts are underway to avoid hospitalization. Nurses play a key role in transfers, yet their views are underreported. A systematic review of qualitative studies was undertaken, guided by Joanna Briggs Institute methods. From seven reviewed studies, it was clear nursing home nurses are challenged by the complexity of the transfer process and understand their need for appropriate clinical knowledge, skills and resources. Communication is important, yet nurses often use persuasive and targeted communication. Ambiguity, strained relationships and negative perceptions of residents' experiences around hospitalization contribute to conflict and uncertainty. Nurses are more confident when there is a plan. Transferring a resident is a complex process and special skills, knowledge and resources are required, but may be lacking. Efforts to formalize the transfer process and improve communication and collaboration amongst all stakeholders is needed and would be well received.</ab>

        <ab>In view of the likelihood that the complexity of care required by those admitted to nursing homes will continue to increase, an expert consensus study was conducted to reach consensus on the competencies which distinguish baccalaureate-educated registered nurses from other nursing staff working in nursing homes. Thirty-one international experts, identified through literature and our professional network, participated in a two-round web-based survey and an expert meeting. Experts reached consensus on 16 desirable competencies, including some not traditionally associated with nursing expertise e.g. being a team leader, role model and coach within the nursing team. These findings suggest that revision of current nursing curricula, nurse training programs and nursing home job profiles might be needed to meet the medically and psychologically complex needs of nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To offer an explanation of how registered nurses' are providing care to hospitalised older adults in nursing teams comprised of a variety of roles and educational levels. Background Around the globe economic pressures, nursing shortages and increased patient acuity have resulted in tasks being shifted to healthcare workers with less education and fewer qualifications than registered nurses. In acute care hospitals, this often means reducing the number of registered nurses and adding licensed practical nurses and care aides (also referred to as unregulated healthcare workers) to the nursing care team. The implications of these changes are not well understood especially in the context of hospitalised older adults, who are complex and the most common care recipients. Design Thematic analysis of data that were collected in a previous grounded theory study to provide an opportunity in-depth analysis of how nurses provided care to hospitalised older adults within nursing teams. Methods Data collected in western Canada on two hospital units in two different health authorities were analysed in relation to how nursing teams provide care. Hand coding and thematic analysis were employed. Results The themes of scrutinised skill mix and working together highlighted how the established nursing value of reciprocity is challenging to enact in teams with a variety of scopes of practice. The value of reciprocity both aided and hindered the nursing team in engaging in team behaviours to effectively manage patient care. Conclusion Educators and leaders could assist the nursing care team in re-thinking how they engage in teamwork by providing education about roles and communication techniques to support teams and ultimately improve nursing care. Relevance to clinical practice The value of reciprocity within nursing teams needs to be re-examined within the context of team members with varying abilities to reciprocate in kind.</ab>

        <ab>Engaging nursing students in the complexities of care across community, acute, rehabilitation and residential aged care settings is challenging. Equally challenging is conceptualising and promoting diverse and comprehensive health assessments across care settings that reflect clinical reality, inform clinical decision making, traverse theory and practice, and transform clinical practice knowledge. This article describes the use of narrative and evolving case study as a teaching-learning tool utilised by the authors in a third year undergraduate gerontic nursing subject in a pre-service nursing degree at a rural university. Principles of transformative learning and strengths based nursing were drawn upon in the development of the case study. The aim of the approach was to draw on embedded knowledge and the experiences of students and academics from assorted practice settings to facilitate understanding of the lived experiences of an older community dwelling couple. Using social learning strategies students were encouraged to analyse and think critically and creatively about the situations they were presented with. They identified possible solutions that would be acceptable to the couple. Building on the older couple's strengths, achievements and personal social capital, the aim was to develop a positive paradigm for health and the way older people are viewed by nursing students.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pain is prevalent among older people, yet is often under-recognised and undertreated in people with dementia. The nurse has a central role in identifying and appropriately assessing pain in order to provide effective treatment. Research however suggests there are significant deficits in this area. Aim: To explore the evidence on nurses' knowledge and attitudes to pain assessment in older people with dementia. Design: A systematic narrative review of peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2014. Data sources: Seven electronic data bases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Wiley, Pubmed, ProQuest and OVID) were searched and articles focusing on nurses knowledge and attitudes on pain assessment towards people with dementia. Methods: Research participants within the studies reviewed were to include registered nurses involved in the assessment and management of pain in older adults with dementia from across all healthcare settings (e.g. dementia units, nursing homes, community and acute settings). Results: Data were systematically analysed from 1 1 papers. Using an inductive approach for thematic content analysis informed by the theory of planned behaviour, five themes were identified. These included: 1) Challenges in diagnosing pain in dementia 2) Inadequacies of pain assessment tools 3) Time constraints and workload pressures 4) Lack of interdisciplinary teamwork and communication 5) Training and education. Conclusion: Nurses play a key role in the effective management of pain through the use of pain assessment tools, behavioural observation, and analgesic choice. Pain assessment in dementia remains challenging for nurses due to the complexity and individualisation of pain behaviours. The accessibility of appropriate training, workforce stability and a standardised approach to pain assessment are key to the successful management of pain in older people with dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Summary Background The aging population is a globally recognized challenge for the health care service. The growing number of older people will probably lead to increased demands for nurses working in elderly care. Clinical practice has been shown to have an impact on how student nurses perceive a particular field of nursing. Objectives To compare perceptions of the clinical learning environment in nursing homes among students considering a career in aged care or not, and to examine the difference in age, gender and previous working experience as health care assistants in elderly care between the two groups. Design This was a cross-sectional study using the Swedish version of the Clinical Learning Environment and Nurse Teacher evaluation scale. Methods Consecutive sampling was performed over three semesters from September 2011 to December 2012. The survey was conducted with 183 student nurses. Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine differences in relation to two groups namely student nurses who did or did not consider to work in elderly care. A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the difference in age, gender and previous working experience between the two groups. Results The analysis leaned towards an overall positive evaluation of the clinical learning environment with more positive values for students considering a career. There were no significant differences between younger students (18–23) and older students (24–50) regarding willingness to work in elderly care or not. Neither was any significant difference displayed between students, based on gender nor for previous work experience. Conclusion Age, gender and previous work experiences as health care assistants did not impact on students' willingness to work in elderly care. Future studies need to acknowledge the complexity of why student nurses choose a particular pathway in nursing by longitudinal studies following cohorts of students during the course of the nursing programme.</ab>

        <ab>Hypercalcaemia is a common biochemical abnormality in the blood that can be caused by malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, medications or underlying medical conditions. Initial signs and symptoms are often vague, however, if someone has severe hypercalcaemia it is treated as an emergency, requiring prompt management to prevent life-threatening complications such as dehydration, cardiac arrhythmias or coma. Understanding the pathophysiology, signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia enables effective diagnosis and holistic management of the patient with complex health needs.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The study aimed to identify the potential for aged care placements to deliver benefits for second year nursing students when conducted within a supportive framework with debriefing and critical reflection opportunities. Background Given the ageing population and complex care needs of aged care facility residents, exacerbated by the high prevalence of dementia, the healthcare workforce's ability to meet older people's care needs is paramount. Yet research shows that nursing students are disengaged from aged care. Methods Using a quasi-experimental mixed method design within an action research framework, 40 students were allocated a 3-week supported placement in 2011-2012 at one of the two intervention residential aged care facilities in Tasmania, Australia. Staff formed mentor action research groups in each facility and participated in a pre-placement capacity-building programme. Thirty-nine students were placed across 14 control facilities. Data were collected via meetings with students and pre-post placement questionnaires on placement experiences, attitudes and dementia knowledge. Results The intervention facility placement programme led to mentors and students being well prepared for the placement and to students experiencing enhanced teaching and learning derived from high levels of mentor support and increased autonomy. Students' knowledge, understanding and attitudes around aged care and dementia improved. Discussion Mentors working together within an action research framework can provide a supported residential aged care placement for nursing students that improves students' aged care attitudes and understandings. Conclusion and Implications for Nursing and Health Policy Provision of quality, supported aged care student placements is vital to prepare a new generation of nurses who will have to deal with the complex chronic healthcare needs associated with an ageing population.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE To define the term complexity of care. BACKGROUND The aging population and lack of gerontological preparation in pre-licensure nursing programs are pressing issues. The NLN Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACE.S) project developed a framework to facilitate faculty and student understanding of older adults' care needs. Integral to the framework is the concept of complexity of care. METHOD Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS The analysis identified three antecedents (focus on treatment and cure of disease, multiple comorbidities, and life experiences and culture), five attributes (polypharmacy, use of advanced technologies, novel care models, a fragmented health care system, and the relational nature of caregiving), and two consequences (impact on quality of life and impact on quality of care). CONCLUSION Defining the concept of complexity of care will facilitate student understanding of the unique health care needs of older adults</ab>

        <ab>Objective To assess effect of a complex, multidisciplinary intervention aimed at reducing avoidable acute hospitalization of residents of residential aged care (RAC) facilities. Design Cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting RAC facilities with higher than expected hospitalizations in Auckland, New Zealand, were recruited and randomized to intervention or control. Participants A total of 1998 residents of 18 intervention facilities and 18 control facilities. Intervention A facility-based complex intervention of 9 months' duration. The intervention comprised gerontology nurse specialist (GNS)-led staff education, facility bench-marking, GNS resident review, and multidisciplinary (geriatrician, primary-care physician, pharmacist, GNS, and facility nurse) discussion of residents selected using standard criteria. Main outcome measures Primary end point was avoidable hospitalizations. Secondary end points were all acute admissions, mortality, and acute bed-days. Follow-up was for a total of 14 months. Results The intervention did not affect main study end points: number of acute avoidable hospital admissions (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.85–1.36; P = .59) or mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.76–1.61; P = .62). Conclusions This multidisciplinary intervention, packaging selected case review, and staff education had no overall impact on acute hospital admissions or mortality. This may have considerable implications for resourcing in the acute and RAC sectors in the face of population aging.</ab>

        <ab>Summary Background An undergraduate nurse's attitude toward older adults or their perception of working with older adults can influence the quality of care provided and their career choice, respectively. As such, it is important to conduct research that contributes to the evaluation of attitudes and perceptions. In the conduct of comprehensive and rigorous research, it is necessary to make the right choice of an instrument to measure outcomes. The identification of a valid and reliable instrument to suit a specific research question is a complex process. Objective In order to deal with this complexity, this paper reviews instruments that have been used to measure undergraduate nurse attitudes toward older adults and their perceptions of working with older adults. Data Sources Data were sourced from Medline, CINAHL, Healthsource/Academic Edition, PsycINFO and PubMed for the years 2008–2013. Results Eight readily available instruments were identified and their characteristics analyzed for their purpose, number of items, design, reliability and validity. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the instruments and recent use are also discussed. Conclusion The choice of a suitable instrument is likely to be critical to the testing of intervention strategies such as curriculum activities, which target attitude improvements to enhance the quality and effectiveness of nursing care provided to older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The aged care sector is increasingly dominated by a less-qualified workforce at a time of increasing prevalence of complex health concerns, such as dementia. An Australian program to develop teaching aged care facilities is being undertaken to build the sector’s capacity and provide nursing students with positive experiences of engaging with vulnerable clients. This research aimed to examine care staff potential to facilitate nursing student engagement with clinically relevant knowledge in the performance of hygiene care in a residential aged care facility. Methods: This study was designed as an action research study. A cycle of reflection, planning, action, and evaluation is described to illustrate the carer mentor capacity to engage with and contribute to the learning of nursing students. Participants were second year student nurses (n = 10) on a four-week placement in a Tasmanian aged care facility in 2013 and their nurse/carer mentors (n = 17). Mentors participated in six action research meetings, and nursing students engaged in a parallel series of four feedback meetings during the placement. Results: At the beginning of the placement, nursing students exhibited a disregard for the clinical value of care provision. Students considered provision of hygiene care, in particular, the preserve of care workers and an inappropriate training exercise in the context of an undergraduate nursing qualification. To assist students to make links between core nursing competencies and hygiene care as well as to engender respect for their role within the aged care facility, carer mentors developed the Carer Assessment and Reporting Guide. Once implemented during the final weeks of the placement, the Guide improved student perceptions of resident hygiene care (reframed as assessment) and the role of facility care workers, as well as reinforcing carer self-esteem. Conclusion: Hygiene care is replete with nursing competencies that are valuable for undergraduate learners, including assessments of skin integrity, mobility, cognitive function, bowels and urine, and basic hygiene. Nurse education programs should strive to address student misconceptions about care work in facilities to account for population level increases in care needs.</ab>

        <ab>Dementia care environments are now home to thousands of people who have complex mental and physical health needs. Many of these people have lost capacity or have fluctuating capacity to make decisions about their care. There can be times when restrictive physical interventions are necessary to protect a person’s wellbeing and to administer required treatment and care. However, nurses working in care settings may not be aware of their rights and liabilities, and those of care staff, when such interventions are used for therapeutic purposes. This article seeks to address areas of uncertainty and clarify the legal responsibilities of care teams by exploring the issues raised through a fictitious case vignette.</ab>

        <ab>Aim Just as in many countries all over the world, the number of older people in Italy has increased rapidly. Consequently, an increasing number of nurses are engaged in the care of older patients. However, due to a lack of understanding of how nurses and patients perceive caring, nursing care may be compromised. The aim of this study is to explore, describe and compare the perceptions of gerontological nurses and patients related to the dimensions of caring in nursing in an Italian hospital setting. Methods In this qualitative descriptive study, a variety of analytic techniques were used to analyse semi-structured interview data from a purposeful sample of 20 nurses and 20 patients from geriatric units in two different Italian hospitals. Findings Although both nurses and patients gave rich descriptions of caring experiences, patients described features of caring in nursing that were visible (including nurses' caring gestures, giving attention and being competent) while nurses predominantly emphasised aspects of caring that were relatively invisible (such as reflecting on the patient's past needs, evaluating the nursing care rendered, planning for more appropriate future nursing care, taking multiple complex contextual factors into account to protect the patient and being competent). Conclusion Our data revealed more nuanced insight into the meaning of invisible and visible caring in nursing within the gerontological context than has been previously reported in the literature. This has implications for nursing education and practice because it may help nurses meet the actual needs of older patients in hospital settings.</ab>

        <ab>Residents of long-term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program ( RACIP) is a quality improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on-site support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology nurse specialists ( GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of hospitalization 1 year before and after program implementation. The sample included 29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention group (rate ratio ( RR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.61-0.86, P &lt; .001). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group (69% increase) ( RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56-0.82, P &lt; .001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention and comparison groups ( RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.68-1.46, P = .99). The integration of GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.</ab>

        <ab>The experience of nurses who work in the residential elderly care setting regarding the seasonal influenza vaccine is often overlooked, with a paucity of published qualitative studies. The aim of this study is to present an insight into the issues concerning nurses with regard to the seasonal influenza vaccine. The study purposively sampled registered nurses (n=11) working in a large long-term care facility for older people (n=142) in Ireland. Using a broad qualitative research approach, data were collected through interviews, transcribed, analysed and grouped into the following themes: knowing: the seasonal influenza vaccine; mandatory vaccination: balancing autonomy and control; and meaningful education. This study reveals the complexity of issues and concerns for nurses when it comes to the seasonal influenza vaccine. These issues and concerns include influences such as family, friends, peers, the media and how nurses inform themselves. The position of nurses within the organisation and recommendations for meaningful nurse education are also discussed. The findings of this study provide an insight that could inform future influenza policy and education, which should be explored before the introduction of any mandatory influenza campaigns.</ab>

        <ab>An increasing number of nursing home quality improvement efforts are aimed at reducing avoidable hospitalizations of residents. The current study focused on the experiences of nursing home nurses as 'boundary-spanners' in the implementation of initiatives aimed at this effort. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 76 nursing staff members within 38 nursing homes. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and an inductive category development approach. Nursing staff described multiple scenarios where they had acted to negotiate the hospitalization decision and described themselves as working both within the nursing home boundary and within the larger system of external stakeholders to avoid a hospital transfer. There is potential for role overload and strain, as nurses are required to provide for complex medical needs within facilities designed to encourage relationship-driven, home-like care. Future efforts to reduce avoidable hospitalizations may benefit by ensuring needed resources are in place to provide clinically complex care and by making efforts to reduce the challenges that emerge when nurses are in the position to span the boundary between the nursing home and outside stakeholders.</ab>

        <ab>With an aging population, the majority of nurses will spend their careers working with older people. Currently, there is scant research about clinical instructors' knowledge and perceptions about nursing care of older people despite their instrumental role in preparing nurses for practice. The purpose of this study was to explore clinical instructors' knowledge and perceptions about nursing care of older people. A mixed methods approach was used. Fifteen clinical instructors and 15 nurse educators employed on specialized units for older people completed questionnaires. Independent t-tests were administered. Five of the clinical instructors also participated in semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings indicated that clinical instructors had significantly lower scores on knowledge and perceptions about nursing care of older people than practice-based nurse educators. Further, clinical instructors found it difficult to integrate specialized knowledge about nursing care of older people along with other aspects of their teaching. They also reported that it was challenging to support learning about best practices for older people within the current clinical context, which was complex and fast-paced. This study reinforces the need for professional development opportunities for clinical instructors to support their instrumental role in preparing students for practice with older people.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To investigate the associations among the ethical climate, professional practice environment and individualized nursing care in care settings for older people. Background The quality of care provision is affected by organizational environments, such as ethical climate and professional practice environment. Although, the association between professional practice environment and individualized nursing care has been pointed out, we know that little is known about how ethical climate is associated with the level of individualized nursing care delivery. Design A cross-sectional explorative and correlational survey design. Methods The study was conducted in 62 units in the vicinity of a Finnish city using a sample of nurses ( N = 874, response rate 58%) who worked clinically with older people in different care settings in 2012. Survey data were collected using the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey, Revised Professional Practice Environment scale and Individualised Care Scale-B. Data were analysed statistically using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients (Pearson) and multiple stepwise regression analyses. Results Statistically significant correlations were found among the variables, ethical climate and individualized care and between individualized care and all professional practice environment sub-scales. Multiple stepwise regression showed associations among individualized care, ethical climate and internal work motivation, control over practice and leadership and autonomy. Conclusions The study provided better understanding of the complex concept of individualized care by taking into consideration the ethical climate and the practice environment and their associations. To increase individualization in care provision, efforts need to be directed towards organizational aspects requiring the support of nursing leaders.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To present three converging myths that underlie the perception that nursing care for older persons in hospital is simple in comparison with its actual complexity. Background Literature provides strong evidence indicating that the myths we discuss inherently arise from ageism, the social value of older patients and the economic burden of being an older patient in hospital. These powerful social discourses promote harm to older patients. Harm emerges from both the omission of gerontological nursing knowledge and skill and the commission of acts that unintentionally harm. A corresponding ethical challenge results for acute care nurses. Design A discursive paper. Methods We illuminate gerontological issues by discussing three myths. In myth one, we detail four clusters of distinguishing characteristics in older hospitalised people. In the second myth, we challenge the idea that the role of the acute care hospital is to attend only to acute medical concerns. Finally, in the third myth, we address the issue of incorporating functional assessment into the acute care nursing assessment. We argue that functional assessment is poorly integrated and becomes acceptable only as long as the medical regimen is managed appropriately. Conclusion Safe quality care in hospital for older adults requires a hybrid practice that integrates acute care specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing knowledge and skill. Clinical reasoning that integrates this type of nursing knowledge can prevent harm. Relevance to clinical practice Integrating key elements of acute care nursing specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing principles aids to prevent the omission of care that is known to be harmful to older people. Conversely, the commission of gerontologically sensitive acute care can enhance safety and promote quality care in hospital.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives The aim of this integrative literature review was twofold: (1) to investigate different collaborative programmes for older people with depression living at home with diverse access to care and (2) to describe conceptualisation of the nurses' role and interventions within these care models. Background One in four older people who visits a General Practitioner suffers from depression. Depression is a concern for 15% of all older home-care service clients. Detecting and managing depression in older people is highlighted as a key role of nurses. A literature review has been conducted to investigate collaborative models of care, aimed at ensuring low-threshold access to care and exploring the scope of nurse practice within these models. Methods Literature review comprising 14 studies and reviews. Results Three different collaborative care programmes ( Collaborative Care Model, Community Mental Health Team and Psychogeriatric Assessment and Treatment in City Housing programme) were identified. In all programmes, the essential aspects were complex and multifaceted interventions, provided by a variety of healthcare professionals, but the access to care differed. All studies described the role of nurses differently and with wide variations. Conclusions Despite a broad scope of practice, nurses play a pivotal role within the different models of care. Nurses have to have the educational background and expertise in mental health issues to recognise depression and eventually be able to provide more comprehensive interventions to alleviate depression in older people. Relevance to practice Collaboration is needed to meet the needs of older people with depression. New forms of work divisions are pivotal to achieve this objective.</ab>

        <ab>Experience with my mother over the past 3 years led me reflect on how we care for older adults. For those who do not have a nurse in the family to provide care coordination and oversight, how are the gaps in continuity of care and transitions in care addressed? Many specialized positions are emerging for nurses in care coordination. These positions tend to focus on the most complex patients and on selected transitions in care. There are pockets of excellence but nurses who provide direct care in inpatient and outpatient settings are the safety net for older adults like my mother. They need competencies in assessment of older adults and awareness of how illness may present differently in this population. They need to be aware of the entire continuum of care and provide care coordination for patients who are not receiving specialized care coordination services.</ab>

        <ab>Intermediate care services are usually intended for frail, older people and those with complex needs. Their aims are to avoid unnecessary hospital admission, help people regain independence after a hospital stay and prevent premature admission to long-term care. Services are time limited and delivered in patients' own homes, community hospitals and sometimes nursing homes. But, as Louise Hunt reports, the second national audit of intermediate care, published late last year, found capacity in England is just half of what is needed. There is also significant variation between localities in capacity outside hospital and in the balance of bed-based, home-based and re-enablement services. Two case studies are presented of intermediate care services where nurses play an important role in achieving positive outcomes for patients and saving the health service money.</ab>

        <ab>Aim Review of intervention studies of associated factors with incontinence as the primary outcome in older people in care homes to identify and inform practice and future research. Background Incontinence is highly prevalent among care home populations. Previous reviews of descriptive and intervention studies have used urinary incontinence as the primary outcome. Design Systematic review and narrative summary. Data sources Electronic searches of English empirical studies undertaken using MEDLINE and CINAHL from January 1966-May 2010. All relevant empirical designs were selected from MEDLINE highly sensitive search strings from the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group, modified to exclude surgical and pharmacological studies Review methods The PRISMA statement was followed and established methods for systematic review to produce a narrative summary. Results Nine studies identified relating to associated factors with the management of incontinence in care homes. Factors included economic data, skin care, exercise studies, staff quality and prompted voiding adherence and the promotion of continence by the management of dehydration and incontinence. Conclusion Managing incontinence and promoting continence in care homes is complex, requiring time and cost-efficient management procedures to contain the problem and deliver quality, achievable care. When developing and designing systems of care in care homes, it is important to also recognize the impact of associated factors. As with any healthcare intervention programme, resources are required to implement the protocols. Economic evaluation studies are limited, with further studies warranted alongside preventative studies to maintain long-term continence in these populations.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a discussion of knowledge and awareness regarding prevention of functional decline in older hospitalized patients. Functional decline is experienced by 30-60% of the older hospitalized patients, resulting in decreased independence and other adverse health outcomes. One literature study and four cohort studies (total n = 1628) were conducted to develop and validate an instrument to identify older hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline. An evidence-based best practice was developed to improve the quality of care for older patients. This paper shows the relevance and the complexity of this problem and shows that patients at risk can be recognized by four simple questions. Due to their ability to observe and guide patients and their 24-h patient supervision, nurses should play a key role in strategies to prevent functional decline. Nurses should assess the geriatric needs in patients at risk and based on these initiate and coordinate multi-professional interventions. Given the growing number of older people in western society and the growing need for care, action to prevent functional decline cannot be withheld. Knowledge of the ageing process, implementation of an evidence-based programme and a multidisciplinary approach is a basic ingredient to prevent functional decline.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this study was to examine the relations between perceived organizational support, the quality of leader-member exchange, in-role and extra-role behaviour, professional identification and organizational identification among registered nurses and nurse assistants. Background Theoretically, employees will reciprocate received beneficial treatment with positive attitudes and behaviour. Recently, it has been shown that this principle may be more complex than originally anticipated. Design A quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was used. The quality of social exchange and identification was scored by the involved registered nurses and nurse assistants; in-role and extra-role behaviour was rated by the head nurse. Methods The survey was administered to nurses and nurse assistants ( n = 196) working in five Belgian nursing homes. Data were collected from February-March 2012. Pearson correlation analyses, t-test analyses and hierarchical regression were used to analyse the data. Results Our results showed no relationship between perceived organizational support and leader-member exchange and in-role behaviour. A positive relationship was found between perceived organizational support and extra-role behaviour and a trend towards significance between leader-member exchange and extra-role behaviour. Organizational and professional identification moderated the relationship between perceived organizational support and extra-role behaviour. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the importance of social exchange to nurses and nurse assistants and therefore nursing administrators and leaders. When registered nurses and nurse assistants perceive high-quality social exchange, they are more likely to go the extra mile on behalf of the organization. Fostering social identification could enhance this.</ab>

        <ab>Lived experiences and the power of memories of significant personal events to influence an individual's choice of career path is well documented in studies of students pursing careers in nursing. Less researched are the personal motivators that influence students' choices of specialization within career paths. Gerontology focused educational research provides a growing body of evidence pointing to the attitudinal disposition of students based on their life experiences and attachment to family members or significant others, not classroom exposure, as the primary predictor of vocational choice. What remain unclear are the types of naturally occurring motivators that propel students either toward or away from professional involvement with the elderly and in particular, the chronically and terminally ill. The questions of what motivates so many non-traditional nursing students, in particular, to work with elderly patients and what might motivate others who have shown no interest in this patient group to specialize in gerontology, is central to this interpretative phenomenological inquiry and frames the methodology used to define and interpret motivators among nursing students expressing an interest in or selecting gerontology as a career specialization. A synthesis of seven themes identified and analyzed from data collected through 30 in-depth interviews with 15 nursing students and other individuals closely associating with nursing education, suggests familial attachments, maturity, and traumatic or transformative experience, as the primary three motivators fueling an expressed desire to work with older patients. Conclusions also suggest motivators are identifiable and may be artificially replicated, and that strategic recruitment may also provide a solution for meeting geriatric nursing shortfalls. The purpose of the study has been to understand this complex phenomenon and to add to the body of knowledge surrounding nursing students' motivations and preferences for career specialization. The goal of the study has been to understand what elements might lead to new ways of increasing interest in the field of gerontology and specifically in direct care to elderly patients. Improvement in the numbers of BSN graduates electing to pursue early careers in geriatric direct care would provide a systemic remedy to the real-world problem of inadequate numbers of qualified nurses with adequate competencies to serve this high needs patient population.</ab>

        <ab>In their practice, nurses make daily decisions that are ethically informed. An ethical decision is the result of a complex reasoning process based on knowledge and experience and driven by ethical values. Especially in acute elderly care and more specifically decisions concerning the use of physical restraint require a thoughtful deliberation of the different values at stake. Qualitative evidence concerning nurses' decision-making in cases of physical restraint provided important insights in the complexity of decision-making as a trajectory. However a nuanced and refined understanding of the reasoning process in terms of ethical values is still lacking. A qualitative interview design, inspired by the Grounded Theory approach, was carried out to explore nurses' reasoning process in terms of ethical values. We interviewed 21 acute geriatric nurses from 12 hospitals in different regions in Flanders, Belgium in the period October 2009-April 2011. The Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven was used to analyse interview data. Nurses' decision-making is characterized as an ethical deliberation process where different values are identified and where the process of balancing these values forms the essence of ethical deliberation. Ethical decision-making in cases of physical restraint implies that nurses have to choose which values receive priority in the process, which entails that not all values can be respected to the same degree. As a result, decision making can be experienced as difficult, even as a dilemma. Driven by the overwhelming goal of protecting physical integrity, nurses took into account the values of dignity and justice more implicitly and less dominantly.</ab>

        <ab>Background It is both complex and difficult for relatives when a loved one moves into a nursing home and many relatives are not prepared for the realities these new situations entail. Little attention has been paid to scrutinising the involvement of relatives in patient care, particularly in relation to the structures and routines of nursing homes or to the staff's reasoning concerning their involvement. Aim To describe, from a gender perspective, how nursing staff's routines and reasoning act to condition the involvement of relatives in nursing homes. Methods Focused ethnographic fieldwork was conducted in a medium-sized urban community in central Sweden in three different nursing homes. Results The nursing staff assigns a certain code of conduct to all relatives they perceived as 'visitors' in their working arena. This code of conduct was related to the routines and subcultures existing among the nursing staff and stemmed from a division of labour; the underlying concept of 'visitor' predetermined the potential for relatives' involvement. This involvement is explicitly related to the general gendered characteristics that exist in the nursing staff's perception of the relatives. Discussion The study's limitations are primarily concerned with shortcomings associated with a research presence during the fieldwork. The discussion focuses on the dimensions of power structures observed in the nursing home routines and the staff's reasoning based on their gendered assumptions. We argue that it is important to develop mechanisms that provide opportunities for nursing staff in elderly care to reflect on these structures without downplaying the excellent care they provide. We stress the importance of further exploring these issues concerning relatives and their involvement in nursing homes to facilitate the transition from informal caregiver to 'visitor'.</ab>

        <ab>Families of older adults are intricately involved in the end-of-life decision-making process for a family member with a serious illness in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. However, families are not always as involved and as informed as they would like to be. Creating a culture that assesses family needs and supports families is an important component of family-centered care. There are several strategies that nurses and other members of the interdisciplinary team can use to promote family-centered end-of-life care in the ICU. Nurses can get to know the family by spending time talking with them, assessing them, seeking to understand their perspectives on their family member's condition, and discussing previously verbalized patient wishes for care. This article offers strategies nurses can use to help guide the family through the end-of-life decision-making process, support families as difficult and complex decisions are made in collaboration with the health care team, and prepare families for the dying process.</ab>

        <ab>Gerontological care in nursing homes receives little interest from students and newly qualified nurses alike. Yet, this population does have ever-more complex needs that call for a wide array of nursing competencies. This article highlights the essential contributions of registered nurses in the context of nursing homes and is part of a research study aimed at grasping the nature of caring for elders. The researchers used the methodology inspired from activity analysis using focus groups. Situations identified by the respondents as being disruptive have been looked at in cross-perspective. The results show that the work carried out by the registered nurses constitutes the linchpin of institutional functioning. Their contribution consists of coordinating all the activities that take place, while striving to make them relevant to the caretakers, residents, and their relatives. This key role comprises three fields of activities: organizational and innovative activities; autonomous, person-centered activities; and ethical tension management activities. By helping to meet the daily challenges pertaining to the care and monitoring of very old people and by dealing with situations that are often tragic, they carry out tasks that are stimulating on human, intellectual, and relational levels.</ab>

        <ab>The author reflects on the medical care of aging patients with developmental disabilities and on the role that gerontological nurses can play in meeting their needs. She suggests that the nursing and health care needs of individuals with developmental disabilities are often complex and that the needs become more challenging as these individuals age. She argues that gerontological nurses face challenges when ensuring that developmentally disabled older adults receive effective care.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that according to government nursing blueprint, nurses provide complex care to extensive frail older people. District nurses are involved in working with community matrons to provide palliative care and nutrition advice, and working with old patients to help them care for themselves. The number of district nurses is decreasing because of the long time required to care for old patients thus increasing the work load on community nurses.</ab>

A complexidade do cuidado ao idoso com perspectiva ecossistêmica é suportada por princípios epistemológicos e compreendida como processo de construção do cuidado, no qual se retomam, em diferentes momentos e de maneira interativa e recursiva, os seres humanos, os instrumentos e o ambiente, visando melhor compreender a dinâmica processual e as mudanças. Alude relação interativa, dinâmica, aberta e recursiva, caracterizada pela construção de estratégias de ação, adaptáveis às mudanças e que desenvolvidas durante o cuidado estão expostas ao imprevisto e ao inesperado, requerendo pluralidade de ações.

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: Qualitatively describe the use of team and group processes in intervention facilities participating in a study targeted to improve quality of care in nursing homes “in need of improvement.” Design/setting/participants: A randomized, two-group, repeated-measures design was used to test a 2-year intervention for improving quality of care and resident outcomes. Intervention group (n = 29) received an experimental multilevel intervention designed to help them: (1) use quality improvement methods, (2) use team and group process for direct-care decision-making, (3) focus on accomplishing the basics of care, and (4) maintain more consistent nursing and administrative leadership committed to communication and active participation of staff in decision-making. Results: The qualitative analysis revealed a subgroup of homes (“Full Adopters”) likely to continue quality improvement activities that were able to effectively use teams. “Full Adopters” had either the nursing home administrator or director of nursing who supported and were actively involved in the quality improvement work of the team. “Full Adopters” also selected care topics for the focus of their quality improvement team, instead of “communication” topics of the “Partial Adopters” or “Non-Adopters” in the study who were identified as unlikely to continue to continue quality improvement activities after the intervention. “Full Adopters” had evidence of the key elements of complexity science: information flow, cognitive diversity, and positive relationships among staff; this evidence was lacking in other subgroups. All subgroups were able to recruit interdisciplinary teams, but only those that involved leaders were likely to be effective and sustain team efforts at quality improvement of care delivery systems. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative analysis can help leaders and medical directors use the key elements and promote information flow among staff, residents, and families; be inclusive as discussions about care delivery, making sure diverse points of view are included; and help build positive relationships among all those living and working in the nursing home. Wide-spread adoption of the intervention in the randomized study is feasible and could be enabled by nursing home Medical Directors in collaborative practice with Advanced Practice Nurses.</ab>

Results: The qualitative analysis revealed a subgroup of homes (“Full Adopters”) likely to continue quality improvement activities that were able to effectively use teams. “Full Adopters” had either the nursing home administrator or director of nursing who supported and were actively involved in the quality improvement work of the team. “Full Adopters” also selected care topics for the focus of their quality improvement team, instead of “communication” topics of the “Partial Adopters” or “Non-Adopters” in the study who were identified as unlikely to continue to continue quality improvement activities after the intervention. “Full Adopters” had evidence of the key elements of complexity science: information flow, cognitive diversity, and positive relationships among staff; this evidence was lacking in other subgroups. All subgroups were able to recruit interdisciplinary teams, but only those that involved leaders were likely to be effective and sustain team efforts at quality improvement of care delivery systems. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative analysis can help leaders and medical directors use the key elements and promote information flow among staff, residents, and families; be inclusive as discussions about care delivery, making sure diverse points of view are included; and help build positive relationships among all those living and working in the nursing home. Wide-spread adoption of the intervention in the randomized study is feasible and could be enabled by nursing home Medical Directors in collaborative practice with Advanced Practice Nurses.</ab>

        <ab>As the American population ages, the need for more long-term care services will increase. The elderly who are afflicted with a number of chronic illnesses predominantly use long-term care services. By 2020, 12 million older Americans will need long-term care services, and those 65 and older have a 40% chance of entering some type of long-term care facility as cited by Medicare, What is Long-Term Care. Challenged to care for this complex group of patients, nurses in long-term care need continuing education to provide appropriate evidence based care. In order to provide competent care, long-term care nurses need to participate in continuing education activities. Due to the growing need for long-term care services, it is important to understand the attitudes and deterrents that may prevent long-term care nurses from participating in continuing educational activities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between attitudes of long-term care nurses toward continuing education and deterrents to participate in these activities. A quantitative correlation design using a survey methodology was employed in this study. Bivariate and multivariate analysis tested for the existence of primary relationships between attitudes toward continuing education and deterrents to participate in continuing education. Analysis also tested for the effects of the moderating variables on the primary relationships. A demographic survey and two quantitative set of surveys, the Adults Attitudes Toward Continuing Education Scale (AATCES) and the Deterrents to Participation Scale (DPS), were administered to gerontological nurses who are members of a national nursing organization. The online surveys were completed by (n = 81) nurses. Overall, there were high positive attitudes toward continuing education. In addition, there was a negative statistically significant correlation between attitudes toward continuing education and deterrents to participate, (r =.-283; p = .010). There were also several statically significant correlations between specific attitudes toward continuing education and specific deterring factors. This study provides a detailed view of the relationship between attitudes toward continuing education and deterring factors that influence participation. Educators can use these findings to better address barriers that prevent participation in continuing education activities among long-term care nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Elder abuse remains a significant problem nationally and globally. Early definitions of abuse, however, oversimplified the phenomena and while the complexity of elder abuse, in nature and scale, has also been growing recently there remains some confusion conceptually and in practice in terms of what is meant by and can be identified as abusive practice. The lack of conceptual clarity is evident across professional and agency boundaries. The authors suggest that a potential way forward is through the development of interprofessional learning as an integral part of education and training in respect of safeguarding older adults. This article highlights a number of complexities in the context of safeguarding and raises areas for further reflection and possible debate.</ab>

        <ab>INTRODUCTION:  Nursing models and terminologies can contribute to research the nature of nursing care. AIM:  The aim of this study was to describe nursing diagnoses in acute- and long-term elderly care. METHODS:  A point prevalence survey was conducted on 240 patients. The International Classification for Nursing Practice was used to describe nursing diagnoses, and a conceptual model was used to categorize them in nursing needs. RESULTS:  A total of 2,673 diagnoses were detected. Mean was higher in nursing home than in hospital ( t test =−3.688; p = .0003). Prevalent diagnoses were significantly different. DISCUSSION:  High complexity, with different issues for nurses, was observed both in acute- and in long-term settings. CONCLUSION:  The results could help to comprehend the nature of older persons needs and could contribute to the development of an International Classification for Nursing Practice catalogue for elderly care. INTRODUZIONE:  Le terminologie infermieristiche possono contribuire a studiare la natura dell'assistenza infermieristica. SCOPO:  Lo scopo dello studio è quello di descrivere le necessità assistenziali infermieristiche dell'anziano nell'ospedale per acuti e in lungodegenza. METODI:  Uno studio di prevalenza di punto è stato condotto coinvolgendo 240 pazienti. L'ICNP è stato impiegato per identificare le necessità assistenziali infermieristiche (nursing diagnoses) ed un modello concettuale per raggrupparle in bisogni di assistenza infermieristica. RISULTATI:  Sono state identificate 2,673 necessità assistenziali. La media è stata maggiore in casa di riposo che in ospedale ( t test =−3.688; p = .0003). Le necessità prevalenti sono state significativamente differenti. DISCUSSIONE:  È stata osservata una elevata complessità dell'assistenza infermieristica, con differenti problematiche per gli infermieri, sia nel contesto acuto che di lungodegenza. CONCLUSIONI:  I risultati possono aiutare a comprendere i bisogni delle persone anziane e possono contribuire allo sviluppo di un ICNP Catalogue per l'assistenza in ambito geriatrico.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Pain continues to be a common problem for older hospitalised patients, but little is known about how the complexities of actual clinical practice affect pain assessment and management in these patients. Objective: To examine how pain was assessed and managed in older patients who were admitted to geriatric evaluation and management units. Design, setting and participants: A naturalistic observational research design was used involving observations of interactions between nurses and patients, and follow-up interviews with nurses. Three observation periods were conducted between midnight and midday, which commenced at 03:30, 07:30, and 10:30, and three observation periods were conducted between midday and midnight, which commenced at 15:30, 18:30, and 22:30. Between 12 and 13 observations were conducted for each observation period, each ranging from 2 to 3h. The study was undertaken in two units, each located in an Australian public teaching hospital. Participants included registered nurses employed in the units, and patients in their care. Results: Four major themes were identified: communication among nurses and between older patients and nurses; strategies for pain management; environmental and organisational aspects of care; and complexities in the nature of pain. Nurses tended to use simple questioning with patients about the pain experienced. Despite the availability of ‘as required’ opioid medication for breakthrough or incident pain, nurses often preferred to wait to determine if pain was relieved following administration of fixed-dose paracetamol. Time of day impacted on how pain was managed due to availability of nursing staff. It was unit policy for doctors to reduce medications prescribed, which often extended to analgesics, and nurses were left to deal with patient tensions in addressing analgesic needs. Complexities were associated with the nature of pain experienced, in terms of perceived level of tolerable pain, the simultaneous presence of chronic and acute pain, location of pain, and differentiation of pain from discomfort. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the intricacies associated with how analgesic needs are addressed in older patients, especially those with communication deficits, the complex nature of older patients’ painful experiences, and the precarious balance of attempting to treat pain effectively while avoiding adverse effects of analgesics.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, the meaning and implications of dignity, integrity, and autonomy as core concepts in eldercare are illuminated and discussed. Elderly people who receive nursing care are vulnerable and dependent which appeal to care ethics and emphasise the importance of these concepts. However, dignity, integrity, and autonomy are complex concepts that are difficult to work with because on the one hand, they are used frequently in everyday language, and on the other hand, they are hard to define in a caring practice. Based on theoretical and empirical studies within the context of eldercare, the aim of this article is, from a caring perspective, to explore and describe the meaning of these concepts and illustrate their impact for a dignified care. Three key ethical challenges and five principles for eldercare are elucidated and discussed. The ethical issue is basically a concern for the vulnerability of the elderly and respecting the elderly person as an individual human being.</ab>

        <ab>Historical and epistemological developments contribute to and reinforce the underlying framework that categorizes antiaging discourse and healthy aging discourse. This discourse creates the question 'Can we live longer or better?' and encompasses issues of quality versus quantity, dependency versus autonomy, and risk versus benefit. By positing this discourse as a dichotomous tension, the development can be traced through the examination of select examples of influential studies in the field of aging. For nursing, the risk of these continued oppositions is potential oversimplification that may limit discernment of the complexities of care of older adults. Through understanding of the evolution and imposition of this dichotomizing discourse, nursing can provide older adult care within the reality of the aging experience, and develop frameworks, theories, and multidisciplinary discursive practice to optimize nursing care in the real-world spaces that exist between antiaging and healthy aging boundaries.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Compassionate care is a key priority for policy and the profession, yet the meaning of the concept and the processes that enable it to happen in the context of everyday practice is unclear. Creative methods within a practice development study helped to engage participants in a deep understanding of compassion. Aims and objectives: One of the aims of the study was to explore the experiences of staff, patients and their families in giving and receiving care within an older people care setting in an acute hospital. The use of creative methods in helping to explore this aim as well as enhancing engagement with the inquiry process and ownership of findings is the focus of this paper. The methods discussed include photo-elicitation, role enactment and poetry. Conclusions: Use of creative methods enabled a clearer articulation of the concept of compassion and an inclusive approach to data generation and analysis, dissemination and the use of findings in practice. It could be argued that these methods enabled a deeper understanding about compassion and how this is experienced in practice compared to more traditional methods such as asking questions and sharing results through reports. Being confident in the initiation and facilitation of these methods however requires a degree of courage and confidence. There is more scope to share reflections on the experience of using such approaches to enables others to develop this courage and confidence. Implications for practice: Using creative methods in practice: * Is valuable to tap into complex concepts in health care * Is valuable in bringing about greater engagement in the practice development process * Requires confidence and skilled facilitation</ab>

        <ab>PROBLEM. The increasing numbers of people seeking care for chronic disease has placed unparalleled demands on nurses who journey with them as they grasp the meaning of their altered health status. The complexity of the newly diagnosed chronic disease can be overwhelming. Newly diagnosed elder patients need a refuge in which to explore the uncertainties and challenges in managing a chronic illness. Reactions to a new diagnosis are uniquely shaped by the elder person's culture, age, life circumstances, and previous coping strategies. Six dichotomous response pairs are posed: relief versus devastation, courage versus cowardice, disease obsession versus disease aversion, rational thinking versus intuition, reawakening versus stuck, and self-reliance versus dependence. Nurses can create a sanctuary for elderly patients with protected space, presence, partnership, past to future orientation, and perspective on life. Nurses who embrace this mission may find themselves returning to the reasons they sought a nursing career, to support and strengthen elderly people in the most vulnerable moments of their lives.</ab>

        <ab>At Leicester Royal Infirmary, the care of frail older people occupies a disproportionate amount of emergency department (ED) staff's time and resources. Too few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as possible. This article describes how the unit operates.</ab>

        <ab>Individualized nursing care, a form of person- centered care delivery, is accepted as best practice, yet its implementation into actual care is far from complete. Appropriate measures of this elusive concept are needed to better understand barriers to implementation. This study explored and tested the convergent validity and the reliability of 2 individualized nursing care measures. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data using the Individualized Care Scale and the Individualized Care Instrument (ICI) from a sample of nurses (n = 263, response rate 71%) working in older peoples' care settings in Finland, and the data were analyzed statistically. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the ICI scales (.63-.80) and ICS-A and B subscales (both a = .91) demonstrated only moderate correlation between the 2 instruments (r = -.39 to .50) and possibly the complexity of measuring "individualized care." The study acknowledges the latent influence of culture and care approach to the conceptualization of individuality. It concludes that the concept may best be measured at this point with the use of other factors in addition to instruments to capture its multiple domains.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: In older age, reduction in physical function can lead to loss of independence, the need for hospital and long-term nursing or residential home care, and premature death. Home-visiting programmes for older people, carried out by nurses and other health-care professionals (e.g. occupational therapists and physiotherapists), aim to positively affect health and functional status, and may promote independent functioning of older people. OBJECTIVE: The main research question addressed by this assessment is 'What is the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of home-based, nurse-led health promotion intervention for older people in the UK?' DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken across 12 different databases and research registries from the year 2001 onwards (including MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Health Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). Published systematic reviews were also hand searched to identify other trials previously published. REVIEW METHODS: Potentially relevant studies were sifted by one reviewer, and inclusion decisions were agreed among the broader research team. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The results of included studies were synthesised using narrative and statistical methods. A separate systematic search was undertaken to identify existing health economic analyses of home-based, nurse-led health promotion programmes. Included studies were critically appraised using a published checklist. Owing to resource constraints, a de novo health economic model was not developed. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the systematic review of clinical effectiveness. There was considerable heterogeneity among the studies with respect to the nature of the intervention, the nurses delivering the programmes and the populations in which the interventions were assessed. Overall, the quality of the included studies was good: all but one of the included studies were judged to be at medium or low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of eight studies suggested a statistically significant mortality benefit for the home-based health promotion groups, whereas a meta-analysis of four studies suggested non-significant benefits in terms of fewer falls in the intervention groups than in the control groups. Positive outcomes for home-based, nurse-led health promotion interventions were also reported within individual studies across several other outcomes. Only three economic studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review of cost-effectiveness. This evidence base consists of one non-randomised cost minimisation analysis and two economic evaluations undertaken alongside randomised controlled trials. Two of these studies involved an intervention targeted specifically at patients with a known underlying incurable disease, whereas the third study examined the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early discharge in patients with a range of conditions, including fractures, neurological conditions and cardiorespiratory conditions. Each study indicated some likelihood that home-based, nurse-led health promotion may offer cost savings to the NHS and associated sectors, such as social services. However, one study did not report any comparison of health outcomes and instead simply assumed equivalence between the intervention and comparator groups, whereas the other two studies suggested at best a negligible incremental benefit in terms of preference-based health-related quality-of-life measures. LIMITATIONS: The evidence base for clinical effectiveness is subject to considerable heterogeneity. The UK economic evidence base is limited to three studies. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the evidence included in this systematic review, home-based, nurse-led health promotion may offer clinical benefits across a number of important health dimensions. However, it is generally unclear from the available studies which components of this type of complex intervention contribute towards individual aspects of benefit for older people. Given the limitations of the current evidence base, it remains unclear whether or not home-based health promotion interventions offer good value for money for the NHS and associated sectors. Given the considerable uncertainties in the available evidence base, it is difficult to isolate the key areas in which future research would be valuable or the exact study design required. Although this report does not identify specific studies that should be undertaken, it does set out a number of key considerations for the design of future research in this area.

        <ab>Background: Quality improvement (QI) programs focused on mastery of content by individual staff members are the current standard to improve resident outcomes in nursing homes. However, complexity science suggests that learning is a social process that occurs within the context of relationships and interactions among individuals. Thus, QI programs will not result in optimal changes in staff behavior unless the context for social learning is present. Accordingly, we developed CONNECT, an intervention to foster systematic use of management practices, which we propose will enhance effectiveness of a nursing home Falls QI program by strengthening the staff-to-staff interactions necessary for clinical problem-solving about complex problems such as falls. The study aims are to compare the impact of the CONNECT intervention, plus a falls reduction QI intervention (CONNECT + FALLS), to the falls reduction QI intervention alone (FALLS), on fall-related process measures, fall rates, and staff interaction measures.Methods/design: Sixteen nursing homes will be randomized to one of two study arms, CONNECT + FALLS or FALLS alone. Subjects (staff and residents) are clustered within nursing homes because the intervention addresses social processes and thus must be delivered within the social context, rather than to individuals. Nursing homes randomized to CONNECT + FALLS will receive three months of CONNECT first, followed by three months of FALLS. Nursing homes randomized to FALLS alone receive three months of FALLs QI and are offered CONNECT after data collection is completed. Complexity science measures, which reflect staff perceptions of communication, safety climate, and care quality, will be collected from staff at baseline, three months after, and six months after baseline to evaluate immediate and sustained impacts. FALLS measures including quality indicators (process measures) and fall rates will be collected for the six months prior to baseline and the six months after the end of the intervention. Analysis will use a three-level mixed model.Discussion: By focusing on improving local interactions, CONNECT is expected to maximize staff's ability to implement content learned in a falls QI program and integrate it into knowledge and action. Our previous pilot work shows that CONNECT is feasible, acceptable and appropriate.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00636675.</ab>

        <ab>The author laments the general perception held by the nursing community of long-term care (LTC) nursing being lowly. The author who switched to LTC from intensive care, found the demands of the specialty to be extremely challenging and rewarding at the same time. Considering that the need for a nursing workforce adept at managing the complex care required by older residents is only increasing the author stresses the need to educate the public about the expert care provided by LTC nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Background  The phenomenon of an ageing population is being experienced globally, as countries struggle to change and improve residential models of care and provide services to the elderly. The role of the registered nurse (RN) is considered crucial to the clinical governance and management of care given. To date, however, no systematic review has examined the RN's experience in leadership and management. Objectives  The objective of this review is to critically appraise, synthesise and present best available evidence on the experiences of RNs as clinical leaders and managers in residential aged care facilities. Inclusion criteria  This review considered qualitative research papers that addressed the experiences of RNs as clinical leaders and managers in residential aged care facilities. Participants of interest were RNs, nurse leaders, nurses holding registration and or regulation under a board of nursing, nurses working in residential aged care and long-term care facilities. The diversity and use of language to describe nurses' roles and models of care for the elderly care environment were considered in the review. Search strategy  The search strategy sought to find both published studies and papers, limited to the English language and published between January 1997 and February 2011. An initial limited search was done in Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases to identify the key words contained in the title or abstract and index terms used to describe the relevant terms in the article. A second extensive search was undertaken and extended to other relevant databases using all identified keywords and index terms. The third step involved searching reference lists and bibliographies of chosen articles for additional studies. Methodological quality  Each paper was assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological quality prior to inclusion in the review using an appropriate critical appraisal instrument from the System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information package. As both reviewers were in agreement on all studies included, a third reviewer was not required. Results  A final total of eight papers, qualitative in nature, were included in the review. The majority of papers examined the experiences of nurses' leadership styles and the management characteristics within their organisations. The qualitative papers were analysed using The Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument.The process of meta-synthesis embodied in this programme involves the aggregation or synthesis of findings or conclusions. Five syntheses were derived with key themes related to education, professional nursing development, positive attitudes to aged care and the need for a supportive environment. Conclusion  Nurses that work in the aged care environment show a strong motivation to work in care and provide the best outcomes in nursing the elderly. Geriatric nursing is considered a specialised and complex area of healthcare by the nursing profession. Nurses experience a lack of professional support and collaboration from allied health and medical colleagues. There is a lack of specific education that is focused in clinical leadership and health team management. There is no current structured pathway of learning and development for nursing careers in aged care. Nurses identify with their leadership role in residential aged care, and experience paradoxical feelings of being valued by the clients and devalued by the system at the same time. Organisational barriers are strong in preventing continuing education and skills development for nurse leaders in aged care environments. Implications for practice  Overall the themes presented in the review reported the negative experiences of nurses in residential aged care and geriatrics. Nurses will continue to be devalued if there is no professional identity and support for their roles and need to have a career pathway when making the decision to enter into aged and geriatric practice. Clinical leadership training is needed for nurses to transition through practice into specialised roles such as the RN team leader and Geriatric Nurse Practitioner (GNP). Providing a career structure and choice in the industry for the nurse to become a clinical leader or a manager of health services will improve recruitment and retention. Implication for research  More research is needed to identify the skills gaps experienced by nurses in aged care and geriatric care. This research could lead to the design and implementation of a skills audit to identify candidates for specialised courses so that clinical leadership and governance in aged care are improved. More research is needed for role construction and the professional development of the GNP. Organisations can benefit from research currently being conducted on the role of the RN in aged care and geriatrics, by mapping the skills mix of candidate RNs to the key performance indicators in the role. Organisations must change their perception and value of RNs as clinical leaders in care teams.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare systems in aging societies need to find new solutions in the provision of care and treatment of older people. Gerotechnologies play a crucial role in the 'aging-in-place' process. This article offers a critical overview of gerotechnological studies and will suggest a new approach in the study of the relationship between aging and technologies. Some trajectories of analysis and theoretical models are presented to underline the different perspectives in the discipline. Critical positions highlight the lack of theoretical analysis, mainly in relation to the complex social phenomenon of aging related to technology. Conclusions outline a relational approach to gerotechnologies: an analysis of the interactions between technological artifacts, users, and the context in which technologies are used. This approach expands the view from the technical potential of the technology to the way elderly people use technology, and suggests innovative care and cure strategies for aging.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this study was to gain insight into registered nurses' experiences of caring for older people in the UK and Japan. Method Critical incident technique was used because of its ability to capture actual incidents from practice. Written, anonymous self-report data were collected during 2010. Participants were asked to recall two critical incidents where they had felt either rewarded or challenged at work. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Analysis revealed striking similarities in the experiences of nurses from both countries. Four main themes emerged: the challenges of a complex work environment; the challenges of resolving ethical conflicts; the rewards of establishing meaningful relationships; and the rewards of achieving excellence in individual patient care. Conclusion The study provides new evidence from two different countries that although there are some challenges, nurses reap many rewards from working with older people.</ab>

        <ab>Violence is the bane of care workers who render direct, personal care on a daily basis. Most of society is unaware of the extent of the problem of violence - one that can only worsen in the coming years as residents with dementia, psychiatric disorders, and complex chronic medical conditions enter our care facilities in record numbers. This article, the first of two, cites a number of literature sources, research studies and the experiences of the author. It describes the extent of the problem, and the consequences should the issue of violence in long-term care not be effectively addressed. The second installment will deal with the prevention of violence.</ab>

        <ab>perry l., bellchambers h., howie a., moxey a., parkinson l., capra s. &amp; byles j. (2011) Examination of the utility of the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework for implementation of evidence based practice in residential aged care settings. Journal of Advanced Nursing 67(9), 2139-2150. Abstract Aim.  This study examined the relevance and fit of the PARiHS framework (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) as an explanatory model for practice change in residential aged care. Background.  Translation of research knowledge into routine practice is a complex matter in health and social care environments. Examination of the environment may identify factors likely to support and hinder practice change, inform strategy development, predict and explain successful uptake of new ways of working. Frameworks to enable this have been described but none has been tested in residential aged care. Methods.  This paper reports preliminary qualitative analyses from the Encouraging Best Practice in Residential Aged Care Nutrition and Hydration project conducted in New South Wales in 2007-2009. We examined congruence with the PARiHS framework of factors staff described as influential for practice change during 29 digitally recorded and transcribed staff interviews and meetings at three facilities. Findings.  Unique features of the setting were flagged, with facilities simultaneously filling the roles of residents' home, staff's workplace and businesses. Participants discussed many of the same characteristics identified by the PARiHS framework, but in addition temporal dimensions of practice change were flagged. Conclusion.  Overall factors described by staff as important for practice change in aged care settings showed good fit with those of the PARiHS framework. This framework can be recommended for use in this setting. Widespread adoption will enable cross-project and international synthesis of findings, a major step towards building a cumulative science of knowledge translation and practice change.</ab>

        <ab>Background Although it is widely recognised that frail older persons need adaptation of healthcare services, it is unclear how hospital care in general can best be tailored to their frailty. Objective To systematically review the evidence for hospital-wide interventions for older patients. Methods PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cinahl and reference lists of included articles (1980-2009) were searched. Papers describing (1) randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-after studies or interrupted time series, (2) patients &gt;=65years admitted to hospital, (3) hospital-wide organisational interventions, and (4) patient-related outcomes, quality of care, patient safety, resource use or costs were included. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently, according to Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group guidelines. Results The authors included 20 articles out of 1175. The mean age of the study populations ranged from 74.2 to 85.8years. Interventions included multidisciplinary (consultative) teams, nursing care models, structural changes in physical environment and/or changes in site of service delivery. Small or no effects were found on patient-related outcomes such as functional performance, length of stay, discharge destination, resource use and costs compared with usual care. Methodological quality evaluation showed data incompleteness and contamination as main sources of bias. Conclusions No single best hospital-wide intervention could be identified using strict methodological criteria. However, several interventions had positive results, and may be used in hospital practice. Since strict methodological designs are not optimal for evaluating highly complex interventions and settings, the authors recommend studying hospital-wide interventions for older persons using adapted quality and research criteria.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Older adults account for up to 14.5% of ED visits. Presentation of older adults can differ from younger adults. Emergency visits by older adults that are characterized by comorbidity, cognitive and functional impairment, and complex social issues. In addition, older adults present with subtle, atypical symptoms making diagnosis and discharge more challenging. The purpose of this study was to describe an innovative geriatric emergency nurse role that has been implemented to address the unique needs of older adults in the emergency department. Methods: This was an exploratory, descriptive study. The study sample was comprised of two groups: Geriatric Emergency Nurses (N=5) and key informants (N=15). The study was based at a tertiary hospital in Vancouver, Canada. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The findings are organized into three sections: defining the role and its functions; a collaborative relationship: fitting in to the larger emergency department; and recommendations for future role development. Conclusion: Findings from the study have led to further considerations about the role in relation to communication about older patients both within the emergency department and with community stakeholders. We also discuss the importance of this role in relation to the continuum of care and recognizing the central role of the emergency department as a place for intervention. Lastly, we consider the need for further integration of gerontological knowledge and expertise within the emergency department beyond a specialized role.</ab>

        <ab>Given the aging population and the complex needs of older adults, there is considerable need for additional gerontological nurses. This pilot study explored fourth-year nursing students' attitudes and values toward caring for older adults and the influence of their experiences with older adults on these attitudes and values. Using Yin's exploratory case study design, 51 fourth-year nursing students constituted the single case. An initial quantitative survey placed students in three embedded units of analysis: neutral, pro-aged, and anti-aged bias toward older adults. Using purposeful sampling from each of the embedded units, 9 students were interviewed. Four main values (respect, caring, independence, and wisdom and experience) and five attitudes (enjoy older adults, see older adults as normal, feel sorry for older adults, are frustrated by older adults, and dislike gerontological nursing) were identified. The authors' findings have important implications for education and practice.</ab>

        <ab>Nursing faculty members are responsible for assuring competence and safety in the preparation of prelicensure students who are preparing to deliver care in diverse settings. The growing complexity of care and the rapid expansion of knowledge have challenged the adequacy of traditional educational approaches. Proposed solutions have encouraged closer integration of classroom and clinical teaching. This article describes an integrated instructional approach to developing clinical leadership competencies in a cohort of accelerated, second-degree, baccalaureate nursing students. Fifty-six students completed an intensive clinical experience in long-term care settings in which they used evidence on improving care for persons with heart failure to practice the principles of delegation and supervision with nursing staff. The pre- and postassessments indicated improvement in heart failure knowledge and increased readiness for delegation and supervision of certified nursing assistants. As one component of the learning experience, the students completed reflection journals. The entries in the students' journals revealed five themes: (a) low leadership self-efficacy, (b) managing the credibility gap, (c) flexibility in communication strategies, (d) RN accountability in delegation and supervision, and (e) knowledge dissemination with diverse nursing staff. Students and faculty judged the learning experience to be successful and supported the experience for future cohorts of students. This report is one example of how innovative learning experiences could be developed to increase the "real-world" aspects of clinical care within a multidisciplinary team context for the entry-level learner.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: In 2000, the John A. Hartford Foundation launched a multi-million dollar investment in Building Academic Geriatric Nursing Capacity (BAGNC) at the American Academy of Nursing (AAN). After a decade of focused support to increase scholarship, research, leadership, and institutional collaboration, is there evidence this program is successful in achieving its goals? Equally important, as the need for quality geriatric nursing care increases with the expanding aging population and associated complex health conditions, how does the experience and outcomes of this program inform nursing’s future? To address both questions, the authors first provide an overview of geriatric nursing prior to and up to the time the BAGNC program began, then review results of an external evaluation of the BAGNC program, and finally propose goals and strategies for the next 20 years of academic geriatric nursing.</ab>

        <ab>Due to the gradual increase in elderly population and the complexity of the process of taking care of long-stay nursing home residents, the formal caregiver is expected to be prepared and to have specific knowledge in the area. This study intended to identify the concepts in elderly care conveyed by formal caregivers in a nursing home located in the municipality of Fortaleza-CE, Brazil. This is a descriptive and exploratory study with a qualitative approach that was carried out in July 2009 with seven formal caregivers in a long-term nursing home. The data were collected via semi-structured interviews and analysed by thematic content analysis. The nurses participating in the study were aged between 20 and 40 years old, mostly female, living in Fortaleza, married, with up to 10 years of formal education, and 1 to 2 years working experience in the area. Five thematic categories configuring these nurses' views on elderly care emerged from the interviews. Elderly care is perceived as: technique/assistance; interaction; subjectivity; attitude; and subject de-characterization. The nurses' tendency to confine the care practice to the mere execution of technical procedures highlighted their difficulty to understand the concept of care in a broader sense. This aspect along with the fragmentation of patient care can contribute to the devaluation of the professionals involved in the process.</ab>

        <ab>Older people, particularly those who are frail, are vulnerable to dehydration. Management of dehydration in older people can be more complex than in younger adults because of the physical effects of ageing. As the population ages, nurses will increasingly care for older patients in every setting. This article provides an overview of the physiological changes that affect the ability of older people to maintain a normal fluid balance. Risk factors for dehydration are reviewed and strategies for the prevention, detection and management of dehydration are discussed. The article focuses on subcutaneous fluid replacement for the management of dehydration in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Pain is a subjective feeling, with no known biologic markers. Proof of its presence and measurement of intensity rely entirely on self-reporting by the patient. The hampered or abrogated ability of demented patients to report their pain is a major difficulty in pain assessment and management. The purpose of this study was to clarify and conceptualize pain identification in demented patients by nurses. The hybrid model of concept development was used in the development of a conceptual structure of pain in demented patients. Data were collected by literature review (theoretical phase) and among nurses caring for demented patients in three nursing homes in South Korea (fieldwork phase). The 13 nurses involved each reported &gt;3 years'' nursing home experience. In a hybrid model, pain identification in demented patients by nurses constituted an active daily process of integrating patient expressional cues during periods of pain and pain relief and involving three dimensions: identification schemes based on the stage and type of dementia, connecting assessments after each intervention, and cognitive efforts to establish the origin of pain. Identification of pain in demented patients by nurses is a complex process. More research is needed to formulate an assessment tool and pain management strategies for patients with dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Pain is a subjective feeling, with no known biologic markers. Proof of its presence and measurement of intensity rely entirely on self-reporting by the patient. The hampered or abrogated ability of demented patients to report their pain is a major difficulty in pain assessment and management. The purpose of this study was to clarify and conceptualize pain identification in demented patients by nurses. The hybrid model of concept development was used in the development of a conceptual structure of pain in demented patients. Data were collected by literature review (theoretical phase) and among nurses caring for demented patients in three nursing homes in South Korea (fieldwork phase). The 13 nurses involved each reported &gt;3 years'' nursing home experience. In a hybrid model, pain identification in demented patients by nurses constituted an active daily process of integrating patient expressional cues during periods of pain and pain relief and involving three dimensions: identification schemes based on the stage and type of dementia, connecting assessments after each intervention, and cognitive efforts to establish the origin of pain. Identification of pain in demented patients by nurses is a complex process. More research is needed to formulate an assessment tool and pain management strategies for patients with dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose This paper seeks to demonstrate the role of person-centred assessment in improving the standard of care for people with dementia in acute hospitals, Design/methodology/approach The paper offers a review of recent research and literature on person centred care highlighting its role in acute hospital settings. Case studies are also used by way of illustration. Findings Acute hospitals are inherently complex environments which pose particular challenges for the care and management of people with dementia. Evidence drawn from the literature and recent research suggests that person-centred assessment has the capacity to enhance the quality of care for people with dementia and improve outcomes. Patients who are understood, listened to, and responded to tend to display lower levels of challenging behaviour, are calmer, more receptive to accepting treatment and have higher levels of well being, Although experienced nurses working in acute wards often have in-depth knowledge of older peoples' health-related needs, a reliance on inflexible 'assessment frameworks' can distract them from focusing on the individual. The routinised nature of many ward environments, shift patterns, high staff turnover and weak clinical leadership also act as barriers. Person-centred assessment can be employed to identify the needs of people with dementia based upon their life history and patterns of daily living; it can also underpin the design and delivery of person-centred care and treatment throughout their hospital stay. Originalitylvalue The capacity of person-centred care to improve care suggests that it needs to be embedded in gerontological nursing practice in acute hospital settings as a clinical and managerial priority.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents the results ofa study of teaching processes involving a group of nurses in eldercare. The nurses went through the teaching processes in connection with the implementation ofprofessional coaching techniques involving handling ofconcrete, multi-complex tasks. The study used open interviews of the participants and their leaders approximately 2 months after completing their coaching training. The study resulted in a model intended to support the teaching processes involved in professional coaching. Professional coaching regarding the handling of multi-complex tasks in eldercare is an easily accessible method for skills development for nursing staffat all levels.</ab>

        <ab>The aim was to review available literature on research and service evaluation evidence of nurse-led case management services targeting older people with multiple chronic conditions in their own homes. This was anticipated to highlight important issues for nursing practice, healthcare policy, service provision and health service research. Enhanced roles for nurses have developed in response to demands for increased efficiency in the provision of healthcare especially in the area of chronic disease management. It is apparent that the evidence to support nurses providing a case management approach for patients with multimorbid chronic conditions in their home environment is ambiguous. A systematic review of the literature. The review was carried out across multiple sources including search and alert engines, electronic databases, relevant journal websites and grey literature. The inclusion criteria applied concentrated on articles in the English language, case management intervention involving nurses providing care in the patients' own home and older people (aged over 65 years) with multiple chronic illnesses. Of a total of 568 papers identified, eight were of relevance and included in the review. The qualitative data derived from this systematic review suggests that access to case management services had a positive impact on the patient, the carer and the healthcare staff particularly the General Practitioner. In contrast the more robust quantitative data does not demonstrate a significant impact on emergency admissions, bed days, nor costs. Further research is needed to understand how case management can most effectively improve service effectiveness for patients and their carers and reduce cost of care. A new emphasis on comparative effectiveness research is required which has the potential to reshape the whole system of healthcare provision for patients with complex needs.</ab>

        <ab>To improve nutritional care and the mealtime experience of older people in a residential aged care setting by assisting nurses to create change to their practice and to the mealtime environment. Despite being preventable and treatable, inadequate nutrition remains a problem for many older people in residential aged care and tertiary health care settings. Nevertheless, many organisations are uniquely positioned to implement solutions that will lead to better care. The study used a qualitative, action research approach, grounded in the participatory worldview. The multimethod approach of data and between-method triangulation were chosen to assist in understanding the multidimensional issues associated with resident mealtimes and the provision of nutritional care. The collection of non-participant observations was informed by aspects of the Developmental Research Sequence. Action group meetings and non-participant observations were qualitatively analysed using the Analytic Hierarchy. Protected Mealtimes was tailored for the residential aged care unit. The most significant change involved the transformation of system processes by creating the space in nurses' busy schedules and thus reclaiming time for nurses to reconnect with nutritional care. Fixed role boundaries were made flexible by assisting individuals to understand and extend their roles in nutritional care. Most importantly, sustainability of Protected Mealtimes was achieved and long-term changes around nutritional care continued to be resident focused. This study demonstrates that lasting changes to nursing practice in nutritional care can be achieved by applying the principles of a participatory worldview and action research. Change is challenging to achieve in complex health care organisations. This study bridges the gap between theory and practice and has shown that nurses can create change by employing a participatory worldview and action research as part of their toolkit for problem solving.</ab>

        <ab>Owing to an aging UK population and an increasingly prevalence of diabetes, many older people's wards, where the admission age is &gt;/=75 years, are now caring for more individuals with diabetes who are much older and who often have complex underlying comorbidities. It is therefor integral that nursing staff and mutlidiscplinary team members have up-to-date knowledge and skills to provide the best inpatient care for this vulnerable group. A pilot audit investigating nursing staff's (n=12) knowledge of diabetes was undertaken and the results and implications for practice are presented.</ab>

        <ab>This article describes an innovative approach to educating gerontological nurse practitioner students about the needs of patients and their families related to palliative and end-of-life care. By using a standardized patient family and creatively using resources from the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC), this author maximized learning experiences for advanced practice students who will care for elderly individuals and their families. The goal of ELNEC is to strengthen nursing education to improve end-of-life care. Principles for developing and implementing a complex standardized patient scenario for graduate nursing students are offered.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. In this discussion paper, the construct of ageing is examined, not only as a process in human life, but also as a defined, taken for granted phenomenon in which particular assumptions can implicitly insinuate themselves into nursing practice. Background. Older people are a growing sub-group in global populations who regularly interface with nurses. However, older people can be devalued in society through attitudes, practices and beliefs engendered in discourse. As an institution in society, nursing can be influenced by such negative discourses. Data sources. A literature search was undertaken using the CINAHL and PUBMED databases using the terms 'older people and theories of ageing', 'ageism and health care professionals', and 'social policy and older people' for the years 2002-2009. Seminal works, which were frequently cited in journal articles, were also reviewed. In addition, the scholarly works of Michel Foucault were examined. Discussion. Using a Foucauldian approach, this paper argues that perspectives on older people can be constituted through multiple, complex social discourses, which have tangible consequences in nursing practice. Power operates in discursively producing subject positions of older people and associated subjectivities which can shape nursing practice. Implications for nursing. Discourses of ageing can locate older people as disempowered, vulnerable and dependent and may deny nurses' ability to constitute older people in alternative subject positions. Conclusion. The taken for granted discourses of ageing can implicitly affect how nurses interact with older people. It is important that all nurses are cognizant of the consequences of such discourses in practice.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this article is to report a study exploring experiences of relatives who have been present immediately prior to and after the death (in the last 72 hours) of a next-of-kin in a nursing home. The purpose of the study was to acquire research-based knowledge to improve practice. Globally, a growing number of older people, often with increased morbidity and complexity of conditions, require specialised nursing care, particularly at the end of life. Several international studies describe end-of-life care in nursing homes as insufficient, mainly owing to shortage of qualified staff and other essential resources. There are few studies in this field in Norway; none of them focus on the final days and hours of a patient's life from the perspective of their relatives. A mixed methods design was used. Data were collected through structured interviews with 50 relatives during Spring 2006 and analysed by version 14 and theme-based analysis. With a few exceptions, the quality of nursing care was considered professional and good. Care was described as supportive, individualised and based on patients' needs - in a safe atmosphere and supported by good relations between patients and nursing staff. Information and communication between staff and relatives, however, were described as unsystematic and casual. That some patients died alone became a source of distress for their relatives. Information and communication between staff and relatives need to be improved. There is need for change to avoid the situation where patients die in solitude. End-of-life care is performed at a time when patients and their relatives are at their most vulnerable. Nurses and other health workers need information, as this study suggests, to provide high-quality care to ease this situation.</ab>

        <ab>For the most part, nurses and care workers in a long-term care homes are respected by residents and family members. However, a small minority of residents, because of varied and complex reasons, may take their fears, frustrations, anxieties and catastrophic stress levels out on the those who care for them. This kind of aggressive behaviour, unfortunately, is increasing in the LTC setting.</ab>

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>

        <ab>In the UK there is an increasing ageing population, bringing with it a host of degenerative conditions such as dementia. Dementia is a common condition among older people. In the UK there are estimated to be over 750 000 people with dementia and numbers are expected to double in the next 30 years (Comas-Herrera et al, 2007). The term 'dementia' is used to describe a syndrome which may be caused by a number of illnesses and is associated with ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. There are many types of dementia, the most common are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's which accounts for 62% of all cases. Vascular dementia either alone or co-existent with Alzheimer's, is the second most common subtype of dementia (Knapp et al, 2007). Dementia is associated with complex needs especially in the later stages, and can have a devastating effect on the individual, their family and friends. The care needs often challenge the skills and capacity of carers especially when normal every-day activities decline. Food and drink are fundamental to living. Consequently observing individuals struggling with eating and drinking not only poses difficulties for professionals but also raises emotional issues for the individual and their family.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to describe the care preferences of individuals living with advanced cardiac and respiratory illnesses about their current and future health, understanding about options for care at the end of life, and expectations from health care providers. Much of what is known about patients' care preferences at the end of life is based on studies of patients with cancer, often in hospice settings. Less is known about the care preferences of patients with end-stage cardiac and respiratory illnesses as they near end of life. Using a qualitative descriptive design, two in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 participants enrolled in a community home care agency. Criterion-based sampling was used to recruit patients with NYS class III and IV heart failure and oxygen dependant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and entered into Atlas Ti 6.0 for data management. Participants described living with their advanced illness as being a trade-off. In order to function and live with their disabling shortness of breath, they had to adopt a complex care regimen and accept the use of adaptive equipment. Their understanding of illness, or lack thereof, impacted how participants managed their health, including reporting symptoms and seeking treatment. All participants expected their doctor would tell them if their illness became life-threatening, which all thought was in the future. Earlier incorporation of palliative care may improve symptom management and future care planning among this population. Research identifying patient preferences and expectations for care holds promise in facilitating better care for persons with advanced illnesses as they near the end of life.</ab>

        <ab>The number of Americans age 65 years and older is increasing. Each day, 10,000 individuals celebrate a 65th birthday. This growth rate is projected to continue for the next 19 years (Alliance for Aging Research, 2006). As individuals age, they are more likely to develop chronic illnesses and use healthcare services more frequently. This high demand will ultimately result in an increase encounter with healthcare workers. The attitude of nurses toward older adults is of interest since their perception toward this group can impact the quality of care they provide, as well as their interest in a career in geriatric nursing. This study examined the impact of a four week educational intervention (four weeks of gerontological content and clinical practicum in a nursing home) on nursing students' perceptions toward older adults. The study further examined their perceived interest in working with this group. A qualitative research design was used for data gathering. Data were obtained from researcher interviews and students' journal entries. Findings were complemented by quantitative data from Kogan's Attitude Toward Old People (KAOP) Scale. Eight (N=8) second level practical nursing students participated in the study. The results identified student nurses as having more positive attitudes toward older adults after the intervention. Emerging themes were, (1) valuing and admiration for older adults, (2) awareness of the complexities of aging, (3) increased competency in caring for older adults, and (4) formation of perceptions. At the end of the study, they expressed more positive perceptions towards older adults, but no significant change in their interest in their desire to seek a career in gerontological nursing. Implicit in these findings is a need to review nursing curricula to ensure a substantial inclusion of gerontological content, as well as adopting an intentional approach to ensure practicum assignments in settings with older adult.</ab>

        <ab>Relationships between nurses and older people within the home: exploring the boundaries of care. International Journal of Older People Nursing , 265-273 doi: 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2009.00192.x To explore the nature of relationships between nurses and older people within the home and to illuminate the nature and quality of caring boundaries within this setting. Older people are increasingly receiving nursing care in the home. There has been little exploration of the nature of the nurse-older patient relationship within this setting. An ethnographic approach using semi-structured interviews with 16 community nurses and 13 older patients (aged 65 years and over), were undertaken to explore the nature of care relationships within the home setting. The study has highlighted the centrality of the location of care and the concept of 'the home' in terms of geographical and metaphorical meanings. Moreover, the study has clearly illuminated the complex nature of relationships and boundary construction from a number of perspectives. As the location of care for older people continues to move closer to home it is crucial that the implicit qualities that are valued within nurse-patient relationships within this context of care, and which contribute to the quality of care, are recognized and made more explicit at the organizational and policy level. For nurses working within the home there is a clear impetus to clearly define and articulate the full breadth of their role, the nature of relationships and issues surrounding professional boundary construction within this environment. There is also a need for the core qualities that underpin the receipt of care within the home and the facets of the nurse-patient relationship valued by older people to be fully recognized and accounted for.</ab>

        <ab>Complex simulations can facilitate students' synthesis of knowledge. Simulations of cognitively impaired elders provide nursing students the opportunity to use critical thinking and clinical decision-making skills in complex patient care situations. The authors report their experiences in designing, implementing, and evaluating a simulation on cognitive problems in elders using actors. This simulation required third-year baccalaureate nursing students to differentiate delirium from dementia, identify symptoms of heart failure, and address a family member's concerns.</ab>

        <ab>Objective of this essay was to lead a reflection/critics about the theoretical and philosophical ideas on the concepts of aging/elderly/old age, and gerontogeriatric nursing. Benchmarks of nursing, gerontology and the complexity of Morin as theoretical were used. The gerontology is still a new science in Brazil, emerging, rising, and walking to the need to implement actions aimed at improving the quality of life of those who are older and a guarantee of autonomy and independence of that part of the old already. There is a need to establish terms that approximate to give a common language among health workers/nurses that act, to act in that area or those who are concerned to use appropriate terms in reference to gerontology.</ab>

        <ab>Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a rare dermatological disease with mucocutaneous and systemic involvement, with the mose severe forme of SJS, presenting as a variant of toxic epidermal necrolysis related to a multiple etiology. We report a case of geriatric patient 84 years of age present the syndrome associated with taking levofloxacin. The complexity of care require in an inpatient unit, and the paucity of references in our environment led us to develop this plan of nursing.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Nurses that care for patients with advanced dementia are increasingly faced with consequences of disease progression, often requiring them to decide whether to artificially feed these patients. Clarifying how nurses can be better supported in complex care processes involving ethically sensitive decision-making requires that their practice be mapped out. Objectives: The aims of this study were to explore and describe how nurses are involved in the care that surrounds decisions concerning artificial nutrition or hydration in hospitalized patients with dementia. Design: We used a qualitative interview design. Data collection and analysis were informed by the grounded theory approach. Setting: Nine hospitals geographically spread throughout the five provinces of Flanders, Belgium. Participants: Twenty-one nurses were purposively selected for interview, with the aim of including nurses that reflected diverse personal characteristics and experiences with the subject matter. Methods: Between April 2008 and June 2009, we conducted 21 interviews that were audiotaped and later transcribed. Data processing involved (1) simultaneous and systematic data collection and analysis, (2) constant forwards-backwards wave, (3) continuous dialogue with the data, and (4) interactive team processes. Results: Nurses’ involvement was characterized by a desire to provide ‘good care’, which was the basis for their motivation and aspiration during the care process. Early in the process, nurses developed a holistic picture of their patients, laying the foundation of their ‘good care’ view. During the actual decision-making, nurses fulfilled the roles of messengers and guiding communicators, as they attempted to realize their ‘good care’ view. Nurses judged the physicians’ decisions in light of their care view. If a decision matched their view, they supported the decision. If not, they resisted it openly or covertly. Some nurses remained passively in the background, while others took action to override the decision. Nurses’ involvement ended with the intensive aftercare of the patients and their family. Conclusions: Nurses are closely and continuously involved in the care that surrounds decisions concerning artificial nutrition or hydration in hospitalized patients with advanced dementia. During the care process, nurses play several and specific roles, giving their contribution a unique and variable character.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The culture change (CC) movement aims to transform the traditional nursing home (NH) that is institutional in design with hierarchical management structure into a homelike environment that empowers residents and frontline staff. This study examines differences in adoption of CC practices according to a NH''s self-reported extent of CC implementation and its duration of CC adoption. Furthermore, it examines differences in adoption by whether a CC practice is considered less versus more complex, using complexity theory as the theoretical framework for this classification. Design and Methods: Using data from a 2007 Commonwealth-funded study, we analyzed a national sample of 291 US nursing homes that identified as being “for the most part” or “completely” CC facilities for “1 to 3 years” or “3+ years.” Also, using a complexity theory framework, we ranked 16 practices commonly associated with CC as low, moderately, or highly complex based on level of agreement needed to actuate the process (number of parties involved) and the certainty of intended outcomes. We then examined the prevalence of CC-associated practices in relation to their complexity and the extent and duration of a NH''s CC adoption. Results: We found practices ranked as less complex were implemented more frequently in NHs with both shorter and longer durations of CC adoption. However, more complex CC practices were more prevalent among NHs reporting “complete” adoption for 3+ years versus 1 to 3 years. This was not observed in NHs reporting having CC “for the most part.” Conclusions/Implications: Less complex practices may be more economical and easier to implement. These early successes may result in sufficient momentum so that more complex change can follow. A nursing home that more completely embraces the culture change movement may be more likely to attempt these complex changes.</ab>

        <ab>Medication adherence is a complex phenomenon. As individuals assume greater responsibility for, and participation in, decisions about their health care, teaching and supporting adherence behaviors that reflect a person's unique lifestyle are the essence of a clinician-patient partnership--and it is a perfect fit with assisted living communities and nursing practice. The notion of compliance is an outdated concept and should be abandoned as a clinical practice/goal in the medical management of patient and illness. It connotes dependence and blame and does not move the patient forward on a pathway of better clinical outcomes. This article discusses the differences between compliance and adherence, identifies purposeful and unintentional reasons for nonadherence, and describes assessment tools for adherence, medication effect, and self-management capacity. Drawing on the scholarly work of others, we introduce a model for medication adherence, the ACE-ME Model: assessment, collaboration, education, monitoring, and evaluation. This model draws on the strengths and science of nursing and engages nursing participation in the continuing evolution of adherence strategies. For purposes of clarity in discussing these concepts, we use the word patient in this article rather than the word resident--that is, the older adult living in an assisted living community.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to explore the barriers that the uninsured elderly population encounter when accessing health care in the United States. These barriers include, but are not limited to lack of transportation, insurance, or family support; the daunting complexity of the health care system; poverty; culture; poor patient-health care provider communications; race/ethnicity; and lack of health care professionals such as nurses and doctors with adequate geriatric preparation, or generalists who are undereducated in geriatrics. The number of health care professionals currently available to treat elderly persons in the United States is inadequate. The Federal government should take steps to develop solutions to improve access to health care and decrease health disparities for older adults. As a nation, we should be proactive in addressing these concerns instead of waiting for new barriers to arise that further limit access to health care for elderly patients and their families. In this article, we provide an assessment of the barriers that limit access to health care in the uninsured elderly population and suggest recommendations and possible solutions to eliminate or reduce these barriers.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Contemporary health care environments are increasingly challenged by issues associated with the recruitment and retention of qualified nursing staff. This challenge is particularly felt by residential aged care providers, with registered nurse (RN) numbers already limited and resident acuity rapidly rising. As a result, aged care service providers are increasingly exploring creative and alternative models of care. This article details exploratory research into a pre-existing, alternative model of care in a medium sized, regional residential aged care facility. Research findings suggest that the model of care is complex and multi-faceted and is an example of an integrated model of care. As a result of the implementation of this model of care a number of shifts have occurred in the practice experiences and clinical culture within this facility. Results suggest that the main benefits of this model are: (1) increased opportunities for RNs to engage in clinical leadership and proactive care management; (2) improved management and communication in relation to work processes and practices; and (3) enhanced recruitment and retention of both RNs and care workers.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. The aim of this paper is to discuss the complexity of admission into a residential care facility from a psychological perspective for residents and their relatives and the resulting implications for nursing care. Background. Admission into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. Data sources. The background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into nursing homes and psychological transitions. Discussion. The concepts of transition from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. Implications for nursing. Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that occurs when an older person is admitted into care. Conclusion. Improving the psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a more positive experience.</ab>

        <ab>Determination of a patient's capacity for medical decision making can be simple or complex, depending on the issue being considered; likewise, the degree of capacity required to make decisions varies with the complexity of the situation. A capacity examination is a focused and impartial evaluation of mental status and medical, surgical, psychiatric, and psychosocial histories. The examination is composed of several basic steps, beginning with an assessment of the patient's ability to communicate, followed by determination of his or her understanding of the proposed care, followed by the patient's rationale for decisions about that care. When a patient is deemed to lack capacity, mechanisms should be in place to ensure the patient receives the care needed. This article provides an overview of the concept of capacity, how it is determined, and how to proceed when the patient is found to lack it. Copyright 2010, SLACK Incorporated.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: The aims of this study were to ascertain perceptions of elder abuse among nurses and care assistants who worked in long-term care settings and whether staff had been educated on elder abuse. Method: A quantitative descriptive co-relational design was used. Questionnaires were completed by 66 nurses and 48 care assistants in three long-term care settings in southern Ireland. Results: Thirty nine (59 per cent) nurses and 25 (52 per cent) care assistants were confident about recognising elder abuse. Nevertheless, there was a high level of uncertainty about what constituted elder abuse. Conclusion: Uncertainty about what constitutes elder abuse may be a barrier to its detection and management. Nurses and care staff working with older people must be able to identify abusive situations and be confident that managers will support them to address the uncertainty surrounding this complex phenomenon.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract The Australian government and aged care industry uphold the standard of care for persons who require high care and reside in residential aged care facilities. The residential aged care system is extremely complex and through research conducted at the micro level it is argued that the macro level of policy can be exposed for the effects on the ground. A case study methodology in the qualitative paradigm used a discourse analysis of the nursing care for three highly dependent residents in one accredited aged care facility. Detailed data were collected through interviews, non-participant observations and document analyses concerning the nursing care these residents received. A comparative analysis of the discourses revealed this facility to be functioning in an environment of neglect. Nursing care provision was rushed and untimely and the residents were at risk of unsafe practices and negligence. The documentation of nursing care was found to be fraudulent, demeaning and out of date. Environmental considerations, continence management and the social and activity needs of residents were contradictory to their quality of life. The autonomy of the residents and advocacy by relatives were misinterpreted and unethical discourses were apparent with relatives having to be constantly vigilant. The nursing care provided by nurses (and non-nurses) failed to meet professional nursing standards and competencies, which adversely affected the residents' health compromising their safety. This situation is attributed to residential aged care policies, whereby nurses and nursing practice have been silenced and made invisible resulting in a substandard level of nursing care provision in this accredited facility that may be transferable to other facilities.</ab>

        <ab>The people of the United States sent a clear message in November 2008 that they wanted a change in the nation's priorities, including healthcare. The question is whether healthcare reform will extend to the care of older adults, especially in the face of complex needs in the last years of their lives. This article addresses this question by examining the demographics of the older adult population, the eldercare workforce, and the current inadequate patchwork of financing. Some aging issues, such as chronic care, are being addressed in the broad context of healthcare reform, whereas health information technology and others remain marginal. The window of opportunity for a clear and coherent voice in a reformed/reshaped healthcare system is narrow. Now is the time for the 'trusted' profession to advocate for meaningful change that will meet the current and future needs of older adults. The article concludes with strategies and Web-based resources for nurses to bring aging issues to the healthcare reform debate at both the national and local levels.</ab>

        <ab>Contemporary health care practices are going through a historical crisis. In contrast to expressive scientific and technological development, these practices are encountering serious limitations to effectively respond to individuals' and populations' complex health needs. This experience report aims to reflect on the empowerment of innovative educational technology towards self-care together with elderly people with diabetes mellitus. The development of the analysis is oriented by experience reports in primary health care assistance, extracted from these authors' daily work. Reception, accessibility to information, knowledge, respect, linking, identity, and responsibility are singled out as key features in understanding the interactions between health professionals, patients, and family members. The construction of empowerment care in nursing provides the elderly to be protagonists of the process, encouraging self-care through the therapeutic alliance between the elderly, the health care professional, and family.</ab>

        <ab>New walking dependence has been found to occur in 16.8% to 59% of older adults in hospital settings. Walking dependence as been associated with limited mobility of older adults during their hospital stays. Nursing has been identified as a key health care provider that can impact mobility decline. However, studies have shown that nurses infrequently ambulate patients. Unfortunately, the research is lacking in knowledge of how nurses assess mobility in hospitalized older adults, when nurses consider mobilizing patients, and what barriers nurses face.The purpose of this study was to explore how nurses think about mobilization of hospitalized older adults and what affect this has on the care they provide.Grounded theory methodology was used. In-depth interviews were conducted. Initial questions were open, becoming more focused as analysis proceeded. Constant comparative analysis was used to identify core categories, dimensions and influencing conditions. Twenty-five registered nurses were interviewed.A conceptual model has been constructed which identifies categories, the interaction among categories, and the impact on the nurses decision as to whether or not, how, and when to mobilize patients. How nurses define mobilization has also been identified. Key categories in the model which affect the Level of Mobilization nurses pursue include the Risk/Opportunity Assessment made by nurses, Unit Expectation, and Purpose for Mobilizing patients.Deciding to mobilize patients is a complex process. The results of this study are the first to identify how nurses conceptualize mobility and what impacts this on whether or not nurses get patients moving.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the work of an acute assessment and liaison service for older people, including the role of the older people's apecialist nurse in the service. The service screens all patients admitted who are over the age of 75 for problems specific to a frail population and to identify where ongoing specialist support referral or advice is indicated. Patients with complex problems undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The service has reduced length of stay and resulted in better care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Nurses in nursing homes care for patients with complex health problems that need to be followed up by medical treatment. Most patients benefit from the treatment, but for some the treatment seems only to lengthen their death process. Sometimes questions are raised as to whether life-sustaining treatment should be withheld/ withdrawn. Decisions related to such questions are difficult to make as some patients are 'on the edge of life', which is understood as a transition between living and dying with an unpredictable outcome, whether the illness will lead to recovery or dying. The aim of this study was to acquire a deeper understanding of what it is to be a nurse in a nursing home for patients on the edge of life. The research design was qualitative, based on hermeneutic phenomenology. Fourteen nurses at two nursing homes were interviewed twice. The result shows that when facing a patient on the edge of life, the nurses were challenged as professionals and as human beings. Two main themes were identified, which included two sub-themes each. The first main theme: 'striving to do right and good for everyone' included the sub-themes 'feeling certain, but accompanied by uncertainty' and 'being caught between too much responsibility and too little formal power'. The second main theme: 'being a vulnerable helper -- the prize and the price', contained the sub-themes 'needing emotional protection in professional commitment' and 'feeling undervalued in spite of professional pride'. The essence was: 'being a lonely and enduring struggler between opposite poles'. The findings revealed paradoxes in nurses' work which might threaten nurses' professional identity and put heavy demands on their professional performance. There is a need for formal involvement in end-of-life decisions from nurses, further education and support to nurses related to patients on the edge of life.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the fact that the amendment of the German Geriatric Nursing Act in 2003 created a training basis with extensive reforms which has validity in all of the federal states for the first time, nursing education is still taking place outside the state education system in most of the federal states. In view of the almost unchanged prevailing financial, staffing and structural conditions which are to be found in schools of geriatric nursing, the question remains as to the extent to which the full-time tutors at these schools are able to cope with the increasingly complex demands placed on nursing education. In the study, nursing tutors from state recognised schools of geriatric nursing in North Hessen were asked about their workloads. It was proven that the training reforms which resulted from the amendment of the Geriatric Nursing Act especially resulted in the salaried tutors at these schools being subjected to additional workloads when taking the prevailing conditions which specifically exist at state recognised schools of geriatric nursing into account. These especially concern the large number of external lecturers, the extremely heterogeneous learning requirements of the students, the lack of training interest which often exists in numerous practise facilities and the time which is made available to these tutors which mainly only work part-time.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a study to identify the patterns of prescribing by primary health care nurse practitioners for a cohort of older adults. Background. The older adult population is known to receive complex pharmacotherapy. Monitoring prescribing to older adults can inform quality improvement initiatives. In comparison to other countries, research examining nurse practitioner prescribing in Canada is limited. Nurse practitioner prescribing for older adults is relatively unexplored in the international literature. Although commonly used to study physician prescribing, few studies have used claims data from drug insurance programmes to investigate nurse practitioner prescribing. Method. Drug claims for prescriptions written by nurse practitioners from fiscal years 2004/05 to 2006/07 for beneficiaries of the Nova Scotia Seniors' Pharmacare programme were analysed. Data were retrieved and analysed in May 2008. Prescribing was described for each drug using the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code classification system by usage and costs for each fiscal year. Results. Antimicrobials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs consistently represented the top ranked groups for prescription volume and cost. Over the three fiscal years, antimicrobial prescription rates declined relative to rates of other groups of medications. Prescription volume per nurse doubled and cost per prescription increased by approximately 20%. Conclusion. Prescription claims data can be used to characterize the prescribing trends of nurse practitioners. Research linking patient characteristics, including diagnoses, to prescriptions is needed to assess prescribing quality. Some potential areas of improvement were identified with antimicrobial and non-steroidal antiinflammatory selection.</ab>

        <ab>Greater standardisation of assessments of older people with complex care needs is a requirement of UK policy. This study explores the practicability and validity of two assessment tools, Minimum Data Set Resident Assessment Instrument (MDS-RAI) and EASY-Care. Participants, aged 65 years or over, living in care homes or awaiting hospital discharge, were assessed using randomly allocated paired instruments. Client evaluation questionnaires on the practicability of the tools were completed. Short Form 12 (SF12) questionnaires were administered to assess participants' health status. Registered nurses undertook data collection and participated in two focus groups designed to explore the practicability of the tools. Statistical tests were applied to quantitative data to assess practicability and validity. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse focus group transcripts. In all, 238 assessments were completed. Older people and assessors generally reported that both tools were practicable, with EASY-Care preferred to MDS-RAI for practicability measures including ease of use, usefulness and acceptability. Focus groups illustrated the significance of professional judgement when using structured tools. Both tools were reasonable indicators of activities of daily living, but there were shortcomings in measurements of cognitive performance and depression. Both instruments require development to fully capture the older person's perspectives of needs and to test the validity of key measures.</ab>

        <ab>Across practice settings, most nursing care is provided to older adults. Yet most nurses receive limited education to care for older adults, especially those with complex needs. A Knowledge Exchange Institute for Geriatric Nursing Education brought together 31 Canadian nursing faculty members and nursing doctoral students and provided them with tools and resources to enhance teaching and curriculum in baccalaureate nursing programs. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action Process model, participants received usable summaries of the best research evidence about care for older adults and tools to increase the likelihood of successful integration of these resources in their teaching and curriculum. Feedback from participants indicates that their personal goals and the goals of the Knowledge Exchange were met. Through a public interactive wiki, participants and others will continue the process of knowledge exchange to improve nursing education and nursing care for older persons.</ab>

        <ab>Given the rapidly escalating older adult population and the need to strengthen content on end-of-life care in nursing curricula, finding creative strategies to encourage student thinking about the dying process and personal choice in end-of-life care is a timely challenge for nurse educators. There is an evolving body of literature in a variety of disciplines on cinemeducation, or the use of films to promote learning and personal awareness. This article describes an innovative assignment incorporating feature films designed not only to enhance student knowledge of the stages and process of grief and the complexity of human reactions when facing end-of-life situations, but also to engage students in thinking about the importance of quality of life in palliative care. The assignment was given to students enrolled in a second-semester, junior-level advanced adult health nursing course. Faculty and student evaluations of the assignment are discussed, and suggestions for selecting films and structuring such an assignment are proposed.</ab>

        <ab>Hypersexuality, also referred to in the literature as sexually inappropriate behavior and sexual disinhibition, involves persistent, uninhibited sexual behaviors directed at oneself or at others. For older adults, the literature generally attributes the behavior to biochemical or physiological changes that accompany cognitive impairment-specifically, dementia. Although less common than other behavioral issues, such as aggression and agitation, hypersexuality presents complex logistical and ethical problems for caregivers. This article reviews the current literature on hypersexual behavior. Assessment essentials as well as nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment approaches are discussed, identifying the need for standardization as well as caregiver education and training.</ab>

        <ab>As the United States population ages, it is important that nursing faculty adequately prepare undergraduate students to provide optimal nursing care for older adults. By 2030, estimates are that one in five Americans will be over the age of 65. Older adults often have complex health issues and use more health care resources than other age groups. Over the last 10 years, schools of nursing have been increasingly enhancing the gerontological content in their curricula. However, to ensure that nurses will have the specialized geriatric knowledge and skills to improve health outcomes, expansion and enhancement of geriatric curricula must be an ongoing process. This article presents information regarding the process that one university used to evaluate and revise its curriculum using geriatric competences and recommendations set forth by the Hartford Foundation and AACN.</ab>

        <ab>More than 1 million older adults, many with significant cognitive impairment, receive care in assisted living residences (ALRs), and their numbers are increasing. Despite this, ALR staff are often inadequately trained to manage the complex emotional, behavioral, and functional impairments characteristic of these residents. Nurses are in a unique position to improve this situation by training and supervising ALR staff. To facilitate such training, an understanding of staff reactions to receiving training as well as a systematic yet flexible method for training is needed. This article provides information on one such program (STAR-Staff Training in Assisted-living Residences), discusses challenges that arose when offering this program across 3 states in 6 diverse ALRs (rural, urban, for-profit, and not-for-profit sites), and describes how these challenges were addressed. We illustrate how nurses can successfully train ALR staff to improve resident and staff outcomes and offer guidance for those interested in providing such training.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a literature review conducted to analyse data from published studies reporting nursing interventions targeted at older attendees of emergency departments (EDs), and to provide a critical appraisal of the evidence concerning their effectiveness. Background. Attendance at hospital EDs by older persons presents opportunities for targeted interventions to address actual and potential problems associated with or in addition to the presenting problem. The evidence concerning the effectiveness of such interventions is mixed. Data sources. Studies were retrieved from a systematic search of published works indexed in CINAHL, MEDLINE (PubMed), Science Direct and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Methods. A systematic review of effectiveness was conducted using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care guidelines and a narrative synthesis approach for data handling and presentation. The review period was 1992 to 31 August 2008. Results. Nursing assessment and referral interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing service use and improving physical function, but have failed to demonstrate statistically significant effects on predicted patient and/or health systems outcomes. Conclusion. The evidence of the effectiveness of gerontologically informed nursing assessment and referral interventions in EDs must be accepted with caution, as not all studies demonstrated effectiveness in predicted patient and/or health systems outcomes, and the testing of complex social interventions in randomized clinical trials is inherently problematic. Further evidence of the effectiveness of nursing interventions is required, and such evidence might be usefully demonstrated using pragmatic, as opposed to explanatory, trials.</ab>

        <ab>The aging population and the associated rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions suggest that the home health population is increasingly complex and challenging to manage. The purpose of this study was to use national administrative data (Outcome and Assessment Information Set assessments of persons discharged in 2004 and 2005) to examine the clinical complexity of older adults admitted to home healthcare. Our descriptive analyses confirm that multiple chronic conditions and cognitive impairment are common and result in longer lengths of stay. The findings support the need for geriatric home healthcare practices that effectively address multiple morbidities and cognitive function.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric failure to thrive (GFTT) poses a complex clinical issue in gerontological nursing practice. GFTT is not a normal part of aging, nor is it an outcome of chronic illness. Rather, GFTT describes a lack of vitality and diminished capacity for life and outlines a process of functional decline that is often difficult to explain. The purpose of this article is to review GFTT, examine the literature on GFTT, and suggest strategies for the identification, assessment, and creative management of this complex condition that affects millions of older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this 2-year study was to evaluate a new educational partnership for a nurse-managed community center in Taiwan. This project provided care to senior residents in an apartment complex and was integrated into a nursing educational program in Taiwan. In collaboration with these organizations, an educational partnership model was developed and evaluated. Three goals were accomplished: to provide health care to elderly residents, practical learning experience for nursing students, and practical experience for nursing faculty. The findings indicated that teachers, students, and residents in the apartment complex presented a high level of satisfaction with this model. The model created a vivid, practical, community-based resource and applied the principles of service-learning into practical nursing education in Taiwan. The model not only facilitated the empowerment of involved organizations, but also served as a reference for developing other community center-based nursing educational partnerships.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Pain constitutes a constant challenge facing staff and residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNF) and nursing homes (NH). Many SNF and NH have not adopted a uniform plan to assess and treat pain for their residents despite published literature that demonstrates that the implementation of scales improves detection and treatment of pain. The objective of this study was to analyze the baseline pain level in the institutionalized elderly, and then implement a standard pain scale for its assessment and evaluation, while simultaneously identifying challenges in adopting this standardized method. METHODS: As part of a Quality Improvement Project (QI), a total of 40 patients were chosen at random in 2 of the major skilled care and dementia units at a Columbia area nursing home, 20 patients from each. A chart review was conducted to document the presence or absence of pain syndromes, pain medications used, and use of standardized tools for the evaluation of pain. Documentation regarding diagnosis of depression and behavioral problems were also noted as potential markers for the manifestation of pain. Verbal and nonverbal pain scales were introduced and approved by the medical and nursing staff. Training sessions for the administration of such tools were implemented. A baseline evaluation of pain level was obtained applying these newly adopted tools. One cycle using the PDSA (Plan-Do-Study and Act) model for QI was followed. RESULTS: Our evaluation showed that 84.2% (32/38) of our study population were females, and the mean age was 91.4 years. Fifty percent (19/38) of patients had mild to moderate pain. Because of nonstandardized approaches to analgesia, some regimens rendered clear potential for toxicity: ie, receiving more than 3 grams per day of acetaminophen. Most patients with cognitive deficits had lower levels of moderate pain (9.5% [2/21]) but higher levels of mild pain (33.3% [7/21]) when compared with patients with normal cognition or mild cognitive deficits (35.3% [6/17] and 17.6% [3/17], respectively). Nursing staff adopted successfully the chosen pain tools and gave positive feedback after the trial period, indicating that they were helpful tools to identify pain and treat it promptly. Active participation of nursing staff through the process of decision making, tailoring of the pain assessment scales, and feedback during the period of implementation of pain assessment tools was perceived to facilitate better results. New cycles of pain evaluation and improvement were scheduled. CONCLUSIONS: Pain evaluation and management is of paramount importance because of its high prevalence and demonstrated deleterious effects on both quality of life and long-term survival. Tools for verbal and nonverbal evaluation of pain are necessary in both NH and SCF. Also, regular cognitive and behavioral assessment may help evaluate pain by providing additional information to physicians, nurses, and other caregivers when treatment becomes more challenging and complex. The use of standard standing orders can easily help decrease the potential of toxicity related to the use of analgesics.</ab>

        <ab>Providing residential aged care is challenging because of the complexity of residents' health status, difficulties recruiting and retaining skilled staff, and financial and regulatory constraints. This paper discusses some of these challenges and describes an innovative model of care, termed 'T he Tri-focal model of care'. This model was developed based on the concepts of 'partnership-centred care', 'positive work environment' and the need for evidence-based practice to underpin all aspects of care. It is envisaged that the implementation of this model will provide a rich learning environment that advances the teaching-nursing home concept and the quality of residential aged care.</ab>

        <ab>We aimed to investigate the factors related to the ineffective control of the individual therapeutic regime in seniors presenting hypertension, relating them to some of their social-demographic characteristics. The descriptive research was developed with 30 elderly people from elderly nursing homes, with the application of a form check-list. It was verified that most was single, had no children, advanced age, catholic, low education degree and had no profession. The most present factors were the knowledge deficit (63,3%), complexity of the system health's attendance (43, 3%), distrust in relationship to the regime and/or health team (23, 3%) and noticed barriers (23,3%). We hope to motivate larger reflection on that problem, making possible the development of plans of more appropriate cares to the elderly reality, contributing to the effective control of their therapeutic regime.</ab>

        <ab>This research describes the development and evaluation of a 2-hour program that taught geriatric nursing assistant students person-centered caregiving skills. The person centeredness of caregiving skills among students who completed the training, as well as those who did not, was evaluated by coding their videotaped interactions with a standardized long-term care resident. Residents reported more satisfaction with students who had completed the special training, although there was little difference between the actual behavior of students in the intervention and control conditions. Students' interpersonal cognitive complexity was associated with their ability to provide care in person-centered ways.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article was to elaborate on the development of policies related to long-term care services in Taiwan and the current status of such. Using the framework of the Department of Health's long-term care projects, issues regarding how to assist nursing professionals cope with the demands of Taiwan's aging society and participate in the planning and implementation of long-term care services were raised and discussed. The demands of long-term care services are complex and multifaceted. An ideal long-term care services system should deliver care that is continuous and comprehensive. Recent developments and demands on long-term care services in Taiwan and supply issues related to nursing services have spurred significant discussion regarding the innovative potential and possibilities for the nursing profession. It is our belief that the commitment of Taiwan's nursing professionals will help se-cure the critical role of nursing in the national long-term care services system and quality healthcare.</ab>

        <ab>This article draws on two studies that have used an ethic of care analysis to explore lay, nursing and social work care for people with dementia. It discusses the political as well as the practice application of ethic of care principles and highlights the necessity to understand both what people do and the meanings with which such practices are imbued in order to identify ;good care' and the relationship between this and social justice. Examples of care for people with dementia are discussed by reference to core principles of an ethic of care: attentiveness, responsibility, competence, responsiveness and trust. These illustrate the potential for the development of a shared language within which different disciplines, lay carers and people with dementia can communicate about how needs could best be met in complex and difficult circumstances.</ab>

        <ab>Institutions of Long Stay for the Elderly (ILPI)are establishments for integral service,institutionalizing 60 year-old people and plus,dependents/or no, that don't have conditions tostay with the family or in their home. Theinstitucionalization can unchain diseases, amongthem the depression. The objective of thisupdating article was to do a reflection about therelationship of the care to the depressed seniorand resident in ILPI with three beginnings of theComplexity according to Edgar Morin. First, wemake reflections about the complexity; then, welink the care to the depressed senior andresident in ILPI, with the beginnings: dialogical,recursive and hologrammar. We realised thatthe Complexity can sustain theoretically, notonly the understanding of the phenomenondepression in the resident senior in an ILPI, aswell as to inspire the way of taking care that itaddresses the workers of the health, that actthe senior person close to, they approach thesenior in a more global way. For so much theMultidimensional Senior's Evaluation should beused, it evaluates the senior person's severaldimensions, contributing in the development ofa care/treatment plan and multiact attendanceand interdisciplinary appropriate. TheComplexity has been used, for nurses, tounderstand the nursing better and to rendermore appropriate care to the human being.</ab>

        <ab>AIMS: To investigate the association between resources of the workplace and the quality of care in municipal long-term care. At the municipal level, the resources comprised the proportion of care workers with a long period of professional training and the relative availability of care-giving manpower. At the level of the organizational unit, the resources comprised aspects of the psychosocial working environment. METHODS: A survey of 7,500 care workers in 36 municipalities in Denmark was performed. Quality of care was measured by seven standardized questions in a questionnaire. Data on the psychosocial resources of the workplace were aggregated responses from the care workers to questions from the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire. Data on the training and relative availability of care workers were derived by combining information from payroll lists and data available from government databases. RESULTS: There was a positive association between psychosocial resources at the level of the organizational unit and the quality of care provided by the individual care worker. There was no association between the level of professional training of the municipal workforce of care-givers and the quality of care provided by the individual care worker. There was a complex relationship between the relative availability of care-giving manpower at the municipal level and the quality of care provided by the individual care worker. CONCLUSIONS: Improving the psychosocial working environment of care workers is one key to securing sufficient caring staff for the long-term care sector; increasing manpower or increasing the proportion of highly trained staff are not in themselves such keys.</ab>

        <ab>Aims This paper discusses how health and social care can work together collaboratively to improve the quality of care for older people resident in care homes, using Essence of Care benchmarking as an example. Background There is an increasing interest in how care is provided in care homes, including its impact on quality-of-life and end-of-life care. Care standards and government policy have emphasized the need for primary care to work more closely with care home staff. Evaluation The available evidence on older people's health care needs, and how primary health care and nursing work in care homes was evaluated. Case studies and descriptive reports on Essence of Care benchmarking were also used to identify the facilitators and barriers to using it as a means to improve the quality of care for older people in care homes. Key issues The key issues relate to the differences in the working cultures of health and social care, and the complex health care needs of older people living in care homes that do not have onsite nursing support. Conclusions Structured tools such as benchmarking can potentially be used to improve the quality of care for older people in care homes, but care home staff need adequate support to adapt this approach to their working environment. Implications for nursing management Primary care nurses need to be more proactive in the way that they work with older people in care homes. Structured tools such as benchmarking can help them to recognize the range and complexity of resident's health needs, and work with care home staff in ways that acknowledge their expertise and improve the overall care of older people in these settings.</ab>

        <ab>Aims The aim of the co-operative enquiry undertaken was to explore how the leadership component of the Consultant Nurse for Older People role was reflected in day-to-day working. Background Leadership is one of the four key elements of the Consultant Nurse role and is the key mechanism for achieving and embedding transformation in practice. However, within the role of the Consultant Nurse this area has not been explored in detail. Methods A 6-month co-operative inquiry approach was used to develop insights into leadership strategies of Consultant Nurses for Older People and involved the five authors of the paper, four Consultant Nurses in Older People nursing and the lead author who was also an experienced Consultant Nurse and practice-based researcher from a different nursing specialism. Results Through the analysis of the stories shared by the co-authors/participants, two key themes emerged relating to complexity and pathway. These themes provided a major focus for the Consultant Nurses in their leadership role. The outcome of the study is a framework that describes the triggers and enabling factors that precede the use of leadership strategies at the clinical and organizational level and associated outcomes. Conclusions In defining how leadership is reflected by Consultant Nurses for Older People, a complex picture emerges that is multifaceted and multidimensional. Consultant Nurses need support to make visible the valuable contribution they make to enabling healthcare teams, organizations and work places. Consultant Nurses for Older People are key in ensuring the quality agenda within their organizations as they are well placed to provide leadership at both a strategic and clinical level, while providing influence to operational development. Implications for nursing management Within the context of the literature this area is under investigated. Understanding how leadership is reflected in the role of Consultant Nurses is complex as Consultant Nurses work across traditional interfaces and between different levels within organizations. Consultant Nurses have been 'challenged' to identify the 'difference' they are making; to do this it is important to understand how leadership (as one element) is reflected in a highly complex, multidimensional role and the links between leadership and enabling, quality person-centred ways of working with Older People within rapidly changing, pressurized healthcare settings.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Sharing information with relatives of elderly patients in primary care and in hospital has to fit into the complex set of obligations, justifications and pressures concerning the provision of information, and the results of some studies point to the need for further empirical studies exploring issues of patient autonomy, privacy and informed consent in the day-to-day care of older people. OBJECTIVES: To know the frequency with which 'capable' patients over 65 years of age receive information when admitted to hospital, the information offered to the families concerned, the person who gives consent for medical intervention, and the degree of satisfaction with the information received and the healthcare provided. METHOD: A descriptive questionnaire given to 200 patients and 200 relatives during the patients' stay in hospital. RESULTS: Only 5% of patients confirmed that they had been asked whether information could be given to their relatives. A significantly higher proportion of relatives received information on the successive stages of the care offered than did patients themselves. As the age of the patients increased, so the number who were given information, understood the information and were asked for their consent for complementary tests decreased. The degree of satisfaction with the information offered was high for both patients and relatives (86.5% and 84%, respectively), despite the irregularities observed. CONCLUSIONS: The capacity of elderly patients to participate in the decision-making process is frequently doubted simply because they have reached a certain age and it is thought that relatives should act as their representatives. In Spain, the opinion of the family and doctors appears to play a larger role in making decisions than does the concept of patient autonomy.</ab>

        <ab>THE STUDY'S RATIONALE: Confusion is a common condition among older patients and often a fearful experience. Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a literature review of experimental evidence describing interventions to manage the older adult in the acute care hospital setting. Background. Older people are increasingly being cared for in a system largely geared towards acute care. This approach is often inadequate to meet the needs of older patients with chronic and complex conditions. In response to these challenges, evidence-based interventions are required to improve health outcomes. Method. The MEDLINE and CINAHL databases and the Internet were searched using the keywords elderly, older, geriatric and aged care. Studies published between 1985 and 2006 were included if they reported, in English, a controlled trial of an intervention designed to improve the management of older adults in the acute care setting. The findings were synthesized using the method of a modified integrative literature review. Findings. Only 26 controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The following elements of interventions appear critical in providing optimal health outcomes for older people admitted to acute care: (1) a team approach to care delivery either directly in a designated unit for older patients or indirectly using gerontological expertise in a consultancy model; (2) targeted assessment techniques to prevent complications; (3) an increased emphasis on discharge planning and (4) enhanced communication between care providers across the care continuum. Conclusion. A multidisciplinary team approach, using gerontological expertise, in acute care settings is recommended to improve the care of older patients. Care delivery should occur in a specially designed unit, with communication strategies that emphasize discharge planning.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a concept analysis of the meaning of preserving dignity. Background. Preserving dignity, especially when caring for older adults, is essential when giving nursing care. There is a lack of clarity about what kinds of caring activities lead to preserved dignity. Method. Data were collected using several databases (CINAHL, Age Info, Libris, Medline, Pub Med, Psyc INFO and Blackwell Synergy) covering the years 1990- 2005. The keywords used were 'dignity', 'human dignity', 'preserving dignity', 'elderly', 'aged', combined with 'patients/persons', 'caring relation' and 'nursing'. The analysis covered 53 articles, dissertations, reports and textbooks. Findings. Dignity may be defined as a concept that relates to basic humanity. Dignity consists of inherent and external dimensions, which are common for all humans and at the same time are unique for each person, relating to social and cultural aspects. The attributes of preserving dignity are individualized care, control restored, respect, advocacy and sensitive listening. Antecedents are professional knowledge, responsibility, reflection and non-hierarchical organization. The consequences are strengthening life spirit, an inner sense of freedom, self-respect and successful coping. Conclusion. Preserving an older adult's dignity is complex. By using the attributes in, for example, nursing documentation, the action and value of preserving dignity could be made visible as a professional nursing activity.</ab>

        <ab>ObjectiveTo examine the role of registered nurses and allied health workers in meal management, assessment, safe environment and care planning for older people in residential aged care.Primary ArgumentNurses and carers are often the first to observe and put into place strategies to prevent choking in residents with swallowing difficulties. Coroners' reports have raised issues with regard to the role of the registered nurse, resident autonomy and the effectiveness of speech pathologist assessments in avoiding incidents that compromise resident's health and well being.ConclusionsIn residential aged care the role of the registered nurse involves managing a complex environment. In the area of meal management, nurses are struggling to have their knowledge and expertise recognised. Nurses need to develop strategies to articulate and demonstrate their contribution to meal management in order to promote their knowledge and skills. Nurses must actively continue to develop their body of knowledge through research: otherwise 'expert' knowledge will be accessed from elsewhere. This paper will outline a number of areas for future development and research which focuses on the needs of older people and staff in this area.</ab>

        <ab>Planning for care of the older adult is especially important during critical illness states when recovery can be uncertain. Patients often present to the ICU with complex illness; therefore, targeting measures to prevent functional status decline is important for hospitalized elders, who are at risk for prolonged recovery from critical illness. Addressing and planning for the needs of hospitalized elders, including the integration of strategies to target independence, is a key area of focus for nursing care. This article provides a review of the literature on strategies for promoting independence during acute illness and includes recommendations for practice, education, research, and policy to promote optimal care for hospitalized elders in acute care.

        <ab>Caring for the elderly in today's acute care setting can be a challenging and complex process. Regardless of whether the interventions provided by caregivers are physical or psychosocial, one of the basic tenets of caring for elderly is to uphold their dignity. The concept of dignity is defined and challenges to maintaining dignity for elderly in the acute care setting are described. Strategies and recommendations for education, practice, research, and policy development are outlined to assist nurses in ensuring that elders receive the dignified care that they deserve.

        <ab>Aging is a complex process, continuous and irreversible, a phenomenon to which Portuguese population is not stranger. With longevity the elderly becomes less autonomous, depending on the case of others, starting to emerge a growing number of elderly much more elderly, many of them taking care of another elder. In the present nurses should give special attention to this phenomenon in order to provide better support to the elderly caregivers of the elderly, who also have geriatrics problems, proving a greater satisfaction in the acquisition and maintenance of this role and in this way promoting self-governing and minimizing the dependency of the cared elder.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Nurses' clinical reasoning is of great importance for the delivery of safe and efficient care. Pressure ulcer prevention allows a variety of aspects within nursing to be viewed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe both the process and the content of nurses' reasoning during care planning at different nursing homes, using pressure ulcer prevention as an example. DESIGN: A qualitative research design was chosen. SETTINGS: Seven different nursing homes within one community were included. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven registered nurses were interviewed. METHOD: The methods used were think-aloud technique, protocol analysis and qualitative content analysis. Client simulation illustrating transition was used. The case used for care planning was in three parts covering the transition from hospital until 3 weeks in the nursing home. RESULT: Most nurses in this study conducted direct and indirect reasoning in a wide range of areas in connection with pressure ulcer prevention. The reasoning focused different parts of the nursing process depending on part of the case. Complex assertations as well as strategies aiming to reduce cognitive strain were rare. Nurses involved in direct nursing care held a broader reasoning than consultant nurses. Both explanations and actions based on older ideas and traditions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Reasoning concerning pressure ulcer prevention while care planning was dominated by routine thinking. Knowing the person over a period of time made a more complex reasoning possible. The nurses' experience, knowledge together with how close to the elderly the nurses work seem to be important factors that affect the content of reasoning.</ab>

        <ab>The premises, questions and methodological problems of a multicentre study aimed at describing the epidemiology of patients' problems that require a nursing intervention are described. The main points and methodological challenges are presented and discussed: (a.) the choice of focusing on patients cared for in Nursing homes and districts because a. they are complex, originate very high nursing workload, b. few studies and data from the nursing point of view are produced; c. information on everydays' care and problems are lacking, d. they are marginal populations both in research and organization of care; (b.) the need of involving nurses in a surveillance exercise, to increase the attention on problems, their causes and potential avoidability, focusing the attention on problems related to drugs and devices; (c.) the importance-and challenge- of describing what happens in everyday' care, taking in account the variability related to contexts and people. The recognition of a problem is, in fact, related to factors such as the knowledge of the patient and his/her story, the level of knowledge and expertise of the nurse, the attention paid, the context and the organization. The main lessons learnt are summarised.</ab>

        <ab>The aims of this study were to explore the practicability of two instruments developed to assess older people with complex care needs and to assess compliance with criteria for assessment tools that require tools to be person-centred and to support rather than replace professional judgement. Nurse assessors undertook assessments of older people living in a care-home setting or awaiting discharge from hospital, using EASY-Care and Minimum Data Set Resident Assessment Instrument (MDS-RAI). The results suggest that both tools are practicable and useful in enabling older people to identify their needs. EASY-Care was preferred to identify both health and social-care needs. It was considered to be more person-centred in that open-ended questions allowed people to describe their circumstances in their own words. Its style made it easier to develop rapport with older people and encouraged them to talk and to disclose information beyond the immediate scope of the tool itself. Nevertheless some questions provoked anxiety and assessors needed to use their professional judgement in order to achieve a person-centred, appropriate assessment. MDS-RAI appeared to be more useful in identifying nursing or medical issues. But it did not always reveal a complete picture of the person's care needs and situation. Some nurses suggested that MDS-RAI was useful in circumstances where, in their professional judgement, older people were not being realistic in discussing their needs and their expectations for future care. The findings identify how nurses can use tools to support their assessment skills.</ab>

        <ab>Maintaining healthy skin, besides being challenging, time consuming, and often costly, is vital to the overall health of all long-term care/complex care clients - many with multiple contributing factors for pressure ulcers - including fragile skin (see illustration below). This article addresses evidence-based standards of care as they relate to current skin care initiatives, reviews standards developed by organizations, and describes select products available to support best skin care practices.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To assess the views and attitudes of aged care staff providing direct care towards palliative care and to identify their learning needs.Design: Survey design using purposive sampling methods.Findings: Nurses and care assistants (n=222) employed within nine residential aged care facilities in regional Australia completed the survey. The majority had received `on the job training' and were committed to providing end-of-life care. Differences in the level of confidence to deal with patient/family interactions and manage complex palliative care scenarios were evident between nurses and care assistants (p&lt;0.05). Both nurses and care assistants perceived a need for further education in symptom management and communication, yet their content need differed significantly between groups.Conclusions: Nurses and care assistants in residential aged care facilities demonstrate commitment to the delivery of palliative care and express a need for increased palliative care competencies. The heterogeneity of roles and educational preparation within the aged care workforce indicate that tailored palliative care education initiatives are required to meet the learning needs of aged care nurses and care assistants, particularly in relation to end-of-life care. These data have implications for skill-mix and model of care development.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Systematic reviews are a useful approach for nurses to take in exploring issues important to their practice, and in this article the process of conducting a systematic literature review on integrated care for older people is described. The review was conducted as one strand of a research project aiming to inform the development of locality-based integrated care for older people in Northern Ireland, a development driven by observations of user needs. Methodology: Systematic literature review methodology is summarized and critiqued. The process of undertaking the review in this study is described with a focus on the first stage of identifying literature, and the challenges that this presents in a review which draws on multiple bodies of work. Results: Producing a systematic literature review in integrated care is a complex undertaking, comprising a variety of different sectors, organizations, care settings, professionals, and other users, with their own bodies of knowledge; the need for an inclusive approach; the need to search a wide range of databases; nonspecific terminology; and the inappropriateness of study design hierarchies as selection criteria. Conclusions: While such a literature review might provide a basis for research and practice, the ability of the review team to call upon a wide range of skills, experience, and knowledge across the information management field and the care system is crucial.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes and examines a change program for nursing services in Complex: Continuing/Long Term Care (CC/LTC) at the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto. It presents a brief history of the rise of CC/LTC services and the difficulties associated with them. In particular it claims that demographic, professional and insti tutional changes have produced a differentiated specialization of supports which tend to disregard some necessary aspects of daily support for patients, and devalue the role of direct care workers in these settings. The 'Reconnecting to Care' (RTC) initiative is a response the to these changes by nurses at Baycrest. In detailing why Baycrest has decided to get back to basics and reconnect to care and how it has begun to do this, this paper provides an overview of the reasons for this initiative, a little of how it has been implemented so far, and some initial lessons for nursing leaders and others.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated the difficlties nursing home nurses face in continuing professional development. Two hundred nurses cmpleted questionnaires on their educational needs and acess to funding and training. The study found that nursing home employers are beginning to recognise and fund staff training needs, but that nursing home residents' needs are becoming more complex, there by increasing these educational needs. This is a summary: the full paper and referende list cann be accessed at nursingtimes.net.</ab>

        <ab>A study exploring older people's participation in their care in acute hospital settings reveals both consumers' and nurses' views of participation. Using a critical ethnographic design, data were collected through participant observation and interviews from consumers in acute care settings who were over 70 years old and nurses who were caring from them. Thematic analysis identified that older people equated participation with being independent. Importantly, consumers highlighted the complexity of the notion of participation when describing situations where they were unable to participate in their own care. The difficulties in communicating with health professionals and an inability to administer their own medications in inpatient settings were identified as barriers to participation. Understanding what consumers believe participation means provides a starting point for developing meaningful partnerships between health professionals and people receiving care.</ab>

        <ab>The theoretical framework for this study was provided by Bandura's (1986) conceptualization of self-efficacy for selecting behaviors perceived as effective in complex situations, and in motivation to perform the behaviors of caring for older adults, specifically older adults from various cultural backgrounds. The increasing number of culturally diverse older adults in the U.S. has prompted research on methods to adequately prepare a nursing workforce to provide quality care to these individuals. Identifying effective teaching-learning methods enables evidence-based teaching (Fineout-Overholt, Melnyk, &amp; Schultz, 2005; Killeen &amp; Barnfather, 2005).Participants from two schools of nursing in the southeastern U.S. provided the sample. The Eldercare Cultural Self-Efficacy Scale (Shellman, 2003) and the Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence-Revised (Campinha-Bacote, 2002c) were used to evaluate student self-efficacy. A pre-course demographic questionnaire provided insight to student characteristics and a post-course demographic questionnaire provided information regarding the clinical experiences during a senior level community health course and how these experiences impacted participant perception of self-efficacy.Results of the research revealed few statistically significant changes over time or by school. Continued evaluation of nursing curricula and evidence-based teaching-learning strategies should be integrated into the Bachelor of Science in Nursing curriculum.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives. To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated. Background. Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on health-care costs is also high. Results. Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described. Conclusion. These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. Relevance to clinical practice. Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives. The literature review was conducted to explore those factors which complicate pain management in older people to inform future research, education and nursing practice in this area. Background. Acute pain management in hospitalized older people is complex because of the physiological changes of ageing, pharmacological factors and under-representation of this patient group in reported research about assessing acute pain. Methods. A review of the literature was undertaken using electronic databases and specified search terms, some hand searching was also used and included the grey literature, textbooks and conference proceedings. A computerized literature search was carried out using CINAHL, Bandolier, Cochrane, Medline, the British Nursing Index and the International Association for the Study of Pain website for the period 1992-2004. The search terms were acute pain, older people, elder care, pain assessment and acute pain services. Thirty-seven research-based reviews and published studies and 17 policy documents were included. Conclusions. Managing acute pain well in older adults involves understanding the influence of a series of integrated factors: attitudes and beliefs, physiological ageing processes, pharmacological factors and the social construction of the older person in healthcare contexts. Relevance to clinical practice. This review offers new insight into those factors which, taken together, add complexity to managing acute pain in older people well. Moreover, nurses are the professional group mainly responsible for assessing pain, administering and now prescribing analgesia and evaluating the quality of pain relief in older people. On this basis, they are also the group most likely to effect improved patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Under-managed pain has serious negative consequences for the quality of life of seniors with dementia. Several studies have shown that such patients are less likely to receive analgesic medication than cognitively intact peers despite a similar prevalence of pain-related conditions (Kaasalainen et al., 1998; Morrison &amp; Sui, 2000; Scherder et al., 1999). Moreover, under-managed pain can lead to patient aggression and behavioural problems. The verbal communication impairments that characterize severe dementia make pain assessment complex and difficult, and pain problems often go undetected. The Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Dementia and Limited Ability to Communicate ([PACSLAC]; Fuchs-Lacelle &amp; Hadjistavropoulos, 2004) was developed as a clinically useful tool designed to assess pain among seniors with severe dementia. The goal of this study was to determine whether systematic pain assessment (i.e., regular use of the PACSLAC in long-term care facilities) leads to improved pain management practices compared to a control condition involving the recording of behaviours that are not directly related to pain. The Communications Model of Pain (e.g., Hadjistavropoulos &amp; Craig, 2004; Prkachin &amp; Craig, 1995) was used as a theoretical basis for the pain assessment and management portion of the study. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) Stress Appraisal Model was used to conceptualize the potential impact of better pain assessment on nurse work-related stress and burden. As hypothesised, regular use of the PACSLAC by nurses improved pain management practices over time as reflected in increased usage of analgesic medications (prescribed on 'as needed' basis) in comparison to a control group. As pain interventions increased, a corresponding decrease in observable pain behaviours (as reflected on the PACSLAC assessments that were completed by the nurses) occurred. In addition, as hypothesised based on the Stress Appraisal Model, nurses who used the PACSLAC reported decreased distress and burden over time. Finally, normative information for use of the PACSLAC is presented. This investigation provides strong support for the clinical utility of the PACSLAC in improving pain management practices and decreasing caregiver distress and burden.</ab>

        <ab>There are studies about the emotional and social aspects of loss and grief in continuing care environments such as care homes and hospital wards, but researchers have tended to focus on either the cultural aspect of the organisation or the emotional response of individuals [Holman, C., Meyer, J. &amp; Cotter, A. (2004) 'The complexity of loss in continuing care institutions for older people: a review of the literature', Illness, Crisis and Loss, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 38-51]. This splitting in the body of knowledge misses the opportunity to examine the link between the personal and the broader public domain [Williams, S. J. &amp; Bendelow, G. (1996) 'Emotions, health and illness: the 'missing link' in medical sociology?', in Health and the Sociology of Emotions, eds V. James &amp; J. Gabe, Blackwell Publications Ltd, Oxford]. This paper concerns the methodology and initial findings from a psychoanalytically informed research study. It was aimed deliberately at exploring the juncture between the psychological and social domains that care staff have to negotiate in order to provide care related to loss and grief in an NHS continuing care ward. The method draws heavily on the Tavistock approach to learning about emotions [Rustin, M. (2003) 'Learning about emotions: the Tavistock approach', European Journal of Psychotherapy, Counselling and Health, vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 187-208] but also adopts participant observation methods rooted in the ethnographic tradition [Fielding, N. (2001) 'Ethnography', in Researching Social Life, 2nd edn, ed. N. Gilbert, Sage Publications, London]. The study identifies the emotional demand of caring for people experiencing loss and grief in a continuing care unit and the development of a reflective group that supported practice developments in meeting these tasks. The paper will argue that research that develops an understanding of social practices underpinned by psychoanalytic perspectives can inform development in areas where staff are expected to cope with high levels of anxiety and stress.</ab>

        <ab>Caring for frail older adults presents unique challenges for the primary care provider. Advancing age is associated with physical and cognitive decline related to increased co-morbid conditions including arthritis, heart disease, pulmonary disease and diabetes. Eighty-year-old Mrs. X illustrates the challenges and issues providers face daily caring for the complex population in the present fragmented health care environment in the United States. The challenges and issues faced by those caring for the frail elderly include lack of coordination and continuity of care for patients with multiple conditions, the nursing shortage, polypharmacy and soaring medication costs, and transportation and access to health care services. There are emerging models of care for the frail elderly; however barriers exist to implementing these models routinely in the present health care system. Barriers to implementing these models include: 1. lack of continuity between ambulatory, acute, and long term care. 2. financing dependent upon employer, age, and type of service. 3. transportation and access to appropriate health care services. 4. inconsistent results of studies of alternative models of care. With the growing older population we must address the health care needs of this frail, medically needy group.</ab>

        <ab>As the complexity of care increases for hospitalized older adults, the clinical nurse specialist is essential for ongoing development of nursing practice and care standards. This article describes the Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) model for interdisciplinary management of older adults and clinical specialist responsibilities within this interdisciplinary team. Within the model, clinical care specialists utilize clinical expertise and consultation skills reflecting three spheres of practice related to care of high-risk community-dwelling older adults admitted an acute medical unit. The goal for this patient group is to achieve medical stability while preserving maximum functioning. The Acute Care of the Elderly team members include primary nurses (staff nurses), physicians, clinical care specialists, therapies, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, and a discharge planner. Under the leadership of the primarily nurse, the team develops a comprehensive care and discharge plan, implemented across a care continuum. Using protocols and working together, the team delivers cost-effective, coordinated care that promotes process improvement resulting in practice that is in alignment with current standards of care.</ab>

        <ab>Most people with Alzheimer's disease and their families receive care in primary care. This article describes an integrated model of Alzheimer's disease care in a primary care setting serving a predominantly ethnic minority population. This model included: a comprehensive screening and diagnosis process; a multidisciplinary team approach to care, coordinated by a geriatric advanced practice nurse; and a proactive, longitudinal tracking system. The psychosocial intervention included specific responses to the treatment and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, including caregiver directed interventions and pharmacological treatment if needed. Results suggest that this type of model can be implemented in primary care, particularly with the involvement of geriatric advanced practice nurses who can effectively manage the complex nature of Alzheimer's disease.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing nurses to meet the care needs of an expanding aging population is a challenge for nursing. Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current vacancies. This article describes the integration of long-term care experiences into senior year community health practicums and reports on a qualitative analysis to evaluate the project's impact on student attitudes and intentions toward geriatric nursing roles.</ab>

        <ab>The present study had the objectives of identifying the characteristics of gerontogeriatric nursing and of reflecting on this teaching, based on identified characteristics, in the light of Complexity. A qualitative research, its data sources were nine proceedings volumes of Brazilian Nursing congresses and seven Brazilian nursing publications of the 1991-2000 period. The main body of this article was comprised of 16 scientific articles; QRSNUD* IST4 was used for analysis. Results showed that this teaching does take place, and it is carried out through: mandatory disciplines in the curriculum; practical activities; activities during curricular training; extra-curricular activities; participation on specific or general Nursing events in which studies are presented; other activities. To use the principles of Complexity is tantamount to perceiving educative teaching as trying to convey a culture that will enable future workers to understand the human condition and to think in a contextualized, open, globalized, ethical way.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the many complexities associated with providing competent care to older Australians, especially in the current aged care environment. It explores the ways in which quality of care is driven and maintained by the registered nurse. It focuses on a study in which five registered nurses shared their perspectives on working in aged care. These experienced nurses articulated many of the important but mostly positive aspects of caring for the older person. Their contributions illustrated how aged care nurses are the lynchpin in the provision of quality care in residential aged care facilities.Older people in residential aged care facilities look to the registered nurse to help them identify and prioritise their needs. Personal care workers now administer care and the registered nurse monitors the provision of this care. It is argued that supervision, while an important aspect of the registered nurse's role, is often one that registered nurses are ill prepared to perform. The paper alerts registered nurses working in the residential aged care arena of the potential to embrace and further develop the principles of primary health care. An outcome of the paper is the recognition for further development of the place of the registered nurse in residential aged care, and the benefits associated with research in this important practice arena.</ab>

        <ab>Bowel problems can be devastating for patients and those who care for them. Accurate assessment is essential in determining the cause of symptoms and deciding treatment and management strategies. Treatment can be complex, but with care and patience improvement or cure is possible. Part 1 of this two-part article offered an overview of bowel problems in older people and an introduction to assessment. Part 2 discusses specific components of assessment, treatment and management.</ab>

        <ab>Bowel problems can be devastating for patients and those who care for them. Accurate assessment is essential to determine the cause of symptoms and to decide treatment and management strategies. Treatment and management can be complex but with care and patience improvement or cure is possible. Part 1 of this two-part article offers an overview of bowel problems in older people and an introduction to assessment.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on aspects of a study designed to answer the research questions: (i) To what extent do practice nurses use the five cyclical elements of a case management approach when caring for people aged over 75 years? (ii) What determines or deters practice nursesâ use of the cyclical elements of a case management approach in caring for older people? Case management is an approach that uses a cyclical process of assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation to provide systematic proactive care to people with complex health and social care needs. In England, specialist practice nurse case managers for older people have been piloted in ten primary care trusts and the posts are to be implemented nationally by 2008. No baseline work has, however, considered the applicability of developing the existing generalist practice nurse workforce. A 26-item structured postal questionnaire was used to explore both practice nursesâ use of a case management approach when working with older people, and what factors influenced the care provided. A random sample of 500 practice nurses was selected from the Royal College of Nursing Practice Nurse Association member database. A 45% response rate was achieved. Practice nurses assessed, planned and implemented care, but reviewing medication opportunistically and evaluating the care were uncommon. A case management approach was significantly ( P = 0.005) more likely to be used in on-going management activities than in one-off treatment room care. Practice nurses with postregistration education in district nursing were significantly ( P = 0.016) more likely to refer patients to social care services. Lack of time and the central role of the general practitioner were the main reasons for not incorporating case management into practice. The extent to which practice nurses used elements of a case management approach was highly variable and influenced by individual professional expertise, the nature of the consultation and the practice nurse's position in the general practice.</ab>

        <ab>The Admiral Nursing Service supports individuals caring for people with dementia. As a response to the high demand for one team's service, a temporary closure to referrals was agreed. This provided the impetus to explore the influence of nurses' decision making at the point of referral on demand for the service. The research questions addressed were: How do Admiral Nurses make decisions regarding referrals and What factors influence this decision-making process? Sixteen case studies were retrospectively reviewed through the auspices of a semi-structured interview aimed at identifying which factors influenced the nurses' acceptance or rejection of these referrals. Results indicated that the Admiral Nurses had a clearly identified focus in supporting the carers of people with dementia, but that the complexity of the carers situation which included the person with dementia was significant. However, the desire to fulfil a case-management role while attempting to provide a service that is of a specialist nature and of limited capacity generated tensions. The decision to offer a service to carers was consequently influenced not only by perceived need but also upon the nurses feeling professionally responsible for perceived gaps in service provision.</ab>

        <ab>AIM: The aim of the study was to use the experiences of emergency nurses to illuminate what constitutes good nursing care for patients 75 years or older transferred to emergency departments. BACKGROUND: Emergency departments have a medical technical character and the number of visits there increases dramatically as people age. Older patients require increased healthcare services in terms of nursing care, interventions and hospitalizations due to an increased complexity of their problems. For these reasons it is important to study what good nursing care of the older patients consists of at an emergency department from the emergency nurses' point of view. METHOD: Ten emergency nurses from a university hospital emergency department in Sweden were interviewed. A thematic content analysis was performed. RESULTS: The study showed that it was necessary to be knowledgeable, to be understanding of the older patients' situation and to take responsibility for them in order to be able to provide good nursing care. The emergency nurses shifted focus from describing the central aspect of good nursing care to describing what hinders the provision of it. Their experience was that prioritizing medical procedures, everyday tasks and routines threatens good nursing care of older patients in emergency departments. The emergency nurses held that the older patient is often sent to an emergency department where the level of care is not appropriate to their needs. CONCLUSIONS: The result can be seen as a challenge for the organization and the nurses in the future; to prioritize differently, thereby maintaining a balance between good nursing and medical/technical tasks when treating older patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The present day healthcare system is not organized to appropriately meet the needs of the older patients. Nurses themselves hold they can better serve the older patient. By sharing their experiences, both can be accomplished.</ab>

        <ab>One of the goals of Healthy People 2010 is for 95% of patients who are ordered medication to receive written medication instructions. The declining physical condition often associated with advanced age, lower literacy levels, and education among members of the current elderly cohorts, and increasingly complex medication regimes for chronic illness affect the ability of many older adults to learn. This article ad-dresses Geragogy, the art and science of helping older adults learn, complimentary theories of learning, and examples of how they can be used to guide the construction of appropriate written medication instructions for older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this review is to discuss how healthcare professionals, and particularly nursing practice, impact upon pain management with older people (65 years and over), following surgery. The review commences with an introduction presenting why this is an important area to consider. Current available literature and findings from an ethnographic study which was designed to examine peri-operative pain-management practices with older people will then be discussed to highlight the key issues of pain assessment and management. Three overarching themes; (1) pain assessment (2) knowledge/strategies to cope with pain and (3) organization of care (culture and context), will guide the discussion. It is suggested that comprehensive pain assessment, proficient communication and multidisciplinary working, are essential to improve pain-management practices. The paper demonstrates some of the multiple and complex factors that affect the older person's pain experience and identifies possible developmental work in this field.</ab>

        <ab>This case study describes the comprehensive and continuous care provided to an elderly patient whose self-care ability had been lost in a traffic accident. During the nursing period, from March 4th 2004 to May 18th 2004, we utilized the literature on the health problems of the elderly, concepts of discharge planning, and a comprehensive nursing assessment to confirm that the main nursing issues were clearance of a blocked airway, and impaired mobility. We also helped caregivers to cope with the problems of role strain. During the nursing process, we placed particular emphasis on management and preparation for care after discharge, the training of a maid, and psychological support for the family. The experience enabled surgical ward nurses who were already used to fast discharges of patients to gain a better understanding of discharge planning in complex cases involving the disabled elderly.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: To describe how nurses interpreted health promotion related to older patients in a medical hospital ward and the presuppositions for this work. METHODS: The study had a descriptive and explorative design. Data were created through participant observation of five nurses and informal dialogues with four nurses working in an infection unit in a small hospital in Norway. The nurses where followed during a period of 6 months. The observations and dialogues were interpreted and transformed into text. This text was analysed with qualitative content analysis and interpreted hermeneutically on three levels: (1) reading the text to get an overview of the themes; (2) systematically separating central patterns; and (3) highlighting the patterns with examples. FINDINGS: The nurses' interpretation of health promotion was closely connected to their interpretation of health and holistic nursing. Two main aspects were uncovered in the informal dialogues: a biomedically oriented nursing view and a holistically oriented nursing view. The observations showed that presuppositions, such as waiting for something or somebody, constantly changing situations, complexity and diversity in patient cases, influenced the nurses' work in general and also their focus on health promotion. The nurses balanced between the biomedical and the holistic approach. It seemed to be important for the nurses to be the masters of walking on a tightrope and to have professional clinical competence. CONCLUSION: It was difficult to find a clear focus on health promotion. The most visible focus was on diagnosis and treatment, while the more complex and comprehensive situations related to health promotion of older patients seemed to be underprioritized. The phenomenon of 'waiting' may be an important issue for further research.</ab>

        <ab>AIMS: This paper reports a study to investigate the relationships between informal and formal care, changing relationships over time, impact of integrated care, and theoretical and methodological lessons that can be drawn from research on this topic. BACKGROUND: The ratio of informal to formal care provided in nursing homes varies. In many countries the predominance of traditional, formal care is being challenged by the emergence of integrated care models in which formal and informal caregivers co-operate and co-ordinate their activities to deliver tailor-made care. This move towards integrated care is likely to result in changes in the degree and nature of involvement of formal and informal caregivers in care activities. However, very little research has investigated this. Previous research is restricted to one point in time, as opposed to focussing on the changing relationships between formal and informal caregivers over time. METHODS: The quasi-experimental design encompassed a traditional care comparison setting and an experimental setting with an integrated care intervention. At three measurement points, one before the intervention in May/June 2000 and two at 6 and 14 months after the intervention, informal and formal caregivers recorded their care activities. Informal care relationships were determined by calculating contribution rates and informal/formal care ratios for 14 activities. RESULTS: Integrated care did not bring about the expected major changes. There was a limited amount of substitution of formal care with informal care. There were limited changes in the extent of dual specialization, in which informal and formal caregivers perform separate activities. There was little supplementation of formal care with informal care. Furthermore, relationships changed over time, resulting in a complex pattern of linkages at the level of separate activities. CONCLUSIONS: Informal caregivers contribute to many activities. The impact of integrated care on the degree and nature of involvement, however, was moderate. A possible explanation is the contextual situation for nursing home care. These findings point to the need for further research into the (changing) relationship between formal and informal carers in residential care activities and the evolution of this relationship over time.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. Evaluate a clinical decision support system in an electronic medical record (EMR) to determine activation frequencies, patterns of activity, and how automated alerting mechanisms affect clinical responses.Design. Descriptive.Setting. Three nursing homes.Participants. Midwestern nursing homes where administrative staff had committed to implementing an EMR and clinical decision support system called OneTouch Technologies.Measurements. Automated alerts in the OneTouch EMR including constipation, decline in condition, dehydration, improvement in condition, skin integrity, weight gain, and weight loss were evaluated. Using alert calculations, frequencies of alerts and triggers were counted. Spearman's rank correlations were determined between the frequency of active alerts and the number of secondary diagnoses for residents. Finally, a comparison was made of clinical responses to active and non-active alerts.Results. Alert data from two facilities totaling 155 days were included in the study. The most frequent alerts were dehydration and improvement in condition. One moderately significant positive correlation was found between the number of secondary diagnoses and weight gain alert frequencies in residents who had a CVA. There were more clinical responses than no clinical responses overall. However, there were as many clinical responses to conditions with no active alerts as active.Conclusions. Frequencies of alerts is an indicator of how much information has to be managed in order to meet complex issues in nursing home residents. Automated alerts play a role in reminding nursing home staff of potential trouble spots in resident care.</ab>

        <ab>At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.</ab>

        <ab>The challenges faced in provision of high quality and effective care to geriatric psychiatric inpatients are substantial for all members of the interdisciplinary team. Common care dilemmas, including the interplay of social, medical, and psychiatric factors in treating complex patients, are perhaps best understood by examining such a case. The hypothetical case of 'Helen' illustrates the multi-dimensional and often perplexing care needs of patients admitted multiple times for inpatient care. Linked nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions, and interdisciplinary care plans emphasize the changing care needs of such patients.</ab>

        <ab>In England, the theme of promoting collaborative working between social and primary health care remains high on the policy agenda. The underlying assumption, largely untested, is that a greater degree of structural integration benefits service users. This paper reports the findings from a feasibility study comparing two models of joint working and examining the relative impact of personal characteristics, service use and co-location on the likelihood of older people remaining in the community. Baseline standardised interviews with 79 older people aged 75 + with complex needs in two social services departments were carried out following referral, covering social circumstances, physical and mental health and services received, with follow-up interviews after six months. Contacts between social workers and primary care were tracked. The findings suggest that co-location does not necessarily lead to substantially closer interprofessional working in terms of greater contact between social workers and GPs or social workers and community nurses. Factors affecting outcome were degree of cognitive impairment, intensity of home care received and whether the older person lived alone. Whatever the model of collaborative working, its effects on remaining in the community must be assessed in the wider context of the characteristics and services received by older people.</ab>

        <ab>Pleural effusion is excess collection of fluid in the pleural cavity. It is a frequent complication of pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and carcinomas of the lung, breast, and ovaries. Regardless of the cause, pleural effusion produces significant effects on the respiratory system, especially when considering the normal age-related changes that compromise the respiratory system. Pleural effusion and the complexity of diagnosis and treatment make planning and delivering care challenging. The article describes the pathophysiology of pleural effusion, its management, and related nursing care priorities.</ab>

        <ab>Research governance in care homes is a complex process, due to the ambiguous status of the care home as a public and a private space. As such, public sector research governance processes may infringe individual's rights to make decisions about participation in research, while treating the processes of informed consent as a purely individual matter may fail to safeguard individuals who may be vulnerable. This paper discusses these dilemmas in the light of existing research governance frameworks, and goes on to outline protocols that the team have developed for their own use.</ab>

        <ab>Alzheimer's disease and other chronic dementing conditions remain formidable challenges for individuals, their families, and health care providers. In addition to the challenges inherent in the sheer numbers affected, the complex and relatively unpredictable progression of these disorders complicates the delivery of interventions for health care providers. Identifying genetic and environmental etiologic factors and understanding their relationship to the natural history of dementia brings health care providers closer to more effective pharmacologic treatments and perhaps cure. In the meantime, genomics research brings professional nurses closer to providing more specific, perhaps individualized, anticipatory guidance and to providing nonpharmacologic interventions in a genotype-directed way to patients with chronic dementing conditions. The emergence of a genomics-based health care environment presents an opportunity and a challenge for gerontological nurse clinicians, educators, and researchers--an opportunity to evolve practice toward a higher level of specificity and effectiveness and a challenge to do so in a equitable and sensitive manner that improves health and quality of life for all served.

        <ab>Nurses caring for older people encounter many complex, challenging and stressful situations. Gerontological nurses must be well educated and actively pursue their own professional development to remain competent, relevant and clinically effective, yet little is known about how they perceive their professional role. Registered nurses (n = 350) from 70 long-term aged care facilities were invited to complete an anonymous postal survey that included the Professional Practice Scale (PPS). A 30.5% (n = 107) response rate was achieved. Scores on the PPS ranged from 26-61 out of 65 with a mean of 46.3. A confirmatory factor analysis of the PPS revealed a two-factor structure. The Cronbach's alpha co-efficient for the PPS (0.87) and its two subscales were high (0.85 for Factor 1, and 0.82 for Factor 2). There were no significant associations between aged care nurses' professional practice and the demographic variables examined (age, length of practice, further qualifications). Attitudes toward professional practice by gerontological nurses require improvement. The low level of professional activity may be due to the predominance of older women in the workforce, constraints of the workplace culture that does not celebrate excellence, limited orientation towards continuing professional education, and poor funding and support.</ab>

        <ab>Although considerable research and development work has been undertaken on the role of General Practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists in medication management, monitoring and referral, there is limited research into a role in medication management for community nurses. One hundred and thirteen older people living at home and receiving community nursing care were assessed for their knowledge of, and ability to manage their medication regimen. From these data, a nurse-initiated intervention was developed that included nursing interventions and referral pathways to GPs for people who might benefit from a GP and/or pharmacist medication review. A subgroup of 24 participants with diminished knowledge of medications or ability to manage their regime (considered to be at risk of drug-related problems) who were followed up, demonstrated an increase in knowledge, some alteration in compliance aids and with no statistically significant change in medication regime complexity. This paper details an approach to medication review and intervention suitable for community nurses that includes referral pathways within the medication team.</ab>

        <ab>Initiating a college-wide, complex multimedia approach to teaching-learning can be fraught with considerable challenges. The strategic use of faculty workgroups to maximize faculty involvement in the development and use of interactive Web-based modules was one successful approach to overcoming such challenges. Use of faculty workgroups composed of grant team faculty members and course faculty during the development process recognized the faculty's curricular and content expertise and tapped individual creativity. Other successful approaches to meeting development challenges were the inclusion of a multimedia designer in faculty workgroups, demonstrations of technology at college council meetings and the use of familiar software by faculty to communicate module design ideas. Additional practical approaches for technology teams within higher education settings are presented from both person and design perspectives.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence is a widespread but often ignored problem among elderly women residing in nursing homes. Despite numerous research studies performed within this setting, few have been able to demonstrate lasting change in the care of and enduring outcomes in this population. However, neither the most commonly used definitions of incontinence nor current management approaches are meeting the needs of institutionalized frail elderly, particularly women, who are twice as likely as men to demonstrate symptoms of the condition. Costs in terms of quality of life and expense of care are staggering. Because many believe that a holistic approach may provide direction for management of urinary incontinence, and because nursing is a holistic profession, a solution to the challenges involved in treating incontinence among the elderly potentially lies in utilizing a nursing as opposed to medical framework for the analysis of factors and care. Specifically, the complexities of testing necessary to differentiate current diagnoses might be simplified by classifying incontinence in a different way, such as using nurse-identified levels of need as opposed to physiologically-based factors. The use of nursing theory to guide patient assessment and an evaluation of systems of care provides a fresh approach to this long-standing problem.</ab>

        <ab>This work wants to discuss the experiencies lived in the Nursing Consults to the elders developed in a Public University, from the conception that the elders has about the care of themselves. The subjects were 37 elders from the Programa Interdisciplinar de Geriatria e Gerontologia (Interdisciplinary Program of Geriatrics and Gerontology) of the Federal Fluminense University - Brasil. The data collection techniques were the semi structured interview and the free association of ideas. The results indicated wich care are fundamental for the elders, and it were categorized in four groups: Professional care; maintainer care; expressive care; care with the self-image and the self-valorization. It concluded that the elders established their own priority of care that not always respect the hierarchy offered by Mas/ow for the basic human needs. It emphasizes the importance of the nurse identify and understand the relations between the different basic needs for the elders and that is, in fact, fundamental care for this group. The old clients' assessment involve complex and varied aspects. The important is identify the positive aspects, the limitations and the subjective aspects that interfere in the care of oneself, so that result in fundamental nursing care for the elder.

        <ab>This qualitative research project explored the complexities associated with providing competent care to older Australians, especially within the context of the current health care environment. The study used the perceptions of experienced Registered Nurses in a residential aged care facility to highlight the ways in which the quality of care in these facilities is both driven and maintained by the Registered Nurse. It is argued that Registered Nurses are the linchpins who act as providers and coordinators of care within residential aged care services. The paper, focuses on the potential for the development of the role of the gerontological nurse in residential aged care, and provides future direction for practice. A feature of the study was the way in which the five participants presented an overwhelming respect and value for the older person.</ab>

        <ab>The rapidly emerging changes in health care needs of elderly individuals have prompted many articles and public policy proposals in support of the advancement of gerontological nursing education. Although more financial support for gerontological expertise is necessary, nurses have begun to move ahead with innovative programs to enhance their own geriatric practice. In this article, the author describes a collaboration among a long-term care facility and local universities created to provide an advanced practice degree program for working nurses interested in gerontology. A needs assessment survey, program planning, and implementation are outlined. The end result is 20 RNs graduating from a master's level program who anecdotally identify increased confidence, critical thinking, and use of research and evidenced-based practice as a result of their graduate studies. The author concludes that more programs accommodating the complex needs of working nurses are needed to develop nursing expertise in gerontology.</ab>

        <ab>Data from a pilot study on the nature of nursing work in long-term care (LTC) facilities are compared with data on nursing work in intensive care units (ICUs). The comparison suggests that the LTC nursing work environment is a complex, demanding, and interesting one that is different from, not less than, nursing work in acute care environments. The data also suggests that nursing educators and researchers should reconsider LTC nursing work environments. Long-term care nursing offers an ideal, relatively controlled environment for research on what nursing work is and how nursing interventions affect patient outcomes. Long-term care nurses, whose daily work has always involved working with a variety of professional and unlicensed staff members, can serve as models for delegation and interpersonal skills. Finally, the LTC setting offers the ideal environment for clinical sites in connection with the proposed curriculum changes in end-of-life care for patients and their families.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: An intervention project was conducted in three nursing home wards in Sweden. Most patients had severe dementia. The intervention consisted of supervision for individualized and documented nursing care, based on multidimensional assessment. AIM: To illuminate changes in carers' approach after the intervention. METHODS: Several data collections were conducted across the intervention and consisted of nursing documentation, patient life stories as told by carers, video recorded interactions, stimulated recall interviews and a questionnaire. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the analyses. FINDINGS: The findings from the different methods mirrored each other and added to the credibility of the intervention. Communicated knowledge about patients improved in nursing documentation and also as told by carers. Carers were differently skilled in managing the complexity of nursing care situations before as well as after the intervention, but the intervention contributed to developing carers in 'confirming nursing care'. They also improved in their ability to verbalize reflections about their everyday life with patients with dementia. CONCLUSION: Supervision made it possible for carers to share their lived experiences about their day-to-day life with patients, which could promote personal and professional development and thus improve care quality. It also appeared that a detailed assessment tool used as part of the nursing process contributed to seeing a patient as a real person behind a dementia surface.</ab>

        <ab>This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>AIM: The aim of this study was to deepen understanding of the relationship between autonomy and integrity in interactions between patients and individual health care workers in real-life care situations. METHOD: The data reported here are from a 6- and 12-month follow-up of the teaching of ethics to health care professionals working with older people. The data collection method used was participant observation. Health professionals' caring behaviour in everyday situations was observed from the point of view of patients' autonomy and integrity. Theoretical frameworks relating to autonomy and integrity were used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: The structural framework was useful for identifying the two concepts and their relationship in everyday situations. The data suggest that the two concepts are ethically complex. Autonomy is grounded in respect for patients' ability to choose, decide and take responsibility for their own lives. Autonomy varies within and between individuals and is dependent on context and on those involved. It stresses the intrinsic value of patients, which marks their worth independently of others. Integrity, however, is bound to patients' very existence, no matter what their physical and mental conditions, and must be respected regardless of their ability to act autonomously. CONCLUSION: The concepts of autonomy and integrity appear to presuppose one another and to be indivisible if older adult patients' dignity is to be maintained. This implies that when patients' autonomy is supported their integrity is protected and, consequently, their dignity upheld.</ab>

        <ab>The home care population is especially vulnerable to depression, yet a recent study showed that home care nurses are not well equipped to identify the signs and symptoms of depression (Brown et al., 2003). Probable causes include lack of training and support for home care nurses combined with passivity and embarrassment about depression among elderly patients. Depression is treatable; however, when left undiagnosed it causes patient suffering, increased likelihood of adverse events, and higher medical costs. Home care agencies can support their nurses to better recognize the signs and symptoms of depression through education and increased awareness of the prevalence and complexity of depression in the home care population. Furthermore, with the aid of screening questions already included in the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), agencies can identify patients at risk of depression and refer them to necessary and beneficial mental health services.</ab>

        <ab>Like many other countries in the world, Australia is grappling with a chronic shortage of registered nurses (RNs). All areas of nursing are currently affected by shortages and high care residential aged care services are no exception. Selection, recruitment and retention of suitable staff to meet the complex needs of residents in aged care facilities are becoming increasingly challenging and must be addressed as a matter of priority. This paper explores the current nursing shortage, looks ahead to identify future threats to a viable nursing workforce in residential aged care, and raises some issues for future consideration.</ab>

        <ab>In the last twenty years the role of dietary has been investigated as a possible enviromental factor in the etiology of the disease, as well as its effect on the prognosis and patient' quality of life due to undernourishment processes. Nutritional intervention pretends to assure a balanced nutritional status from both clinic and educative perspectives, This work is the result of a documental study about the nutritional complexities in the Alzheimer's disease with the objetive of improving nutritional cares though the use of an effective dietary therapy.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a research study that demonstrates the inadequacy of the traditional biomedical approach to caring for older people and shows the benefits of using a more holistic, bio-psychosocial approach. An ethnographic inductive approach was taken. Nonparticipant observation was performed on complete episodes of nursing practice, followed by semi-structured interviews to explore and ratify theories in use. Phase one of the data analysis used qualitative inductive analysis to generate main categories and themes. Phase two was a process of factor isolation, which identified factors of practice theories in use. The themes identified were: nursing therapeutics; preventative nursing; communication; nurse-patient relationships; collaborative nursing; nursing assessment; decision making; and management of patient care. Further analysis identified that important theoretical factors included: encouraging; responding; comforting; explaining; maintaining ability; judgement in action; and collaborating. This knowledge is embedded in the practice theories of practitioners but it is only by exploring and critiquing these that we can hope to understand the complex nature of nursing practice as it relates to the care of older people.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the marginalisation of nursing discourse, which followed the enactment of the Aged Care Act 1997. This neo-reform period in aged care, dominated by theories of economic rationalism, enshrined legislation based upon market principles and by implication, the provision of care at the cheapest possible price. This paper exposes some of the gaps in the neo-reform period and challenges the assertion that the amalgamation of nursing homes and hostels in such an environment can provide better quality of care and life for residents. It argues that this amalgamation entails a transformation towards a social model of care and fails to address the professional healthcare needs of the acutely sick and complex extreme old person and makes evident new gaps in the provision of aged care services. The paper proceeds to present strategies where the future for nursing practice in aged care necessarily involves a judicious balancing of individual cases alongside economic prescriptions of care and ever-changing public policy initiatives. It concludes that this can be achieved through a more interactive public, professional and advocacy discourse. The methodology involves extensive analysis of public documents including media, academic journals, government reports and interviews with recognised leaders in the field of aged care. The study utilises a critical interpretative framework consistent with the logic of Michel Foucault.</ab>

        <ab>The aging of the baby boomers comes at a time of a growing nursing workforce shortage: registered nurses, nurse aides, and nursing faculty. Older adults have multiple physical, social, and psychological conditions, making the assessment, planning, and delivery of health care more complex than that of younger adults. Not surprisingly, this age group also utilizes the majority of health services in the country. Thus, most nurses will provide care to older adults in a variety of settings. However, the majority of nurses have little to no background in geriatric nursing. These multiple forces: aging population with complex needs, nursing work force shortage, and lack of geriatric knowledge, along with fewer resources, will have a grave impact on health care in this country in the near future. This article reviews issues related to an aging population, the projected nursing workforce shortage, and the lack of geriatric nursing education; it concludes with suggestions for future health care delivery to the geriatric population in the US Copyright (c) 2003 Online Journal of Issues of Nursing.

        <ab>Currently, adults older than 50 account for approximately 15% of the total number of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases. As baby boomers age, the number of older adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is expected to rise. This expected increase is due, in part, to an increase in the number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV, and, in part, to improved efficacy of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications used to treat HIV/AIDS. Older individuals who are infected with HIV also are expected to seek treatment for common conditions associated with aging. Thus, a considerable risk for drug interactions between the medications used specifically for HIV treatment and those used for other conditions exists. This article is intended as a guide for gerontological nurses facing these complexities. It includes reviews of the goals of HAART therapy and of the mechanisms of drug interactions, as well as detailed discussions related to the effects of HAART and their potential interactions with medications used to treat conditions commonly found in aging populations.</ab>

        <ab>Disturbed behaviour in older people is a challenging and complex clinical problem. Accurate nursing assessment and management are key elements for good outcomes. The literature shows that nurses do not consistently understand this clinical syndrome and appropriate education is needed. In recognition of limited time frames and of theories of learning, an algorithm has been developed detailing, in order of priority, the management of aggression, delirium, depression or other mental disorders and dementia, plus an outline of supportive communication and care techniques. Three separate packages, each comprising a booklet of lecture notes and resources plus a matching poster are available. Each of these relates particularly to the needs of older people in aged care facilities, acute care or the community.</ab>

        <ab>The worldwide phenomenon of ageing populations in developed countries has led to an increased emphasis on how best to meet the healthcare needs of people aged 65 years and older. One area identified as requiring particular attention is the care provided to older people in acute settings. This paper reports on the findings of an exploratory qualitative study that investigated issues having an impact on registered nurses' ability to care for older people in a publicly funded teaching hospital in Australia. Issues identified pertain to the complexity of managing the healthcare needs of the older person with an acute illness; the acute care environment as being problematic for the older person, and maintaining continuity of care in an often fragmented and under-resourced healthcare system.It is clear from the study findings that registered nurses in the acute setting play a central and pivotal role in the multidisciplinary team caring for older people with regard to the management and coordination of care as well as in the provision of direct care. However, tensions arise from the curative focus dominant in acute care settings, which privileges and resources technically focused acute care skills and does not place as high a priority on developing appropriate knowledge, attitudes and skills specific to the care of older people.The findings provide a base from which to progress further research as well as a challenge to those working in acute settings to develop systems of care that maximise the role of the registered nurse in improving outcomes for hospitalised older people.</ab>

        <ab>The proportion of older people in the total population is increasing in most countries because of advances in medical technology and resulting longer life expectancy. The role that older people play in our communities does not reflect this. Sometimes they are reduced to mere statistics and stereotypes in economic and political discussions on the financial burdens of care for older people. I argue that we need to rebuild inclusive munities in which older people are respected as valuable members. I suggest that this can be done by studying the characteristics of past communities and by learning from the work of environmental ethicists who advocate the preservation of our heritage. Nurses share with them a holistic perspective on complex issues such as ageing. They are therefore in a position to empower older people to play a role in our communities as unique individuals with integrity and wisdom.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND:increasing numbers of elderly patients are admitted to hospital. Ensuring that they are given appropriate and timely access to the range of hospital and community medical, rehabilitation and social care facilities has become more difficult due to the complexity of management options now available, and limited senior medical staff time. METHODS:we established a scheme in which specialist nurses made first assessments of all inter-departmental referrals to a hospital department of geriatric medicine. We evaluated the scheme prospectively using process and outcome data. RESULTS:2825 new patients were seen by two nurses in the first two years, an average of 5.4 per weekday (range 0-17). Mean time from admission to referral was 9 days. Most referrals were seen within 1 day. Mean total length of hospital stay was 43 days (range 1-351). Seven percent died on the referring ward, and 31% were discharged directly from the referring ward. Almost half were accepted for in-patient rehabilitation. Sixty percent of these were discharged home. Thirteen percent were transferred to an acute geriatric medical or stroke ward. One-quarter of these died. Senior medical review was requested in 8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:nurses could select patients suitable for rehabilitation, identify those requiring on-going acute in-patient care, and make arrangements for supported direct discharges where appropriate. This model facilitated access to a wide array of discharge and community support schemes, and supported the efficient use of consultant time.</ab>

        <ab>This paper considers the position of people with dementia in care homes, and the different understandings of their predicament. There are conflicting pressures on care homes. On the one hand there are reasons to ignore dementia, but on the other there are new expectations that a reasonable quality of life is both possible and desirable for people with dementia. These expectations are informed by a view of dementia which challenges narrow medical understandings and implies a kind of care that is based on sensitive interpretations of individuals, and is able to meet a broad range of needs.Drawing upon findings from a study of wellbeing among people with dementia in long-term care, the paper suggests that applying new understandings to care practice is a slow but worthwhile process. In a favourable care environment, people with dementia can maintain wellbeing, although staff need continuing encouragement and support, especially when residents' needs are complex. In their own way, people with dementia make efforts to hold on to the essential underpinnings of wellbeing, and these efforts need to be recognised and supported. Staff who develop a special understanding of the lived experience of dementia, together with skills to support broader needs, can make a significant difference to residents' lives. The challenge for care homes is to find ways of enabling staff to work in this way.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to explore eating, feeding and nutrition among stroke patients in nursing homes as described by their nurses and by assessments. Registered Nurses were interviewed about an individual stroke patient's state of health, care needs and nursing care received and nursing records were reviewed. Information on eating, feeding and nutrition was extracted from the interviews and nursing records. A comprehensive instrument, the Resident Assessment Instrument, was also used to assess these patients' state of health. The domains of eating, feeding and nutrition were focused on in this study. Manifest content analysis was used. The results showed that more than 80% of the stroke patients in nursing homes were assessed as having some sort of dependence in eating. According to the Registered Nurses, 22 out of 40 patients demonstrated different eating disabilities. The number of eating disabilities in individual patients ranged from 1 to 7, which emphasized the complexity of eating disabilities in stroke patients. Dysphagia was reported in almost one-fourth of the patients and 30% were described and/or assessed as having a poor food intake or poor appetite. The Registered Nurses' descriptions of the eating disabilities, nutritional problems and their care were often vague and unspecific. Only six weights were documented in the nursing records and there were no nutritional records. The findings highlight the importance of making careful observations and assessments, and of maintaining documentation about eating and nutrition early after a patient's arrival in the nursing home to enable appropriate care and promotion of health.</ab>

        <ab>Contemporary nursing in residential aged care facilities poses many challenges. Issues impacting on registered nurses providing care to older Australians living in residential aged care settings are explored and described in this paper. Five broad themes emerged from the analysis of thirty interviews with Registered Nurses, eleven focus groups with participants who worked with registered nurses in the residential aged care facilities selected in the sample, and five nominal groups which consisted of key stakeholders from the aged care industry and professional nursing forums. These themes were: a changing and increasingly complex role; perceptions of the registered nurse in residential aged care and how to deal with them; the need for strategies to work with others; coping with the everyday demands; and dealing with a sense of powerlessness and lack of control. The identified themes form the of the discussion to follow.</ab>

        <ab>Clinical nursing documentation, written, verbal or supported by technology, is being affected by both the worldwide 'information explosion' and budgetary constraints. In Australia, the necessity of documenting complex care needs and treatment plans in older adult care settings has become more imperative because funding levels and sources are frequently tied to these documents. As a consequence, the statutory requirements for documentation have become a significant driving force in shaping nursing practice. Although the value of quality documentation is or should be recognized, the seemingly vast amounts of time required inevitably distracts nurses from what they see as their primary purpose-the provision of direct patient care. Older adults who are frail are among the most complex clients requiring services in what is traditionally a poorly resourced sector. Under-funding frequently impacts on the staff skill mix, resulting in low levels of senior, highly qualified, and skilled staff. These factors impact the quality of the documentation and possibly the usage of the information itself. This article will provide an overview of the issues related to documentation of clinical information in older adult care settings with particular reference to some of the 'unique' inefficiencies inherent in the Australian system.</ab>

        <ab>The abuse of older people by someone they know and should be able to trust is a complex problem that faces nurses working in aged care. From the beginning days of dealing with this social problem, a great deal has been learned about elder abuse, about victims and perpetrators and about the difficulty of working in this area. A conceptual framework of knowing, such as that developed by Barbara Carper (1978), is a valuable framework to guide knowledge organisation and utilisation in confronting cases of abuse in clinical practice. This article briefly considers Carper's four ways of knowing to show how they can influence professional practice in general, and dealing with elder abuse in particular.</ab>

        <ab>This article deals with a plan of care based on Dorothea Orem's Theory. This has been applied to a healthy old man until recently, the care of old men on the part of nurses has been centered on the multipathology which they suffer, and consequently on the complexities derived from it. However, healthy old men also need the care of nurses due to he necessity of physico psychological adaptations and the loss of vision, hearing or movement which the natural process of agein brings about with it. Since ageing may suppose a decline in old men's well-being, nurses' intervention is then advised in order to help these people in their adaptation (new situation) and to the counteract the effects of previously mentioned loss in this new stage of life. This work tries to illustrate a plan of care which put into practice with a healthy old man and which kind of intervention on the part of the nurse, will be necessary.

        <ab>This article explores the value of using the Critical Incident Technique to capture qualitative data relating to nurses' experiences in three diverse clinical contexts: (i) neonatal intensive care; (ii) palliative care; and (iii) care of the demented elderly. It is suggested that this technique enables the researcher to capture the reality of contemporary nursing practise, and nurses' experiences of that practise. It is also suggested that the versatility and flexibility of the Critical Incident Technique reveals the subtleties and complexities in nurses' experiences of practising nursing in diverse contexts, thereby promoting a deeper understanding of meanings underpinning this practise.</ab>

        <ab>The well-being of older adults is a major social and health concern in the United States. Of particular import is the mental health of the expanding older adult population. Older adults often receive inadequate or inappropriate mental health services. Provision of appropriate, efficacious care is a challenge because of the complexity of determining the differential diagnosis of health problems in elders. Mental health professionals require knowledge not only of the unique presentation of psychiatric disorders in older adults but also of normal aging, diseases and disabilities of aging, and the cultural diversity found between and among subgroups. For the purposes of this article, emphasis will be placed on geriatric mental health, including issues and barriers that have affected the diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems and psychiatric disorders in older adults. Areas of concern identified in the recent Surgeon General's reports on older adult suicide and mental health will be presented. A case example will be used to illustrate key issues in geriatric mental health care.</ab>

        <ab>As life expectancy increases, American's health needs are becoming more complex. At the same time, early hospital discharge and the declining reimbursement rate for visiting nurse agencies are leaving people baffled about how to provide the proper care for their loved ones. It's the job of geriatric care managers to guide patients and their families through the complicated maze of home healthcare.</ab>

        <ab>Older emergency department (ED) patients have complex medical, social, and physical problems. We established a program at four ED sites to improve case finding of at-risk older adults and provide comprehensive assessment in the ED setting with formal linkage to community agencies. The objectives of the program are to (1) improve case finding of at-risk older ED patients, (2) improve care planning and referral for those returning home, and (3) create a coordinated network of existing medical and community services. The four sites are a 1,000-bed teaching center, a 700-bed county teaching hospital, a 400-bed community hospital, and a health maintenance organization (HMO) ED site. Ten community agencies also participated in the study: four agencies associated with the hospital/HMO sites, two nonprofit private agencies, and four public agencies. Case finding is done using a simple screening assessment completed by the primary or triage nurse. A geriatric clinical nurse specialist (GCNS) further assesses those considered at risk. Patients with unmet medical, social, or health needs are referred to their primary physicians or to outpatient geriatric evaluation and management centers and to community agencies. After 18 months, the program has been successfully implemented at all four sites. Primary nurses screened over 70 (n = 28,437) of all older ED patients, GCNSs conducted 3,757 comprehensive assessments, participating agency referrals increased sixfold, and few patients refused the GCNS assessment or subsequent referral services. Thus, case finding and community linkage programs for at-risk older adults are feasible in the ED setting.</ab>

        <ab>As elderly become older, they often present complex needs and numerous health problems. In order to guarantee their quality of life they should receive comprehensive care services provided by specialized geriatric teams. A key component of these teams is the nursing staff, in charge of the important task of evaluating and managing senior care services. In this report the authors will analize the ratio of Registered Nurses available to the public institutions more closely involved in elder care on the island of Lanzarote. The said ratio is compared with studies conducted on this subject by the Spanish Society of Geriatrics. Among the facilities evaluated area geriatric department, two nursing homes and a geriatric day care service center. In the discussion, the authors highlight the fact that the staffing ratio of Registered Nurses is scarce in the majority of the institutions surveyed. The long-term care unit and nursing homes are the facilities where the lowest ratio of Registered Nurses is found. This abstract was translated into English by the publisher or author.</ab>

        <ab>In this article two algorithms are suggested for use by district nurses in the management of constipation in dependent older people at home. Prescribing for this group of patients requires a complex assessment of medical and social factors as 24-hour supervision is not always available and local health and social service resources may impact on the level of care that is available in terms of the provision of food and drink and the taking of medicines.</ab>

        <ab>Caring for people with dementia is complex and demanding, and informal carers carry out much of the care. In this article, Madeline Armstrong outlines the different types of dementia and discusses the psychological approaches to care. Informal carers experience many stressors when caring for people with dementia and Admiral nurses play an important role in supporting carers.</ab>

        <ab>Managing behavioral disorders such as delirium and agitation while simultaneously attending to the acute needs of elderly patients is a challenge that confronts orthopaedic nurses on a daily basis. This will only increase in frequency and complexity as the new century dawns. Delirium and agitation affect morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and costs--in short, outcomes. To manage and care for these patients, orthopaedic nurses must first update their knowledge of acute disorders that can disrupt mental status and behavior, and the effects of systemic events on brain function. With the knowledge of the pathophysiology of delirium and agitation, nurses then need to refine their assessment and intervention skills. This article describes the phenomena of agitation and delirium in the elderly acute orthopaedic patient, outlines current perceptions regarding pathophysiology, and offers guidelines for prevention and intervention. An algorithm has been developed that can assist with the identification of at-risk individuals, causes of delirium, and early assessments in the acute care setting.</ab>

        <ab>Due to social policy reforms in Sweden, professionals with a social and a medical education work together. Reported conflicts within municipal elderly and disabled care, related to professional training, sometimes result in a deteriorated work climate. As an attempt to improve the work climate in interprofessional groups, an intervention study was set up in four `experimental dwellings' where staff participated in systematic ethical group discussions. Four similar dwellings were used as reference. Work climate was studied before and after the intervention using a questionnaire measuring sense of coherence, job satisfaction, and burnout among the staff. High scores at baseline with no significant differences after the intervention. That staff had high coping capacity, were satisfied and did not experience burnout. The small observed changes after intervention indicate that the intervention did not lead to the expected improvement of work climate, but might also result from the chosen scales inability to measure complex social processes. The importance of interprofessional discussions about everyday skills and values is stressed.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to obtain an increased understanding of the experiences of elderly people in geriatric care, with special reference to integrity. Data were collected through qualitative interviews with elderly people and, in order to obtain a description of caregivers' integrity-promoting or non-promoting behaviours, participant observations and qualitative interviews with nursing students were undertaken. Earlier studies on the integrity of elderly people mainly concentrated on their personal and territorial space, so Kihlgren and Thorsen opened up the possibility of considering the concept of integrity from a broader view by recognizing its relationship to the larger framework of the self-concept. Based on this, findings in the present study indicate that elderly people's integrity relating to their corporal self were the least violated. On the other hand, their psychological, information and cultural selves were the most exposed. The study also identified a further dimension (i.e. one relating to social self), which should be included in the concept of integrity because respecting elderly people's social self reduces their feelings of loneliness, isolation and seclusion. In summary, the results indicate that the concept of integrity is complex and has several dimensions.</ab>

        <ab>The normal aging process brings about inevitable and irreversible changes in physical, psychosocial, and spiritual health. These normal changes are partially responsible for the increased risk of developing health-related problems in the hospitalized elder population. The Acute Care for Elders (ACE) model provides an effective, proactive, inexpensive framework for addressing the complex health needs of older adults. When ACE principles are used for the clinical management of clients with orthopaedic problems, interdisciplinary conferences provide the structure for maintaining the continuity of care. Mobility as well as independent functioning, comfort level, mental status, depression, skin health, nutrition, and response to treatment, are discussed and nurse initiated guidelines for preventive and restorative interventions are implemented. Follow-up phone calls and/or home visits are important indices of thorough discharge planning. The theory of comfort is used to assure that holistic needs are addressed. Nurses who practice the ACE model are excited about demonstrating the highest level of competency in geriatric nursing, whereby patient functioning is maximized, comfort and dignity are promoted, functional decline is prevented, and patients are successfully returned to their homes.</ab>

        <ab>Findings from a research study investigating nurses' educational preparation for and practice of their role in educating patients about medication identified that the inclusion of patient education in clinical interactions has implications for the governance of clinical practice - an agenda now being implemented in UK health contexts. A review of patient education, concordance (compliance), health promotion and pharmacology literature was undertaken to illuminate the current status of the evidence for effective medication interactions. Observation (n = 48) and audio-recordings (n = 37) of nurse-patient interactions about medication were collected in seven different contexts focusing on adult and older-person, mental-health and community-nursing settings. Post-interaction interviews with nurse (n = 29) and patient (n = 39) participants were conducted to explore views on the observed interaction and to attempt to identify intended outcomes of the interactions. Issues highlighted by the research concern: the need for a pluralistic understanding of what might constitute the evidence base for practice; a requirement to recognise the complexities of professionals' and patients' perspectives on what constitutes quality; the need for caution in the application of generic `standards' to individualised care contexts, coupled with the problem of what counts as effective outcomes. The recognition of such concerns is posited as a critical ingredient in the process of clinical governance.</ab>

        <ab>Registered nurses working in nursing homes often care for stroke patients with impaired cognition and mood disorders. Understanding the behaviour of these patients often puts great demands on nurses. This study illuminates registered nurses' descriptions and experiences of stroke patients and the nursing care given in nursing homes, with a focus on cognition and mood. Registered nurses responsible for the care of stroke patients in nursing homes were asked to describe the individual patient's state of health and the nursing care given. Patients' cognition and mood have been selected for this article. A qualitative content analysis was used to group the text into categories. Registered nurses' descriptions showed great complexity and variation in patients' disabilities, as well as uncertainty about understanding these patients and the appropriate nursing care. Registered nurses described the need for further education in stroke care, and adequate resources for patient activity training, as well as meeting patients' psychosocial and communicative needs.</ab>

        <ab>Application of the trajectory reference framework of chronic conditions occurred during assistance to a certain number of aged persons presenting chronic conditions and living with their families. It happened during the Nursing Assistance Practice for the UFSC Master's degree program (UFSC x UFPel Interinstitutional agreement). The experience showed to be a challenge to that author who lived it, on account of its complexity; nevertheless, final outcomes make clear this framework is a useful one, and feasible to be adopted by Nursing.

        <ab>The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method research.</ab>

        <ab>Congestive heart failure is a complex disease that is complicated by the normal changes that accompany aging. The medical profession has learned a great deal about managing this disease in the past decade. However, the challenge remains for the nursing profession to help individuals and their families live with this chronic, debilitating disease. We must be prepared to coordinate the complex array of services needed, educate the elder to an acceptable level of understanding, counsel regarding end-of-life issues, and encourage all elders to remain active in an effort to help these fragile individuals retain the quality in their life until the end of life.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this descriptive, correlational study was to investigate the relationship between continuing education and job satisfaction among RNs and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) employed in long-term care facilities. METHOD: Herzberg's Motivational-Hygiene Theory was used as a framework to guide the design of the study. The Professional Educational Activities Scale and the McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale were completed by 110 nurses employed in long-term care facilities. RESULTS: No difference was found between type of employment status (full-time versus part-time) on the level of professional educational activities. However, RNs participated in more continuing education activities than LPNs. Nurses who reported higher family incomes also had greater participation in educational activities. Registered nurses reported greater job satisfaction than LPNs. No significant difference was found between the degree of job satisfaction for Black and White nurses. The results of this study indicated nurses who participated in more continuing education activities scored higher on the job satisfaction scale. CONCLUSION: As the elderly population increases, a critical need exists for nurses to be knowledgeable about current research-based information, including the economic and psychosocial effects of illness in later life. To provide the most effective care for the elderly population, nurses in long-term care must be knowledgeable about the complexity and specific characteristics of chronic illnesses. Continuing education activities are an important way to access this information.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on a study which employed auto/biography as a research method to expose the marginalisation and discrimination experienced by Registered Nurses (RN) employed in the nursing home sector. By virtue of their area of practice, these nurses are frequently perceived by the wider nursing community and society at large to be deskilled and not competent. A critical incident from my story is recounted and thereafter discussed from a personal perspective and within a wider context of nursing and related literature. I argue that the complexity of clinical practice in a nursing home means that RNs are no less skilled or competent than RNs in other clinical settings. However, marginalisation and discrimination occur because nurses and nursing are not isolated from the values and beliefs of society. This is a society which under values caring and nurturing and places a higher value on complex technologies with an emphasis on cure being the dominant ideology. The style of reporting the research is congruent with an auto/biographical approach.</ab>

        <ab>Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia in the United States, affecting as many as 4 million people. Extensive research is under way to identify environmental and genetic risk factors for this complex disease. Currently, tour genes are associated with an increased risk for AD: the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21, the Presenilin I gene on chromosome 14, the Presenilin II gene on chromosome I, and the apolipoprotein E gene on chromosome 19. Expert and advanced practice gerontological nurses are faced with new challenges as a result of these gene discoveries. Gerontological nurses should assess for relevant environmental and genetic risk factors; obtain comprehensive family health histories recorded as pedigrees; integrate genetic information into diagnosis, intervention, and evaluation strategies; initiate and coordinate referrals to genetic specialists; and provide ongoing emotional and decision-making support for patients and families experiencing AD.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents the steps and results of the empirical testing of a theoretical longitudinal model, derived from Roy's nursing conceptual model, of the psychosocial determinants of adaptation in different target groups. The model was elaborated and empirically verified based on the integrated results of four longitudinal studies involving groups vulnerable to mental health problems. By means of structural equation analyses, the cross-sectional model was verified at two points in time. The results showed that the model was relatively stable over time. The model was also tested using longitudinal data. Results showed little consistency in the patterns of relationships across studies. The significant links that emerged from the analyses shed some fight on the complexity of the process of adaptation to different types of stressors. They underscore the importance for nursing practice to develop interventions aimed at certain variables: perceived stress, conflicts in the exchange of support, and passive and avoidance coping strategies. The results also highlight the importance of the relationship between perceived stress, passive/avoidance coping strategies and psychological distress.</ab>

        <ab>Self-feeding behavior is often the first of a chain of self-maintenance skills to deteriorate in people with Alzheimer's-type dementia and is a major determinant of institutionalization. Moreover, nurses working in geriatric settings report the feeding of patients as a most difficult management problem. Of the various features of Alzheimer's-type dementia that can affect a person's ability to feed him- or herself, ideational apraxia can explain the loss of ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute the complex sequence of motor actions involving the use of tools or objects necessary for feeding. In this article, a systematic process is used to review the research literature to develop substantive content for nurses caring for people with feeding problems related to ideational apraxia. Ideational apraxia is a condition in which an individual is unable to plan movement related to an object because he or she has lost the perception of the object's purpose. The specific abilities necessary for feeding that are threatened by ideational apraxia are identified. A tool to assess these abilities is described, and nursing interventions aimed at enhancing or preserving existing abilities, preventing excess disability, or compensating for lost abilities are presented.</ab>

        <ab>Multidimensional functional assessment is the basis of individualized care. It is especially important in the care of elderly, with the complexity of symptomatology and often with cognitive impairment present. An assessment instrument for elderly persons, used in this study, is the Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) and its incorporated MDS Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS). The purposes of the study were to demonstrate the cognitive performance in elderly persons in different levels of care by using the CPS and to elicit the views of staff on use of the RAI/MDS. Cognitive impairment was found in 1276 elderly persons in six levels of care studied, an important factor to consider when organizing care of elderly. An intervention study was carried out for 1 year in three nursing home wards, with training and supervision in implementation of the RAI/MDS including individualized and documented care. Part of a questionnaire was used to evaluate staff (n = 50) views on using the instrument. A majority of the staff thought that the RAI/MDS could contribute to the improvement of quality of care, documentation in nursing records, and in co-operation and engagement. Further research is necessary to elicit more knowledge on the usefulness and benefits of the instrument.</ab>

        <ab>Because of the complexity in assessing elders for depressive symptoms, we recommend that nurses use a differentiated approach as an adjunct to clinical judgment and other assessment strategies. Based on our research and clinical experience, we advocate the joint use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale, and propose a two-tiered assessment process. The first differentiation in this process is made by means of a cut-off score to determine whether or not depressive symptoms exist. If depressive symptoms are present, a second system of differentiation may be employed to identify discrete symptom factors. Application of this differentiated approach will enable the nurse to better understand and design interventions for each elder's specific presentation of depressive symptoms.

        <ab>Older adults with heart failure have extensive and complex care needs. This article presents a framework for assessment and intervention with this fragile patient group. Comprehensive assessment of elders with heart failure includes gathering information about care, advocacy, and knowledge needs. Nursing interventions are focused on providing direct care, counseling, teaching, and advocacy. The unique role of the advanced practice nurse in discharge planning and home follow-up of elders with heart failure is emphasized. Copyright (c) 1998 by W.B. Saunders Company</ab>

        <ab>A theoretical model of clinical case management for psychogeriatric patients and their families is described. Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively with members of a multidisciplinary team. Copyright (c) 1998 by W.B.

        <ab>Family caregiving creates challenges and gains for professionals and family members involved in the caregiving arrangement. Caregiver well-being, in particular, is a complex and multidimensional concept for case managers as they engage in assessment, measurement and intervention planning. This article describes a blending of concepts--case management, strengths model and caregiver well-being--and presents applications of this integrated practice framework. The Caregiver Well-Being Scale is discussed as a tool for use in case management with elders and their family caregivers. Case scenarios derived from a strengths-based practice perspective are presented as examples of ways in which the Scale can be integrated into case management practice. Implications for programmatic use are also highlighted.</ab>

        <ab>This article evaluates the emergent fit of the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) clients in an effort to evaluate the usefulness of the theory in thinking about AD and planning nursing interventions. Qualitative data from a 3-year study on the range and diversity of behavioral symptoms in AD and published research, treated as textual data, illustrate the theory. Although the components of the theory appear blurred when used with AD client behavior, the theory is useful because it emphasizes the complexity and interaction of symptoms and the interrelationships among symptoms, influencing factors, and symptom consequences/performance outcomes. These interrelationships make assessment more challenging than when symptoms are considered individually. The importance of the caregiver and the social and environmental context, called situational factors in the theory, emerge as especially relevant in AD. When symptoms are examined in their entirety, and nursing interventions take the interactive nature of symptoms, influencing factors and symptom consequences/performance outcomes into consideration, interventions should be client specific and, therefore, more effective.</ab>

        <ab>This literature review looked at past studies which investigated the relationship between attitudes and behaviour, particularly in nursing care, delivery. Positive attitudes have been linked with higher rehabilitative practice as opposed to encouraging dependency. No concrete evidence could be achieved linking age and past experience with attitude but what could be established is the imperative role education plays in 'moulding' nurses to have the right attitude to deliver the right approach to nursing the elderly. Linking attitudes to behaviours have been a difficult task due to the complex contextual issues which are multi-factorial.</ab>

        <ab>Functional status in older adults admitted to hospitals is a major predictor of outcomes. Functional decline, which is complex and multifactorial in cause, is a common complication of hospital stays. Many factors contributing to functional decline are preventable and treatable by proper nursing. Advanced practice nurses have an important, multifaceted role to play in resolving this geriatric problem.</ab>

        <ab>The complexity of clients in today's health care environment requires a close, collaborative working relationship among disciplines. However, nurses, who are often key decision-makers in the planning, management, and movement of clients throughout the health care system, may not use the expertise of their best allies: nurses in other settings, institutions, and specialty areas. Many care problems-at home or in the hospital, nursing home, or rehabilitation center-can be effectively resolved by nurse-to-nurse consultation. The importance and benefit of nurses relying on their own profession to answer nursing care questions are illustrated with vignettes that apply a model of consultation to the practice of geriatric nursing.</ab>

        <ab>The growing population of older adults presents many challenges to nursing education. Curriculum design must attend to means that support students in a comprehensive approach to the often complex care that older adults require. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how baccalaureate nursing students come to know and understand care for older adults, and apply this student perspective to curriculum and practice issues related to gerontology nursing.Eight recent graduates of a baccalaureate nursing program at a midwestern, private, liberal arts college were individually interviewed at two separate meetings. In addition, a document review was conducted of respondent-created assignments that were developed as learning tools throughout the student's undergraduate education. These interview transcripts and documents served as the data that were inductively analyzed through a constant comparative process of unitizing and categorizing. From this process four themes emerged which served to represent the data and provide the foundation for pattern analysis and interpretation. Trustworthiness was established according to Lincoln and Guba's (1986) criteria of soundness.The four emergent themes were: (1) Experience as a Growing Foundation, (2) Ways of Being, (3) Contexts of Care, and (4) Teaching and Learning Care for Older Adults. These themes were consistent with established feminist pedagogy in that life experience, relationships, and multiple ways of knowing pervaded. Students came to know and understand care for older adults by constructing knowledge based on a variety of lived experiences within a variety of contexts. Experiences that both challenged and supported the students' development were evident in the findings.The themes affirm student development theory, multiple ways of knowing, and development of caring relationships. Recommendations to inform nursing curriculum development include facilitation of experiential learning situations that: (1) Foster relationship-building with the older adult, (2) Allow for active engagement and knowledge sharing in all teaching/learning experiences, and (3) Encourage reflection on and in action to support transformational learning opportunities and meaning-making.</ab>

        <ab>Collaboration, partnership, service coordination and integrated systems are terms being presented in strategic plans and agendas of governing boards and councils. Shrinking resources and changing public policies have combined to redirect organizational energy to solutions for client needs that cross agency boundaries. This paper analyzes and illustrates the benefits and challenges of service coordination in the context of two presenting problems that are inherently complex and demanding: mental illness and elder abuse and neglect. Recommendations are presented based on a model of coordination in the field of aging developed in Cleveland, Ohio. The problems are described and the agencies that undertook the coordination compared and contrasted.</ab>

        <ab>Much has been learned in the past decade, through quality medical and nursing research, regarding the pathophysiology and management of congestive heart failure. Primary care practitioners are challenged to apply the latest data to the clinical management of these patients when there is clear evidence of improvement in the control of symptoms and quality of life. Because of the complexities of the disease process, older adults with congestive heart failure require a comprehensive approach that is particularly well suited to the knowledge and skills of the advanced practice nurse.</ab>

        <ab>As the number of elderly increase, new challenges for the management of their health care arise. Elders who become critically ill are one of the most complex subsets of this population. Their special needs, risk factors, and diminished resources create a demand for comprehensive and creative approaches to care management. The purpose of this article is to explore the needs of the critically ill elderly and the role of nursing case management in meeting these needs. A case study approach is used to illustrate typical needs, interventions, and outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults are experiencing excellent health and maintaining active lifestyles. They continue to engage in the activities they have enjoyed throughout their lives, but as they grow older they are at increased risk for injury related to these activities. Older adults suffer injuries of equivalent severity as those of younger patients; however, the consequences are much more severe. The older adult presents a unique and complex scenario that requires nurses to understand the normal physiological changes of aging and the effects of chronic disease. This article provides guidelines for the emergency care of the older adult patient with trauma and emphasizes areas that require special considerations.</ab>

        <ab>Our study emphasizes the implicit theories of nursing professionals about the elderly and their influence on nursing behavior styles. According to our central hypothesis we expected a correlation between the differentiation of attitudes towards the elderly and the quality of nursing interventions. By means of a new methodological approach based on Forgas' theory of 'social episodes' we investigated attitudes towards the elderly and behavior intentions in specific nursing situations. The sample consists of 133 professionals working in nursing homes for the elderly or in home care services. In a first step the structure of attitudes towards the elderly was examined by employing multivariate techniques, e.g. factor analysis and multidimensional scaling. Three aspects of older patients' competence constitute the images which influence nursing personnel's interactions with the elderly. In the next step a significant correlation between the complexity of attitudes towards the elderly and the quality of nursing behavior could be demonstrated. In general, the findings in our sample support personalized rather than stereotyped perceptions of the elderly. In particular such qualities will be stressed by nursing professionals which facilitate or disturb the nursing process.</ab>

        <ab>Nurses need to reframe their concepts about osteoporosis to identify it as a pediatric disease with geriatric consequences. A complex metabolic process, bone development and maintenance relies on the interplay between the endocrine and renal systems, heredity and genetic predisposition, and lifestyle factors such as dietary intake, exercise, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. As nurses we need to utilize every teachable moment to educate women and reinforce efforts to prevent the development of osteoporosis. The Healthy People 2000 objective is clear on how we must counsel and educate perimenopausal women about the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy.</ab>

        <ab>Parish nurses are documenting their outcomes and, with them, instances of cases in which parish nurse interventions have potentially resulted in substantial cost savings to the federal government through averted Medicare expenses. Theoretical cost saving estimates implied in the first 600 visits exceeded $400,000. Half these estimates were related to scenarios where caregivers were sustained to facilitate ongoing home care. The other half were related to disregard of signs and symptoms warranting prompt attention. In either case, advocacy, referral, assistance finding, active listening, and supportive education efforts served to overcome major stumbling blocks to access for those elders and their caregivers who felt physically and emotionally isolated or overwhelmed by their situation. Facilitating access meant earlier, simpler, more cost-effective treatment of conditions that might otherwise have escalated to require complex care. In the 1800 stories of record, half the concerns addressed by parish nurses were related to spiritual-psychosocial concerns (e.g., unresolved feelings, transitions, interpersonal tensions, caregiver stresses, and isolation). The other half were related to physical concerns (e.g., symptom disregard, illness self-care deficits, and struggles pertaining to functional safety or independence). Most significant, the former often contributed to the latter.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to analyze questions on a complex ethic, medical and caring dilemma about reasons to continue or suspend compelled alimentation in really old patients carrying progressive acute dementia. Traditionally, the principle of life holiness supports the idea that life should be extended at all costs and the decision to continue feeding the patients is not questioned. However, revolutionary ideas are arising about attitudes, concepts and value of treatment, conducting an urgent need to discuss this problem deeply. Until when should we compel demented patients to eat, as they do not accept food and have to be fed through a catheter or intraveined alimentation, tying back their hands or using other measures? This discussion occurred in a geriatric institution at Israel, when a doctor's order was not accepted by nurses, as they had a different way of seeing the problem. A national conference on this theme was organized with the attendance of doctors, nurses, social workers and psychologists.</ab>

        <ab>IN THIS STUDY, WE addressed the problem of whether residents with a diagnosis of dementia would become agitated if given verbal commands at a level of language complexity above their comprehension ability. The study used an A-B-A research design. The convenience sample of 15 subjects was comprised of 11 men and 4 women who resided in a long-term care institution. Their mean age was 86.6 years, and their average length of stay in the institution was 317.3 days. The results lent support to the hypothesis that exposing residents with dementia to language beyond their comprehension ability could result in agitated behavior. The predominant manifestations of agitation were general restlessness, strange noises, and negativism. An important implication for nursing practice is that the language used by caregivers should match the comprehension ability of residents. Caregiving can thereby facilitate communication and, potentially, prevent agitation.</ab>

        <ab>BECAUSE THE PHENOMENA of managing and therapeutically responding to confused elderly hospitalized patients is complex and difficult, a group of advanced practice nurses, supported by a pharmacist, nursing administration, and a School of Nursing professor, was commissioned to explore the research-based literature and provide practice recommendations for these patients. This article identifies one process undertaken for synthesizing and grounding an immense body of literature related to confused elderly patients. The literature review served to begin clarifying the differences between the diagnosis and required interventions for managing either acute or chronic confusion. These interventions were articulated within a protocol format (Marker model) familiar to staff members at our institution. The development, implementation, and evaluation of the protocol is presented, as well as suggestions for further research.</ab>

        <ab>Over the next half century the population of moderately to severely demented individuals is projected to nearly triple. Because high complex technology is usually not required in the care of cognitively impaired elderly people, these individuals may be the first patients nursing students are assigned to care for. Despite the fact that these elderly people do not require 'high tech' care, their nursing care can be extremely challenging for nursing students. In order to help prepare nursing students to meet this challenge, a phenomenological study was conducted to describe the meaning of nursing students' experiences caring for cognitively impaired elderly people. Thirty-seven undergraduate nursing students participated in the study. Each student described in writing an experience he/she had had while caring for a cognitively impaired elderly person. Using Colaizzi's phenomenological method to analyse these descriptions, five themes emerged. Nursing students experienced a myriad of emotions such as frustration, sadness, fear and empathy. Caring for cognitively impaired elderly people presented difficult challenges for nursing students to overcome. Because of the difficulties encountered in caring for confused elderly people, nursing students utilized multiple nursing care approaches. As a result of giving care to elderly people suffering from dementia, negative consequences ensued for some nursing students. The positive outweighed the negative consequences in the phenomenological study. Implications for nurse educators are addressed.</ab>

        <ab>An ageing Australian population and improving medical retrieval technology have led to an increasing need for nurses to manage complex and acute health issues of aging and chronic disability. In a study of aged and extended care involving nurses, residents, allied health professionals and family members, investigators used semi-structured interviews to identify critical aspects of nursing. The aim of the study was to begin to identify and illustrate a theoretical framework of 'critical' nursing activities for aged and extended care. Two important themes to emerge were the structure of the health care setting and the characteristic behaviours of people associated with it. These themes reinforce the importance of treating people as individuals and of describing caring criteria in ways which reinforce holism.</ab>

        <ab>Delirium is an acute confusional state, associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates, that can occur in up to half of hospitalized, critically ill elderly patients. Complex in presentation and multifactorial in origin, it often is exacerbated by a lack of recognition and inappropriate treatment. As the discipline in the best position to assess patients at risk for delirium, nursing plays a key role in its prevention and management. Copyright (c) 1996 by W. B. Saunders Company</ab>

        <ab>As society ages, a challenge is presented to health care providers. The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.</ab>

        <ab>In terms of NEST, aging can be understood as a process of formative change toward increasing disorder and order in form, pattern, or structure. The person moves toward greater complexity through self-organization processes. Over time, self-organization processes result in increasingly unique perceptions and behavior. As an older person becomes more unique, he or she becomes more different from other older persons. Self-organization processes are an appropriate focus of concern for nursing when NEST is used as a practice framework. The nurse tries to understand older persons' behaviors as outcomes of self-organization processes (attempts to bring order out of disorder).</ab>

        <ab>Demographic changes have created the need for psychiatric nurses to examine knowledge and practice in the area of geropsychiatry. Older adults present unique challenges. The interaction of biological and psychosocial problems are most evident in the oldest old and necessitate a holistic approach. This report addresses psychosocial causes and treatment of 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT) in the elderly. FTT is a label commonly used to describe a complex of nonspecific symptoms that often leads to increased disability and premature death. Psychiatric nurses are challenged to take a leadership role in case finding, as well as assessment and intervention.</ab>

        <ab>The growing elderly population with diverse and complex health care needs requires increased attention to educational preparation for nurses who provide their care. This article describes a needs assessment effort that reinforces the importance of using a variety of strategies to collect data to facilitate planning relevant educational offerings. Results of the study indicated a wide variety of learning needs and diverse opinions regarding priorities. In addition, all participants in the study indicated perceptions of greater educational need for other RNs in gerontological practice than for themselves. The extent of the perception of need for educational offerings in gerontology and the lack of consensus about priorities indicate a need for further research. Several issues surrounding survey methods for collecting needs assessment data are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of the meta-analysis was to examine the state of the science of empirical nursing research in gerontology. Although the quantity and quality of nurse investigated phenomena have increased, the scattered findings of statistical significance/nonsignificance are often incomprehensible. Effect size theory grounded the project's conceptual, analytical, and interpretive approach and provided scale-free estimates of intervention effect. The study included published research and unpublished dissertations reported between 1981 and 1992. Forty-three experimental and quasi-experimental studies involving samples with a mean age of 65 contributed data to the research synthesis of nurse implemented intervention on four client referenced outcomes. The Data Coding Form and Protocol were developed, pilot tested, revised, and interrater reliability affirmed. Agreement rate (AR) was .85 for two independent coders on combined categorical and continuous variables. Nursing's impact on elder health status was apparent in the mean cumulative unweighted n adjusted, d index of 0.56, SD = 0.39, EM = 0.06, N = 43. Significance tests (p &lt;/= .05) and effect magnitudes confirmed that diverse strategies yielded positive outcomes across a wide range of persons, settings, and health conditions. Intervention efficacy was reflected in the four intervention domain unweighted mean effect sizes as follows: Physiological: d = 0.71, SD = 0.29, EM = 0.08, n = 14); Behavioral: d = 0.56, SD = 0.38, EM = 0.08, n = 25; Health System: d = 0.40, SD = 0.28, EM = 0.20, n = 2; and Safety: d = -0.18, SD = 0.47, EM = 0.33, n = 2. Weighted mean effect sizes for homogeneous outcome categories were: Overall effect: d = 0.53, v = .002, SE = .04, N = 41; Behaviors/Competencies: d = 0.54, v = .004, SE = .06, n = 18; Signs/Symptoms: d = 0.71, v = .008, SE = .08, n = 14; Feelings/Knowledge: d = 0.37, v = .013, SE = .12, n = 8; Health care delivery: d = 0.25, v = .013, SE = .12, n = 2. Although small subsamples limit conclusions for health care delivery, robust findings of the meta-analysis of gerontologic intervention research contribute to nursing's knowledge base. Current knowledge was organized. Discipline specific phenomena were identified and nursing sensitive outcomes were measured. Moreover, health care providers, researchers, and policy makers require science-based evidence of effective intervention linked to client health outcomes. Studies of family care, crisis intervention, and some complex physiological interventions were not represented in the data base, suggesting areas for further research.

        <ab>A growing nursing shortage and a growing population of older individuals with complex needs have created an unprecedented demand for qualified nurses in long-term care. Nurse retention is associated with the status of salary, benefits, paperwork, staffing, and supplies; the quality of relationships with residents, families, and peers; and the extent to which nurses feel autonomous and empowered with the authority to make nursing decisions regarding their patients. Nurse researchers in both clinical and educational settings must place a high priority on developing methods of making long-term care a more attractive and satisfying practice setting.</ab>

        <ab>Families are rapidly becoming unpaid givers of complex care. Using McKeehan &amp; Coulton's systems model, this critique reviews the evolution of the structure and processes of discharge planning programmes. It explores three common assumptions: discharge planning programmes are cost-effective, allow for enhancement of patients' and families' quality of life, and ensure continuity of care between hospital and community. Funds are saved due to decreased lengths of initial hospital admissions and readmission rates. However, the cost of additional hospital and community resources is rarely considered. Little evidence supports the concept that discharge planning directly affects a patient's health status. Patients and families often do not perceive the same level of benefit from discharge planning as do health professionals. Several issues surrounding research methodologies used in the reviewed studies are identified. Of particular concern is the lack of qualitative research into patients' and families' experiences. The critique concludes with an exploration of ethical issues and challenges arising from increased emphasis on cost-effective discharge planning. These include patients' rights, provision of sufficient human, social and financial resources, improved hospital-community communications, and control over hospital-developed but community-implemented programmes.</ab>

        <ab>Geropsychiatric nursing has evolved over the past 20 years in response to the complex health care needs of our rapidly expanding older population. Because of the nonspecific presentation of both physical and mental symptoms, the assessments, interventions, and coordination of resources must occur from several vantage points. The challenge has been to blend gerontologic and psychiatric nursing and to incorporate community health and medical-surgical nursing. Older adults are vastly diverse in their past life experiences, culture, ethnicity, lifestyles, current physical and mental conditions, and resources. This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to practice and presents many challenges for research.</ab>

        <ab>Behavioral problems in elders with dementia. This article focuses on the behavioral problems and care needs of elders with dementia and on the associated burden and suffering that can occur within the family unit. The authors explore these complex issues and suggest take-charge strategies to assist the nurse. Adopting Orem's self-care theory as the frame of reference, they describe the clinical manifestations of dementia and outline environmental, behavioral and medication options. By way of example, a case study presents the story of Mr. Tremblay, an elderly client with Alzheimer's disease. His care, provided by the nurse in collaboration with family and significant others, is also described. The authors suggest that appropriate care of clients like Mr. Tremblay cannot be accomplished in isolation and that a collaborative approach among health care professionals is required.</ab>

        <ab>Today's psychiatric population presents with a higher acuity and complexity of problems. Concomitant medical diagnoses may add to the psychiatric nurse's uneasiness with medical-surgical skills and knowledge. A needs assessment survey of nurses' medical-surgical skills and knowledge was conducted at a private psychiatric facility. Of the 163 surveys distributed, 55 were returned (response rate=33.74 percent). The greatest number of skill requests (30.56 percent) were for assessment skills, mainly general physical assessment. To survive as a specialty, psychiatric nursing must include physical as well as psychologic assessments; psychiatric nurses must reintegrate a medical knowledge base while maintaining a balance with the psychodynamic aspects of care.</ab>

        <ab>The complexities and challenges of conducting nursing research with the frail elderly have been poorly identified in the nursing literature. This literature examines geriatric research issues but fails to examine issues involved in doing field research with any special population, including the frail elderly. In-depth consideration of the special problems associated with studying the elderly generally, or the frail elderly specifically, are omitted. These two groups differ based on extent of functional impairment. Due to market constraints, a specialized text on gerontological nursing research simply does not exist. Although some articles about doing nursing research with frail elders exist, the issues raised in these articles are limited. The most popular issues in the nursing literature about doing research with the elderly have related to ethics (e.g., Archbold, 1981; Davis, 1981; Wolanin, 1980, 1984). Although ethical issues are important, knowledge of ethics does not solve the complex, practical problems of formulating conceptualizations and designing measures and procedures for studying the frail elderly.</ab>

        <ab>Secondary data are increasingly incorporated into nursing research studies, as nurses seek to capture and address the complexity of patient care. There is, however, little discussion in methodological literature about this type of data; the meaning is taken for granted and the data are regarded as simple sources of information, which are convenient and cost-effective. This approach denies the social meaning of the data, and is likely to lead to misinterpretation of the content. This paper discusses these analytical issues with reference to a research study which used secondary data (nursing care plans) in an examination of the ways in which nurses assess their patients. Using this data led to an increased understanding of the social world in which assessment took place.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to investigate the continuing education needs of gerontological nurses in South Carolina, a state that has experienced a large increase in the elderly population in recent years. Demographic trends relative to the aging population are predicted to continue. Increasingly, well prepared nurses will be required to meet the diverse and often complex health care needs of older people. Despite some improvement in gerontology education in recent years, knowledge gaps exist for many nurses who provide care for the elderly. Assessment of continuing education needs of nurses in gerontological practice has been neglected. A needs assessment of this specialized area of clinical practice was warranted to provide information that may enhance program planning of educational offerings for gerontological nurses. This research investigated the self-expressed instructional needs of nurses from the perspective of personal needs, instructional needs of gerontological nurses in general, and nurse experts who rated the instructional needs of gerontological nurses in general. Participants rated the need for each instructional topic and identified their perceptions of the top priorities as well as additional topics perceived as instructional needs in gerontology. Mean ratings of instructional needs were compared, and results examined relative to the biographic variables age, gender, level of education, and years experience working with the elderly. Null hypotheses #1, stated that no difference would exist between gerontological instructional needs (clinical, general, and administration) based on perceptions of personal needs, needs in general, and needs perceived by nurse experts. Hypothesis 1 was rejected for the following comparisons: personal perceptions and perceptions in general, fourteen items; expert and personal perceptions, seven items; expert perceptions and general perceptions, three items. With one exception, all of the instructional needs for which mean ratings were rejected were categorized as clinical instructional needs. The exception was a general instructional need for which a statistically significant difference was found between expert perceptions and general perceptions. Null hypothesis 2, stating there would be no difference between perceptions of instructional needs and the biographic variables was not rejected for variables age, gender, or level of education, but was rejected for the variable total years experience working with the elderly for the following instructional needs. For groups with less than 10 years experience and groups with 10-19 years experience, ratings were statistically significant for two clinical needs and one general information need. For groups with less than 10 years experience and greater than 19 years experience, there was a statistically significant difference between mean ratings of one clinical instructional need and one general instructional need.</ab>

        <ab>A complex and dangerous area of medical intervention with the elderly population is drug therapy. Although drugs have contributed to the well-being of many older persons, some elderly individuals are at risk due to polypharmacy and age-related factors. The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the medication-taking behaviors of two ethnic groups of noninstitutionalized frail elderly individuals. The findings indicate that these individuals may be at risk for harm due to their medication-taking practices. Healthcare professionals must evaluate drug use by the elderly and be aware of the risks of drug misuse by this vulnerable group.</ab>

        <ab>Clear and concise written guidelines must designate accountability for coordination of the persons involved. As might be assumed by the preceding discussion, the process takes considerable time and effort. The development of clear guidelines is a long term venture and usually does not occur quickly. In some cases a nearby agency may have developed a useful protocol that when shared with area providers, is quickly accepted. However, one to two years is not uncommon to developing a complex plan of care or protocol which can be used effectively and is specific to the conditions in a particular setting. Written guides, when developed correctly, should save all providers' time, and ensure better client care. Clear directions regarding the care to be provided and well-established lines of communication can save health care providers time and increase the likelihood of better health outcomes for the client. The coordination of planning within the home care agency, and across professional, agency and geographic boundaries is a prerequisite for successful cancer symptom management. The central aim in planning is to enhance the family's ability to manage independently and to facilitate continuity of care in the use of health care services. For the client to have the greatest potential for symptom amelioration, the home care agency must assume a major role in the coordination of care providers in the delivery of care.</ab>

        <ab>Nursing is at the heart of home care; therefore, the profession of nursing must ensure the availability of qualified nurses to provide and manage care in the growing and increasingly complex home care market. In response to this need, the College of Nursing, Arizona State University, developed a CE program for nurse clinicians and managers in home care. This article describes the development, implementation, and outcomes of a project that linked service agencies with education in this collaborative endeavor.</ab>

To meet these needs the gerontic nurse specialist assumes a number of interrelated roles: role model, implementer, consultant, educator, researcher, manager, advocate and mentor. This paper discusses the multiple roles of the gerontic nurse specialist in meeting the health care needs of dementia sufferers and their caregivers. It is recognized that caregivers encompass family members and nursing staff.</ab>

        <ab>The elderly are at particular risk for drug misuse and abuse, yet this problem is underdiagnosed. Drug misuse is the underuse, overuse, or erratic use of a drug. Drug abuse is the use of a drug for other than its intended purpose. A thorough nursing assessment is essential to detect and correct drug misuse and to diagnose drug abuse. In this paper methods to prevent and correct drug misuse and abuse are discussed. Case studies are used to illustrate the complexity of the problem.</ab>

        <ab>The nursing literature states that reminiscence is an independent nursing intervention for elderly clients and patients. This paper is about the use of reminiscence by nurses in all settings. Nurses have not to date built a firm knowledge base. The paper discusses the need for knowledge about the phenomenon and life review versus reminiscence. The uses of reminiscence therapy in one-to-one interaction, in the group modality, and as a research tool are all important applications of the concept. In contrast to other disciplines, reminiscence therapy, as studied by nurses, focuses on interventions. Reminiscence is a fascinating, elusive, and complex phenomenon, but although nursing textbooks tout its usefulness, the research findings are less optimistic.</ab>

        <ab>By the year 2030 the elderly are expected to comprise 17% of our population. These older adults with their complex health problems place a tremendous burden on the nursing care system in our institutions. Clinical nurse specialists are called upon to recommend appropriate nursing interventions designed to deal with the unique needs of older clients. Clinical nursing research is necessary to identify such interventions. The special needs of the elderly must be accommodated in the design of the research. In this paper the problems encountered in planning clinical nursing research with the elderly are discussed. Suggestions are made throughout the paper for planning nursing research which will overcome or accomodate the unique characteristics of the elderly.</ab>

        <ab>Nurses are the major caregivers for the aged with brain failure. The patients' needs and resources must be continually reassessed and care adjusted to the changing situation whether the patient is at home, attending a community ambulatory clinic, or in hospital or a long-term institution. The nursing role includes humanistic concern, physical care, scientific/technological interventions, organization of care and contributing to the limited body of knowledge. The most complex area of care of brain-failure patients is communication, which has an important impact on both psychosocial and physical well-being. Often neglected aspects of care are ambulation and regulating body temperature. Nurses can make maximum use of resources through good organization of the environment. The nurse must continually update her knowledge and use a problem-solving approach in her work. She should record, analyse and share her experiences with others, thus helping to develop more humanistic and scientific modes of care.</ab>

        <ab>It is commonly assumed that elderly patients in long-term care facilities require less total care and less professional care than patients in active 'treatment' settings. However, no objective data have been available to support or refute these assumptions. This study examined patient classification data obtained from eight acute care medical and surgical units and four long-term care geriatric units over a 1-year period. Results indicated that (1) geriatric patients in long-term care units had differing (as opposed to similar) nursing care needs, (2) nursing care requirements of geriatric patients in several long-term care units differed from those of patients in another long-term care unit, (3) geriatric patients in the selected long-term care units required at least as much nursing care as those in the medical surgical units, and (4) the long-term care units had many patients with extensive nursing care requirements but no patients with very complex requirements when compared with the medical/surgical units. The potential impact of these findings on staffing of long-term care units is considerable. Issues relating to reliability, validity and comparability are discussed. There is a great need to utilize standardized, state-of-the-art methods for nursing workload measurement to facilitate comparisons of nursing care requirements of geriatric long-term care patients with those of patients in other areas.</ab>

        <ab>Behavioral techniques are increasingly being applied in the geriatric field as part of a broader emphasis on psychological and social treatments in the care of the elderly. The nurse is in the best position to analyze a patient's performance and manage an intervention program; however, some nurses have had little experience of autonomously diagnosing problems and setting performance goals. The authors argue that it is important to set such goals and give examples of how performance may be objectively specified, prerequisites made explicit, criteria for success defined and the con-sequences of goal attainment or non-attainment discussed with those most concerned. A complex situation drawn from the geriatric setting which was used as part of a teaching workshop to help nurses define suitable targets for intervention is described in the Appendix.</ab>
