        <ab>Recently, many community gathering spaces (CGSs) have been built as platforms for senior citizens to socialize. This study constitutes an ethnographic examination of how senior citizens use a CGS in a public housing complex in Japan. The results depicted six characteristic styles in which senior citizens used the CGS: visiting a park, attending a school, using a library, using a meeting room, shopping for commodities, and participating in events. Frequency of CGS use and group cohesion were two properties that distinguished among the six styles. Moreover, environmental features of the CGS enabled senior citizens with various physical and social conditions to use the CGS.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Few qualitative studies of cancer patients' everyday experiences with pain exist within the large body of cancer pain research. Longitudinal qualitative studies are particularly sparse, and no studies have qualitatively described patients' pain experience over time during participation in a self-management intervention. Objective: To longitudinally describe patients' pain experiences during a 10-week pain self-management intervention. Methods: This qualitative study was embedded in a randomized controlled trial of a psychoeducational pain management intervention. The data consisted of transcribed audio recordings of each intervention session. An emergent, interpretive approach was used in this longitudinal qualitative analysis. Results: Forty-two adult patients were included. The analysis revealed the strikingly dynamic nature of individual patient's pain experiences. Multiple facets of pain contributed to its dynamic nature, including pain in changing locations, co-occurring sources of pain, and varying patterns of pain intensity over time. For individual patients, the cumulative effect of these multiple facets resulted in a phenomenon we termed "complex pain dynamics." Conclusion: The results contribute to knowledge about the dynamic nature of cancer patients' pain experiences over a relatively short period. They suggest the need for a new paradigm for management of pain in cancer patients and raise questions about the interpretation of randomized controlled trial results in the absence of qualitative data. Implications for Practice: Frequent assessments and reassessments of pain are needed in cancer patients with the ongoing development of highly individualized self-management strategies. A large repertoire of interventions is needed to effectively manage pain in cancer patients over time.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To determine the role of ultrasonography in the follow‐up of effectiveness of complex decongestive therapy (CDT) in different subgroups of patients with breast cancer‐related lymphoedema (BCRL). Methods: Forty‐seven patients with unilateral upper BCRL were enrolled in the study. The patient group was divided into two subgroups according to body mass index (BMI) as obese and non‐obese and three subgroups according to International Society of Lymphology staging. All patients underwent CDT, the circumference measurements and ultrasonographic soft tissue thicknesses evaluations were performed at two anatomic sites, and upper extremity limb volumes were calculated using the truncated cone formula before and after CDT. Results: There were significant decreases in both circumferential measurements and ultrasonographic soft tissue thicknesses in non‐obese patients and stage 2 lymphoedema patients after 15 sessions of CDT. The ultrasonographic soft tissue thickness values were correlated with the upper arm and forearm circumference values before (r = 0.491, p &lt;.001, r = 0.841, p &lt;.001, respectively) and after (r = 0.535, p &lt;.001, r = 0.714, p &lt;.001, respectively) CDT. Conclusions: Ultrasonography presents as a reliable method to measure the soft tissue thickness and treatment efficacy after CDT in only non‐obese and stage 2 patients with BCRL.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Lymphoedema is a debilitating condition that results in the swelling of one or more limbs, leading to a significant impairment of mobility. From a psychosocial perspective, body image and quality of life (QoL) are also adversely affected. To date, non-cancer lymphoedema has been under-researched. The primary objectives of this study were to explore QoL and limb volume in patients with primary and secondary non-cancer-related lower limb lymphoedema during the intensive, maintenance and self-care phases of complex decongestive therapy over a 24-week period. Secondary objectives included exploring patients' experiences of living with lymphoedema and the challenges of self-care maintenance. Method: A sequential mixed methodology, using quantitative and qualitative methods, was used. The quantitative part of the study involved the use of tape measurements at 4cm intervals to ascertain limb volume alterations. Measurements were taken during the intensive phase at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4; and during the maintenance phase at weeks 8, 16 and 24. QoL was measured using the lymphoedema QoL (LYMQOL) leg, at baseline and weeks 8 and 24. The qualitative part of the study involved the use of semi-structured interviews with patients at week 8. Interviews explored the experiences of patients living with lymphoedema and their experiences of complex decongestive therapy. Results: A total of 20 patients were recruited, two male and 18 female, with a mean age of 58.8 years (standard deviation (SD): 16 years), and all receiving complex decongestive therapy. At baseline, for all patients, the mean QoL score was 4.3 (SD: 2.4); and 8 (SD: 1.5) after 8 weeks of complex decongestive therapy. Mean difference was 4.00 (95% confidence interval: 2.76--5.24; p=0.00001) indicating a positive treatment effect. Limb volume measurements demonstrated a reduction in oedema from baseline to week 8. However, there were fluctuations in limb volume over the maintenance period of four months after treatment as the patients endeavoured to engage in self-care. Analysis of the interviews identified themes pertaining to lack of knowledge of lymphoedema among health professionals, a negative impact of living with lymphoedema and the positive therapeutic effect of complex decongestive therapy. Conclusion: Lower limb lymphoedema is a chronic condition that impacts negatively on the individual. Complex decongestive therapy improves QoL and reduces oedema. However, given the fluctuations in oedema post-treatment, individuals need greater support to maintain active engagement in effective self-care strategies. Declaration of interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Globally, stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. With a strong sense of filial responsibility, Asian caregivers are committed to caring for their ill family members. In response, the 3H (Head, Heart, Hands) intervention was developed and implemented in Singapore to support couples in their coping after a stroke. The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of the participants taking part in the 3H intervention and evaluate the intervention after they had participated in it. METHODS: An interpretive descriptive design was used. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 7 patients and 7 spousal caregivers. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: The participants' experience was described as one of becoming more prepared to face the storm. The "storm" resulted from a stroke, where the participants were worried and uncertain about their future. After participating in the intervention, the couples' coping processes had improved. They coped by breaking the silence and engaging in conversations, cultivating a sense of support, and conveniently fulfilling their educational needs. It was evaluated that extending the 3H intervention for community nursing is necessary to strengthen the care transition of couples fromthe hospital to home. CONCLUSION: Newknowledge has been gained that the 3H intervention is useful andmay be implemented in a clinical context before a patient's discharge from hospital. As a result of participating in the 3H intervention, effective coping was evident where participants engaged in conversations, cultivated a sense of support, and fulfilled their educational needs. Primary healthcare professionals should pay more attention to the difficulties and needs of this group of people, provide more resources to support them, and improve their quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Overburdened hospital clinics can have adverse outcomes. Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness and patient acceptability of an integrated model of complex type 2 diabetes care delivered in a community‐based general practice by upskilled general practitioners (GP) co‐located with an endocrinologist and diabetes nurse educator. Methods: Patients transferred from hospital clinic lists or referred by local GP were assessed in two southern Perth practices. An upskilled GP and endocrinologist developed a management plan which was communicated to the participant's usual GP. Up to two follow‐up visits over 6 months ensured that management was acceptable and effective. Results: A total of 464 people with type 2 diabetes (mean ± standard deviation age = 59.3 ± 13.7 years, 52.2% males) was enrolled. Their mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 9.3% (78 mmol/mol) and their mean body mass index 33.7 kg/m2. Use of injectable blood glucose‐lowering therapies increased between the initial and final visit in association with a median HbA1c reduction of 1.2% (13 mmol/mol) which was sustained to 12 months in assessable participants. There were also reductions in blood pressure, and serum low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Patient satisfaction with current treatment, time for self‐management, time spent in diabetes‐related appointments and diabetes knowledge increased significantly. Non‐attendance for scheduled appointments was &lt;10%. Local hospital referrals and waiting lists reduced over the study period. Conclusions: This study confirms the value of integrated community‐based care of complex type 2 diabetes which could represent a sustainable solution to overburdened hospital diabetes outpatient clinics.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This pilot study assessed feasibility of video‐enhanced care management for complex older veterans with suspected mild cognitive impairment (CI) and their care partners, compared with telephone delivery. DESIGN: Pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Durham Veterans Affairs Health Care System. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were enrolled as dyads, consisting of veterans aged 65 years or older with complex medical conditions (Care Assessment Need score ≥90) and suspected mild CI (education‐adjusted Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status score 20–31) and their care partners. INTERVENTION: The 12‐week care management intervention consisted of monthly calls from a study nurse covering medication management, cardiovascular disease risk reduction, physical activity, and sleep behaviors, delivered via video compared with telephone. MEASUREMENTS: Dyads completed baseline and follow‐up assessments to assess feasibility, acceptability, and usability. RESULTS: Forty veterans (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age = 72.4 (6.1) years; 100% male; 37.5% Black) and their care partners (mean (SD) age = 64.7 (10.8) years) were enrolled and randomized to telephone or video‐enhanced care management. About a third of veteran participants indicated familiarity with relevant technology (regular tablet use and/or experience with videoconferencing); 53.6% of internet users were comfortable or very comfortable using the internet. Overall, 43 (71.7%) care management calls were completed in the video arm and 52 (86.7%) were completed in the telephone arm. Usability of the video telehealth platform was rated higher for participants already familiar with technology used to deliver the intervention (mean (SD) System Usability Scale scores: 65.0 (17.0) vs 55.6 (19.6)). Veterans, care partners, and study nurses reported greater engagement, communication, and interaction in the video arm. CONCLUSION: Video‐delivered care management calls were feasible and preferred over telephone for some complex older adults with mild CI and their care partners. Future research should focus on understanding how to assess and incorporate patient and family preferences related to uptake and maintenance of video telehealth interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) rely heavily on caregivers for assistance with care. However, we know little about their psychosocial experiences and their needs for support in managing MCC. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of caregivers of older adults living in the community with MCC. Methods: This qualitative study was a secondary analysis of previously collected data from caregivers in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Participants included caregivers of older adults (65 years and older) with three or more chronic conditions. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using Thorne's interpretive description approach. Results: Most of the 47 caregiver participants were female (76.6%), aged 65 years of age or older (61.7%), married (87.2%) and were spouses to the care recipient (68.1%). Caregivers' experiences of caring for community-living older adults with MCC were complex and included: (a) dealing with the demands of caregiving; (b) prioritizing chronic conditions; (c) living with my own health limitations; (d) feeling socially isolated and constrained; (e) remaining committed to caring; and (f) reaping the rewards of caregiving. Conclusions: Healthcare providers can play key roles in supporting caregivers of older adults with MCC by providing education and support on managing MCC, actively engaging them in goal setting and care planning, and linking them to appropriate community health and social support services. Communities can create environments that support caregivers in areas such as social participation, social inclusion, and community support and health services.</ab>

        <ab>This cohort study uses data clustering methods and clinical stakeholder assessment to identify clinical profiles in a population of medically complex patients. Key Points: Question: What distinct clinical profiles can be identified within a population of the most medically complex patients? Findings: In this cohort study of 104 869 individuals, data clustering methods were combined with clinical stakeholder assessment to define clinical profiles within the top 3% most medically complex adult patients in a large integrated care system: high acuity, older with cardiovascular complications, frail elderly, pain management, psychiatric illness, cancer treatment, and less engaged. These profiles had significantly different 1-year health care utilization and mortality, and each profile suggested different adjunctive care strategies. Meaning: The findings suggest that a single care model may not meet the needs of adults with high comorbidity and care utilization. Importance: Medically complex patients are a heterogeneous group that contribute to a substantial proportion of health care costs. Coordinated efforts to improve care and reduce costs for this patient population have had limited success to date. Objective: To define distinct patient clinical profiles among the most medically complex patients through clinical interpretation of analytically derived patient clusters. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed the most medically complex patients within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system, based on comorbidity score, prior emergency department admissions, and predicted likelihood of hospitalization, from July 18, 2018, to July 15, 2019. From a starting point of over 5000 clinical variables, we used both clinical judgment and analytic methods to reduce to the 97 most informative covariates. Patients were then grouped using 2 methods (latent class analysis, generalized low-rank models, with k-means clustering). Results were interpreted by a panel of clinical stakeholders to define clinically meaningful patient profiles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Complex patient profiles, 1-year health care utilization, and mortality outcomes by profile. Results: The analysis included 104 869 individuals representing 3.3% of the adult population (mean [SD] age, 70.7 [14.5] years; 52.4% women; 39% non-White race/ethnicity). Latent class analysis resulted in a 7-class solution. Stakeholders defined the following complex patient profiles (prevalence): high acuity (9.4%), older patients with cardiovascular complications (15.9%), frail elderly (12.5%), pain management (12.3%), psychiatric illness (12.0%), cancer treatment (7.6%), and less engaged (27%). Patients in these groups had significantly different 1-year mortality rates (ranging from 3.0% for psychiatric illness profile to 23.4% for frail elderly profile; risk ratio, 7.9 [95% CI, 7.1-8.8], P &lt;.001). Repeating the analysis using k-means clustering resulted in qualitatively similar groupings. Each clinical profile suggested a distinct collaborative care strategy to optimize management. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that highly medically complex patient populations may be categorized into distinct patient profiles that are amenable to varying strategies for resource allocation and coordinated care interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Controversy exists regarding first-line use of the recently approved reversal agent andexanet alfa due to limitations of the ANEXXA-4 study, thrombotic risks, and high medication acquisition cost. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 4F-PCC for the reversal of emergent oral fXa inhibitor-related bleeding. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate a subgroup using strict ANNEXA-4 patient selection criteria.Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted utilizing chart review of adult patients that received 4F-PCC for oral fXa inhibitor-related bleeding. The primary endpoint was the rate of clinical success defined as achieving excellent or good hemostatic effectiveness following the administration of 4F-PCC. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality and arterial/venous thromboembolism, and cost compared with andexanet alfa.Results: A total of 119 patients were included, with 83 patients in the ANNEXA-4 criteria subgroup. Eighty-five of the 119 patients (71%) required reversal due to intracranial bleeding. Prior to reversal, 70 patients (59%) were taking apixaban and 49 patients (41%) were taking rivaroxaban. Clinical success was achieved in 106 of 119 patients (89%) and 74 of 83 patients (90%) in the strict criteria subgroup. Three of 119 patients (2.5%) had a thrombotic event during hospital stay and the overall mortality rate was 13%. The average cost increase of andexanet alfa compared to 4F-PCC would have been $29,500 per patient.Conclusions: Administration of 4F-PCC for the reversal of oral fXa inhibitors was effective with relatively low thrombotic risk. Further direct prospective comparison of 4F-PCC to andexanet alfa is warranted.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This pilot trial focused on feasibility and safety to provide preliminary data to evaluate the hemostatic potential of cold-stored platelets (2° to 6°C) compared with standard room temperature-stored platelets (20° to 24°C) in adult patients undergoing complex cardiothoracic surgery. This study aimed to assess feasibility and to provide information for future pivotal trials.Methods: A single center two-stage exploratory pilot study was performed on adult patients undergoing elective or semiurgent complex cardiothoracic surgery. In stage I, a two-armed randomized trial, platelets stored up to 7 days in the cold were compared with those stored at room temperature. In the subsequent single-arm stage II, cold storage time was extended to 8 to 14 days. The primary outcome was clinical effect measured by chest drain output. Secondary outcomes were platelet function measured by multiple electrode impedance aggregometry, total blood usage, immediate and long-term (28 days) adverse events, length of stay in intensive care, and mortality.Results: In stage I, the median chest drain output was 720 ml (quartiles 485 to 1,170, n = 25) in patients transfused with room temperature-stored platelets and 645 ml (quartiles 460 to 800, n = 25) in patients transfused with cold-stored platelets. No significant difference was observed. The difference in medians between the room temperature- and cold-stored up to 7 days arm was 75 ml (95% CI, -220, 425). In stage II, the median chest drain output was 690 ml (500 to 1,880, n = 15). The difference in medians between the room temperature arm and the nonconcurrent cold-stored 8 to 14 days arm was 30 ml (95% CI, -1,040, 355). Platelet aggregation in vitro increased after transfusion in both the room temperature- and cold-stored platelet study arms. Total blood usage, number of adverse events, length of stay in intensive care, and mortality were comparable among patients receiving cold-stored and room temperature-stored platelets.Conclusions: This pilot trial supports the feasibility of platelets stored cold for up to 14 days and provides critical guidance for future pivotal trials in high-risk cardiothoracic bleeding patients.Editor’s Perspective: </ab>

        <ab>Aim To explore the perceptions of main caregivers regarding caring for chronic complex patients in two different regions of Spain. Spain is a country with an ageing population and a high number of people with chronic diseases. It is well known that the role of the caregiver is important to ensure quality of life and appropriate care. Qualitative design using focus groups. Five focus groups, from two different regions, were conducted with 22 caregivers of people with chronic complex diseases to explore their personal experience, examine the quality of care received by the patient and their family and to develop strategies for the improvement of the quality of health care. The focus groups were audio and video recorded. The transcriptions of the focus group sessions were exported to qualitative software analysis MAXQDA 2018.2. The qualitative content analysis was based on different analytical cycles. In general terms, caregivers would refer to accepting the care of their family members, but they highlight many negative aspects such as tiredness, lack of help and overload of care. They indicated general satisfaction with the health system but indicated that help was insufficient and that strategies to better address the situations of the complex chronic patient should be improved. The main categories observed were: Conclusions. Complex chronic illnesses are increasingly common at present, generating important consequences on the lives of patients and that of their caregivers. The design of any health strategy for facing the dilemma of chronic illnesses, must necessarily include the vision of the caregivers. • 95% of patients with chronic illnesses live in their home and depend on a caregiver. • Being a caregiver implies a high workload which is assumed in the family context. • Caregivers mostly highlighted the negative impact of caregiving on their physical, mental and emotional health • Health system care for caregivers and chronic patients is still insufficient to meet their needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Assessing outcomes of enhanced Chronic disease Care through patient Education and a value‐baSed formulary Study (ACCESS) is a randomized controlled trial evaluating two interventions targeting barriers to care among those at high risk of cardiovascular disease: copayment elimination for cardioprotective medications, and a tailored self‐management support programme. We designed a process evaluation to better understand participant perspectives on the interventions. Design: We used a qualitative descriptive study design, collecting patient and pharmacist feedback via individual semi‐structured telephone interviews and in‐person focus groups. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. Results: Fifty‐three patients (39 interviews and 14 in two focus groups) and 20 pharmacists participated. Copayment elimination provided quality of life benefits: minimizing the need to 'cut‐back', allowing 'peace of mind' and providing emotional support. Health‐related benefits included: improving adherence to covered medications, and helping to afford non‐covered goods. The only criticism was that not all medications and testing supplies were covered. Patients reported that the educational materials provided helpful information, acted as a reminder, improved confidence, improved adherence to medication, and helped initiate conversations with providers about indicated medication. Some participants felt that the educational materials were repetitive, overly medication‐focused and not tailored enough. Pharmacists felt that their patients benefitted from both interventions, which improved patient adherence and communication with their patients. Conclusion: The success of interventions intended to change behaviour is largely dependent upon participant's feelings that the intervention is helpful. This process evaluation provided insights into participants' perceptions on these interventions. Reception of both was largely positive with a few criticisms noted.</ab>

        <ab>There is optimism about the coming availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, supplies are likely to be limited, at least initially. Thus, various groups have suggested prioritization schemes to allocate limited vaccine supplies.</ab>

        <ab>Background: We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 905 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (IKHC), Tehran, Iran. Methods: COVID-19 patients were recruited based on clinical symptoms and patterns of computed tomography (CT) imaging between February 20 and March 19. All patients were tested for the presence of COVID-19 RNA. The Poisson regression model estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for different parameters. Results: The average age (± standard deviation) was 56.9 (±15.7) years and 61.77% were male. The most common symptoms were fever (93.59%), dry cough (79.78%), and dyspnea (75.69%). Only 43.76% of patients were positive for the RT-PCR COVID-19 test. Prevalence of lymphopenia was 42.9% and more than 90% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or C-reactive protein (CRP). About 11% were severe cases, and 13.7% died in the hospital. The median length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. We found higher risks of mortality in patients who were older than 70 years (IRR = 11.77, 95% CI 3.63--38.18), underwent mechanical ventilation (IRR = 7.36, 95% CI 5.06--10.7), were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (IRR = 5.47, 95% CI 4.00--8.38), tested positive on the COVID-19 test (IRR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.64--3.55), and reported a history of comorbidity (IRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.07--2.89) compared to their corresponding reference groups. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was not associated with mortality in our study. Conclusion: Older age, experiencing a severe form of the disease, and having a comorbidity were the most important prognostic factors for COVID-19 infection. Larger studies are needed to perform further subgroup analyses and verify high-risk groups.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. The aim of this study was to describe emergent approaches to integrated care for older people with complex care needs and investigate the viability of measuring integrated care. Methods. A case study approach was used. Sites were recruited following discussion with senior staff in health and social care agencies. Service arrangements were categorised using a framework developed by the researchers. To investigate joint working within the sites, the development model for integrated care was adapted and administered to the manager of each service. Data were collected in 2018. Results. Six case study sites were recruited illustrating adult social care services partnerships in services for older people with home care providers, mental health and community nursing services. Most were established in 2018. Service arrangements were characterised by joint assessment and informal face-to-face discussions between staff. The development of an infrastructure to promote partnership working was evident between adult social care and each of the other services and most developed with home care providers. There was little evidence of a sequential approach to the development of integrated working practices. Conclusion. Components of partnerships promoting integrated care have been highlighted and understanding of the complexity of measuring integrated care enhanced. Means of information sharing and work force development require further consideration.</ab>

        <ab>The number of older people living with complex health conditions is increasing, with the majority of these managed in primary and community settings. Many models of care have been developed to support them, however, there is mixed evidence on their value and they include multiple overlapping components. We aimed to synthesise the evidence to learn what works for managing complex conditions in older people in primary and community care. We carried out a state‐of‐the‐art review of systematic reviews. We searched three databases (January 2009 to July 2019) for models of primary and community care for long‐term conditions, frailty, multimorbidity and complex neurological conditions common to older people such as dementia. We narratively synthesised review findings to summarise the evidence for each model type and identify components which influenced effectiveness. Out of 2,129 unique titles and abstracts, 178 full texts were reviewed and 54 systematic reviews were included. We found that the models of care were more likely to improve depressive symptoms and mental health outcomes than physical health or service use outcomes. Interventions including self‐management, patient education, assessment with follow‐up care procedures, and structured care processes or pathways had greater evidence of effectiveness. The level of healthcare service integration appeared to be more important than inclusion of specific professional types within a team. However, more experienced and qualified nurses were associated with better outcomes. These conclusions are limited by the overlap between reviews, reliance on vote counting within some included reviews and the quality of study reports. In conclusion, primary and community care interventions for complex conditions in older people should include: (a) clear intervention targets; (b) explicit theoretical underpinnings; and (c) elements of self‐management and patient education, structured collaboration between healthcare professionals and professional support. Further work needs to determine the optimal intensity, length, team composition and role of technology in interventions.</ab>

        <ab>The U.S. population is aging, supported in part by continued development of life-prolonging medical therapies and technologies. These innovations, including kidney replacement therapies, have been effective in providing additional options to patients facing serious illness, but they have also introduced a new level of complexity in the provider assessment of treatment for these patients. Health care providers are being tasked to decide if medical care is appropriate for an aging and medically complex population, a decision complicated by a variety of factors. Patient-focused conversations surrounding goals of care, prognosis, medical futility, and quality of life need to become part of the routine practice pattern for nephrology care in the United States.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Mapping the genetic diversity of MTBC in high TB burden country like Ethiopia is important to understand principles of the disease transmission and to strengthen the regional TB control program. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates circulating in the South Omo, southern Ethiopia.Methods: MTBC isolates (N = 156) were genetically analyzed using spacer oligotyping (spoligotyping) and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Major lineages and lineages were identified using MTBC databases. Logistic regression was used to correlate patient characteristics with strain clustering.Results: The study identified Euro-American (EA), East-African-Indian (EAI), Indo-Oceanic (IO), Lineage_7/Aethiops vertus, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium africanum major lineages in proportions of 67.3% (105/156), 22.4% (35/156), 6.4% (10/156), 1.9% (3/156), 1.3% (2/156) and 0.6% (1/156), respectively. Lineages identified were Delhi/CAS 23.9% (37/155), Ethiopia_2 20.6% (32/155), Haarlem 14.2% (22/155), URAL 14.2%(22/155), Ethiopia_3 8.4% (13/155), TUR 6.5% (10/155), Lineage_7/Aethiops vertus 1.9% (3/155), Bovis 1.3% (2/155), LAM 1.3% (2/155), EAI 0.6% (1/155), X 0.6% (1/155) and Ethiopia H37Rv-like strain 0.6% (1/155). Of the genotyped isolates 5.8% (9/155) remained unassigned. The recent transmission index (RTI) was 3.9%. Orphan strains compared to shared types (AOR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04-0.25) were associated with reduced odds of clustering. The dominant TB lineage in pastoral areas was EAI and in non-pastoral areas was EA.Conclusion: The epidemiological data, highly diverse MTBC strains and a low RTI in South Omo, provide information contributing to the TB Control Program of the country.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Detecting infection in frail elderly is a challenge due to lack of specific signs and symptoms. We highlight the complex situation when an elderly woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system.Methods: A descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is explored in the discussion.Results: The latent content analysis of the daughter's story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women recovers quickly.Conclusion: The healthcare system should embrace the complexity in the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage "correctly" for later placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption of complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Chronic diseases are the leading contributor to the excess morbidity and mortality burden experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter, respectfully, Indigenous) people, compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. The Home-based Outreach case Management of chronic disease Exploratory (HOME) Study provided person-centred, multidisciplinary care for Indigenous people with chronic disease. This model of care, aligned to Indigenous peoples' conceptions of health and wellbeing, was integrated within an urban Indigenous primary health care service. We aimed to determine the impact of this model of care on participants' health and wellbeing at 12 months.Methods: HOME Study participants were Indigenous, regular patients of the primary health care service, with a diagnosis of at least one chronic disease, and complex health and social care needs. Data were collected directly from participants and from their medical records at baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 months thereafter. Variables included self-rated health status, depression, utilisation of health services, and key clinical outcomes. Participants' baseline characteristics were described using frequencies and percentages. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were employed to evaluate participant attrition and changes in outcome measures over time.Results: 60 participants were enrolled into the study and 37 (62%) completed the 12-month assessment. After receiving outreach case management for 12 months, 73% of participants had good, very good or excellent self-rated health status compared with 33% at baseline (p &lt; 0.001) and 19% of participants had depression compared with 44% at baseline (p = 0.03). Significant increases in appointments with allied health professionals (p &lt; 0.001) and medical specialists other than general practitioners (p = 0.001) were observed at 12-months compared with baseline rates. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased over time (p = 0.02), but there were no significant changes in mean HbA1c, body mass index, or diastolic blood pressure.Conclusions: The HOME Study model of care was predicated on a holistic conception of health and aimed to address participants' health and social care needs. The positive changes in self-rated health and rates of depression evinced that this aim was met, and that participants received the necessary care to support and improve their health and wellbeing.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate trends in the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries cared for by nurse practitioners from 2012 to 2017, to characterize beneficiaries cared for by nurse practitioners in 2017, and to examine how the percentage of beneficiaries cared for by nurse practitioners varies by practice characteristics.Design: An observational study of 2012-2017 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries' ambulatory visits. We computed the percentage of beneficiaries with 1 or more ambulatory visits from nurse practitioners and the percentage of beneficiaries receiving the plurality of their ambulatory visits from a nurse practitioner versus a physician (ie, predominant provider). We compared beneficiary demographics, clinical characteristics, and utilization by the predominant provider. We then characterized the predominant provider by practice characteristics.Key Results: In 2017, 28.9% of beneficiaries received any care from a nurse practitioner and 8.0% utilized nurse practitioners as their predominant provider-an increase from 4.4% in 2012. Among beneficiaries cared for by nurse practitioners in 2017, 25.9% had 3 or more chronic conditions compared with 20.8% of those cared for by physicians. Beneficiaries cared for in practices owned by health systems were more likely to have a nurse practitioner as their predominant provider compared with those attending practices that were independently owned (9.3% vs. 7.0%).Conclusions: Nurse practitioners are caring for Medicare beneficiaries with complex needs at rates that match or exceed their physician colleagues. The growing role of nurse practitioners, especially in health care systems, warrants attention as organizations embark on payment and delivery reform.</ab>

        <ab>Chronic enterocutaneous fistulas present an extensive range of issues and require a multidisciplinary approach to effectively manage and treat. As a stomal therapy nurse involved in the care of the patient with an enterocutaneous fistula, it is often a requirement to be creative in our management approach and rely on the resources and expertise of our professional colleagues. Progress can be slow and frustrating, and it is important to keep the patient's wellbeing and dignity central during this challenging time. At times, there may be setbacks and this can be difficult to not only the stomal therapy nurse but the entire healthcare team. It is imperative to gain the trust of patient and reassure them that, although slow, progress and improvements will be made. The enterocutaneous fistula is confronting both emotionally and physically for the patient and their family; a comforting, caring and professional approach is paramount.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Triage functions to quickly prioritize care and sort patients by anticipated resource needs. Despite widespread use of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), there is still no universal standard for emergency department (ED) triage. Thus, it can be difficult to objectively assess national trends in ED acuity and resource requirements. We sought to derive an ESI from National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) survey items (NHAMCS-ESI) and to assess the performance of this index with respect to stratifying outcomes, including hospital admission, waiting times, and ED length of stay (LOS). Methods: We used data from the 2010-2015 NHAMCS, to create a measure of ED visit complexity based on variables within NHAMCS. We used NHAMCS data on chief complaint, vitals, resources used, interventions, and pain level to group ED visits into five levels of acuity using a stepwise algorithm that mirrored ESI. In addition, we examined associations of NHAMCS-ESI with typical indicators of acuity such as waiting time, LOS, and disposition. The NHAMCS-ESI categorization was also compared against the “immediacy” variable across all of these outcomes. Visit counts used weighted scores to estimate national levels of ED visits. Results: The NHAMCS ED visits represent an estimated 805,726,000 ED visits over this time period. NHAMCS-ESI categorized visits somewhat evenly, with most visits (42.5%) categorized as a level 3. The categorization pattern is distinct from that of the “immediacy” variable within NHAMCS. Of admitted patients, 89% were categorized as NHAMCS-ESI level 2-3. Median ED waiting times increased as NHAMCS-ESI levels decreased in acuity (from approximately 14 minutes to 25 minutes). Median LOS decreased as NHAMCS-ESI decreased from almost 200 minutes for level 1 patients to nearly 80 minutes for level 5 patients. Conclusion: We derived an objective tool to measure an ED visit’s complexity and resource use. This tool can be validated and used to compare complexity of ED visits across hospitals and regions, and over time.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Joint contractures in frail older people are associated with serious restrictions in participation. We developed the Participation Enabling CAre in Nursing (PECAN) intervention, a complex intervention to enable nurses to promote participation in nursing home residents with joint contractures. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of the implementation strategy and to identify enablers and barriers for a successful implementation.Methods: The implementation of PECAN was investigated in a 6-month pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial (c-RCT). As a key component of the implementation strategy, nominated nurses were trained as facilitators in a one-day workshop and supported by peer-mentoring (visit, telephone counselling). A mixed-methods approach was conducted in conjunction with the pilot trial and guided by a framework for process evaluations of c-RCTs. Data were collected using standardised questionnaires (nursing staff), documentation forms, problem-centred qualitative interviews (facilitators, therapists, social workers, relatives, peer-mentors), and a group discussion (facilitators). A set of predefined criteria on the nursing home level was examined. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using directed content analysis.Results: Seven nursing homes (n = 4 intervention groups, n = 3 control groups) in two regions of Germany took part in the study. Facilitators responded well to the qualification measures (workshop participation: 14/14; workshop rating: "good"; peer-mentor visit participation: 10/14). The usage of peer-mentoring via telephone varied (one to seven contacts per nursing home). Our implementation strategy was not successful in connection with supplying the intervention to all the nurses. The clear commitment of the entire nursing home and the respect for the expertise of different healthcare professionals were emphasised as enablers, whereas a lack of impact on organisational conditions and routines and a lack of time and staff competence were mentioned as barriers.Conclusion: The PECAN intervention was delivered as planned to the facilitators but was unable to produce comprehensive changes in the nursing homes and subsequently for the residents. Strategies to systematically include the management and the nursing team from the beginning are needed to support the facilitators during implementation in the main trial.Trial Registration: German clinical trials register, DRKS00010037 .

        <ab>Background: Prolonged diagnosis intervals occur more often in rare cancers, such as sarcoma. Patients with a delayed diagnosis may require more radical surgery and have a reduced chance of survival. Previous research has focused on quantifying the time taken to achieve a diagnosis without exploring the reasons for potential delays. The aim of this study was to explore patients', carers', and health professionals' perceived barriers to timely diagnosis and referral for treatment for sarcoma.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with: health professionals working with sarcoma (n = 21); patients who have been diagnosed with sarcoma (n = 22); and carers of patients diagnosed with sarcoma (n = 17). Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Four overarching themes were identified: patient perception of symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, lack of experience, and availability of health services. Diagnosis was prolonged by the limited availability of health services, lack of prompt referrals to a sarcoma specialist centre, and diagnostic challenges. Intervals also occurred when patients underestimated the severity of their symptoms and did not seek prompt medical consultation.Conclusions: Patients with a potential sarcoma need to be promptly referred to a sarcoma specialist centre and additional diagnosis pathways need to be developed to reduce the rate of patients being referred to wrong specialists. Sarcoma education must be embedded in medical courses and professional development curricula. A public health approach should be taken to improve sarcoma knowledge and health seeking behaviours in the community.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the remaining abilities of people with dementia (PwD) in performing daily activities. Method: Informal carers of community-residing PwD were recruited across England via mail out and carer support groups. Carers completed the revised Interview for Deteriorations in Daily Living Activities in Dementia 2 to rate the PwD's initiative and performance of daily activities. Six complex instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) were selected: shopping, preparing a hot drink, using the telephone, preparing a cold meal, house work, and engaging in social activities, all of which were broken down into three sub-tasks. Data were analysed using Chi-square tests and linear regression analysis, assessing the contributions of hours of IADL care, hours of supervision, and dementia stage for each activity. Results: 581 carers of people with mild, moderate, and severe dementia completed the questionnaire. The ability to perform individual activities deteriorated from mild to moderate to severe dementia, with PwD remaining the most able to perform subtasks of preparing a hot drink and a cold meal. Subtask performance varied across activities, with some better maintained than others across severity stages. Linear regression models showed that hours of supervising PwD explained a greater proportion of the variance of each IADL than IADL care hours. Conclusion: PwD should be supervised to continue engaging in activities, thereby avoiding performing everything for the PwD. Findings can have implications for PwD living in nursing homes, and future research should explore the remaining IADL abilities of nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (AMNs) are a rare and complex spectrum of disease involving a mucinous tumor within the appendix, which can range from benign to malignant. If not limited to the appendix, the mucinous tumor can spread diffusely throughout the peritoneum. OBJECTIVES: Because of the low incidence of AMN, this study describes the diagnosis and treatment process for this disease, which is not well known to most care providers. METHODS: An extensive analysis of the current literature, including incidence, diagnosis, and surgical treatment, was performed. A review of the pre- and postoperative needs for patients undergoing surgery was also conducted. FINDINGS: There is minimal information in the nursing literature about AMN and the complexity of surgical management. Nurses play an important role in caring for these patients and their unique needs both before and after surgery.</ab>

        <ab>Emergency department (ED) nurses need to identify patients with potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rapidly because treatment delay could impact patient outcomes. Aims of this secondary analysis were to identify key patient factors that could be available at initial ED nurse triage that predict ACS. Consecutive patients with chest pain who called 9‐1‐1, received a 12‐lead electrocardiogram in the prehospital setting, and were transported via emergency medical service were included in the study. A total of 750 patients were recruited. The sample had an average age of 59 years old, was 57% male, and 40% Black. One hundred and fifteen patients were diagnosed with ACS. Older age, non‐Caucasian race, and faster respiratory rate were independent predictors of ACS. There was an interaction between heart rate by Type II diabetes receiving insulin in the context of ACS. Type II diabetics requiring insulin for better glycemic control manifested a faster heart rate. By identifying patient factors at ED nurse triage that could be predictive of ACS, accuracy rates of triage may improve, thus impacting patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To assess the feasibility of a patient-centered complex intervention for multimorbidity (CIM) based on general practice in collaboration with community health-care centers and outpatient clinics. Methods: Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, diagnoses of two or more of three chronic conditions (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic heart conditions), and a hospital contact during the previous year. The CIM included extended consultations and nurse care manager support in general practice and intensified cross-sectorial collaboration. Elements included a structured care plan based on patients' care goals, coordination of services, and, if appropriate, shifting outpatient clinic visits to general practice, medication review, referral to rehabilitation, and home care. The acceptability dimension of feasibility was assessed with validated questionnaires, observations, and focus groups. Results: Forty-eight patients were included (mean age 72.2 (standard deviation (SD) 9.5, range 52–89); 23 (48%) were men. Thirty-seven patients had two diseases; most commonly COPD and cardiovascular disease (46%), followed by diabetes and cardiovascular disease (23%), and COPD and diabetes (15%). Eleven (23%) patients had all three conditions. Focus group interviews with patients with multimorbidity identified three main themes: (1) lack of care coordination existed across health-care sectors before the CIM, (2) extended consultations provided better care coordination, and (3) patients want to be involved in planning their treatment and care. In focus groups, health-care professionals discussed two main themes: (1) patient-centered care and (2) culture and organizational change. Completion rates for questionnaires were 98% (47/48). Conclusions: Patients and health-care professionals found the CIM acceptable.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 31% of all global deaths. Primary prevention strategies are needed to improve longer-term adherence to statins and healthy lifestyle behaviours to reduce risk in people at risk of cardiovascular disease.Methods: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial recruited between May 2016 and March 2017 from primary care practices, England. Participants (n = 212) prescribed statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with total cholesterol level ≥ 5 mmol/l were randomised: 105 to the intervention group and 107 to the control group, stratified by age and sex. The 3R intervention involved two facilitated, structured group education sessions focusing on medication adherence to statins, lifestyle behaviours and cardiovascular risk, with 44 weeks of medication reminders and motivational text messages and two supportive, coaching phone calls (at approximately 2 weeks and 6 months). The control group continued with usual clinical care. Both groups received a basic information leaflet. The primary outcome was medication adherence to statins objectively measured by a biochemical urine test. Self-reported adherence and practice prescription data provided additional measures. Secondary outcomes included cholesterol profile, blood pressure, anthropometric data, cardiovascular risk score, and self-reported lifestyle behaviours and psychological measures (health/medication beliefs, quality of life, health status). All outcomes were assessed at 12 months.Results: Baseline adherence to statins was 47% (control) and 62% (intervention). No significant difference between the groups found for medication adherence to statins using either the urine test (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.06, P = 0.968) or other measures. This may have been due to the higher than expected adherence levels at baseline. The adjusted mean difference between the groups (in favour of the intervention group) for diastolic blood pressure (- 4.28 mmHg (95% CI - 0.98 to - 1.58, P = 0.002)) and waist circumference (- 2.55 cm (95% CI - 4.55 to - 0.55, P = 0.012)). The intervention group also showed greater perceived control of treatment and more coherent understanding of the condition.Conclusions: The 3R programme successfully led to longer-term improvements in important clinical lifestyle indicators but no improvement in medication adherence, raising questions about the suitability of such a broad, multiple risk factor approach for improving medication adherence for primary prevention of CVD.Trial Registration: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN16863160), March 11, 2006.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To analyze, quantify, and redefine the anatomy of the peripheral attachments of the lateral meniscal body to further understand how the structures might play a part in preventing meniscal extrusion and how it might be applied to surgical techniques.Methods: Ten nonpaired fresh-frozen cadaveric knees without prior injury, a surgical history, or gross anatomic abnormality were included. There were 5 right and 5 left knees, and 50% were from male donors and 50% were from female donors. All the dissections were performed by a group of 3 experts in knee surgery (2 knee surgeons and 1 anatomy professor who oversaw the design of the dissection protocol and guided this protocol). The main peripheral structures associated with the lateral meniscus body were dissected to determine the insertion, size, thickness, and location of the lateral meniscotibial ligament (LMTL), popliteofibular ligament (PFL), and popliteomeniscal ligament (PML). The distance to various landmarks in the lateral compartment was also determined using an electronic caliper. Moreover, a histopathologic study was carried out.Results: The average thickness of the LMTL was 0.62 ± 0.18 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.75 mm); that of the PFL-PML area was 1.05 ± 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.85-1.24 mm). The anteroposterior distance measured 15.80 ± 4.80 mm (95% CI, 12.40-19.30 mm) for the LMTL and 10.40 ± 1.70 mm (95% CI, 9.21-11.63 mm) for the PFL-PML area. The anteroposterior distance of the whole menisco-tibio-popliteus-fibular complex (MTPFC) was 28.20 ± 4.95 mm (95% CI, 24.70-31.70 mm). The average distance from the MTPFC to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscal root was 29.30 ± 2.29 mm (95% CI, 27.60-30.90 mm), whereas that to the anterior horn was 32.00 ± 4.80 mm (95% CI, 28.60-35.50 mm). The average distance from the tibial insertion of the LMTL to the articular surface was 5.59 ± 1.22 mm (95% CI, 4.72-6.46 mm). In all the anatomic components of the knee, a consistent morphologic and histologic pattern was observed between the fibers of the LMTL, PFL, and PML and those of the lateral meniscal body, making up the proposed MTPFC.Conclusions: A consistent anatomic pattern has been identified between the lateral meniscal body and the LMTL, PFL, and PML, forming an interconnected complex that would seem appropriate to denominate the MTPFC. A precise study of this region and appropriate nomenclature for it could contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of lateral meniscal injuries at this level, as well as the development of surgical techniques to treat these lesions and prevent extrusion.Clinical Relevance: This study contributes to the understanding of the lateral meniscal body attachments and the functions they serve. This will lead to improvements in the treatment of lesions in this region, including the development of surgical techniques.</ab>

        <ab>• A residual clinical instability and functional deficit is fully expected for patients discharge from ICU. • Patients at high risk for adverse events can be effectively identified before ICU discharge based on routinely collected data. • The level of acuity and nursing complexity can independently predict the risk of adverse events. • Using such information to support the discharge decision-making could prevent adverse events and improve patient's outcome. Patients discharged from intensive care units (ICUs) are at risk for adverse events (AEs). Establishing safe discharge criteria is challenging. No available criteria consider nursing complexity among risk factors. To investigate whether nursing complexity upon ICU discharge is an independent predictor for AEs. Prospective observational study. The Patient Acuity and Complexity Score (PACS) was developed to measure nursing complexity. Its predictive power for AEs was tested using multivariate regression analysis. The final regression model showed a very-good discrimination power (AUC 0.881; p &lt;0.001) for identifying patients who experienced AEs. Age, ICU admission reason, PACS, cough strength, PaCO 2 , serum creatinine and sodium, and transfer to Internal Medicine showed to be predictive of AEs. Exceeding the identified PACS threshold increased by 3.3 times the AEs risk. The level of nursing complexity independently predicts AEs risk and should be considered in establishing patient's eligibility for a safe ICU discharge.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Elderly patients with multiple health problems often experience disease complications and functional failure, resulting in a need for health care across different health care systems during care trajectory. The patients' perspective of the care trajectory has been insufficiently described, and thus there is a need for new insights and understanding. The study aims to explore how elderly patients with complex health problems engage in and interact with their care trajectory across different health care systems where several health care personnel are involved.Methods: The study had an explorative design with a qualitative multi-case approach. Eleven patients (n = 11) aged 65-91 years participated. Patients were recruited from two hospitals in Norway. Observations and repeated interviews were conducted during patients' hospital stays, discharge and after they returned to their homes. A thematic analysis method was undertaken.Results: Patients engaged and positioned themselves in the care trajectory according to three identified themes: 1) the patients constantly considered opportunities and alternatives for handling the different challenges and situations they faced; 2) patients searched for appropriate alliance partners to support them and 3) patients sometimes circumvented the health care initiation of planned steps and took different directions in their care trajectory.Conclusions: The patients' considerations of their health care needs and adjustments to living arrangements are constant throughout care trajectories. These considerations are often long term, and the patient engagement in and management of their care trajectory is not associated with particular times or situations. Achieving consistency between the health care system and the patient's pace in the decision-making process may lead to a more appropriate level of health care in line with the patient's preferences and goals.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine agreement between administrative and self-reported data on the number of and constituent chronic conditions (CCs) used to measure multimorbidity. Study Design and Setting: Cross-sectional self-reported survey data from four Canadian Community Health Survey waves were linked to administrative data for residents of Ontario, Canada. Agreement for each of 12 CCs was assessed using kappa (κ) statistics. For the overall number of CCs, perfect agreement was defined as agreement on both the number and constituent CCs. Jackknife methods were used to assess the impact of individual CCs on perfect agreement. Results: The level of chance-adjusted agreement between self-report and administrative data for individual CCs varied widely, from κ = 5.5% (inflammatory bowel disease) to κ = 77.5% (diabetes), and there was no clear pattern on whether using administrative data or self-reported data led to higher prevalence estimates. Only 26.9% of participants had perfect agreement on the number and constituent CCs; 10.6% agreed on the number but not constituent CCs. The impact of each CC on perfect agreement depended on both the level of agreement and the prevalence of the individual CC. Conclusion: Our results show that measuring agreement on multimorbidity is more complex than for individual CCs and that even small levels of individual condition disagreement can have a large impact on the agreement on the number of CCs.</ab>

        <ab>In the last 2-3 decades internists have confronted dramatic changes in the pattern of patients acutely admitted to hospital wards. Internists observed a shift from younger subjects affected by a single organ disease to more complex patients, usually older, with multiple chronic conditions, attended by different specialists, with poor integration and treated with multiple drugs. In this regard, the concept of complex patients is addressed daily in clinical practice even if there is no agreed definition of patient complexity. To try to evaluate clinical complexity different instruments have been proposed. Among these, the number of comorbidities (NoC) was considered a marker of clinical complexity. However, this instrument would not give information about the clinical relevance of each condition. On the contrary, cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) addresses the problem calculating both CIRS severity index (CIRS-SI) and CIRS comorbidity index (CIRS-CI). In light of this, 4714 patients from the RePoSI register were retrospectively analyzed to show if CIRS assessment of comorbidity burden is different from the simple count of comorbidities in predicting the length of hospital stay (LOS) and all-cause of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients and if NoC could be a valid tool to measure patient's complexity. CIRS-SI resulted the best predictor of all-cause in-hospital mortality [OR: 2.66 (1.88-3.77)] in comparison with NoC that did not result statistically significant (p = 0.551). CIRS-SI was also the best predictor of all-cause of post-discharge mortality corrected for age and sex [OR: 2.12 (1.53-2.95)]. CIRS-SI (coefficient ± standard error: 1.23 ± 0.59; p &lt; 0.0381) and CIRS-CI (coefficient ± standard error: 0.27 ± 0.10; p &lt; 0.011) were strong predictors of LOS in comparison with NoC that did not result statistically significant (coefficient ± standard error: 0.04 ± 0.06 p &lt; 0.0561). In conclusion, CIRS assessment of comorbidity burden is a better clinical tool in comparison with the simple count of comorbidities especially considering the length of hospital stay and all-cause mortality in hospitalized elderly patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Aim: Anterior mediastinal masses which invade the great vessels and heart are rare. We report a case of a 76-year-old male presenting with a large invasive anterior mediastinal mass following recent cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement via sternotomy).Materials and Methods: This is a case report study with clinical patient information retrieved from hospital electronic records.Results: Computed tomography scanning revealed a large heterogeneous 6.5 × 7.2 × 7.0 cm right anterior mediastinal mass. The mass directly propagated via the left innominate vein into the superior vena cava (SVC) and proximal right atrium. The patient underwent redo sternotomy with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic circulatory arrest to remove the mass. The mass was sitting in the right pleural cavity and was adherent to the right lung and pericardium. Tumor material was removed from the right atrium, SVC and left innominate vein. The mass was excised en bloc along with a portion of the upper lobe of the right lung.Discussion and Conclusion: Histology of the mass revealed the diagnosis of invasive type A thymoma with transvenous and transcardiac invasion. We advocate for surgeons to be aggressive in their operative resection of such tumours to ensure the best prognostic outlook for the patient.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES The main objective of the study was to investigate annual changes in the sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, and functional status of new nursing home residents in Ontario, Canada, between 2000 and 2015. A secondary objective was to develop and assess the quality of an algorithm for ascertaining admissions into publicly funded nursing homes in Ontario using a combination of health administrative data sources that indirectly identifies the residential status of new nursing home residents. DESIGN Population‐based serial cross‐sectional study with an accompanying quality assessment study of algorithms. SETTING Publicly funded nursing care homes in Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS The reference standard for the assessment of algorithm performance was 21 544 newly admitted nursing home residents identified from the Resident Assessment Instrument‐Minimum Data Set in 2012. The selected algorithm was then used to identify serial cross‐sectional cohorts of newly admitted residents between 2000 and 2015 that ranged in size between 14 651 and 23 630 residents. MEASUREMENTS Sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, and functional status of new residents were determined upon admission to examine patterns in the cohorts' profiles. RESULTS: The proportion of residents aged 85 years and older increased from 45.1% to 53.8% over 16 years. The proportions of individuals with seven or more chronic conditions (from 14.1% to 22.1%) and with nine or more prescription medications (from 44.9% to 64.2%) have also increased in parallel over time. Hypertension, osteoarthritis, and dementia were the most prevalent conditions captured, with the proportion of incoming residents with dementia increasing from 42.3% to 54.1% between 2000 and 2015. Newly admitted residents were more likely to have extensive physical and cognitive impairments upon admission. CONCLUSION: Admission trends show that new residents were older and had greater multimorbidity and limitations in physical functioning over time. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1293–1300, 2020.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Clinical work in the operating room (OR) is considered challenging as it is complex, dynamic, and often time- and resource-constrained. Important characteristics for successful management of complexity include adaptations and adaptive coordination when managing expected and unexpected events. However, there is a lack of explorative research addressing what makes things go well and how OR staff describe they do when responding to challenges and compensating for constraints. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how complexity is managed as expressed by operating room nurses, registered nurse anesthetists, and surgeons, and how these professionals adapt to create safe care in the OR.Method: Data for this qualitative explorative study were collected via group interviews with three professional groups of the OR-team, including operating room nurses, registered nurse anesthetists and operating and assisting surgeons in four group interview sessions, one for each profession except for ORNs for which two separate interviews were performed. The audio-taped transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by inductive qualitative content analysis.Results: The findings revealed three generic categories covering ways of creating safe care in the OR: preconditions and resources, planning and preparing for the expected and unexpected, and adapting to the unexpected. In each generic category, one sub-category emerged that was common to all three professions: coordinating and reaffirming information, creating a plan for the patient and undergoing mental preparation, and prioritizing and solving upcoming problems, respectively.Conclusion: Creating safe care in the OR should be understood as a process of planning and preparing in order to manage challenging and complex work processes. OR staff need preconditions and resources such as having experience and coordinating and reaffirming information, to make sense of different situations. This requires a mental model, which is created through planning and preparing in different ways. Some situations are repetitive and easier to plan for but planning for the unexpected requires anticipation from experience. The main results strengthen that abilities described in the theory of resilience are used by OR staff as a strategy to manage complexity in the OR.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Over the past 3 decades there have been significant advances in the development of pharmaceutical and rehabilitative treatments for persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), such that life expectancy is continuing to increase. As a result of these advancements, there is a "graying" phenomenon within the global MS population and a demographic shift of the aging landscape. While these advancements are exciting, there also concerns and unknowns regarding what it is like to age with MS. Objectives: The objectives of this research were to explore the experiences of aging in conjunction with having MS, and the different ways persons older than 60 with MS interpreted this phenomenon. Methods: Semistructured interviews with 40 persons with MS older than 60 years were conducted. Thereafter data were subject to a pluralistic analysis approach utilizing phenomenological and narrative traditions. Results: This research highlighted the complexity of aging with MS and the various ways persons older than 60 with MS experience and interpret this phenomenon. Most participants experienced a continued progression of physical and cognitive deficits, however aging narratives and what is culturally expected as a person older than 60 allowed for positive interpretations of this stage of life. For example, participants diagnosed in early adulthood stated having health problems was "normal" over 60, resulting in a sense of belonging that they had not experienced since being diagnosed. Some participants also perceived they were aging more successfully than peers without MS as they had engaged in healthenhancing behaviors from an earlier age, while others believed they had "aged out" of MS and were experiencing a peak of health and wellness. Participants who were diagnosed in middle age, however, noted a sharp progression of age-related and MS symptoms, but stated "everyone has something" and perceived the diagnosis of MS was less impactful in older age with regards to what is expected at this life stage. Concerns remained, however, regarding whether a new physical or cognitive experience was aging or MS, what the future holds regarding losing independence, losing spouses and caregivers, and growing "too old" such that quality of life is completely diminished. Conclusions: This qualitative research has highlighted the complexity of aging with MS. All participants noted a continued progression of health, physical function, and cognitive ability but stated that they felt a sense of normality and were living a life that culturally aligned with aging narratives. Fears about the future do remain as participants were concerned about living too long for being able to thrive. More research must be done that focuses on maintaining quality of life among older person with MS as quantity of life continues to increase.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: This study aimed to (1) quantitatively analyze the fibular footprints of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) and (2) evaluate whether a fibular tunnel can restore the LCL and PFL fibular footprints simultaneously without modification in anatomic posterolateral corner reconstruction of the knee.Methods: In 20 cadaveric knees, anatomic characteristics, such as diameter, location and relationship with anatomic landmarks, of the LCL and PFL footprints were analyzed. Subsequently, a fibular tunnel that connected the LCL and PFL footprint centers was created with 1.5 mm drill bit, and tunnel depth, which is defined as the distance between the tunnel and the nearest cortex, was evaluated. An additional tunnel from the anteroinferior border of the LCL footprint to the posteroinferior border of the PFL footprint was created, and its tunnel depth was evaluated as well and compared with that of the original tunnel.Results: The LCL footprint was longitudinally ovoid (8.4 ± 1.0 × 13 ± 1.0 mm), and its inferior margin corresponded well with the lateral apex of the fibula (distance, 1.0 ± 0.7 mm). The PFL footprint was round (9.7 ± 1.3 × 9.0 ± 1.1 mm), and its center was very close to the tip of the fibular styloid process (1.2 ± 0.8 mm). The tunnel depth of the original fibular tunnel was 1.8 ± 0.7 mm, and it was very shallow for tunnel reaming. On the contrary, the tunnel depth of the modified fibular tunnel (6.4 ± 1.1 mm) was significantly higher than that of the original tunnel (P &lt; 0.05), and it was relatively safe for tunnel reaming.Conclusions: A single fibular tunnel cannot reproduce the LCL and PFL footprint centers simultaneously because the trajectory is too close to the cortex. A modified fibular tunnel, using the margins of the footprints, is recommended to avoid cortical blowout.Clinical Relevance: A modified fibular tunnel that covers only portions of the LCL and PFL footprints, from the anteroinferior LCL footprint to the posteroinferior PFL footprint, is less likely to blow out the lateral fibula than is a similar tunnel using the anatomic footprint centers.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction. Unresolved wound healing represents a major health care cost with a negative impact on patient quality of life, especially among oncology patients who exhibit a delay in the wound healing cascade due to chemotherapy and radiation. In order to address this problem, the author utilized negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) to cleanse wounds of debris and help promote healing. Objective. The author examines the impact of NPWTi-d on multiple indicators of wound healing progress in 6 cancer patients with complex wounds and multiple comorbidities. Materials and Methods. The NPWTi-d was initiated with instillation of normal saline or 0.125% hypochlorite solution, which was allowed to dwell for 3 to 20 minutes, followed by 2 to 3.5 hours of -125 mm Hg continuous negative pressure. Dressing changes were performed every 2 to 3 days. Debridements, incision and drainage, and antibiotics were administered as necessary. Results. A total of 1 woman and 5 men (average age, 62 years; range, 53--78 years) presented with the following wounds: surgical dehiscence (n = 3), pressure injury (n = 1), chronic seroma (n = 1), and abdominal wall abscess (n = 1). Malignancy was not detectable in any wounds. Patient comorbidities included diabetes, hypertension, and past treatment for cancers. The NPWTi-d was applied for 1 to 2 weeks, after which the wounds exhibited a reduction in slough, an improvement in granulation tissue, and a decrease in wound volume. Wounds were closed with a flap or transitioned to conventional NPWT prior to discharge home or to a rehabilitation facility for outpatient recovery. Conclusions. As shown in this case series, NPWTi-d was a beneficial tool for cleansing the wound bed, thus creating a moist, closed wound environment conducive to healing. Using NPWTi-d supported the formation of a healthy wound bed and contributed to rapid, positive outcomes in this patient population.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patients who refuse allogeneic blood transfusions (alloBT) on the basis of religious doctrine, such as Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs), can pose a challenge when undergoing surgical procedures. During cardiac surgery, special considerations regarding surgical techniques and blood loss minimization strategies can lead to improved outcomes. Limited literature exists to guide the use of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4PCC) in this patient population undergoing cardiac surgery.Study Design and Methods: This retrospective, single-center study evaluated the impact of 4PCC on hemoglobin (Hgb) change from baseline to postoperative nadir within a 7-day period among patients who refused alloBT during cardiac surgery. This study identified patients who refused alloBT from January 2011 to June 2017. Multivariable linear regression was used to control for confounding variables to evaluate the effectiveness of 4PCC.Results: During the study timeframe, 79 patients met inclusion criteria, all of whom identified as JWs, and underwent cardiac surgery. Of these, 19 received intraoperative 4PCC. Multivariable linear regression found no difference in Hgb change in patients who received 4PCC vs those who did not. No significant differences were found in mortality, thromboembolic complications, or in-hospital postoperative events.Conclusions: In JWs undergoing cardiac surgery who refuse alloBT, intraoperative use of 4PCC was not associated with a difference in Hgb change within 7 days postoperatively when adjusting for confounding variables. In the event of excessive blood loss, the utilization of 4PCC may provide a viable option in JW patients who undergo cardiac surgery where few options exist to mitigate blood loss.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Informative System of Nursing Performance was developed to measure complexity of nursing care based on the actual interventions performed by nurses at the point of care. The association of this score with in-hospital mortality was not investigated before. Having this information is relevant to define evidence-based criteria that hospital administrators can use to allocate nursing workforce according to the real and current patients' need for nursing care. The aim of this study is to assess the association between complexity of nursing care and in-hospital mortality.Methods: Register-based cohort study on all patients admitted to acute medical wards of a middle-large hospital in the North of Italy between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015 and followed up to discharge. Out of all the eligible 7247 records identified in the Hospital Discharge Register, 6872 records from 5129 patients have been included. A multivariable frailty Cox model was adopted to estimate the association between the Informative System of Nursing Performance score, both as continuous variable and dichotomized as low (score &lt; 50) or high (score ≥ 50), and in-hospital mortality adjusting for several factors recorded at admission (age, gender, type of admission unit, type of access and Charlson Comorbidity Index).Results: The median age of the 5129 included patients was 76 [first-third quartiles 64-84] and 2657(52%) patients were males. Over the 6872 admissions, there were 395 in-hospital deaths among 2922 patients at high complexity of nursing care (13.5%) and 74/3950 (1.9%) among those at low complexity leading to a difference of 11.6% (95% CI: 10.3-13.0%). Adjusting by relevant confounders, the hazard rate of mortality in the first 10 days from admission resulted 6 times significantly higher in patients at high complexity of nursing care with respect to patients at low complexity (hazard ratio, HR 6.58, 95%CI: 4.50;9.62, p &lt; 0.001). The HR was lower after 10 days from admission but still significantly higher than 1. By considering the continuous score, the association was confirmed.Conclusion: Complexity of nursing care is strongly associated to in-hospital mortality of acute patients admitted to medical departments. It predicts in-hospital mortality better than widely used indicators, such as comorbidity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In osteoporotic bone, the quality of the bone-to-implant interface is decreased, which may lead to early implant failure. Screw anchorage can be improved by augmentation. This effect is mainly investigated with a pull-out test. To our knowledge, the effect of cement augmentation in an in vivo physiological setup focusing on screw movement has not been investigated to date. The aim of this work was to investigate and compare augmented and native screw behavior in a physiologically related setup.Methods: Twelve fresh-frozen human lumbar vertebrae were divided into two groups. Each vertebra was bilaterally instrumented with either non-augmented or augmented pedicle screw systems and loaded in a recently developed test setup that provided cyclic conditions comparable to a physiological gait. The cyclic loading should test the primary implant stability, comparable to the postoperative period of two months in a worst-case scenario in the absence of osseous remodeling. Screws were tracked optically, and screw movement and failure patterns were observed.Results: Mutual influence between the left and right sides resulted in a successive, rather than simultaneous, failure. Augmentation of the screws in vertebrae with poor bone quality reduced screw subsidence and thus improved the rigidity of the screw-to-implant interface by up to six-fold. The non-augmented condition was significantly related to early screw failure.Conclusions: Pedicle screw system failure involves a complex bilateral-coupled mechanism. The cyclic loading based on physiological conditions during walking has allowed the postoperative conditions and clinical failure mechanisms to be simulated in vitro and clarified. Future implant systems should be investigated with a physiologically related setup.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Clinical data support the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as being associated with improved outcomes. Nonetheless, global utilization of IVUS remains low. We hypothesize that, in the revascularization of complex lesions, IVUS use is associated with improved outcomes.Methods: All patients with complex lesions treated with PCI at a single center from 2003 to 2016 were stratified by use of IVUS. Complex lesions were defined as follows: American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association type C lesions, in-stent restenosis, long lesions, bifurcations, severe calcification, left main lesions, and chronic total occlusions. The primary end point was the rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1-year follow-up, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, Q-wave myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. Inverse probability weighting was used in the adjusted analysis.Results: A total of 6,855 patients were included in the final analysis, of whom 67.3% had IVUS and 32.7% had angiography alone. The primary end point occurred in 13.4% of patients treated with IVUS and 18.3% of patients treated with angiography alone (P &lt; .001). Inverse probability weighting-adjusted 1-year MACE rates demonstrated significant reduction with IVUS for each complex lesion type.Conclusions: Among patients with complex lesions, the use of IVUS was associated with lower MACE 1 year after PCI than angiography alone was. Because of the increased procedural risk in complex lesions, routine utilization of IVUS-guided PCI should be considered in this subset of patients.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Psychosocial risk and protective factors specific to acute burn patients have been shown to impact on longer-term health outcomes. Yet the nature and impact of such factors throughout the acute hospital admission phase have not been extensively examined to date. This study analysed the psychosocial pre-admission, hospitalisation and discharge factors for a sample of burn patients at an Australian specialist acute burns unit (The Alfred) and the relationship with their admission length.Methods: A retrospective audit was undertaken of psychosocial factors documented in patient medical records, Victorian Adult Burns Service registry data, and social work files (January-December 2014).Results: Two hundred and forty-nine patients were identified, with a mean age of 42.83 years and a preponderance of men (73.9%). The majority (71%) had a low burn severity (&lt;10%), and an average of eight psychosocial factors. Independent of the severity of the burn, two psychosocial domains were strongly predictive of length of stay - coping with treatment and discharge planning - along with pre-existing psychosocial factors and family support.Conclusion: A diversity of psychosocial factors was identified, highlighting the clinical complexity of this patient group. Given three domains of admission-related psychosocial factors were predictive of the length of patient stay, more targeted psychosocial interventions in these areas may ensure patients and their families are supported more effectively throughout an admission, and length of stay costs may also be reduced.</ab>

        <ab>This study assessed nurses' knowledge and attitudes by gender toward the care of elderly patients with dementia and explored gender differences in attitudes and associated factors in Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife. The study adopted a sequential explanatory mixed method design to obtain data from 100 nurses selected through a multistage sampling technique. Data analysis was done at univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels with a significance at P &lt;.05. Findings revealed that a majority of the nurses have good knowledge and attitudes toward the care of elderly patients with dementia. Previous experience in a specialized unit (Odd = 2.879, CI = 0.013–8.287, P =.047) was the main predictor for the nurses' attitude.</ab>

        <ab>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) develops after-limb injury, with persistent pain and deficits in movement frequently co-occurring. The striatum is critical for mediating multiple mechanisms that are often aberrant in CRPS, which includes sensory and pain processing, motor function, and goal-directed behaviors associated with movement. Yet, much remains unknown with regards to the morphological and functional properties of the striatum and its subregions in this disease. Thus, we investigated 20 patients (15 female, age 58 ± 9 years, right-handed) diagnosed with chronic (6+ months of pain duration) CRPS in the right hand and 20 matched, healthy controls with anatomical and resting-state, functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, a comprehensive clinical and behavioral evaluation was performed, where each participant's pain, motor function, and medical history were assessed. Complex regional pain syndrome patients harbored significant abnormalities in hand coordination, dexterity, and strength. These clinical pain- and movement-related findings in CRPS patients were concomitant with bilateral decreases in gray matter density in the putamen as well as functional connectivity increases and decreases among the putamen and pre-/postcentral gyri and cerebellum, respectively. Importantly, higher levels of clinical pain and motor impairment were associated with increased putamen-pre-/postcentral gyri functional connectivity strengths. Collectively, these findings suggest that putaminal alterations, specifically the functional interactions with sensorimotor structures, may underpin clinical pain and motor impairment in chronic CRPS patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Trials are at risk of contamination bias which can occur when participants in the control group are inadvertently exposed to the intervention. This is a particular risk in rehabilitation studies where it is easy for trial interventions to be either intentionally or inadvertently adopted in control settings. The Falls in Care Homes (FinCH) trial is used in this paper as an example of a large randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention to explore the potential risks of contamination bias. We outline the FinCH trial design, present the potential risks from contamination bias, and the strategies used in the design of the trial to minimise or mitigate against this. The FinCH trial was a multi-centre randomised controlled trial, with embedded process evaluation, which evaluated whether systematic training in the use of the Guide to Action Tool for Care Homes reduced falls in care home residents. Data were collected from a number of sources to explore contamination in the FinCH trial. Where specific procedures were adopted to reduce risk of, or mitigate against, contamination, this was recorded. Data were collected from study e-mails, meetings with clinicians, research assistant and clinician network communications, and an embedded process evaluation in six intervention care homes. During the FinCH trial, there were six new falls prevention initiatives implemented outside the study which could have contaminated our intervention and findings. Methods used to minimise contamination were: cluster randomisation at the level of care home; engagement with the clinical community to highlight the risks of early adoption; establishing local collaborators in each site familiar with the local context; signing agreements with NHS falls specialists that they would maintain confidentiality regarding details of the intervention; opening additional research sites; and by raising awareness about the importance of contamination in research among participants.Conclusion: Complex rehabilitation trials are at risk of contamination bias. The potential for contamination bias in studies can be minimized by strengthening collaboration and dialogue with the clinical community. Researchers should recognise that clinicians may contaminate a study through lack of research expertise.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Over recent years there has been growing evidence of increased risk of mortality associated with hemorrhagic stroke among older patients. The main objective of this study is to propose and validate a prognostic life table for complex chronic patients after an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) episode in primary care settings.Methods: This was a multicenter and retrospective study (April 1, 2006-December 31, 2016) of a cohort from the general population presenting an episode of ICH from which a predictive model of mortality was obtained using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the log-rank test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the ability to stratify patients according to vital prognosis. We proceeded to external validation of the model through prospective monitoring (January 1, 2013-December 31, 2017) of the population of complex chronic patients with an episode of ICH.Results: A total of 3594 people aged ≥ 65 years were identified as complex chronic patients (women 55.9%; mean age, 86.1 ± 8.4 years) of whom 161 suffered hemorrhagic stroke during the study period (January 1, 2013-December 31, 2017). The primary outcome was death from any cause within 5 years of follow-up after an ICH episode. The independent prognostic factors of mortality were age &gt; 80 years (HR 1.048, 95% CI 1.021-1.076, p &lt; 0.001) and HAS-BLED score (HR 1.369, 95% CI 1.057-1.774, p = 0.017). Compared to the general population, the incidence density/1000 person per year (15 vs 0.22) was significantly higher with a significantly lower annual lethality rate (17% vs 49.2%); and both the prognostic factors and the risk of stratified mortality showed different epidemiological patterns. The internal validation of the model was optimal (log-rank &lt; 0.0001) in the general population, but its external validation was not significant in the complex chronic patient population (log-rank p = 0.104).Conclusions: The ICH-AP is a clinical scale that can improve the prognostic prediction of mortality in primary care after an episode of ICH in the general population, but it was not significant in its external validation in a population of complex chronic patients.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03247049.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: The lack of coordination of care for complex patients in the hematology setting has prompted nurse case managers (NCMs) to coordinate that care. OBJECTIVES: This article aimed to identify the frequency of NCM care coordination activities and quality and resource use outcomes in the complex care of patients in the hematology setting. METHODS: NCM aggregate data from complex outpatients with hematologic cancer were retrieved from electronic health records at a comprehensive cancer center in the midwestern United States. Total volume of activities and outcomes were calculated as frequency and percentage. FINDINGS: Care coordination activities included communicating; monitoring, following up, and responding to change; and creating a proactive plan of care. Quality outcomes included improving continuity of care and change in health behavior, and resource use outcomes most documented were patient healthcare cost savings.</ab>

        <ab>Few studies have been conducted on strategies to promote the implementation of complex interventions in nursing homes (NHs). This article presents a pilot study intended to assess the strategies that would enable the optimal implementation of a complex intervention approach in NHs based on the meanings of screams of older people living with Alzheimer's disease. An action research approach was used with 19 formal and family caregivers from five NHs. Focus groups and individual interviews were held to assess different implementation strategies. A number of challenges were identified, as were strategies to overcome them. These latter included interactive training, intervention design, and external support. This study shows the feasibility of implementing a complex intervention to optimize older people's well-being. The article shares strategies that may promote the implementation of these types of interventions in NHs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: With increasing age, having multiple chronic conditions is the norm. It is of importance to study how co-existence of diseases affects functioning and mortality among older persons. Complex multimorbidity may be defined as three or more conditions affecting at least three different organ systems. The aim of this study was to investigate how complex multimorbidity affects activities of daily living and mortality amongst older Norwegians.Methods: Participants were 60-69-year-olds at baseline in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 1995-1997 (HUNT2) n = 9058. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between complex multimorbidity in HUNT2, basic and instrumental activities of daily living in HUNT3 (2006-2008) and mortality during follow-up (n = 5819/5836). Risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) in percentage points (pp) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported.Results: 47.8% of 60-69-year-olds met the criteria of complex multimorbidity at baseline (HUNT2). Having complex multimorbidity was strongly associated with the need for assistance in IADL in HUNT3 11 years later (RR = 1.80 (1.58-2.04) and RD = 8.7 (6.8-10.5) pp) and moderately associated with mortality during the follow-up time (RR = 1.22 (1.12-1.33) and RD = 5.1 (2.9-7.3) pp). Complex multimorbidity was to a lesser extent associated with basic activities of daily living 11 years later (RR = 1.24 (0.85-1.83) and RD = 0.4 (- 0.3-1.1) pp).Conclusions: This is the first study to show an association between complex multimorbidity and activities of daily living. Complex multimorbidity should receive more attention in order to prevent future disability amongst older persons.</ab>

        <ab>Nurses need to have a firm grasp of normal and pathophysiological mechanisms of sodium and water balance to fully understand assessment findings and establish a rationale for a patient's plan of care. While multiple mechanisms control sodium and water balance, antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone are the most important hormonal influences. This article, the first in a new series designed to improve nurses' understanding of the physiological abnormalities underlying many disorders, reviews the common etiologies and symptoms of hyponatremia and hypernatremia, as well as the role of nursing care in patients with imbalances of sodium and water. Case studies guide the reader through relevant medical history and examination findings to an understanding of both the nursing and medical plans of care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether there has been a measurable change in the dependency and complexity of patients admitted to in-patient rehabilitation in Australia between 2007 and 2016. Methods: A retrospective cohort study design was used to examine in-patient rehabilitation data held in the Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre Registry Database for the period 2007–16. Epidemiological descriptive analysis was used to examine datasets for difference between four discrete years (2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016). Datasets included patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), comorbidities, complications and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM™). Results: Between 2007 and 2016, rehabilitation in-patients as a whole: (1) had a mean decrease in total admission FIM score; (2) became more complex, as evidenced by the increased proportion of particular comorbidities impacting on rehabilitation, namely cardiac and respiratory disease, dementia, diabetes and morbid obesity; and (3) had a mean decrease in total discharge FIM score. However, there was an increase in the proportion of patients discharged home from rehabilitation (from 86.5% to 92%) and decreases in onset and rehabilitation LOS of 2.2 and 2.5 days respectively. Conclusion: The dependency and complexity of patients admitted to in-patient rehabilitation in Australia has increased between 2007 and 2016. What is known about the topic?: Anecdotal reports suggest that rehabilitation patients in Australia have become more complex, necessitating increased active management of their presenting health condition and comorbid health conditions. However, to date, no systematic investigation has been undertaken to examine trends in rehabilitation in-patient dependency and complexity over time. What does this paper add?: This study provides measurable evidence of increased dependency and complexity in patients admitted to rehabilitation in Australia. Further, compared with 2007, rehabilitation in-patients as a whole had an increased burden of care on discharge from rehabilitation in 2016. What are the implications for practitioners?: The changes in patient dependency and complexity reported in this study have implications for rehabilitation service delivery. This is because the increased need for illness or injury and comorbidity management may result in increased potential for acute complications and health deterioration, and compensatory care for patients during rehabilitation. Clinicians may need to widen their skill set to include more acute and chronic illness management.</ab>

        <ab>In the United States and abroad, health systems have begun to address housing insecurity through programs that adhere to the Housing First model. The model provides permanent supportive housing without disqualification due to current mental health problems or substance use, along with optional case management services. This study used qualitative methods to explore how housing stability affected chronic disease management and social and community relationships among individuals with complex health and social needs and patterns of high hospital utilisation who were housed as part of a scattered‐site Housing First program in a mid‐size city in the northeastern United States. 26 individual, semi‐structured interviews were conducted with Housing First clients in their homes or day program sites between March and July 2017. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcripts were analysed using a qualitative descriptive methodology until thematic saturation was reached. Findings suggest that housing provided the physical location to manage the logistical aspects of care for these clients, and an environment where they were better able to focus on their health and wellness. Study participants reported less frequent use of emergency services and more regular interaction with primary care providers. Additionally, case managers' role in connecting clients to behavioural health services removed barriers to care that clients had previously faced. Housing also facilitated reconnection with family and friends whose relationships with participants had become strained or distant. Changes to physical and social communities sometimes resulted in experiences of stigmatisation and exclusion, especially for clients who moved to areas with less racial and socioeconomic diversity, but participation in the program promoted an increased sense of safety and security for many clients.</ab>

        <ab>Due to its labour migration history, Belgium is confronted with an increasingly older population of people of Moroccan background who have been diagnosed with dementia. These migrants came to the country during the labour migration wave of the nineteen-sixties and seventies to work in mines and other industries and they are now ageing. Yet little is known about how dementia care is provided to this older population. This study explores how dementia care is provided to these Moroccan older people with dementia, and what challenges do caregivers face in providing care. A qualitative study including 31 informal caregivers of older Moroccan migrants with dementia and professional caregivers in the field of dementia care in several Belgian cities was conducted. After an initial focus group including 6 informal and professional caregivers, individual in-depth interviews were held with 12 informal caregivers of Moroccan decent and 13 professional caregivers. In order to be included in the study, informal caregivers had to have a recent experience in caring for an older family member with dementia. The professional caregivers had to be active in the field of dementia care (General Practitioners, nurses, psychologists,...) and have experience with older migrants with dementia. Analyses of the collected data reveal that current dementia care is a challenging, complex and dynamic search process. This process is shaped by (1) multiple factors reflecting the changing care needs of the care recipient during the course of the dementia, (2) the individual (transnational) recourses of the informal caregivers and the (3) current (lack of) accessibility of professional dementia care (driven by the absence of an accessible migration-, culture- and religion-sensitive professional care). The limited professional service-use is predominantly compensated through the search for transnational external helpers. The limited migration, cultural and religious sensitivity of current dementia care is often overlooked by professional caregivers. The study provides a better understanding of the complex reality of dementia care for older migrants in which these different aspects intersect. This understanding enable health professionals and policy makers to develop a better suited care for older migrants with dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To assess the feasibility of a patient-centered complex intervention for multimorbidity (CIM) based on general practice in collaboration with community health-care centers and outpatient clinics. Methods: Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, diagnoses of two or more of three chronic conditions (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic heart conditions), and a hospital contact during the previous year. The CIM included extended consultations and nurse care manager support in general practice and intensified cross-sectorial collaboration. Elements included a structured care plan based on patients' care goals, coordination of services, and, if appropriate, shifting outpatient clinic visits to general practice, medication review, referral to rehabilitation, and home care. The acceptability dimension of feasibility was assessed with validated questionnaires, observations, and focus groups. Results: Forty-eight patients were included (mean age 72.2 (standard deviation (SD) 9.5, range 52–89); 23 (48%) were men. Thirty-seven patients had two diseases; most commonly COPD and cardiovascular disease (46%), followed by diabetes and cardiovascular disease (23%), and COPD and diabetes (15%). Eleven (23%) patients had all three conditions. Focus group interviews with patients with multimorbidity identified three main themes: (1) lack of care coordination existed across health-care sectors before the CIM, (2) extended consultations provided better care coordination, and (3) patients want to be involved in planning their treatment and care. In focus groups, health-care professionals discussed two main themes: (1) patient-centered care and (2) culture and organizational change. Completion rates for questionnaires were 98% (47/48). Conclusions: Patients and health-care professionals found the CIM acceptable.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) rely heavily on caregivers for assistance with care. However, we know little about their psychosocial experiences and their needs for support in managing MCC. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of caregivers of older adults living in the community with MCC. Methods: This qualitative study was a secondary analysis of previously collected data from caregivers in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Participants included caregivers of older adults (65 years and older) with three or more chronic conditions. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using Thorne's interpretive description approach. Results: Most of the 47 caregiver participants were female (76.6%), aged 65 years of age or older (61.7%), married (87.2%) and were spouses to the care recipient (68.1%). Caregivers' experiences of caring for community-living older adults with MCC were complex and included: (a) dealing with the demands of caregiving; (b) prioritizing chronic conditions; (c) living with my own health limitations; (d) feeling socially isolated and constrained; (e) remaining committed to caring; and (f) reaping the rewards of caregiving. Conclusions: Healthcare providers can play key roles in supporting caregivers of older adults with MCC by providing education and support on managing MCC, actively engaging them in goal setting and care planning, and linking them to appropriate community health and social support services. Communities can create environments that support caregivers in areas such as social participation, social inclusion, and community support and health services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine agreement between administrative and self-reported data on the number of and constituent chronic conditions (CCs) used to measure multimorbidity. Study Design and Setting: Cross-sectional self-reported survey data from four Canadian Community Health Survey waves were linked to administrative data for residents of Ontario, Canada. Agreement for each of 12 CCs was assessed using kappa (κ) statistics. For the overall number of CCs, perfect agreement was defined as agreement on both the number and constituent CCs. Jackknife methods were used to assess the impact of individual CCs on perfect agreement. Results: The level of chance-adjusted agreement between self-report and administrative data for individual CCs varied widely, from κ = 5.5% (inflammatory bowel disease) to κ = 77.5% (diabetes), and there was no clear pattern on whether using administrative data or self-reported data led to higher prevalence estimates. Only 26.9% of participants had perfect agreement on the number and constituent CCs; 10.6% agreed on the number but not constituent CCs. The impact of each CC on perfect agreement depended on both the level of agreement and the prevalence of the individual CC. Conclusion: Our results show that measuring agreement on multimorbidity is more complex than for individual CCs and that even small levels of individual condition disagreement can have a large impact on the agreement on the number of CCs.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Ankle lateral collateral ligament complex has been the focus of multiple studies. However, there are no specific descriptions of how these ligaments are connected to each other as part of the same complex. The aim of this study was to describe in detail the components of the lateral collateral ligament complex-ATFL and CFL-and determine its anatomical relationships.Methods: An anatomical study was performed in 32 fresh-frozen below-the-knee ankle specimens. A plane-per-plane anatomical dissection was performed. Overdissecting the area just distal to the inferior ATFL fascicle was avoided to not alter the original morphology of the ligaments and the connecting fibers between them. The characteristics of the ATFL and CFL, as well as any connecting fibers between them were recorded. Measures were obtained in plantar and dorsal flexion, and by two different observers.Results: The ATFL was observed as a two-fascicle ligament in all the specimens. The superior ATFL fascicle was observed intra-articular in the ankle, in contrast to the inferior fascicle. The mean distance measured between superior ATFL fascicle insertions increases in plantar flexion (median 19.2 mm in plantar flexion, and 12.6 mm in dorsal flexion, p &lt; 0.001), while the same measures observed in the inferior ATFL fascicle does not vary (median 10.6 mm in plantar flexion, and 10.6 mm in dorsal flexion, n.s.). The inferior ATFL fascicle was observed with a common fibular origin with the CFL. The CFL distance between insertions does not vary with ankle movement (median 20.1 mm in plantar flexion, and 19.9 mm in dorsal flexion, n.s.). The inferior ATFL fascicle and the CFL were connected by arciform fibers, that were observed as an intrinsic reinforcement of the subtalar joint capsule.Conclusion: The superior fascicle of the ATFL is a distinct anatomical structure, whereas the inferior ATFL fascicle and the CFL share some features being both isometric ligaments, having a common fibular insertion, and being connected by arciform fibers, and forming a functional and anatomical entity, that has been named the lateral fibulotalocalcaneal ligament (LFTCL) complex. The clinical relevance of this study is that the superior fascicle of the ATFL is anatomical and functionally a distinct structure from the inferior ATFL fascicle. The superior ATFL fascicle is an intra-articular ligament, that will most probably not be able to heal after a rupture, and a microinstability of the ankle is developed. However, when the LFTCL complex is injured, classical ankle instability resulted. In addition, because of the presence of LFTCL complex, excellent results are observed when an isolated repair of the ATFL is performed even when an injury of both the ATFL and CFL exists.</ab>

        <ab>• Our health care system is facing unprecedented challenges in caring for older adults. • Nurses are called to assume leadership roles in implementing evidence-based care. • Educational enhancements and system-level infrastructure are needed. Our health care system is facing unprecedented and complex challenges in caring for older adults and their families. A paradigm shift is needed that recognizes new roles and competencies for nurses to play a leadership role in the design and implementation of high value care models. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a series of recommendations for leveraging nurses to generate innovative tools and solutions for the delivery of value-based care for older adults living with complex health and social needs and their families. These recommendations were generated by a Think-Tank of national experts based on review of current evidence and focus groups with older adults. The generated recommendations focus on positioning nurses to assume leadership roles in implementing evidence-based care models, preparing nurses to serve as health innovators and catalysts of system transformation, and fostering system-level infrastructure that leverages the contributions of nurses for current and emerging roles. Nurses as innovators can address the challenges in providing high quality care for older adults with complex needs and their families. System-level infrastructure, including resources for training and implementation of well-established programs, is necessary to leverage the contributions of nurses and facilitate innovative approaches to care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to characterize the socioeconomic and clinical--epidemiological profile of people attended in an outpatient clinic specialized in complex wounds. Methods: cross-sectional study with 69 people with wounds, through the application of a questionnaire. Data analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics. Results: most participants were male (55.1%), above 60 years old (55.1%), married (40.6%), income from one to three minimum wages (69.6%). Regarding clinical aspects, 50 (72.4%) had the injury for more than six months, 32 (46.4%) had a relative responsible wound dressing, 44 (63.8%) did not have difficulties in wound dressing. Regarding how long they had the wound, pain and arterial disease were statistically significant (p=0.042; p=0.026). Conclusion: most participants were male and above 60 years old. Pain and the presence of arterial diseases were significant with regards to people with chronic wounds.</ab>
        <ab>Objetivo: caracterizar perfil socioeconômico e clínico epidemiológico de pessoas com feridas, atendidas em ambulatório especializado em feridas complexas. Métodos: estudo transversal, com 69 pessoas com feridas, mediante aplicação de questionário. Dados analisados por meio de estatística descritiva e analítica. Resultados: predominância do sexo masculino (55,1%), idade acima de 60 anos (55,1%), casados (40,6%), com renda entre um e três salários mínimos (69,6%). Quanto aos aspectos clínicos, 50 (72,4%) tinham a lesão a mais de seis meses, 32 (46,4%) algum familiar como responsável pelos curativos e 44 (63,8%) não apresentaram dificuldade com as trocas dos curativos. Em relação ao tempo da ferida, as variáveis dor e doença arterial apresentaram significância estatística (p=0,042; p=0,026). Conclusão: predominaram o sexo masculino e as pessoas acima de 60 anos. No tocante às características das lesões, a dor e presença de doença arterial apresentaram significância em relação às pessoas com feridas crônicas.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Macrolide is a key drug in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). Macrolide-resistant MAC is gaining importance, but there are little data in clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of macrolide-resistant MAC-PD (MR-MAC-PD).Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies reporting clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with MR-MAC-PD. Risk of bias was assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Results: Nine studies (seven retrospective and two prospective) comprising 319 patients were identified through a database search. Around 73% were women, and 52% had the fibrocavitary form. Pooled sputum culture conversion rate after combined multiple antibiotics or surgical resection was 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14-30%), and the one-year all-cause mortality was 10% (95% CI, 5-20%). There was no significant difference in treatment outcomes between nodular bronchiectatic and fibrocavitary types.Conclusions: Even combination therapy with fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, and surgical resection, the treatment outcomes of MR-MAC-PD were poor. The investigation of new treatment modalities is urgent.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Health care employees in Germany and worldwide are exposed to a variety of stressors. However, most of the hospitals in Germany lack a systematic workplace health management. Thus, this study aims at the evaluation of the effects of a behavioural as well as organisational (´complex´) intervention on the mental health and well-being of hospital staff.Methods: Mental health in the hospital workplace (SEElische GEsundheit am Arbeitsplatz KrankeNhaus - SEEGEN) is an unblinded, multi-centred cluster-randomised open trial with two groups (intervention group (IG) and waitlist control group (CG)). Study participants in the intervention clusters will receive the complex intervention; study participants in the waitlist control clusters will receive the complex intervention after the last follow-up measurement. The intervention consists of five behavioural and organisational intervention modules that are specifically tailored to hospital employees at different hierarchical and functional levels. Hospital staff may select one specific module according to their position and specific needs or interests. Towards the end of the intervention roundtable discussions with representatives from all professional groups will be held to facilitate organisational change. Primary outcome is the change in emotional and cognitive strain in the working environment, from baseline (T0) to 6 month-follow up (T1), between IG and CG. In addition, employees who do not participate in the modules are included in the trial by answering shorter questionnaires (cluster participants). Furthermore, using mixed methods, a process evaluation will identify uptake of the intervention, and mediators and moderators of the effect.Discussion: There seems to be growing psychological strain on people working in the health care sector worldwide. This study will examine whether investing directly in the hospital staff and their interpersonal relationship may lead to measurable benefits in subjective well-being at the workplace and improved economic performance indicators of the hospital. In case of a positive outcome, health promotion strategies looking at behavioural as well as organisational components within the hospital may gain additional importance, especially in regard of the growing financial pressure within the health sector.Trial Registration Drks: The SEEGEN study is registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS) under the DRKS-ID DRKS00017249.

        <ab>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a complex and rapidly fatal prion infection of the central nervous system with characteristic clinical and pathological findings. Herein, we present the case of an 80-year-old man with a 2-month history of rapid cognitive decline and ataxic gait. He was found to have a positive rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) upon clinical testing and was presumed to have neurosyphilis. His neurological status precipitously declined during his hospitalization and he died. A complete autopsy was performed, which revealed diffuse spongiform change throughout the cerebrum. Brain tissue was sent to the National Prion Disease Surveillance Center, where immunostaining for prion protein (3F4) showed granular deposits, confirming the diagnosis of CJD. There have been rare cases reported in which CJD was clinically suspected but neurosyphilis was confirmed at autopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first case to be published in which the clinical findings strongly favored neurosyphilis, but spongiform encephalopathy was identified at autopsy. We review the clinical, radiographic, electrophysiological, laboratory, and histopathological features of both diseases and discuss the overlapping findings and inherent diagnostic difficulties. We also review the recommended protocols for safely handling suspected prion-infected autopsy tissue. A heightened awareness of the features of CJD and other prion diseases is needed among forensic pathologists, neuropathologists, and general autopsy pathologists to understand how to safely handle the tissue to get definite diagnoses for the decedent's family members and clinical care team.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Fracture stem of the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) was designed for better tuberosity bone healing for the proximal bone defect of complex proximal humeral fractures (PHF). Our purpose was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients using fracture stem vs non-fracture (conventional) stem of RTSA in complex PHF of elderly patients.Methods: Between 2008 March and 2017 June, 48 patients who had undergone an RTSA with non-fracture or fracture stem for complex PHF with a minimum 18 months of follow-up were evaluated. Finally, total 45 patients with a mean age of 80 ± 7 years (65-92 years) were enrolled because three patients were excluded due to age related mortality. We divided them into two groups: 25 patients using non-fracture stem (non-fracture stem group) in the early period of this study, and consecutive 20 patients using fracture stem (fracture stem group) in the later period. Between two groups, we compared clinical and radiologic outcomes such as tuberosity failure, heterotopic ossification (HO), dislocation, acromion fracture, notching, loosening and periprosthetic fracture.Results: In all patients, clinical outcomes were improved significantly and tuberosity failure was found in 62% (28/45). Between two groups, there were no statistically significant differences on clinical outcomes and radiologic outcomes except UCLA score. As complications, two humeral stem revision was performed due to tuberosity failure related HO and stem loosening with subsequent periprosthetic fracture in non-fracture stem group.Conclusions: Compared to non-fracture stem, fracture stem usage of RTSA in complex PHF of elderly patients has no significant different impact on clinical and radiological outcomes. However, tuberosity failure related secondary HO of non-fracture stem might be responsible for stem loosening and periprosthetic fracture in the RTSA for complex PHF of elderly patients.Level Of Evidence: Level IV, case series study.</ab>

        <ab>The number of elderly suffering from dementia and complex disabilities is gradually increasing in nursing homes, and they form a differentiated group that requires palliative care provided by practitioners in various disciplines from the time of their admission to improve the quality of their remaining lives. The purpose of this study was to explore an interdisciplinary care approach by nurses and related practitioners for the demented and complex-disabled elderly in nursing homes that focuses on palliative care based on an ethical point of view. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted through in-depth interviews of 29 interdisciplinary practitioners working at 5 nursing homes. From them, 3 themes and 9 subthemes were extracted as the key results. First, practitioners set up cooperative care plans based on constantly tracking down clues to gradual functional deteriorations. Second, practitioners establish a cooperative committee to link residents and practitioners for responding to the subtle expressions of the elderly. Finally, practitioners maximize the opportunities for improving the quality of the elderly's remaining lives. These results can be the basis for the first prototype in developing interdisciplinary practical guidelines for nursing home–specific palliative care and can provide new insights for the practical care concept of palliative care.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To characterize the short-term results of a newly available self-expanding covered stent (Covera; CR Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc., Murray Hill, New Jersey) for the reconstruction of target vessels in complex aneurysms.Materials and Methods: From August 2017 to November 2018, this self-expanding covered stent was used in 17 patients (mean 72.6 ± 7.6 years of age) during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with hypogastric preservation (11.8%), branched EVAR (29.4%), fenestrated (F)-EVAR (17.6%), chimney + F-EVAR (11.8%), or chimney EVAR (29.4%). In more than 48 stented arteries (2.8 ± 1.1/patient), 25 were preserved using this self-expanding covered stent.Results: All target vessels were successfully preserved. There was no 30-day mortality and 1 in-hospital death. Intraoperative aneurysm exclusion was successful in 14 patients (82.4%) with a perioperative technical success rate of 82.4%. The actuarial survival rate was 93.8% at 6 months and 85.9% at 12 months. Aneurysm sac regression of &gt;5 mm was observed in 4 cases (23.5%), and the sac remained stable in the remaining patients (13 cases [76.5%]). At 12 months, the primary clinical success rate was 76.5%, and assisted primary clinical success rate was 82.4%. No type 3 endoleak was related to a disruption of the reconstruction with the self-expanding covered stent.Conclusions: This new self-expanding covered stent provides good short-term patency in chimneys, branches, or fenestrations. Larger series with long-term follow-up are required to determine if the stent can sustain the mechanical stress to which it will be submitted in these repairs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal infusion is an effective treatment for motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. However, it has been recently associated with emergent complex/atypical dyskinesias. We sought to characterize patients who developed these dyskinesias after levodopa infusion initiation, and to compare these patients to a control population with conventional motor fluctuations.Methods: 208 Parkinson's disease patients, treated with levodopa intestinal infusion due to motor fluctuations, were screened for onset and/or worsening of dyskinesias after initiation of levodopa infusion, resistant to the routine titration, and presenting with atypical or unexpected patterns. Patients with extensive follow-up data were enrolled for a longitudinal analysis. Cases were compared to a control sample with conventional motor fluctuations in order to investigate predisposing factors, difference in dyskinesia phenotype, management strategies and dropouts.Results: Thirty patients out of 208 (14.4%) reported atypical (i.e. long-lasting) biphasic, biphasic-like (i.e. continuous) or mixed (peak-dose and continuous biphasic) dyskinesias after levodopa infusion. They were compared at baseline and follow-up to a sample of 49 patients with conventional motor fluctuations on levodopa infusion. Both groups had similar demographic and clinical features, except the former having higher prevalence of biphasic dyskinesias while on oral therapy. Biphasic-like dyskinesias in nearly half the number of cases improved with increasing the dopaminergic load, while mixed dyskinesias had the worst outcome and highest dropout rate (58%).Conclusions: Atypical biphasic, biphasic-like and complex dyskinesias could hinder the course of patients treated with levodopa infusion. This study further informs the selection process of advanced therapies, particularly in dyskinetic patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patient blood management (PBM) is especially applicable in major spine surgery, during which bleeding and transfusion are common. What remains unclear in this setting is the overall impact of bundled PBM measures on transfusion requirements and clinical outcomes. We compared these outcomes before and after implementing a PBM program.Study Design and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 928 adult complex spine surgery patients performed by a single surgeon between January 2009 and June 2016. Although PBM measures were phased in over time, tranexamic acid (TXA) administration became standard protocol in July 2013, which defined our pre- and post-PBM periods. Transfusion rates for all blood components before and after PBM implementation were compared, as were morbid event rates and mortality.Results: Baseline characteristics were similar before and after PBM. Before PBM, the mean number of units/patient decreased for red blood cells (RBCs; by 19.5%; p = 0.0057) and plasma (by 33%; p = 0.0008), but not for platelets (p = 0.15). After risk adjustment by multivariable analyses, the composite outcome of morbidity or mortality showed a nonsignificant trend toward improvement after PBM (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.01; p = 0.055), and the risk of thrombotic events was unchanged (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.42-2.58; p = 0.80).Conclusion: In complex spine surgery, a multifaceted PBM program that includes TXA can be advantageous by reducing transfusion requirements without changing clinical outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The use of a comprehensive wound assessment tool and appropriate selection of dressing products can aid clinicians in the management of complex wounds. This paper describes the care of two patients presenting with head wounds. The first case is a patient who suffered from a right temporalis flap failure and exposed periosteum after wide excision. The second case explores the management of a sternocleidomastoid abscess that developed during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. The paper outlines how the choice of healing by secondary intention can prevent patients from undergoing additional surgeries where outcomes may not be favourable.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Elective complex ventral hernia repairs, done using synthetic mesh in patients with comorbidities, can result in mesh related complications such as hernia recurrence or infection. We studied hernia recurrence and surgical site occurrences after elective complex repairs in predominately clean cases using biologic mesh and examined the impact of several comorbidities.Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed on patients who underwent elective repair with biologic mesh in clean/clean-contaminated settings between 2012 and 2015 with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Multiple comorbid conditions, including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steroid use, smoking history and previous hernia repairs were identified. Post-operative complications including recurrence and infections were ruled out by computed tomography, clinical exam, and/or by telephone survey.Results: 40 patients were identified. 85% (n = 34) had class 1 wounds. 25% (n = 10) experienced a hernia recurrence. 10% (n = 4) of patients developed postoperative infection, none required mesh explantation or re-operation. No statistically significant association was found between the comorbidities assessed and recurrence/infection rates.Conclusions: We present the first study analyzing clinical outcomes of complex ventral hernia repairs using biologic mesh in predominately clean settings. This study being non-comparative limits definitive conclusions, but our aim is to add to the growing literature on biologic mesh to help future researchers performing comparative trials of synthetic versus biologic meshes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: DYRK1A is implicated in mental retardation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia of Down syndrome (DS) individuals. The protein is associated with cytoskeleton and altered expression has been shown to impair the cytoskeletal network via dosage effect.Objective: Our original observations of marked reduction of cytoskeletal proteins associated with DYRK1A in brains and lymphoblastoid cell lines from DS and AD prompted an investigation whether cytoskeleton abnormalities could potentially be used as biomarkers of AD.Methods: Our assay relied on quantification of co-immunoprecipitated cytoskeletal proteins with DYRK1A (co-IP assay) and analysis of the profile of G- and F-actin fractions obtained by high-speed centrifugations (spin-down assay).Results: In co-IP assay, both DS and AD samples displayed reduced abundance of associated cytoskeletal proteins. In spin-down assay, G-actin fractions of controls displayed two closely spaced bands of actin in SDS-PAGE; while in AD and DS, only the upper band of the doublet was present. In both assays, alterations of actin cytoskeleton were present in DS, sporadic and familial AD cases, and in asymptomatic persons who later progressed to confirmed AD, but not in non-AD donors. In blind testing involving six AD and six controls, the above tests positively identified ten cases. Analysis of blood samples revealed the diversity of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases regarding the presence of the AD biomarker allowing distinction between likely prodromal AD and non-AD MCI cases.Conclusions: Both brain tissue and lymphocytes from DS and AD displayed similar semi-quantitative and qualitative alterations of actin cytoskeleton. Their specificity for AD-type dementia and the presence before clinical onset of the disease make them suitable biomarker candidates for early and definite diagnosis of AD. The presence of alterations in peripheral tissue points to systemic underlying mechanisms and suggests that early dysfunction of cytoskeleton may be a predisposing factor in the development of AD.</ab>

        <ab>Background: A three-drug regimen (macrolide, ethambutol, and rifampicin) is recommended for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). Although macrolide has proven efficacy, the role of ethambutol and rifampicin in patients without acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not proven with clinical studies. We aimed to clarify the roles of ethambutol and rifampicin in the treatment of MAC-PD.Methods: Patients treated for MAC-PD between March 1st, 2009 and October 31st, 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Rates of culture conversion, microbiological cure, treatment failure, and recurrence were compared according to the maintenance (≥6 months) of ethambutol or rifampicin with macrolide.Results: Among the 237 patients, 122 (51.5%) maintained ethambutol and rifampicin with macrolide, 58 (24.5%) maintained ethambutol and macrolide, 32 (13.5%) maintained rifampicin and macrolide, and 25 (10.6%) maintained macrolide only. Culture conversion was reached for 190/237 (80.2%) patients and microbiological cure was achieved for 129/177 (72.9%) who completed the treatment. Treatment failure despite ≥12 months of treatment was observed in 66/204 (32.4%), and recurrence was identified in 16/129 (12.4%) who achieved microbiological cure. Compared with maintenance of macrolide only, maintenance of ethambutol, rifampicin or both with macrolide were associated with higher odds of culture conversion [odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 18.06, 3.67-88.92; 15.82, 2.38-105.33; and 17.12, 3.93-74.60, respectively]. Higher odds of microbiological cure were associated with maintenance of both ethambutol and rifampicin with macrolide (OR, 95% CI: 5.74, 1.54-21.42) and macrolide and ethambutol (OR, 95% CI: 5.12, 1.72-15.24) but not macrolide and rifampicin. Maintenance of both ethambutol and rifampicin with macrolide was associated with lower odds of treatment failure (OR, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.01-0.53) compared with macrolide only, while maintenance of one of these with macrolide was not. Maintenance of both ethambutol and rifampicin or one of these with macrolide did not decrease the probability of recurrence when compared with macrolide only.Conclusions: Maintenance (≥6 months) of ethambutol and rifampicin with macrolide was associated with the most favorable treatment outcomes among patients with MAC-PD. Given the association between ongoing ethambutol use and microbiological cure, clinicians should maintain ethambutol unless definite adverse events develop.</ab>

        <ab>As treatment for HIV improves, an ageing population is experiencing comorbidity which often leads to complex clinical presentations requiring an interdisciplinary care approach. This study sought to quantify clinician assessment of the level of clinical complexity, through the development of a rating scale for people living with HIV (PLHIV), to improve client care through an interdisciplinary care model. An existing alcohol and other drug complexity rating scale was selected and modified for use with PLHIV. HIV-specific items were included through consultation with an interdisciplinary team. A risk-prediction model was developed and validated using clinician ratings of clients attending The Albion Centre, a tertiary HIV clinic in Sydney, Australia, resulting in the development of the Clinical Complexity Rating Scale for HIV (CCRS-HIV). Multivariable logistic regression models identified eight characteristics based on clinician assessment of complexity in PLHIV: financial instability, social isolation, problematic crystal methamphetamine use, mental illness and/or other problematic substance use, cognitive/neurological impairment, polypharmacy, current hepatitis C infection and/or cancer, and other physical health comorbidity. A weighted risk-prediction model was developed and validated. The final model accurately predicted 85% of complex clients, with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 91%. This study developed an HIV-specific clinician-rated complexity scale. Further investigations are required to validate the CCRS-HIV with broader HIV populations. This simple complexity screening tool is a promising adjunct to clinical assessment to identify clients with complex physical and psychosocial needs who may benefit from interdisciplinary care interventions and allocation of resources.</ab>

        <ab>The systematic review written by Cheng and his colleagues ([4]), regarding "the prevalence and predictors of anxiety and depression in near-centenarians and centenarians" is, as far as we know, the first attempt to offer a landscape view of the research done around this important topic. But we have a lack of studies investigating prevalence and predictors of depression and anxiety, which are two of the clinical conditions that can contribute to poor mental and physical health for the oldest-old. It is very important that more studies are conducted on investigating how biopsychosocial factors influence longevity, since they could help us understand what can prevent the onset of clinical factors, such as anxiety and depression, which can lead to poor mental and physical health. ([4]), the various studies conducted on longevity are too heterogenous, and they often do not consider that how a person perceives her/his mental and/or physical health depends on factors that often are beyond the objective health condition.</ab>

        <ab>Clinical complexity (CC) represents one of the most relevant challenges of modern medicine, and its quantification is crucial both to stratify the clinical risk and for a fair hospital reimbursement policy.[1]-[3] CC is a multifaceted condition that encompasses biological (e.g., age, multimorbidity, frailty) and non-biological (e.g., socioeconomic, cultural, environmental, and behavioral) components.[4], [5] On this basis, a vectorial model of CC has been set up in which each vector expresses the dynamic changes over time of each component.[5] Although this model cannot but be an approximation of CC, it is able to take into account its determining factors all at once. The CC index studied has a high interobserver agreement among different healthcare professionals who were trained to administer this tool (observers #1 and #2). To conclude, the results of the present study support the feasibility of the use of the CC index in an internal medicine setting, and could provide background for its use in future studies.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To explore patients' with complex aortic diseases lived experiences of recovery between and after staged endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedures, including adjunctive open surgery. Design: Qualitative descriptive phenomenological design, applying person‐centred care and lifeworld‐led health care. Methods: Patients operated on in a staged fashion between 2012–2017 were invited to participate. Six participants underwent in‐depth interviews 1–5 years postoperatively. The interviews were analysed using descriptive phenomenological method. Findings: The essence of the patients' experiences was described as: a necessary, overwhelming, hard, and prolonged process with life changing consequences. Between the operations: expected tiredness where life goes on as usual and insufficient time for recovery. Short‐term after all operations: overwhelming tiredness, pain and complications, mostly from neurological deficits. Losing 'yourself' and struggling to manage daily life one day to another. Long‐term after all operations: gradually recovering back to 'yourself' and having to accept life with permanent setbacks and limitations. Conclusion: Patients with complex aortic diseases struggle with physical and psychological setbacks, continuing years after their operations. There is a need to prospectively assess different aspects of these patients' recovery, identify those with impaired recovery and establish preventive and supporting strategies. Impact: Patients' experience of recovery after staged aortic repair has not previously been investigated. The findings indicate that these patients struggle with various physical and psychological setbacks continuing years after their operations. These results will inform further research on this group of patients and guide healthcare professionals in the care of these patients in their transition back to recovery.</ab>
        <ab>目的: 探索经过分级主动脉修复手术(EVAR)或辅助性开腹手术后病人的恢复经历。 设计: 定量描述性现象学设计,应用以人为本的治疗和以生活世界为主导的健康护理。 方法: 此研究的参与者都是于2012‐2017年期间做过分级主动脉修复手术的病人。六位病人在手术后1‐5年间接受过深度采访。研究采用描述性现象学方法分析所有采访。 发现: 病人的恢复历程可概括为:一种必要的、不可避免的、艰辛的、漫长的会改变一生的过程。两次手术之间:预料之中的疲劳,生命仍在延续而恢复时间过短。手术后短期内:神经功能缺陷导致重度疲劳、疼痛和并发症。失去自我,挣扎着度过每一天。手术后很长时间:逐渐找回自我,不断接受自己生命的缺陷和限制。 结论: 病人术后多年一直与身体和心理缺陷作斗争。因此我们需要预期性地分析病人恢复过程的各个方面,建立预防和治疗策略。 影响: 此前我们并未研究过病人在分级主动脉修复手术后的恢复过程。研究的发现表明,病人术后多年一直与身体和心理缺陷作斗争。研究结果使得我们要继续对这类病人做更多研究,同时也为专业医学团队提供了为过渡阶段病人提供治疗的向导。</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Emergency departments (EDs) care for patients with complex medical problems who require a coordinated care approach. Patient navigation services, which help assist patients with care coordination, have been widely implemented for patients with cancer in a variety of settings, but this approach has not been described in the ED. We sought to better understand the potential for ED-based patient navigation services from the perspective of individuals currently providing these services in other settings.Methods: A survey was conducted of participants at a regional conference for patient navigation services of patients with cancer.Results: Eighty-five completed surveys were returned representing a response rate of 64%. Ninety-one percent of responses indicated that lay navigation services would be either very helpful or moderately helpful for either ED patients with cancer or for ED patients aged 65 years or older with or without cancer in an ED. Coordination of care, the provision of emotional support and educational resources relevant to their medical conditions, and providing companionship to older patients during the ED visits were identified as priorities for an ED-based lay navigation program. The lack of navigators with experience in the ED, the physical space constraints of the ED, and the time constraints associated with an ED visit were identified as the primary barriers to establishing a lay navigation program in the ED.Conclusions: These results identify the care priorities and barriers to be overcome during the development of an ED-based lay navigation program from the perspective of those currently providing patient navigator services.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Speech-language pathologists may introduce augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) systems to people who are unable to use speech for everyday communication. Despite the benefits of AAC systems, they are significantly underutilized by the people with complex communication needs. The current review aimed to synthesize the barriers and facilitators to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems. Materials and methods: Relevant literature was identified via a systematic search strategy. Included articles (n = 43) were evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Qualitative framework analysis was then completed with reference to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). Results and conclusion: Most barriers and facilitators were coded as contextual factors within the ICF. Of most prominence were environmental factors, including attitudes of and supports provided by professionals, family members, and the society at large. Themes were also identified which related to the personal factors, including the user's own attitude, socioeconomic status, and culture. Beyond these contextual factors, the remaining codes related to body functions such as cognition and movement. There are numerous barriers to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems, which may contribute to the inadequate use of these systems by people with complex communication needs. Suggestions for reducing these barriers are presented with regards to the person with complex communication needs, their family, and the professionals involved in their care. AAC systems can reduce participation restrictions for people with complex communication needs. The provision and use of AAC systems is influenced by environmental factors, personal factors, and features of a person's body function. SLPs may need to collaborate with a large multidisciplinary team to successfully introduce AAC systems. SLP, teaching, and nursing students require theoretical and practical experience in AAC throughout their training to enable the provision and use of these systems.</ab>

        <ab>We developed a measure of family obligation stress and compared its relationship to health and unmet health care needs relative to social support among a sample of US-based Latinas. Data come from a randomized controlled trial within 4 clinics to increase mammography among Latinas (n = 539). The 1-factor measure had acceptable reliability and construct validity. Family obligation stress was associated with worse health and greater unmet health care needs. Family obligation stress varied by years in the United States and country of origin. Our measure of family obligation stress contributes new venues to family research among Latino populations.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the implementation and outcomes of evidence-based fall-risk-reduction processes when those processes are implemented using a multiteam system (MTS) structure.Data Sources/study Setting: Fall-risk-reduction process and outcome measures from 16 small rural hospitals participating in a research demonstration and dissemination study from August 2012 to July 2014. Previously, these hospitals lacked a fall-event reporting system to drive improvement.Study Design: A one-group pretest-posttest embedded in a participatory research framework. We required hospitals to implement MTSs, which we supported by conducting education, developing an online toolkit, and establishing a fall-event reporting system.Data Collection: Hospitals used gap analyses to assess the presence of fall-risk-reduction processes at study beginning and their frequency and effectiveness at study end; they reported fall-event data throughout the study.Principal Findings: The extent to which hospitals implemented 21 processes to coordinate the fall-risk-reduction program and trained staff specifically about the program predicted unassisted and injurious fall rates during the end-of-study period (January 2014-July 2014). Bedside fall-risk-reduction processes were not significant predictors of these outcomes.Conclusions: Multiteam systems that effectively coordinate fall-risk-reduction processes may improve the capacity of hospitals to manage the complex patient, environmental, and system factors that result in falls.</ab>

        <ab>Stroke patients' well-being is threatened after stroke. A psychosocial intervention was developed for Norwegian stroke patients living in the community. Eight individual sessions between people with stroke and a trained health care professional were conducted 1 to 6 months post-stroke with one group of participants and 6 to 12 months post-stroke with another group. Subsequently, 19 of these stroke patients were interviewed to gain an in-depth understanding of their lived experience of the influence of the intervention on their adjustment process. Interview texts were analyzed using Ricoeur's interpretation theory. Two participants did not personally find the intervention useful. The remaining participants greatly appreciated dialogues with the empathetic intervention personnel, feeling free to discuss their fears and worries. The intervention raised these participants' awareness of their needs and resources. They were guided to resume their everyday life and adopt a future-oriented attitude. The intervention facilitated their meaning-making endeavors and post-stroke adjustment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The ubiquitous expressed transcript (UXT) plays a key role in various tumors by regulating transcriptional activity of multiple transcription factors, including androgen receptor (AR). However, the role of UXT in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is still unknown.Methods: Yeast two-hybrid screening, GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to detect the interacting protein of UXT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to investigate the levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation at the HOXA9 promoters. CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays and Transwell assays were performed to detect the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of renal cancer cells. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed to detect the expressions of UXT in human ccRCC samples.Results: The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a novel UXT interacting protein and UXT interacts with EZH2 in the nucleus. In addition, UXT interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) through directly binding to EZH2 and suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (SUZ12), but not to embryonic ectoderm development (EED). Moreover, the UXT activates EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity by facilitating EZH2 binding with SUZ12. We further provided striking evidences that knockdown of UXT inhibits proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of renal cancer cells, in an EZH2-dependent manner. Importantly, the upregulation of UXT expression was observed in clinical ccRCC samples, and the high expression level of UXT was associated with advanced stage, distant metastasis and poor overall survival in patients with ccRCC.Conclusion: The UXT is a novel regulator of the PRC2 and acts as a renal cancer oncogene that affects the progression and survival of ccRCC patients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This prospective, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of an acellular dermal matrix allograft, DermACELL (D-ADM; LifeNet Health, Virginia Beach, Virginia), in the treatment of large, complex diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that probed to tendon or bone. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs between 4 weeks and 1 year in duration. All participants received one application of D-ADM at baseline and could receive one additional application if wound healing arrested. Ulcers were assessed weekly for 16 weeks using a laser measuring device. RESULTS: Sixty-one participants were enrolled, with an average wound area of 29.0 cm2; 59 of these ulcers showed exposed bone. The entire per-protocol population (n = 47) achieved 100% granulation. The mean time to 100% granulation was 4.0 weeks with an average of 1.2 applications of D-ADM. Mean percent wound area reduction was 80.3% at 16 weeks. Those DFUs 15 cm2 or smaller were substantially more likely to close than DFUs larger than 29 cm2 (P =.0008) over a 16-week duration. No complications were associated with the use of the studied matrix. CONCLUSIONS: The D-ADM demonstrated the ability to rapidly reduce the size of large, complex DFUs with exposed bone. Some wounds did not completely heal by 16 weeks; however, the significant reduction in size suggests that these large, complex wounds may heal if given more time.</ab>

        <ab>The article describes the case of a 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained by prehospital providers on a 70-year-old woman who called 911 after her internal cardiac defibrillator fired multiple times. Highlights include the challenge of determining if the rhythm is originating in supraventricular regions or not, treatment for unstable ventricular tachycardia with a loading dose of amiodarone before hospital arrival, and a patent stent in the right coronary artery show by coronary angiography.</ab>

        <ab>Left eye indocyanine green angiography showing A: the large aneurysms superior to the fovea (black arrow) and B: with no leakage (white triangle) suggestive of PEVAC lesion. gl Based on the clinical and imaging findings and treatment response, a diagnosis of PEVAC was made in the left eye along with mild diabetic retinopathy changes in both eyes. The left eye of the patient showed large aneurysmal dilatation superior to the fovea with angiographic characteristics and OCT features as described by Sacconi et al.[1] There were associated mild diabetic retinopathy changes noted in both eyes as well. However, such large retinal micro-aneurysms associated with diabetic retinopathy often occur in eyes with chronic macular oedema and with higher severity of diabetic retinopathy, and are usually responsive to therapy.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To investigate the clinical characteristics of perifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex (PEVAC) in Korean patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 8 eyes (8 patients) diagnosed with PEVAC. Demographic characteristics of the patients, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine-green angiography (ICGA) findings were analyzed. Available follow-up data were also reviewed. Results: The mean ± standard deviation age was 61.0 ± 11.0 years and mean logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) best-corrected visual acuity was 0.15 ± 0.14. PEVAC was noted in 2 eyes with coincident age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and in the fellow eye of 1 eye with unilateral type 3 neovascularization. On fundus photography, PEVAC presented as a perifoveal isolated aneurysm associated with retinal exudation and hemorrhage. Well-defined hyperfluorescent lesions with leakage were noted on fluorescein angiography, but no leakage was observed on ICGA. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy was performed for 2 patients. However, there was no notable improvement after treatment. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of PEVAC in Korean patients were similar to those reported in patients of other ethnicities. Further studies are needed to better understand the nature of this newly described clinical entity.</ab>

        <ab>Background Traditionally, the treatment of exposed tendon has required vascularised tissue coverage, usually with complex surgical intervention. The introduction of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has challenged this traditional reconstructive concept. Unfortunately, standard NPWT units are usually bulky, noisy and curtail the mobility and lifestyle of patients. The introduction of small, modern, lightweight, portable, single-use NPWT units have therefore revitalised the use of NPWT and provided a solution to the many problems encountered with the larger devices. Case series This study highlights three cases of patients with complex lower limb wounds with tendon exposure who were successfully treated with single-use NPWT in an outpatient setting. The median time for complete wound granulation was 5-10 weeks. Minor sharp debridement of wounds was required to encourage granulation tissue formation and this was well tolerated in the outpatient setting. Conclusion Portable NPWT units provide an alternative to surgical reconstruction in patients with lower limb wounds with exposed tendon. These devices can be utilised in a purely outpatient setting, thus avoid long-term hospitalisation. Older patients with high anaesthesia risk or who lack alternative reconstructive options due to vascular co-morbidities are the most appropriate candidates for this treatment option.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant.Methods: The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant.Discussion: The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03883425 , registered on March 20, 2019.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: To assess the prevalence of overactive bladder (OAB) among medically complex vulnerable elderly (MCVE) patients in the United States and to compare health status measures, functional status, healthcare events, use of healthcare services and costs between MCVE patients with and without OAB.Methods: Using the 2001-2010 Medicare Current Beneficiary Surveys, we defined the MCVE as those respondents who were ≥65 years old with scores ≥3 on the Vulnerable Elders Survey-13. OAB diagnosis codes or self-reported use of antimuscarinic medications were used to identify MCVE individuals with OAB. Multiple regression analyses were used to estimate the adjusted relationship between OAB and the outcome measures.Results: The annual prevalence of OAB among the MCVE increased from 9.6% in 2001 to 13.5% in 2010. MCVE individuals with OAB were more likely to have experienced falls or fractures (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.0), urinary tract infections (OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 3.5-5.4), institutionalization (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.5), limitations in activity of daily living (ADL) (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7) and instrumental ADL (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2-2.0), hospital admission (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.0) and emergency department admissions (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.0) than those without OAB. MCVE individuals with OAB incurred, on average, $7188 (2013 dollars) more in healthcare costs than those without OAB.Discussion/conclusions: The prevalence of OAB in the MCVE population increased over time. OAB is associated with substantial clinical and economic burden. Further research is warranted to understand whether better management of the MCVE population with OAB may reduce healthcare resource use.</ab>

        <ab>Spatial integration of parts of the body is impaired in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Because the training of mental rotation (MR) has been shown to be among the effective therapy strategies for CRPS, impairment of MR is also important for the pathophysiological understanding of CRPS. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether differences in the neural representation of MR occur between patients with CRPS and healthy controls (HC). Therefore, we included 15 patients with chronic CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched HC. We assessed behavioral (accuracy and reaction time for MR of both hands), clinical (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) and magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted, function magnetic resonance imaging during MR) data. Reaction times in the patient group were delayed compared with HC without a lateralization effect for the affected hand side. Although both groups showed an activation pattern typical for MR, only HC showed a highly significant contrast for the rotated versus unrotated hands in the right intraparietal sulcus. Patients with CRPS showed a reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging activation in areas including the subthalamic nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and putamen. Regression analysis for the CRPS group emphasized the importance of putamen and nucleus accumbens activation for MR performance. This study highlights the reduced access of patients with CRPS for mental resources modulating arousal, emotional response, and subcortical sensorimotor integration. PERSPECTIVE: This study localized the underlying neural responses for impaired mental rotation in patients with complex regional pain syndrome as a decrease in basal ganglia (putamen) and nucleus accumbens activation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Herein we describe the presentation of drug‐induced lupus in an 89‐year‐old woman with end‐stage kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 11 mL/min per 1.73 m2) who had chosen a conservative non‐dialysis pathway of care, and highlight the role of a pharmacist in identifying drug‐related problems. Clinical details: Among numerous health conditions, the patient had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that had previously responded to hydroxychloroquine, which had been ceased. Hydralazine was subsequently commenced to control the patient's blood pressure. The combination of ceasing the medicine that controlled the patient's SLE and commencing a medicine that accumulates in patients with reduced renal function and can precipitate SLE resulted in a reactivation of the patient's disease. Outcomes: The pharmacist was pivotal in uncovering the timeline of medication changes and assisting in identifying SLE reactivation. Cessation of the patient's hydralazine and recommencing hydroxychloroquine resulted in the resolution of the symptoms. Conclusion: This case presents the value of an interdisciplinary approach to patient directed symptoms, when prescribing in the very complex clinical context of multiple comorbid conditions for patients with severely reduced renal function.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: The homeless population is aging, and their use of nursing homes is not well understood. We compared comorbidities (substance use, mental health conditions, and physical illness) and nursing home measures (source of admission, length of stay, and mortality in the facility) of veterans who were homeless, at risk for being homeless, or stably housed in the year prior to admission. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All veterans admitted to a nursing home between January 2010 and December 2016 and their housing status in the year prior to their nursing home admission. MEASUREMENTS: Adjusted relative risks (ARRs) for the association between housing status, comorbidities, and nursing home measures. RESULTS: Veterans who were homeless in the year prior to their community nursing home admission were younger (n = 3355; 62.5 years [SD = 10.3 years]) at admission compared to stably housed veterans (n = 64 884; 75.3 years [SD = 11.9 years]). After adjustment for demographic characteristics, homeless veterans were more likely to have diagnoses for alcohol abuse (ARR = 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.05‐2.31), drug abuse (ARR = 3.03; 95% CI = 2.74‐3.33), mental health condition (ARR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.45‐1.54), dementia (ARR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.04‐1.25), liver disease (ARR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.23‐1.41), lung disease (ARR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.04‐1.13), and trimorbidity (co‐occurring substance abuse, mental illness, and physical illness) (ARR = 2.57; 95% CI = 2.40‐2.74) compared to stably housed veteran nursing home users. Homeless veterans were more likely to be admitted to a nursing home from a hospital (ARR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.08‐1.17) and remain in the nursing home 90 days after admission (ARR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.04‐1.16), but were less likely to die in the facility (ARR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.67‐0.78) compared to stably housed veterans. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless veteran nursing home users have different characteristics than stably housed veteran nursing home users. These differences may challenge nursing home staff caring for homeless patients. Nursing homes should assess resident housing status to help provide linkages with existing social services.

        <ab>Background: Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) is US Food and Drug Administration approved for the urgent reversal of coagulation factor deficiency induced by a vitamin K antagonist complicated by acute major bleeding or in situations in which invasive procedures are urgently needed. Although recent evidence suggests the superiority of 4F-PCC over plasma for on-label indications, the off-label use of 4F-PCC has not been rigorously studied.Study Design and Methods: Eighty-nine patients receiving 4F-PCC at a single institution from July 2016 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Two cohorts, "On-Label" and "Off-Label" uses of 4F-PCC, were evaluated, comparing patient characteristics, blood utilization, and clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality.Results: Patients receiving 4F-PCC for off-label reasons (n = 46) were younger and sicker compared to those receiving 4F-PCC for on-label reasons (n = 43). Notably, the mortality rate for off-label use was approximately twofold greater than the mortality rate for on-label use (26 of 46 [56.5%] vs. 12 of 43 [27.9%]; p = 0.006). Patients receiving 4F-PCC for off-label reasons received more units per patient of each blood component than their on-label counterparts. The average cost estimate per patient for 4F-PCC was similar (approx. $4300) in each cohort.Conclusion: 4F-PCC is an effective but expensive treatment option for those requiring urgent reversal of vitamin K antagonist-induced coagulopathy. However, providers should be conscious of the high costs and questionable efficacy when using 4F-PCC off-label.</ab>

        <ab>This cross-sectional study uses data from the US National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations to assess the association between accountable care organization–reported care management and coordination activities and outcomes in older adults with complex needs. Key Points: Question: What is the association between care management and outcomes among patients with complex needs in Medicare accountable care organizations? Findings: In this cross-sectional analysis of 1 402 582 US Medicare beneficiaries who had frailty or multiple chronic conditions, beneficiaries attributed to accountable care organizations in the top vs bottom tertile of reported care management and coordination activities did not have statistically different quality, utilization, spending, or health care system interaction measures. Meaning: Accountable care organization–reported care management and coordination activities were not associated with improved outcomes among patients with complex needs. Importance: People with complex needs account for a disproportionate amount of Medicare spending, partially because of fragmented care delivered across multiple practitioners and settings. Accountable care organization (ACO) contracts give practitioners incentives to improve care coordination to the extent that coordination initiatives reduce total spending or improve quality. Objective: To assess the association between ACO-reported care management and coordination activities and quality, utilization, spending, and health care system interactions in older adults with complex needs. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, survey information on care management and coordination processes from 244 Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs in the 2017-2018 National Survey of ACOs (of 351 Medicare ACO respondents; response rate, 69%) conducted from July 20, 2017, to February 15, 2018, was linked to 2016 Medicare administrative claims data. Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who were defined as having complex needs because of frailty or 2 or more chronic conditions associated with high costs and clinical need were included. Exposures: Beneficiary attribution to ACO reporting comprehensive (top tertile) care management and coordination activities. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause prevention quality indicator admissions, 30-day all-cause readmissions, acute care and critical access hospital admissions, evaluation and management visits in ambulatory settings, inpatient days, emergency department visits, total spending, post–acute care spending, health care contact days, and continuity of care (from Medicare claims). Results: Among 1 402 582 Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions, the mean (SD) age was 78 (8.0) years and 55.1% were female. Compared with beneficiaries assigned to ACOs in the bottom tertile of care management and coordination activities, those assigned to ACOs in the top tertile had identical median prevention quality indicator admissions and 30-day all-cause readmissions (0 per beneficiary across all tertiles), hospitalization and emergency department visits (1.0 per beneficiary in bottom and top tertiles), evaluation and management visits in ambulatory settings (14.0 per beneficiary [interquartile range (IQR), 8.0-21.0] in both tertiles), longer median inpatient days (11.0 [IQR, 4.0-33.0] vs 10.0 [IQR, 4.0-32.0]), higher median annual spending ($14 350 [IQR, $4876-$36 119] vs $14 229 [IQR, $4805-$36 268]), lower median health care contact days (28.0 [IQR, 17.0-44.0] vs 29.0 [IQR, 18.0-45.0]), and lower continuity-of-care index (0.12 [IQR, 0.08-0.20] vs 0.13 [IQR, 0.08-0.21]). Accounting for within-patient correlation, quality, utilization, and spending outcomes among patients with complex needs attributed to ACOs were not statistically different comparing the top vs bottom tertile of care management and coordination activities. Conclusions and Relevance: The ACO self-reports of care management and coordination capacity were not associated with differences in spending or measured outcomes for patients with complex needs. Future efforts to care for patients with complex needs should assess whether strategies found to be effective in other settings are being used, and if so, why they fail to meet expectations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The lack of effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) stems mainly from the incomplete understanding of AD causes. Neuroinflammation has emerged as an important component of AD pathology, and a vast number of experimental and clinical data indicated a crucial role for the activation of the innate immune system in disease promotion and symptom progression.Methods: Clinical examinations of AD patients in a different stage of disease severity in correlation with the measurement of two innate immune reactions, i.e., peripheral blood leukocyte (PBLs) resistance to viral infection (vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV) ex vivo, and cytokines: TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and IL-10, production with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), have been investigated during this preliminary study before and after 4 weeks of oral treatment with dietary supplement proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP) (120 μg of PRP/day). The potential effect of PRP on the distribution of PBLs' subpopulations has been specified.Results: We have found a deficiency in innate immune response in AD patients. It was demonstrated for the first time that the degree of PBLs resistance to VSV infection was closely related to the stage of clinical severity of AD. Our study showed significant differences in cytokine production which pointed that in AD patients innate immune mechanisms are impaired. Administration of PRP to our patients increased innate immune response of PBLs and declined pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, thus subduing the excessively developed inflammatory response, especially among patients with high severity of AD. PRP did not exhibit a pro-proliferative activity. It was showed, however, significant influence of PRP on the distribution of PBLs' subpopulations.Conclusion: The findings mentioned above might be crucial in the context of potential application of immunomodulatory therapy in AD patients and indicated PRP as a potential target for future treatments in neuroinflammatory diseases like AD.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To report clinical and radiographic results of treatment of patients with complex open tibial pilon fractures.Methods: A retrospective analysis in 14 patients with complex open pilon fractures treated between 2010 and 2015 was conducted. The injuries were graded according to AO Classification and the Gustillo-Anderson system. Routine follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, 12 month with an annual evaluation thereafter. All patients were included for the assessment of the rate of infection, wound and fracture-healing. Functional outcome assessment was performed in all patients according to the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) at 12 months after the injury. The radiological outcome was evaluated through standard XR using the criteria proposed by Burwell and Charnley.Results: Analysis were conducted in 12 men and 2 women, with a mean age of 50.4 years (20-77) who were followed up for an average 34 months (range: 9-60 months). All patients had a AO type 43C fracture. There were three Gustilo Type IIIA injuries, seven Type III B and four Type III C. The mean time to fracture healing was 6.3 months. 4 patients underwent definitive treatment with external fixation at the time of the initial irrigation and debridement. 10 patients underwent delayed definitive surgery: in 10 patients ORIF was used. Soft-tissue coverage by vascularized muscle flap was necessary in 4 patients (28%) and was typically performed on the day of definitive fixation. One patient required iliac crest bone-grafting. 4 patients (28%) had a deep infection.6 patients (43%) had a superficial pin infection or cellulitis. 6 patients (43%) presented delayed union. The average AOFAS score was 71.5 (40-95). According to the Burwell-Charnley score, the anatomical reduction of the fracture was obtained in 50% of patients and a good reduction in 86% of cases. 5 patients (35.7%) had loss of joint congruity and evidence of osteoarthritis on radiographs at final follow-up. No patient needed arthrodesis or amputation.Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that open tibial pilon fractures can be safely managed with low rate of complications using intensive debridement, antibiotics, adequate devices and patient-tailored timing of definitive surgical treatment.</ab>

        <ab>We investigated the perspectives of patients, relatives and health professionals on the drivers and barriers to patient involvement (PI) in the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). During 2016–2017, individual and focus group interviews were conducted with purposively selected participants during CRS and HIPEC, supplemented by field observations. This material was analysed using meaning condensation (Kvale). Fifteen patients, eight relatives and nine health professionals participated in 31 individual and two focus group interviews, supplemented by 37 observations. The findings were structured into themes concerning treatment decisions, organisation of pathways, knowledge of the patient and life during treatment. Deciding to treat was determined not only by preoperative biomedical information, personal preferences but also findings during surgery. This circumstance put the patients under mental pressure and affected their ability to process the offered information. They furthermore perceived the pathway as complex and occasionally unclear, leading them to attempt to coordinate transitions themselves. The study has highlighted barriers to, rather than drivers of, PI. To promote PI during comprehensive complex cancer surgery, we suggest that patients and relatives are offered patient‐centred care, such as support in posing questions, overview of their treatment pathway and coherent transitions.</ab>

        <ab>Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a serious clinical problem and a condition requiring immediate diagnostics, supporting the therapeutic decision adequate to the specific ADHF mechanism. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is an established biochemical marker of heart failure, strongly related to hemodynamic status. Impedance cardiography (ICG) provides non-invasive hemodynamic assessment that can be performed immediately at the bedside and revealed to be useful diagnostic tool in some clinical settings in cardiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of ICG in the admission diagnostics and monitoring the effects of treatment in patients hospitalized due to ADHF, with special emphasis on its relation to NT-proBNP. This study enrolled 102 patients, aged over 18 years, hospitalized due to ADHF. The subjects underwent detailed clinical assessment, including ICG and NT-proBNP at admission and at discharge day. Among all analyzed ICG parameters thoracic fluid content (TFC), a marker of chest overload, was the most significantly correlated with NT-proBNP level (R = 0.46; p = 0.000001). In comparison with patients with low thoracic fluid content (TFC ≤ 35/kΩ), those with higher TFC values (&gt;35/kΩ) exhibited a greater severity of symptoms (NYHA functional class); higher NT-proBNP levels; lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), stroke index (SI), and cardiac index (CI); as well as significantly higher systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI). These TFC-based subgroups showed no significant differences in terms of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The evaluation of hemodynamic parameters, especially TFC, seems to be a worthwhile addition to standard diagnostics, both at the stage of hospital admission and while monitoring the effects of treatment. Impedance cardiography is a useful method in evaluating individual hemodynamic profiles in patients with ADHF.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Wound risk-stratified analyses are clinically relevant as they can assist in identifying hard-to-heal wounds. The aim of the study is to develop risk categories for wound healing based on a limited number of reliably recordable clinical data. Method: This retrospective study used observational data. The primary outcome measure was wound healing at the end of treatment and the secondary outcome measure was the time to wound healing. A stratification model using regression analyses was developed to assign the patients to risk categories for wound healing and the time-to-heal. Results: The study cohort comprised of 540 patients. The most common wound diagnoses were diabetic ulcers, wounds in irradiated areas and wound dehiscence after surgery. Average wound duration before starting treatment at the wound centre was 11.7 months. Healing was achieved in 382 (71%) wounds, after an average treatment time of 4.4 months. A total of four risk categories for wound healing were developed by combining wound diagnosis (favourable versus unfavourable) and duration (&lt;3 months versus &gt;3 months). These risk categories demonstrated healing percentages ranging from 69–97% (p=0.0004) and mean time-to-healing varying from 2.7–5.9 months (p=0.01). Conclusion: Using two clinical wound variables, diagnosis and duration, stratification categories were identified with significant associations with wound healing outcomes. Longer wound duration and unfavourable diagnoses, when combined into unfavourable risk categories, were associated with a lower percentage of wound healing and a longer treatment time until healing.</ab>

        <ab>Traditional quality assurance processes provide significant opportunities for positive disruption. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students are well positioned to apply program learning to largescale change in complex organizations. This article presents an innovative approach for creating a point-of-care interdisciplinary approach to address high fall risk frequencies in ambulatory oncology clinics using complexity leadership principles. Processes for nurse executives to consider for replication of this approach for other challenging clinical situations are suggested using the emerging competence of DNP educated nurses. Adults with cancer who are older than 65 years are at a higher risk for falls than older adults without cancer. Oncology providers and nurses are not routinely screening, documenting, and preventing falls. A fall injury in an older adult with cancer may not only delay or impact cancer treatment but also result in hospitalization, loss of function, and/or death. Increasing awareness of the impact of falls and implementing change within a large ambulatory health care organization requires an interdisciplinary team approach. Complexity theory supports nonlinear change initiated at the grassroots level to create a dynamic movement to bring forth emergence and adaptation. The use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) initiative will enable oncology professionals to screen, assess, and intervene by collaborating, communicating, and coordinating with other health care specialists to introduce a fall prevention quality improvement system process. Nurse executives need to know about STEADI.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of performing partial nephrectomy (PN) on patients with high nephrometry score tumors.Patients and Methods: We used a prospectively maintained multi-institutional kidney cancer database to identify 144 patients with R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score ≥10 who underwent PN for a cT1-cT2 renal mass. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, tumor characteristics, perioperative, and pathological outcomes were analyzed and reported. Trifecta achievement, defined by warm ischemia time &lt;25 minutes, no perioperative complications, and negative surgical margins, was the primary outcome. We assessed the relationship of baseline clinical and tumor characteristics data to trifecta achievement and perioperative complications.Results: Baseline median eGFR was 84.57 ml/min/1.73 m2, with 119 (84.39%) patients having normal baseline kidney function. The median clinical tumor size was 4.95 cm, with 74 (51.75%) being completely endophytic and 58 (41.73%) located on the hilum. The median ischemia time was 20 minutes. Median estimated blood loss was 150 ml. Twelve patients (8.33%) had intraoperative complications. No patient had a conversion to open surgery. Postoperative, perioperative, and major complication rate were 10.42%, 17.3%, and 2.34% respectively. Thirty-six patients (37.89%) developed postoperative acute kidney injury and 28 (20.90%) developed new-onset CKD at a median follow-up of 6 months. Eight patients (5.56%) had a positive surgical margin. Trifecta was achieved in 89 (61.81%) patients. There was no significant difference in baseline, clinical, and tumor characteristics between those that achieved trifecta and in those where trifecta was not. Pathologic tumor stage was the only factor significantly associated with trifecta achievement (P = 0.025).Conclusion: In treating complex renal tumors, PN should be performed when possible. Although this remains a challenging procedure, with experience and appropriate case selection, the trifecta outcome can be achieved in a significant number of patients with high renal score lesions.</ab>

        <ab>Few studies have reported on using craniometry for comminuted zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture management. We present our experiences with this procedure and a review of the related literature.From September 2011 to October 2018, 43 patients with comminuted ZMC fracture receiving open reduction internal fixation under coronal incision were enrolled. Data on gender, age, operation time, hospital stay, duration of follow-up, vertical/horizontal differences, and complications were collected. Between-group differences (C-arm imaging vs craniometry) were evaluated using nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous data and chi-square test for categorical data.No significant difference were found between the groups regarding gender, age, hospital duration, follow-up duration, and postoperative complications, except for operation time. The averaged operation time was significantly shorter in the C-arm imaging group (4.217 h) than in the craniometry group (6.193 h). The C-arm imaging group had two cases with horizontal differences &gt;3 mm and one case with vertical differences &gt;3 mm. The craniometry group had four cases with horizontal differences &gt;3 mm and four cases with vertical differences &gt;3 mm. There were no significant differences between the two groups in horizontal differences and vertical differences.Craniometry may achieve the same outcomes as C-arm imaging in comminuted ZMC fracture management; however, the former requires more time than the latter.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation resolves recurrent Clostridium difficile infections in greater than 82% of patients. Highly screened, processed universal donor fecal material is available. We compared cost and scheduling efficiency of fecal microbiota transplantation by universal donors to patient-directed donors.Methods: Medical records from a prospectively maintained database of recurrent C. difficile patients who underwent fecal microbiota transplantation between 2012 and 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient-directed donor stool was prepared in our microbiology laboratory using protocol-based screening. We transitioned to purchasing and using universal donor fecal material in 2015. Clinical outcomes, adverse events, time between consult to infusion, consultation fees, and material costs were compared. This was a retrospective comparison of two historical cohorts.Results: A total of 111 fecal microbiota transplantations were performed on 105 patients (56 from patient-directed donors and 55 from universal donors). Median recipient age was 66 years (18-96) with male to female ratio of 1:2.7, equivalent in both cohorts. Total consultation fees were significantly lower in the universal donor group owing to fewer infectious disease consultations. Costs for donor screening and stool preparation were lower in the universal donor cohort ($485.0 vs. $1189.90 ± 541.4, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 559.9-849.9). Time from consultations to infusion was shorter in the universal donor cohort (18.9 ± 19.1 vs. 36.4 ± 23.3 days, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 9.521-25.591). Recurrences within 8 weeks after fecal microbiota transplantation were equivalent (p = 0.354). Adverse events were equivalent.Conclusions: Fecal microbiota transplantation using universal donors versus patient-directed donors for recurrent C. difficile showed comparable efficacy and short-term complications. The use of universal donors resulted in significant cost savings and scheduling efficiency.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The ICD-11 includes a new disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD). A network approach to CPTSD will enable investigation of the structure of the disorder at the symptom level, which may inform the development of treatments that target specific symptoms to accelerate clinical outcomes.AimsWe aimed to test whether similar networks of ICD-11 CPTSD replicate across culturally different samples and to investigate possible differences, using a network analysis.Method: We investigated the network models of four nationally representative, community-based cross-sectional samples drawn from Germany, Israel, the UK, and the USA (total N = 6417). CPTSD symptoms were assessed with the International Trauma Questionnaire in all samples. Only those participants who reported significant functional impairment by CPTSD symptoms were included (N = 1591 included in analysis; mean age 43.55 years, s.d. 15.10, range 14-99, 67.7% women). Regularised partial correlation networks were estimated for each sample and the resulting networks were compared.Results: Despite differences in traumatic experiences, symptom severity and symptom profiles, the networks were very similar across the four countries. The symptoms within dimensions were strongly associated with each other in all networks, except for the two symptom indicators assessing aspects of affective dysregulation. The most central symptoms were 'feelings of worthlessness' and 'exaggerated startle response'.Conclusions: The structure of CPTSD symptoms appears very similar across countries. Addressing symptoms with the strongest associations in the network, such as negative self-worth and startle reactivity, will likely result in rapid treatment response.Declaration of interestA.M. and M.C. were members of the World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-11 Working Group on the Classification of Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress, reporting to the WHO International Advisory Group for the Revision of ICD-10 Mental and Behavioural Disorders.

        <ab>This qualitative study explores the experiences of older adults participating in a creative visual arts program at a residential care facility in Victoria, British Columbia. A narrative inquiry approach was used to conduct face-to-face interviews with 10 residents and three program staff in addition to the systematic observations of program activities and an arts exhibit. The findings reveal the program fostered a sense of community among participants and enhanced their sense of self-worth as artists. A public art exhibition at a community centre underlined the value of residents' artwork and gave meaning and purpose to their involvement in the program. Findings show the importance of arts programs in fostering creativity in later life and illustrate how people living in institutions can experience multiple dimensions of the self through artistic forms of expression. This study highlights the need to increase access to arts programs for individuals living in residential care.</ab>
        <ab>RÉSUMÉ: Cette étude qualitative explore les expériences vécues par des personnes âgées participant dans un programme d'arts visuels créatifs dans un établissement de soins de Victoria (Colombie-Britannique). Une approche par enquête narrative a été utilisée dans le cadre d'entretiens en personne menés avec dix résidents et trois membres du personnel du programme. Les activités du programme et l'exposition artistique qui y était associée ont aussi fait l'objet d'une observation systématique. Les résultats démontrent que le programme a stimulé le sentiment de communauté des participants et augmenté leur estime d'eux-mêmes, en tant qu'artistes. Une exposition artistique publique dans un centre communautaire a permis de souligner la valeur de leur production artistique et a conféré un sens et un but à leur implication dans le programme. Les résultats démontrent l'importance des programmes artistiques stimulant la créativité chez la population âgée. Ils illustrent aussi que les personnes vivant en institution peuvent prendre conscience des multiples dimensions de leur personnalité à travers l'expression artistique. Cette étude souligne la pertinence d'accroître l'accès à des programmes artistiques pour les individus vivant en établissements de soins.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Down syndrome (DS) is characterised by premature ageing that affects selected organ systems, and persons with this condition can present patterns of co‐morbidities and deficits often observed in the older population without DS. However, information on the characteristics of adult persons with DS is limited. The objective of the study is to describe characteristics of adults with DS collected with a standardised, comprehensive assessment instrument. Methods Cross‐sectional study. Four hundred thirty adults with DS (age range 18/75 years) from three countries (Italy, n = 95; USA, n = 175; and Canada, n = 160). A standardised assessment instrument (interRAI intellectual disability) was used to assess sample characteristics. Results: Mean age ranged from 35.2 (standard deviation 12.0) years in the US sample to 48.8 (standard deviation 9.0) years in the Canadian sample. Most participants in the Italian and US sample were living in private homes, while more than half of those in the Canadian sample were institutionalised. Prevalences of geriatric conditions, including cognitive deficits, disability in the common activities of daily living, symptoms of withdrawal or anhedonia, aggressive behaviour, communication problems, falls and hearing problems were high in the study sample. Gastrointestinal symptoms, skin and dental problems and obesity were also frequently observed. Conclusions: Adults with DS present with a high level of complexity, which may suggest the need for an approach based on a comprehensive assessment and management that can provide adequate care. Further research is needed to understand better the effectiveness of such an approach in the DS population.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine effects of a multifactorial program for preventing the frailty of older adults and effects of a follow-up program applying a capacity building strategy. Methods: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used for the nonequivalent control group. The follow-up group (n=75) and non-follow-up group (n=68) received the same multifactorial program comprising muscle strength exercise, cognitive training, and psychosocial programs for 12 weeks. After completion of multifactorial program, the follow-up group took follow-up programs applying the capacity building strategy for following 12 weeks. The data of physical function, cognitive function, and psychological function, and self-rated health were collected from both groups three times: before intervention, after intervention, and 12 weeks after intervention. The data were analyzed using x2 test and t-test. Results: In comparison with the non-follow-up group, the scores of Timed Up &amp; Go Test, and physical activities energy expenditure were significantly improved in the follow-up group. Conclusion: These results indicate that a multifactorial program with follow-up adapting the strategies of capacity building for the older adults group is feasible to prevent the physical frailty in community.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Targeted Intervention Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (TIME) has recently in a three-month cluster randomised controlled trial demonstrated reduction in agitation in nursing home residents with dementia. To ease replication and future implementation, and to clarify possible causal mechanisms, we performed a process evaluation of the intervention based on the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance).Methods: An exploratory and a quasi-experimental design with mixed methods were used. The RE-AIM dimensions were explored by questionnaires to 807 staff members and 46 leading ward nurses in both the intervention nursing homes (INH) and the control nursing homes (CNH), before the start of the trial (baseline), and six and 12 months later. These questionnaires assessed data regarding the reach, effectiveness (staff level) and adoption dimensions. To assess implementation, we used a checklist for performance of the main components in TIME and analysed the minutes from 84 case conferences in the INH. To explore adoption and maintenance, five focus group interviews with 32 participants from the staff in the INH were conducted three to 6 months after the end of the trial.Results: Reach: On average 61% (SD 22) of the staff in each ward in the INH attended the training sessions. Effectiveness at staff level: There were no between-group differences throughout the study period for attitudes towards dementia, perceived competence or perception of mastery and social interaction. Adoption: 16 of the 17 INH completed the intervention.Implementation: 75% or more of the components of TIME were performed for 91% of the included residents. Maintenance: Most of the nursing homes used TIME three to 6 months after the end of the trial. An easy to grasp model and an engaged leadership facilitated the intervention and maintenance.Conclusions: A high degree of reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance contributed to the effectiveness of TIME at resident level. One other causal assumption of the effectiveness of TIME is the development in the staff of a new, shared and situated knowledge about each individual resident, not reflected by measurements in general knowledge and attitudes.Trial Registration: The trial was registered January 6, 2016 with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02655003 ).</ab>

        <ab>Background: Deficits in general and specialized on-site medical care are a common problem in nursing homes and can lead to unnecessary, costly and burdensome hospitalizations for residents. Reasons for this are often organizational obstacles (such as lack of infrastructure or communication channels) and unfavorable compensation structures, which impede the implementation of adequate medical care. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a complex intervention aiming to improve the coordination of medical care in long-term care nursing homes in Germany. The project aims to optimize the collaboration of nurses and physicians in order to reduce avoidable hospital admissions and ambulance transportations.Methods/design: In a prospective controlled trial, nursing home residents receiving a complex on-site intervention are compared to residents receiving care/treatment as usual. The study will include a total of around 4000 residents in approximately 80 nursing homes split equally between the intervention group and the control group. Recruitment will take place in all administrative districts of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. The control group focuses on the administrative district of Tuebingen. The intervention includes on-site visits by physicians joined by nursing staff, the formation of teams of physicians, a computerized documentation system (CoCare Cockpit), joint trainings and audits, the introduction of structured treatment paths and after-hours availability of medical care. The project evaluation will be comprised of both a formative process evaluation and a summative evaluation.Discussion: This study will provide evidence regarding the efficacy of a complex intervention to positively influence the quality of medical care and supply efficiency as well as provide cost-saving effects. Its feasibility will be evaluated in a controlled inter-regional design.Trial Registration: WHO UTN: U1111-1196-6611 ; DRKS-ID: DRKS00012703 (Date of Registration in DRKS: 2017/08/23).</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To identify factors associated with prescribing potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in older adults (≥65 years) with complex care needs, who have undertaken a comprehensive geriatric risk assessment.Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional (retrospective, observational) study was performed. The national interRAI Home Care assessments conducted in New Zealand in 2015 for older adults were linked to the national pharmaceutical prescribing data (PHARMS). The 2015 Beers criteria were applied to the cross-matched data to identify the prevalence of PIMs. The factors influencing PIMs were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression model.Results: In total, 16,568 older adults were included in this study. Individuals diagnosed with cancer, dementia, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and who were hospitalized in the last 90 days were more likely to be prescribed PIMs than those who were not diagnosed with the above disorders, and who were not hospitalized in the last 90 days. Individuals over 75 years of age, the Māori ethnic group among other ethnicities, individuals who were diagnosed with certain clinical conditions (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, or congestive cardiac failure), individuals requiring assistance with activities of daily living, and better self-reported health, were associated with a lesser likelihood of being prescribed PIMs.Conclusion: The study emphasizes the identification of factors associated with the prescription of PIMs during the first completed comprehensive geriatric assessment. Targeted strategies to reduce modifiable factors associated with the prescription of PIMs in subsequent assessments has the potential to improve medication management in older adults.</ab>

Materials/methods: Analysis of a large multicentre cohort of patients (n = 5396) from the national clinical dataset representing 63 specialist rehabilitation services across England. Structural validity was examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Concurrent and criterion-validity were tested through a priori hypothesized relationships with other validated measures of resource requirements and dependency. Results: All but two items loaded strongly onto a single principal component with Cronbach's alpha 0.88. A total score of ≥30 identified patients with complex (category A) needs with sensitivity 76% and specificity 75%. However, confirmatory factor analysis provided a better fit when the scale was split into two subscales – a 'Cognitive/psychosocial' and a 'Physical' sub-scale (alpha 0.83 and 0.84, respectively). Moderate convergent and discriminant correlations were consistent with hypothesized relationships. Conclusions: The findings provide some overall support for the Patient Categorisation Tool as a unidimensional tool for measuring complexity of needs for neurorehabilitation, but the subscales may be more suitable for certain groups of patients. Further analysis is now required to evaluate its performance in different conditions. A psychometrically robust tool for measuring the complexity of rehabilitation needs has potential value, both at an individual level for treatment planning, and at a population level for planning and commissioning rehabilitation services. The Patient Categorisation Tool now forms part of the United Kingdom national clinical dataset mandated by the National Health Service in England This psychometric analysis from a large national multicentre cohort representing a diverse range of conditions, provides evidence for its validity as a means to identity patients with complex rehabilitation needs requiring specialist rehabilitation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The vascular anatomy of the anterior communicating artery complex (ACAC), the most frequent site of occurrence of aneurysms, is complex and associated with many anatomical and morphological variations.Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the anatomical variations of ACAC in the Indian population.Setting and Design: This was an observational study.Materials and Methods: Sixty-two patients of ACAC aneurysms were subjected to clipping, and intraoperative microsurgical details were analyzed.Results: Twenty-two (35.48%) patients had anatomical and morphological variations that were more common on the right side. Right A1 was hypoplastic in 5 (8.06%), aplastic in 2 (3.22%), and tortuous in 1 (1.61%) patient. Left A1 was aplastic in 3 (4.83%), hypoplastic in 1 (1.61%) and prominent in 2 (3.22%) patients. One patient (1.61%) had a prominent left A2 segment and 2 (3.22%) had a prominent right A1 and A2 segment. Two patients (3.22%) had fenestration of the ACAC and 3 (4.83%) had the median artery of corpus callosum. The recurrent artery of Heubner was identified in only 44 (70.96%) patients, and in these patients, distinct anatomical variations were noted. Eleven patients were found to present with a parent vessel anomaly, having a total of 23 (mean, 2.09) perforators arising from ACAC, whereas those without a parent vessel anomaly had a total of 57 (mean, 1.11) perforators. This difference was statistically significant.Conclusion: The ACAC region is the area of highest anatomical and morphological variability. This variability is even more exhaustive when associated with aneurysmal formation. A sound anatomical knowledge of the perforators and their preservation during the surgical management of the ACAC is of paramount importance for ensuring a good clinical outcome of patients.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The complex healthcare system that provides patients with medicines places them at risk when care is transferred between healthcare organisations, for example discharge from hospital. Consequently, understanding and improving medicines management, particularly at care transfers, is a priority.Objectives: This study aimed to explore the medicines management system as patients experience it and determine differences in the patient-perceived importance of people in the system.Methods: We used a Social Network Analysis framework, collecting ego-net data about the importance of people patients had contact with concerning their medicines after hospital discharge. Single- and multi-level logistic regression models of patients' networks were constructed, and model residuals were explored at the patient level. This enabled us to identify patients' networks with support tie patterns different from the general patterns suggested by the model results. Qualitative data for those patients were then analysed to understand their differing experiences.Results: Networks comprised clinical and administrative healthcare staff and friends and family members. Networks were highly individual and the perceived importance of alters varied both within and between patients. Ties to spouses were significantly more likely to be rated as highly important and ties to community pharmacy staff (other than pharmacists) and to GP receptionists were less likely to be highly rated. Patients with low-value medicines management networks described having limited information about their medicines and a lack of understanding or help. Patients with high-value networks described appreciating support and having confidence in staff.Conclusions: Patients experienced medicines management as individual systems within which they interacted with healthcare staff and informal support to manage their treatment. Multilevel models indicated that there are unexplained variables impacting on patients' assessments of their medicines management networks. Qualitative exploration of the model residuals can offer an understanding of networks that do not have the typical range of support ties.</ab>

        <ab>In recent years, autologous platelet‐rich plasma (PRP) derivatives have been used widely in the regeneration and repair of tissue, but a standard definition and preparation method for PRP are lacking. We developed a standardized method using platelet indices as quality‐control indicators for PRP preparation. Twenty‐one elderly patients (9 males, 12 females) with complex wounds were treated with standardized platelet‐rich plasma (S‐PRP). The platelet count in PRP after the second centrifugation was 1,069–1,436 × 109/L. We adjusted the platelet concentration in PRP after a second centrifugation to 1,000 × 109/L according to a formula using platelet‐poor plasma (PPP). The standardized preparation method that we developed gave S‐PRP with a relatively uniform platelet concentration. The wounds of 21 patients showed accelerated healing after S‐PRP treatment, and there were no obvious side effects during treatment. These data suggest that our preparation method of S‐PRP, using platelet indices as quality‐control indicators with platelet count of 1,000 × 109/L could be used for the treatment of complex wounds in the elderly. The preparation method of S‐PRP proposed in the present study may be a simple and effective method of PRP quality control.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction. An early-stage decision clinicians often make in the management of complex wounds is which method of wound preparation will be appropriate for the patient. This decision can be affected by numerous wound and patient risk factors that present challenges and may make surgical debridement difficult in patients with complex wounds. Recently, negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) using a novel reticulated open-cell foam dressing with through holes (ROCF-CC) was shown to aid in the loosening and removal of thick exudate and nonviable tissue from wounds. Objective. The authors present their experiences of using NPWTi-d with ROCF-CC, along with rationales for wound care decisions. Materials and Methods. Patients received antibiotics and surgical debridement when appropriate. Therapy selection and parameters were based on a decision-tree model for wound care management that takes into consideration patient and wound information. Most patients received NPWTi-d with ROCF-CC for a duration of 5 to 8 days; however, 1 patient received NPWTi-d with ROCF-CC for more than 30 days due to the wound extent and severity. Therapy consisted of instilling saline or quarter-strength sodium hypochlorite solution with dwell times of 3 to 10 minutes, followed by 2 hours or 3.5 hours of NPWT either at -100 mm Hg or -125 mm Hg. Results. There were 6 patients (3 men, 3 women; average age, 58.5 years) treated. Wound types included 3 pressure ulcers, 1 necrotizing soft tissue infection, 1 perianal abscess, and 1 large abdominal wound. Patient comorbidities included obesity, type 2 diabetes, and radiation therapy. In all cases, progression of wound healing was observed with no complications. This method produced viable granulation tissue and wound bed preparation; however, patients were not followed to closure or grafting. Conclusions. These cases help support the use of NPWTi-d with ROCF-CC as a viable option for wound care providers in the early-stage management of complex wounds.</ab>

        <ab>Background The Heart Team ( HT ) comprises integrated interdisciplinary decision making. Current guidelines assign a Class Ic recommendation for an HT approach to complex coronary artery disease ( CAD ). However, there remains a paucity of data in regard to hard clinical end points. The aim was to determine characteristics and outcomes in patients with complex CAD following HT discussion. Methods and Results This observational study was conducted at St Thomas' Hospital (London, UK). Case mixture included unprotected left main, 2-vessel (including proximal left anterior descending artery) CAD , 3-vessel CAD , or anatomical and/or clinical equipoise. HT strategy was defined as optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) alone, OMT +percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ), or OMT +coronary artery bypass grafting. From April 2012 to 2013, 51 HT meetings were held and 398 cases were discussed. Patients tended to have multivessel CAD (74.1%), high SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) scores (median, 30; interquartile range, 23-39), and average age 69±11 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis performed to determine variables associated with HT strategy demonstrated decreased likelihood of undergoing PCI compared with OMT in older patients with chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease. The odds of undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting compared with OMT decreased in the presence of cardiogenic shock and left ventricular dysfunction and increased in younger patients with 3-vessel CAD . Three-year survival was 60.8% (84 of 137) in the OMT cohort, 84.3% (107 of 127) in the OMT + PCI cohort, and 90.2% in the OMT +coronary artery bypass grafting cohort (92 of 102). Conclusions In our experience, the HT approach involved a careful selection process resulting in appropriate patient-specific decision making and good long-term outcomes in patients with complex CAD .</ab>

        <ab>Background: Post-acute care hospitals are often subject to patient flow pressures because of their intermediary position along the continuum of care between acute care hospitals and community care or residential long-term care settings. The purpose of this study was to identify patient attributes associated with a prolonged length of stay in Complex Continuing Care hospitals.Methods: Using information collected using the interRAI Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set 2.0 (MDS 2.0), a sample of 91,113 episodes of care for patients admitted to Complex Continuing Care hospitals between March 31, 2001 and March 31, 2013 was established. All patients in the sample were either discharged to a residential long-term care facility (e.g., nursing home) or to the community. Long-stay patients for each discharge destination were identified based on a length of stay in the 95th percentile. A series of multivariate logistic regression models predicting long-stay patient status for each discharge destination pathway were fit to characterize the association between demographic factors, residential history, health severity measures, and service utilization on prolonged length of stay in post-acute care.Results: Risk factors for prolonged length of stay in the adjusted models included functional and cognitive impairment, greater pressure ulcer risk, paralysis, antibiotic resistant and HIV infection need for a feeding tube, dialysis, tracheostomy, ventilator or a respirator, and psychological therapy. Protective factors included advanced age, medical instability, a greater number of recent hospital and emergency department visits, cancer diagnosis, pneumonia, unsteady gait, a desire to return to the community, and a support person who is positive towards discharge. Aggressive behaviour was only a risk factor for patients discharged to residential long-term care facilities. Cancer diagnosis, antibiotic resistant and HIV infection, and pneumonia were only significant factors for patients discharged to the community.Conclusions: This study identified several patient attributes and process of care variables that are predictors of prolonged length of stay in post-acute care hospitals. This is valuable information for care planners and health system administrators working to improve patient flow in Complex Continuing Care and other post-acute care settings such as skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation facilities.</ab>

        <ab>Inpatients with hematologic cancer (HC), particularly in an aging population, often require levels of nursing care that feel very demanding. Therefore, it is important to assess nursing complexity in this care environment. The purpose of this study is to assess nursing complexity of inpatients with HC. A prospective observational study was carried out on 131 patients admitted to an adult hematologic center in northern Italy. The following variables were analyzed by means of the Index of Caring Complexity (ICA): age, sex, diagnostic category, purpose of admission, presence of transplant, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and length of stay. A total sample of 131 patients were enrolled. Patients older than 65 years, with a history of transplant, admitted for complications, and with a diagnosis of myeloma or myelodysplasia had higher ICA scores. Therefore, patients in these groups are more likely to exhibit a higher nursing complexity than other patients. The study results can help health-care professionals identify, at an early stage, patients who need higher levels of nursing care; promote a more efficient allocation of nursing staff to the patient needs based on their group; and qualify the need for higher levels of nursing care in order to improve nursing care quality and achieve higher standards of care in Italian hematologic centers.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: Findings regarding efficacy of substrate modification for non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) are inconsistent. We prospectively compared clinical outcomes of complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE)-guided focal ablation (CFA) and CFAE-guided linear ablation (CLA) in patients with non-paroxysmal AF.Methods and Results: We randomized 150 patients with non-paroxysmal AF into CFA and CLA groups in a 1:1 ratio. Complex fractionated atrial electrogram distribution was evaluated using an automated algorithm of a three-dimensional mapping system. After pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), CFAE-guided ablation was performed in the left atrium and then in the right atrium (RA). When compared with conventional CFA, CLA was performed based on conventional lines, with additional lines. Atrial fibrillation was not induced after PVI alone or with cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in 20.7% of patients. To achieve the endpoint, additional CFAE-guided RA ablation was required in 42.7% and 36.0% of patients undergoing CFA and CLA, respectively (P = 0.403). Atrial fibrillation was terminated during CFAE-guided ablation in 72.9% and 75.0% of patients undergoing CFA and CLA, respectively (P = 0.792). Termination of atrial tachycardia (AT) or non-inducibility of AF/AT was achieved in 61.3% and 68.0% of patients undergoing CFA and CLA, respectively (P = 0.393). The CLA group showed decreased 1-year freedom from AF/AT recurrence (60.0%, CFA vs. 47.3%, CLA; log rank P = 0.085), but no significant difference throughout the follow-up (22.2 ± 21.0 months) (67.1%, CFA vs. 68.9%, CLA; log rank P = 0.298).Conclusion: Long-term efficacy of CFAE-guided ablation was unaffected by the ablation technique in patients with non-paroxysmal AF.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To assess the effectiveness and safety of a product containing diosmin, coumarin, and arbutin (Linfadren®) in addition to complex decongestive therapy (CDT) on the management of patients with a breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).Methods: Fifty outpatients (average age of 56.2 ± 2.7 years, range 28-71) with a BCRL were enrolled for this study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either CDT consisting of skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, remedial exercises, and elastic compression garment (control group, n = 25) or CDT plus Linfadren® (study group, n = 25). Patients were evaluated before and after treatment and 3 months after the end of treatment. Primary outcomes were reduction of upper limb excess volume (EV) and percentage reduction of excess volume (%REV). Secondary outcomes were improvement in Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, and patient's perception of treatment effectiveness (PPTE).Results: Addition of Linfadren® to CDT yielded an additional reduction of primary outcomes both after treatment (EV, - 521 ml vs. - 256 ml, P &lt; 0.0001; %REV, - 66.4% vs. - 34%, P = 0.02) and at 3-month follow-up (EV, - 59 ml vs. + 24 ml, P &lt; 0.0001; %REV, - 73.6% vs. - 31.4%, P = 0.004). Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for the secondary outcomes after treatment (QuickDASH, P = 0.006; PPTE, P = 0.03) and at 3-month follow-up (QuickDASH, P = 0.006; PPTE, P = 0.02). No patient showed adverse events.Conclusions: Linfadren® in addition to CDT was a safe and effective therapy for reducing BCRL and was better than CDT alone.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Permacol paste injection is a novel treatment approach for complex cryptoglandular anal fistulas. This study was performed to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of treatment with Permacol paste for complex cryptoglandular fistulas.Methods: Patients with primary or recurrent complex cryptoglandular anal fistulas treated with Permacol paste from 2014 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed.Results: A total of 46 patients (median age, 41.3 years; 21 female) underwent Permacol paste injection; 20 patients (43%) had previously undergone failed fistula surgery. The patients had experienced anal fistula-related symptoms for a median of 10 weeks (range, 3-50 weeks). All patients had a draining seton in situ for a median of 10 weeks (range, 4-46 weeks). The median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 1-25 months). At the 1-month follow-up, 2 patients had paste extrusion and 2 had anal abscesses. The mean preoperative Continence Grading Scale score was 1.10 ± 1.40, and that at 3 months postoperatively was 1.13 ± 1.39 ( P = .322). There was a significant difference in the preoperative and the 1- and 3-month postoperative pain scores ( P &lt; .001). At the 24-month follow-up, the healing rate was 50% (n = 23). A total of 19 patients (41%) with a recurrent fistula after failed Permacol paste injection required additional operative procedures. The satisfaction rate at the 2-year follow-up was 65%.Conclusion: Permacol paste injection is minimally invasive and technically easy to perform. It can be considered as a viable and reasonable option for the treatment of complex cryptoglandular anal fistulas in patients with fecal continence disorders.</ab>

        <ab>There is limited clinical experience with the use of coagulation concentrates to reverse the effect of direct oral anticoagulants. We assess the achievement of effective clinical hemostasis with the use of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in patients on apixaban or rivaroxaban presenting with major bleeding. A retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary referral medical center in the USA. We assess the achievement of clinical hemostasis using 4-factor PCC in patients on chronic apixaban or rivaroxaban therapy presenting with major bleeding. Clinical hemostasis was assessed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Scientific and Standardization Subcommittee criteria. A total of 29 patients are included in the study. The most common site of bleeding was intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (72.4%), followed by gastrointestinal bleed (13.8%). Clinical hemostasis was achieved in 21 (72.4%) patients. Patients who did not achieve clinical hemostasis (27.6%) suffered from ICH, and all of them died during hospitalization except for two patients who were discharged with neurologic deterioration. One patient developed multiple brain infarctions after receiving 4-factor PCC. Sixteen patients (55.2%) were receiving concomitant medications that interact with apixaban and rivaroxaban and increase the risk of bleeding. Four-factor PCC appears to be effective in achieving clinical hemostasis in patients on apixaban or rivaroxaban presenting with major bleeding. It may be an alternative to patients who need anticoagulation reversal if the specific antidote, andexanet alfa, is not available.</ab>

        <ab>This case study features the importance of mental health support for patients requiring complex surgery which results in the formation of a stoma. Extensive pre-operative preparation does not always equip patients with the necessary coping skills to overcome adversity after the operation. Stomal therapy nurses endeavour to enhance patient coping skills by providing pre- and postoperative advice and education. However, the patient's recovery and rehabilitation journey can be compromised by psychological impacts. Early identification of dyscopia leads to timely intervention to prevent further mental deterioration. This case study also highlights the significance of bowel health promotion for early detection of abdominal cancers. The patient had an incidental finding of his cancer that resulted from diagnostic investigations for a back pain.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: While emotion recognition difficulties in moderate-severe TBI are well established, the standard measures of emotion recognition significantly limit the conclusions which can be drawn regarding real-life deficits. Two studies report on the development of CAVEAT, a new measure of emotion recognition that attempts to overcome these limitations.Method: These studies were designed to establish CAVEAT's psychometric properties by examining performance of a TBI group and matched controls in order to provide estimates of its reliability and validity (study 1), and to compare performance of the TBI and control groups on a subgroup of emotions from the CAVEAT that represented the six basic emotions used in conventional emotion research (study 2). Thirty-two participants with TBI and 32 matched controls (study 1) and 16 participants with TBI and 12 matched controls (study 2) participated in this study.Results: CAVEAT demonstrated high construct validity and internal consistency. Performance on the subgroup of "basic" six emotions was largely similar to the rates reported in the literature.Conclusions: These findings provided some evidence for the psychometric properties of CAVEAT, indicating that it can be used as a clinical test for assessing emotion recognition in people with moderate-severe TBI.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The aim was to better understand how beliefs influence medication adherence in asthma.Methods: All participants were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid for a diagnosis of asthma. Each participant completed a survey consisting of: Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids was elicited using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Multiple linear regression with interaction effects was used to identify significant predictors of medication adherence and interactions between beliefs.Results: A total of 198 participants completed the survey. The mean(±SD) MARS score was 19.2(±4.5). A multivariable model (adjusted R2 = 0.39) predicted adherence using: age, asthma hospitalisation, timeline (B-IPQ) subscale, necessity and concern (BMQ) subscales, doctor (MHLCS) subscale and the two interaction effects (concerns [BMQ] moderated by chance [MHLCS] and treatment control [B-IPQ] moderated by understanding [B-IPQ]).Conclusion: The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the role of beliefs in medication adherence in asthma. Certain beliefs meaningfully interrelate and change the relationship they have with medication adherence.Practice Implications: If these beliefs are causally related to medication adherence and can be intervened upon, the findings are useful for providing targets to personalise adherence support.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To establish a high-resolution US technique that enables a systematic morphometric examination of the three components that form the distal biceps brachii tendinous complex; the internal bicipital aponeurosis, the distal biceps brachii tendon and the external bicipital aponeurosis (also known as lacertus fibrosus).Materials and Methods: Fifty cryopreserved cadaver body donor elbows were dissected to obtain morphometric reference values and to establish reliable landmarks for the US examination. Then, a systematic US technique was designed and validated by a one-to-one US/dissection analysis of 11 cryopreserved cadaver body donor elbows. Finally, the systematic US technique was carried out in 44 healthy volunteers and morphometric parameters were compared to those obtained in the first part of the study.Results: Mean dissection reference values: internal bicipital aponeurosis width 39.61 mm (10.02 SD) and thickness 0.75 mm (0.24 SD), distal biceps brachii tendon width 8.38 mm (1.87 SD) and thickness 2.73 mm (0.69 SD), external bicipital aponeurosis width 11.17 mm (5.84 SD) and thickness 0.85 mm (0.28 SD). One-to-one US/dissection correlation was overall good (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.876, p &lt; 0.0001). When comparing volunteer US/dissection measurements, significant differences were encountered in all measures except for internal bicipital aponeurosis width. However, the overall magnitude of such significant differences was &lt; 0.7 mm.Conclusions: Using the systematics hereby proposed, high-resolution US is reliable for the morphometric assessment of the distal biceps brachii tendinous complex. The external bicipital aponeurosis is morphometrically the most variable structure.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This study aimed to comprehensively define the breadth and specificity of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-specific T-cell response in patients at different stages of chronic coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).Methods: Following in vitro stimulation with an overlapping set of 21 HDV-specific 20mer peptides and exogenous interleukin 2, HDV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses of 32 HDV-infected patients were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot analysis and intracellular cytokine staining for interferon γ production at the single-peptide level. Additionally, HLA-binding studies were performed both in silico and in vitro.Results: We were able to detect ≥1 T-cell response in &gt;50% our patients. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the breadth of the response in patients positive and those negative for HDV by PCR. HDV-specific T-cell responses focused on 3 distinct HDV-specific epitopes that were each detected in 12%-21% of patients-2 HLA class II-restricted epitopes (amino acids 11-30 and 41-60) and 1 major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitope (amino acids 191-210). In in vitro HLA-binding assays, the 2 CD4+ T-cell specificities (amino acids 11-30 and 41-60) showed promiscuous binding to multiple HLA-DR molecules.Conclusions: This comprehensive characterization of HDV T-cell epitopes provides important information that will facilitate further studies of HDV immunopathogenesis.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear is a common cause of ulnar-side wrist pain; however, its natural course is not well understood.Questions/purposes: We sought (1) to determine the natural course of TFCC tears without distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability, and (2) to identify the factors associated with poor prognosis after nonsurgical treatment of TFCC tears.Methods: Over a 3-year period, we treated 117 patients with TFCC tears who did not have DRUJ instability. The diagnosis was made on the basis of ulnar-sided wrist pain, a positive ulnocarpal stress test or ulnar grinding test, and identification of a tear on MRI or CT arthrography. Of those, 25 were excluded during the initial evaluation period because they met the previously defined indications of surgery on the basis of clinical history. Another 19 patients (20%) were lost to followup before 6 months, and one patient was excluded because of prior wrist surgery, leaving 72 wrists in 72 patients for analysis in this retrospective study, which drew data from a review of electronic medical records of one institution. The group consisted of 42 men and 30 women, with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18-70 years). The study group was followed for a mean of 16 months (range, 6 to 36 months). We evaluated the pain VAS and patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) at the initial visit, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at more than 6 months after the initial visit. A PRWE score ≤ 20 points indicated complete recovery, and a PRWE score more than 20 points was considered an incomplete recovery. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression modelling to estimate the time to complete recovery and to identify factors associated with incomplete recovery among the seven possible factors of older age (≥ 45 years), male, obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m), dominant-hand involvement, chronic symptoms (≥ 6 months), traumatic tear, and ulnar-plus variance.Results: The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that estimated cumulative incidence of complete recovery was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20-40) at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 39-61) at 1 year. We could not find any risk factors among the seven candidate factors, including older age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.608; 95% CI, 0.34-1.087; p = 0.093), male (HR, 1.152; 95% CI, 0.667-1.991; p = 0.612), obesity (HR, 1.433; 95% CI, 0.603-3.402; p = 0.415), dominant hand involvement (HR, 1.808; 95% CI, 0.927-3.527; p = 0.082), chronic symptoms (HR, 0.763; 95% CI, 0.443-1.922; p = 0.133), traumatic tear (HR, 0.756; 95% CI, 0.432-1.32; p = 0.325), and ulnar plus variance (HR, 0.804; 95% CI, 0.461-1.404; p = 0.443).Conclusions: This study demonstrates that nonsurgical treatment is moderately successful for treating patients with TFCC tears without DRUJ instability. We recommend a minimum of 6 months nonsurgical treatment as the first-line treatment for this injury. Future studies are necessary to clarify predictors of persistent pain with nonsurgical treatment to avoid an unnecessary surgical delay.Level Of Evidence: Level III, prognostic study.</ab>

        <ab>To assess the procedural performance and 3-years outcomes of unprotected complex bifurcation Left Main (LM) stenting using either Culotte or the novel nano-crush techniques, consisting in the use of two ultra-thin strut stents with a 1-ring stent crushed into the LM. We analysed the records of patients with complex distal/bifurcation LM disease and contraindications and/or refusal of bypass surgery, who from 1 January 2014 to 1 November 2017, received at operators' discretion LM double stenting by means of nano-crush technique using Orsiro (Biotronik Inc, Bulack, Switzerland) or Onyx (Medtronic Inc, Galway, Ireland) stents or Culotte stenting using same stent platforms. Among 65 patients (28 females, mean age 77.2 ± 6.2 years), 32 received nano-crush while 33 patients received Culotte technique. Mean angles between left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex was 63.6 ± 21.3°. Post-operative success was achieved in 100% of cases. Nano-crush patients showed lower contrast medium volume and X-ray exposure, shorter fluoroscopy and procedural times compared to Culotte patients group. At a mean follow-up of 27.4 ± 10.8 months, clinical-driven target lesion revascularization, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death were 0 versus 4/33 (12.1%, p = 0.04), 1/32 (3.1%) versus 6/33 (18.1%, p = 0.03) and 2/32 (6.2%) versus 8/33 (24.2%, p = 0.04) in nano-crush versus Culotte patients, respectively. In this single center study, the nano-crush technique was associated with less use of contrast, less procedural time and less X-ray exposure compared to the culotte technique for the treatment of unprotected left main bifurcation lesions.</ab>

        <ab>The innovative vascular unloading technology (VUT) allows continuous noninvasive arterial blood pressure (AP) monitoring. We aimed to investigate whether the VUT enables AP changes to be detected earlier compared with intermittent AP monitoring in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. In this prospective observational study, we recorded continuous AP measurements with the VUT (CNAP system; CNSystems Medizintechnik AG, Graz, Austria) and intermittent AP measurements with upper arm cuff oscillometry in 90 patients undergoing complex gastrointestinal endoscopy (Department of Interventional Endoscopy at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). A "hypotensive phase" was defined as a time period of at least 30 s during which ≥ 50% of the VUT-AP values were in a predefined range of hypotension, i.e., AP value a) ≥ 10% below the last oscillometric value and b) ≤ 65 mmHg for mean AP or ≤ 90 mmHg for systolic AP. In the 5-min-interval between two oscillometric measurements, one or more hypotensive phases were detected in 26 patients (29%) for mean AP and in 27 patients (30%) for systolic AP. Hypotensive phases had a mean duration of 195 ± 99 s for mean AP and 197 ± 97 s for systolic AP with a mean procedure duration of 36 (± 21) min. Continuous noninvasive AP monitoring using the VUT enables hypotensive phases to be detected earlier compared with intermittent AP monitoring during complex gastrointestinal endoscopy. These hypotensive phases may be missed or only belatedly recognized with intermittent AP monitoring. Continuous noninvasive AP measurement facilitates detecting hemodynamic instability more rapidly and therefore may improve patient safety.</ab>

        <ab>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is associated with deficits in sensorimotor control. Herein we have used a novel finger illusion to investigate whether CRPS is associated with reduced weighting of bimanual hand representations. The illusion normally induces a compelling feeling that the hands are close together when in fact they are 12 cm apart. People with CRPS and age, gender, and dominant hand-matched controls tested the illusion in the midline then on either side of the midline. The illusion had 2 variants; the passive pincer-grip position, without contact (no grasp condition) and with contact (grasp condition) of the artificial finger. The primary outcome was the perceived vertical distance between the index fingers. Twenty people with CRPS and 20 controls participated (mean age 44.4 ± 11.7 years). During the no grasp condition, participants with CRPS perceived the vertical distance significantly closer to the actual 12 cm (mean 8.0 cm, 95% confidence interval 6.5-9.5 cm), than controls did (mean 6.4 cm, 95% confidence interval 5.5-7.2 cm]). That is, the illusion was weaker in people with CRPS than in controls during no grasp. There was no such difference during grasp; that is, both groups showed the predicted illusion response. There was no effect of hand placement relative to midline or relative to the opposite hand. We conclude that people with unilateral CRPS have lower weighting of bimanual hand representation than controls have, independent of hand location. However, adding additional cutaneous input returns those with CRPS to the expected performance. We suggest the results have clear clinical and research implications. PERSPECTIVE: An abnormal weighting of bilateral hand representation may reflect a vulnerability for chronic CRPS, an adaptation to the disease, and/or a potential therapeutic target. That addition of cutaneous input immediately normalizes the problem points to the possible role of bimanual tasks in prevention or rehabilitation.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Care communication about obesity needs to respond to the complex biopsychosocial processes that affect weight and health. The collaborative deliberation model conceptualizes interpersonal work that underpins empathic communication and shared decision-making. The goal of this study was to elucidate how primary care practitioners can use the model to achieve shared obesity assessment and care planning.Methods: This qualitative study used direct observation of clinical encounters with twenty patients with obesity sampled for maximum variation in context, semi-structured patient and provider interviews, patient journals and two follow-up interviews over eight weeks. Themes were compared to the original model.Results: We identified five processes that may be relevant for collaborative deliberation about obesity in addition to the original model: (1) Exploring the story, (2) Reframing the story, (3) Co-constructing a new story, (4) Choosing a priority, and (5) Experimenting with alternatives.Conclusions: We propose an enhanced collaborative deliberation model for obesity that describes the interpersonal work needed before and after deliberation about preferences and courses of action.Practice Implications: The enhanced model can support clinicians in achieving meaningful conversations about obesity and complex chronic disease resulting in care plans that are responsive to and achievable in the patient's lifeworld.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is an advance care planning tool designed for seriously ill patients. The discussions needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not occur in the outpatient setting. Objective: We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. Setting/Participants: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. Measurements: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items about the intervention. Results: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers agreed or strongly agreed that "Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about what I really want." Conclusions: The POLST facilitation can be successfully delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Hospital-related factors associated with mortality and morbidity after hip fracture surgery are not completely understood. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest single-payer, networked healthcare system in the country serving a relatively homogenous patient population with facilities that vary in size and resource availability. These characteristics provide some degree of financial and patient-level controls to explore the association, if any, between surgical volume and facility resource availability and hospital performance regarding postoperative complications after hip fracture surgery.Questions/purposes: (1) Do VHA facilities with the highest complexity level designation (Level 1a) have a disproportionate number of better-than-expected performance outliers for major postoperative complications compared with lower-complexity level facilities? (2) Do VHA facilities with higher hip fracture surgical volume have a disproportionate number of better-than-expected performance outliers for major postoperative complications compared with lower-volume facilities?Methods: We explored the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Project (VASQIP) database from October 2001 to September 2012 for records of hip fracture surgery performed. Data reliability of the VASQIP database has been previously validated. We excluded nine of the 98 VHA facilities for contributing fewer than 30 records. The remaining 89 VHA facilities provided 23,029 records. The VHA designates a complexity level to each facility based on multiple criteria. We labeled facilities with a complexity Level 1a (38 facilities)-the highest achievable VHA designated complexity level-as high complexity; we labeled all other complexity level designations as low complexity (51 facilities). Facility volume was divided into tertiles: high (&gt; 277 hip fracture procedures during the sampling frame), medium (204 to 277 procedures), and low (&lt; 204 procedures). The patient population treated by low-complexity facilities was older, had a higher prevalence of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (26% versus 22%, p &lt; 0.001), and had a higher percentage of patients having surgery within 2 days of hospital admission (83% versus 76%, p &lt; 0.001). High-complexity facilities treated more patients with recent congestive heart failure exacerbation (4% versus 3%, p &lt; 0.001). We defined major postoperative complications as having at least one of the following: death within 30 days of surgery, cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, new q-wave myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, ventilator dependence for at least 48 hours after surgery, reintubation for respiratory or cardiac failure, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, progressive renal insufficiency with a rise in serum creatinine of at least 2 mg/dL from preoperative value, pneumonia, or surgical site infection. We used the observed-to-expected ratio (O/E ratio)-a risk-adjusted metric to classify facility performance-for major postoperative complications to assess the performance of VHA facilities. Outlier facilities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for O/E ratio completely less than 1.0 were labeled "exceed expectation;" those that were completely greater than 1.0 were labeled "below expectation." We compared differences in the distribution of outlier facilities between high and low-complexity facilities, and between high-, medium-, and low-volume facilities using Fisher's exact test.Results: We observed no association between facility complexity level and the distribution of outlier facilities (high-complexity: 5% exceeded expectation, 5% below expectation; low-complexity: 8% exceeded expectation, 2% below expectation; p = 0.742). Compared with high-complexity facilities, the adjusted odds ratio for major postoperative complications for low-complexity facilities was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.67-1.09; p = 0.108).We observed no association between facility volume and the distribution of outlier facilities: 3% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for high-volume; 10% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for medium-volume; and 7% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for low-volume; p = 0.890). The adjusted odds ratios for major postoperative complications were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.73-1.05) for low- versus high-volume facilities and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79-1.02] for medium- versus high-volume facilities (p = 0.155).Conclusions: These results do not support restricting facilities from treating hip fracture patients based on historical surgical volume or facility resource availability. Identification of consistent performance outliers may help health care organizations with multiple facilities determine allocation of services and identify characteristics and processes that determine outlier status in the interest of continued quality improvement.Level Of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic study.</ab>

        <ab>The clinical characteristics of male patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease have not been clearly defined. We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of male patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease compared with female patients.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease who visited the outpatient clinic of the Shinshu University Hospital between 2003 and 2016 and compared the clinical characteristics of male and female patients.A total of 234 patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease were identified (68 men and 166 women). Male patients were significantly older than female patients. Blood examination results showed that the lymphocyte count, total protein level and albumin level were significantly lower in men than in women. Chest imaging findings were broadly categorised into the fibrocavitary and nodular bronchiectasis types. There were no significant differences in chest imaging findings and the time from diagnosis to disease exacerbation between men and women.During the study period, the incidence of the nodular bronchiectasis type of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease in male patients increased compared with previous reports. Men had no difference in time to exacerbation compared with women.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To understand the experience of family members of an older relative who has had a fall which required medical attention. Background: There is abundant bibliography in caregiving, but little is known about the problems faced by caregivers and how family members cope when their older relative has a fall. Design: Qualitative study that used a symbolic interactionism perspective. Methods: Twenty‐two people with older relatives, who had had a fall and contacted health services in Spain, participated in the study. Data were obtained via written accounts, focus groups, and semi‐structured interviews between February 2014 ‐ December 2015. Analysis was guided by grounded theory procedures. Results: With the fall, dependency becomes a complex issue for the family. To manage a complex dependency is the core issue that emerges from the data analysis. It depicts family efforts to assist their relative in gaining autonomy after a fall, in the best conditions they can provide. They do this with little guidance and support from healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Guides and protocols for the care of a fragile older person, particularly after a fall, should not only include care but also support to caregivers. Health professionals and especially nurses need to be aware and respond to the family caregivers needs after a fall. To the fall prevention initiatives already in place, it must be added that those who support family members to cope with the care of an older person who has had a fall.</ab>
        <ab>目的: 了解一位摔倒后需要医疗护理的老年亲属的家属经验。 背景: 护理领域有很多参考文献,但是很少有人知道护理人员面临的问题,以及老年亲属摔倒时家庭成员应如何应对。 设计: 定性研究,使用符号互动论。 方法: 22名曾摔倒并联系西班牙卫生服务机构的老年亲属参加了这项研究。通过2014年2月至2015年12月期间的书面报告、焦点小组和半结构化访谈获得数据。以扎实理论程序为指导进行分析。 结果: 摔倒后,家庭依赖性成为一个复杂问题。处理复杂的依赖关系是数据分析中出现的核心问题。它描述了基本缺乏医疗专业人员的指导和支持的情况下,家庭成员尽力以他们能够提供的最佳条件,帮助亲戚在跌倒后获得自主行动能力。 结论: 照顾脆弱的老年人,尤其是摔倒后的老年人时,不仅仅是给予照顾,还应支持照顾者。健康专业人员,尤其是护士,在家属摔倒后需要意识到并响应家庭护理人员的需要。此外,支持家庭成员照顾摔倒老人的人必须注意已采取的防摔措施。</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To test a self‐management intervention in primary health care (PHC) for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic heart failure (CHF) on self‐efficacy, symptoms, functioning, and health. Background: Patients with COPD or CHF experience often the same symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, lack of energy, dry mouth, numbness or tingling in hands and feet, pain and sleeping problems. Design: A multicentre randomized control trial. Method: The trial was conducted with one intervention group (N = 73) and one control group (N = 77). The trial was performed from September 2013–September 2015 at nine PHC centres in three county councils in Sweden. At baseline patients with COPD and CHF experienced any symptom. Follow‐ups were performed after 3 months and 1 year. The intervention was structured on Bandura's theory of self‐efficacy in six meetings and individual action plans based on personal problems were performed and discussed. Results: At baseline, there were no differences between the groups except for SF‐36 social function. After 3 months, the intervention group improved performance and satisfaction with regard to own selected activities, otherwise no differences were found. Conclusion: When designing a program, the patient's own difficulties must be taken into consideration if person‐centred care is to be established. It is feasible to include both patients with COPD and CHF in the same group in PHC. Healthcare professionals need supervision in pedagogics during intervention in self‐management.</ab>
        <ab>目的: 探讨慢性阻塞性肺病(COPD)或慢性心力衰竭(CHF)患者在初级卫生保健(PHC)中的自我管理干预对其自我效能、症状、功能及健康的影响。 背景: COPD或CHF患者经常出现同样的症状,如呼吸急促、咳嗽、精神不振、口干、手脚麻木或刺痛、疼痛和睡眠问题。 设计: 多中心随机对照试验。 方法: 实验分为干预组(数量=73)和对照组(数量=77)。试验于2013年9月至2015年9月在瑞典三个县议会的九个PHC中心进行。基线状态时,COPD和CHF患者出现任何症状。3个月和1年后进行随访。以班杜拉的自我效能理论为指导,在六次会面期间进行干预,并根据个人问题制定和探讨个人行动计划。 结果: 基线时,除SF‐36社会功能外,其余各组间无显著性差异。3个月后,干预组在自己选择的活动中提高了表现和满意度,因此未发现差异。 结论: 设计方案时,如果要建立以人为中心的护理,必须考虑患者自身的困难。在PHC中,将COPD和CHF患者纳入同一组是可行的。卫生保健专业人员在自我管理干预过程中需要教育监督。</ab>

        <ab>Introduction. Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) cleanses wounds with cyclic delivery, dwell, and removal of topical solutions to solubilize infectious materials and wound debris. Objective. In this 2-patient case study, the authors report their experiences using NPWTi-d on 2 critically ill patients requiring management of large, complex wounds. Materials and Methods. In both cases, normal saline was instilled with 10- to 20-minute dwell times, followed by 2 hours of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) at -125 mm Hg. Results. Patient 1 was a 67-year-old woman, with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, who required emergency surgery about 36 hours after ischemic efferent limb detorsion. After damage control surgery, NPWTi-d was applied for about 2 weeks. Once the wound was granulating, treatment was switched to conventional NPWT. Definitive surgery was planned for once she became physiologically optimized. Patient 2 was a 45-year-old woman presenting with septic shock and complex, necrotic wounds due to Fournier's gangrene. She received appropriate debridement, antibiotics, and adjunctive nutritional and critical care support. Then, NPWTi-d and NPWT were applied for 68 days, after which split-thickness skin grafts were used to close the right thigh, inguinal area, perineum, suprapubic area, right superior buttocks region, and back. Conventional NPWT was applied over the grafts as a bolster, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center 27 days later with a 95% graft take. Conclusions. In the authors' clinical experience, NPWTi-d promoted wound healing in critically ill patients with large wounds.</ab>

The objective of this study was to provide a qualitative understanding of the most helpful coordination services as experienced by patients receiving these services to reduce emergent hospital use. Methods Using case study methodology, we conducted focus group conversations with 51 care coordination patients and semi-structured interviews with 29 care coordinators at nine sites throughout Texas. The study team performed constant comparative analysis, beginning with start codes based on prior research. Results On average, focus group participants were 47 years old. The majority of participants reported a high school or General Equivalency Diploma level of education or less (84%), an annual income less than $14,999 (87%), and living with multiple chronic health conditions (60%). The majority (85%) of care coordinators reported backgrounds in nursing or social work. In our analysis, themes of what patients found most helpful fell under a broad social support framework (instrumental, informational, emotional, and advocacy) that care coordinators were uniquely situated to provide. Discussion Our paper adds to existing evidence by providing perspectives of patients with complex medical and non-medical needs about which care coordination services are most helpful. In this sample, patients with high needs describe reliance on professional sources, rather than their own social networks, to address several aspects of social support and to help meet non-health-related, as well as health-related needs. This can inform providers' approaches to treatment as well as program administrators' decisions about addressing and prioritizing services in care coordination programs.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Injectable cements have been developed to improve fixation's stability and thus obtain early return to adequate joint function. We aimed to compare post-operative radiographic and clinical outcomes of patients suffering from a complex tibial plateau fracture (TPF) fixed with calcium-phosphate bone substitutes (CPBS) augmentation to a matched group of patients with identical fracture pattern, treated with the same fixation's type, but augmented with bone grafting.Methods: After local ethic committee approval, we retrospectively identified in a prospectively collected database, patients with complex comminuted metaphyseal and epiphysial bicondylar TPF (Schatzker type VI) admitted in our emergency department between January 2011 and December 2013. From those, 23 patients (14 males, 9 females) were treated with CPBS (Quickset-CP®, Graftys, Aix-en-Provence, France) fixation augmentation. Patients' mean age were 44.4 years. We then created a control group using a 1:1 matching process on gender, age, fracture pattern, and method of fixation. Patients were evaluated prospectively at 3, 6, and then every six  months using radiographic (AP/ML views) and clinical criteria (knee osteoarthritis outcomes score (KOOS) and EuroQOL-5D).Results: Articular step-off and variation of articular step-off were significantly lower in the CPBS groups (mean step-off 1.4 ± 1.9 (0.5-6.5 mm) and mean step-off Δ = 0.3 ± 0.4 (0.5-2.2 mm)) than in the control group (mean step-off 3.6 ± 2.1 (1-7.5 mm) and mean step-off Δ = 2.2 ± 2 (0.5-7 mm) p &lt; 0.01). At last follow-up, patients of the control group presented a higher rate of step-off &gt; 2 mm and step-off Δ &gt; 2 mm (respectively, 56 and 35%) than patients of the CPBS group (26 and 9%). Odd ratio of, respectively, 3.6 (95% CI (1.08-12.7) and p = 0.03) and 5.6 (95% CI (1.04-30.1) and p = 0.03).At mean follow-up of 29 months, KOOS pain subscore was significantly better in patients of the CPBS group (85.3 ± 12.1) than in control patients (74.2 ± 10.4 and p = 0.03).Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that calcium-phosphate bone substitute used as synthesis augmentation improves mid-term radiological outcomes of patients suffering from complex tibial plateau fracture. Series reporting outcomes from a larger number of patients and longer follow-up must confirm clinical benefits and safety of this method.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Burns patients are at high risk of nosocomial infection, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common causes of wound and systemic infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in burns patients.Aim: To describe an outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR-Pa) at a specialist burns service and highlight the challenges in identifying the reservoir of infection despite extensive epidemiological, microbiological, and environmental investigations.Methods: Multi-disciplinary outbreak control investigation.Findings: Following an inter-hospital transfer of a burns patient from another country, an admission screen revealed that the patient was colonized with MDR-Pa. Subsequently nine more patients contracted MDR-Pa in the period from November 2015 to September 2017. Given the relatively long gap between confirmation of the index and subsequent cases, it was not possible to identify with certainty the reservoirs and mechanisms of spread of infection, although contamination of the burns service environment and equipment are likely to be contributory factors.Conclusion: Preventing infection transmission in specialist burns services is highly challenging, and it may not always be possible to identify and eradicate the reservoirs of infection for P. aeruginosa outbreaks. Our study supports the literature, providing additional evidence that inanimate, common contact surfaces play an important role in nosocomial transmission of P. aeruginosa. These surfaces should either be decontaminated efficiently between patient contacts or be single patient use. Enhanced vigilance is crucial, and, with strict adherence to infection prevention and control procedures, it is possible to reduce the risk of acquisition and spread of infection in patients.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale: Patients with refractory Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MAC-LD) undergo long-term macrolide therapy, but macrolide resistance develops infrequently.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether reinfection was a factor in the low incidence of macrolide resistance in patients with refractory MAC-LD.Methods: Among 481 patients with treatment-naive MAC-LD who started antibiotic treatment between January 2002 and December 2013, we identified 72 patients with refractory disease, characterized by persistently positive sputum cultures despite ≥12 months of treatment. Molecular analyses of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene responsible for macrolide resistance and serial mycobacterial genotyping were performed using stored MAC isolates.Measurements and Main Results: The median duration of treatment was 32 months (interquartile range, 24-41 mo) in 72 patients. After treatment for a median of 33 months (interquartile range, 21-44 mo), macrolide resistance developed in 16 (22%) patients. Molecular analysis of isolates from 15 patients revealed that 80% (12 of 15) had a point mutation at position 2,058 or 2,059 of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene. Of the 49 patients who had stored pre- and post-treatment isolates, mycobacterial genotyping revealed that reinfection by new MAC strains occurred in 36 (73%) patients. New MAC strains were found in 24 (49%) patients, and mixed infections with original and new strains occurred in 12 (24%) patients. Only 13 (27%) patients had persistent infections with their original MAC strains.Conclusions: Refractory MAC-LD is commonly caused by reinfection with new strains rather than persistence of the original strain, which may explain the infrequent development of macrolide resistance in refractory MAC-LD.

        <ab>Background: Gaining glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) usually requires more complicated medication regimens. Increased medication regimen complexity (MRC) negatively impacts adherence and clinical outcomes.Objective: Compare MRC change in patients with uncontrolled T2D referred to a collaborative pharmacist-endocrinologist Diabetes Intense Medical Management (DIMM) clinic "tune up" model versus similar patients receiving usual primary care provider (PCP) care over 6 months.Methods: Retrospective, observational, comparative cohort study compared MRC of complex DIMM clinic patients to a similar group (adults with T2D, glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C] ≥8%), continuing to receive usual care from their PCPs. The MRC Index (MRCI) was used to quantify MRC.Results: Both DIMM (n=99) and PCP (n=56) groups were similar, with high baseline mean MRC scores as measured by number of medications and MRCI (12.0 [SD=5.7] vs 13.7 [SD = 5.6], and 32.7 [SD=17.0] vs 38 [SD=16.5]), respectively. Mean MRC change over 6 months was not significantly different between groups, although mean A1C reduction was significantly greater in the DIMM versus PCP group (-2.4% [SD=2.1] vs -0.8% [SD=1.7], P&lt;0.001, respectively).Conclusions and Relevance: Outcomes represent the first report demonstrating how treating patients with an innovative DIMM model can help complex T2D patients achieve glycemic control without increasing the MRC to more than a comparator group. With the growing prevalence of T2D and associated elevated treatment costs, identifying effective means for achieving glycemic control without increasing complexity is needed. Application of this model may be considered by other health systems to aid in achieving outcome measures.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of our study was to assess the incidence of pain flare and the effectiveness of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in pain management of patients with bone oligometastases. We evaluated 48 patients accounting for 54 treatments. The Edmonton Classification System for Cancer Pain (ECS‐CP) was applied to identify indicators of treatment‐resistant pain, in patients with active pain (NRS ≥ 2) at baseline. Statistical analysis was performed to identify predictors of pain flare and pain control. Pain flare occurred in 38% of treated patients (n = 18/48): No correlation was found between pain flare and patient‐ or treatment‐related variables. In the subset of patients with active pain at baseline (n = 23), pain control was obtained in 62% of patients at 1 year; median time to pain progression after SBRT was 29 months (CI95% 6–52 months). Presence of ≥2ECS‐CP features was correlated with earlier pain progression (4 vs. 30 months, p = 0.012). Pain flare occurred in 38% of cases irrespectively of steroid premedication and dose regimen. In patient with baseline active pain, durable pain control was obtained. Presence of ≥2 complexity indicators at the ECS‐CP assessment was correlated with impaired pain control and may deserve future investigation in prospective studies.</ab>

        <ab>Background: A major obstacle that academic institutions face is the steep learning curve for cornea fellows initially learning to perform Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of complex DSEK performed by cornea fellow supervised by an attending surgeon at an academic institution.Methods: Patients who underwent a complex DSEK procedure performed by a cornea fellow during the years 2009-2013 were included. All the surgeries were supervised by the same cornea attending. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Charts were reviewed for demographic data, intraoperative and postoperative complications and clinical outcomes. Corneal graft survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results: Fifty-seven eyes of 55 patients (mean age 77.5 ± 8.5 years) were included in the study with a mean follow-up time of 16.4 ± 15.6 months. Previous graft failure, presence of a tube and history of trabeculectomy were the leading diagnoses to define the surgery as complex. No intraoperative complications occurred. In 21.1% of cases a corneal graft detachment was documented in the first postoperative day. Mean visual acuity improved from 1.06 LogMAR (20/230) preoperatively to 0.39 LogMAR (20/50, p &lt; 0.001) by the sixth postoperative month and to 0.52 LogMAR (20/65, p &lt; 0.001) at the last follow-up visit. Graft failure rate was 29.8%. Kaplan-Meier analysis found a 67.2% graft survival rate at 20 months.Conclusions: Complex DSEK can be performed successfully with an acceptable postoperative complication rate by cornea fellows during their training period when supervised by an experienced attending.</ab>

        <ab>Background: People experiencing homelessness often encounter progressive incurable somatic diseases in combination with psychiatric and psychosocial problems, and many need palliative care at the end of their lives. Little is known about how palliative care for this group can be started in good time and provided optimally. The objective of this paper is to give insight into the extent people experiencing homelessness have access to good palliative care. Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews were held to reconstruct the cases of 19 people experiencing homelessness in the Netherlands. Eight cases concerned persons being in the palliative phase (using the surprise question) and the other 11 cases concerned persons recently died after a period of ill health due to somatic illness. We used purposive sampling until data saturation was reached. The total number of interviews was 52. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed inductively. Results: Three key themes were: 'late access', 'capricious trajectory' and 'complex care'. The first key theme refers to the often delayed start of palliative care, because of the difficulties in recognizing the need for palliative care, the ambivalence of people experiencing homelessness about accepting palliative care, and the lack of facilities with specific expertise in palliative care for them. The second key theme refers to the illness trajectory, which is often capricious because of the challenging behaviour of people experiencing homelessness, an unpredictable disease process and a system not being able to accommodate or meet their needs. The third key theme refers to the complexity of their care with regard to pain and symptom control, psychosocial and spiritual aspects, and the social network. Conclusions: The care for in the palliative phase does not satisfy the core requirements of palliative care since there are bottlenecks regarding timely identification, the social network, and the assessment and management of physical symptoms and psychosocial and spiritual care needs. Education in palliative care of outreach professionals, training staff in shelters in the provision of palliative care, and building a network of palliative care specialists for people experiencing homelessness.</ab>

        <ab>Acute, unintentional drug-related poisonings lead to an estimated 418,313 ED visits in 2014, according to the latest statistics from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. While most of these were opiate-related poisonings, anticoagulant rodenticides were the most common cause of rodenticide-related poisoning in the United States. Many clinical syndromes and treatment algorithms have been described for patients with anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning. We report a case of an acute ingestion of two anticoagulant rodenticides and successful reversal of coagulation parameters using 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate in a fixed-dose approach.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Nearly 800,000 primary hip and knee arthroplasty procedures are performed annually in North America. Approximately 1% of these are complicated by a complex surgical site infection (SSI), leading to very high healthcare costs. However, population-based studies to properly estimate the economic burden are lacking. We aimed to address this knowledge gap. Design: Economic burden study. Methods: Using administrative health and clinical databases, we created a cohort of all patients in Alberta, Canada, who received a primary hip or knee arthroplasty between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2015. All patients who developed a complex SSI postoperatively were identified through a provincial infection prevention and control database. A combination of corporate microcosting data and gross costing methods were used to determine total mean 12- and 24-month costs, enabling comparison of costs between the infected and noninfected patients. Results: Mean 12-month total costs were significantly greater in patients who developed a complex SSI compared to those who did not (CAD$95,321 [US$68,150] vs CAD$19,893 [US$14,223]; P &lt;.001). The magnitude of the cost difference persisted even after controlling for underlying patient factors. The most commonly identified causative pathogen (38%) was Staphylococcus aureus (95% MSSA). Conclusions: Complex SSIs following hip and knee arthroplasty lead to high healthcare costs, which are expected to rise as the yearly number of surgeries increases. Using our costing estimates, the cost-effectiveness of different strategies to prevent SSIs should be investigated.</ab>

        <ab>Background: As the US population ages, the number of hip and knee arthroplasties is expected to increase. Because surgical site infections (SSIs) following these procedures contribute substantial morbidity, mortality, and costs, we projected SSIs expected to occur from 2020 through 2030. Methods: We used a stochastic Poisson process to project the number of primary and revision arthroplasties and SSIs. Primary arthroplasty rates were calculated using annual estimates of hip and knee arthroplasty stratified by age and gender from the 2012–2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample and standardized by census population data. Revision rates, dependent on time from primary procedure, were obtained from published literature and were uniformly applied for all ages and genders. Stratified complex SSI rates for arthroplasties were obtained from 2012–2015 National Healthcare Safety Network data. To evaluate the possible impact of prevention measures, we recalculated the projections with an SSI rate reduced by 30%, the national target established by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Results: Without a reduction in SSI rates, we projected an increase in complex SSIs following hip and knee arthroplasty of 14% between 2020 and 2030. We projected a total burden of 77,653 SSIs; however, meeting the 30% rate reduction could prevent 23,297 of these SSIs. Conclusions: Given current SSI rates, we project that complex SSI burden for primary and revision arthroplasty may increase due to an aging population. Reducing the SSI rate to the national HHS target could prevent 23,000 SSIs and reduce subsequent morbidity, mortality, and Medicare costs.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale: Despite multiple trials of interventions to improve end-of-life care of the critically ill, there is a persistent lack of understanding of factors associated with barriers to decision-making at the end of life. Objective: To apply the principles of complexity science in examining the extent to which transitions to end-of-life care can be predicted by physician, family, or patient characteristics; outcome expectations; and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Methods: A descriptive, longitudinal study was conducted in 3 adult intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred sixty-four family surrogates of patients lacking decisional capacity and the physicians caring for the patients were interviewed every 5 days until ICU discharge or patient death. Measurements: Characteristics of patients, physicians, and family members; values and preferences of physicians and family; and evaluation of treatment effectiveness, expectations for patient outcomes, and relative priorities in treatment (comfort vs survival). The primary outcome, focus of care, was categorized as (1) maintaining a survival orientation (no treatment limitations), (2) transitioning to a stronger palliative focus (eg, some treatment limitations), or (3) transitioning to an explicit end-of-life, comfort-oriented care plan. Main Results: Physician expectations for survival and future cognitive status were the only variables consistently and significantly related to the focus of care. Neither physician or family evaluations of treatment effectiveness nor what was most important to physicians or family members was influential. Conclusion: Lack of influence of family and physician views, in comparison to the consistent effect of survival probabilities, suggests barriers to incorporation of individual values in treatment decisions.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose to support older people with several healthcare needs in sustaining adequate functioning and independence, more proactive approaches are needed. This purpose of this study is to summarise the (cost-) effectiveness of proactive, multidisciplinary, integrated care programmes for older people in Dutch primary care. Methods design individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of eight clinically controlled trials. Setting primary care sector. Interventions combination of (i) identification of older people with complex problems by means of screening, followed by (ii) a multidisciplinary integrated care programme for those identified. Main outcome activities of daily living, i.e. a change on modified Katz-15 scale between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes quality of life (visual analogue scale 0–10), psychological (mental well-being scale Short Form Health Survey (SF)-36) and social well-being (single item, SF-36), quality-adjusted life years (Euroqol-5dimensions-3level (EQ-5D-3L)), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness. Analysis intention-to-treat analysis, two-stage IPD and subgroup analysis based on patient and intervention characteristics. Results included were 8,678 participants: median age of 80.5 (interquartile range 75.3; 85.7) years; 5,496 (63.3%) women. On the modified Katz-15 scale, the pooled difference in change between the intervention and control group was −0.01 (95% confidence interval −0.10 to 0.08). No significant differences were found in the other patient outcomes or subgroup analyses. Compared to usual care, the probability of the intervention group to be cost-effective was less than 5%. Conclusion compared to usual care at 1-year follow-up, strategies for identification of frail older people in primary care combined with a proactive integrated care intervention are probably not (cost-) effective.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Individual patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) show divergent specific anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) patterns, but hitherto no individual ACPA specificity has consistently been linked to RA pathogenesis. ACPA are also implicated in immune complexes (IC)-associated joint pathology, but until now, there has been no method to investigate the role of individual ACPA in RA IC formation and IC-associated pathogenesis.Methods: We have developed a new technique based on IC binding to C1q-coated magnetic beads to purify and solubilise circulating IC in sera and synovial fluids (SF) from 77 patients with RA. This was combined with measurement of 19 individual ACPA in serum, SF and in the IC fractions from serum and SF. We investigated whether occurrence of individual ACPA as well as number of ACPA in these compartments was related to clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity and inflammation.Results: The majority of individual ACPA reactivities were enriched in SF as compared with in serum, and levels of ACPA in IC were regulated independently of levels in serum and SF. No individual ACPA reactivity in any compartment showed a dominating association to clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity and severity. Instead, the number of individual ACPA reactivities in the IC fraction from SF associated with a number of markers of joint destruction and inflammation.Conclusions: Our data highlight the polyclonality of ACPA in joint IC and the possibility that a broad ACPA repertoire in synovial fluid IC might drive the local inflammatory and matrix-degrading processes in joints, in analogy with antibody-induced rodent arthritis models.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Incidence of fragmented (fQRS) and predisposing factors in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) have not yet been established. Aim To examine incidence of fQRS, associated factors as well as predictive value in identifying site of coronary artery disease (CAD).Methods: Consecutive patients with ICD. Retrospective analysis of demographic, clinical and ECG data.Results: Of 382 patients, 163 (43%) had fQRS. They had more frequently history of MI, Q wave, lower left ventricular ejection fraction and prolonged ECG repolarisation indices. The presence of fQRS in more than one ECG localisation was associated with higher number of MI and ICD for secondary prevention. By combining fQRS with Q wave location, site of CAD could be predicted (total accuracy 84-95%).Conclusions: The fQRS is frequent in patients with ICD, especially those with CAD, more advanced cardiac disease and altered ECG repolarisation. The fQRS may improve ECG-based non-invasive identification of the site of CAD.</ab>

        <ab>INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of long-term health conditions (LTCs) continues to increase and it is normal for people to have several. Lifestyle is a core feature of the self-management support given to people with LTCs, yet it seems to fail to meet their needs. From a larger study exploring the experiences of this group, this paper reports on the role of food and mealtimes, and the effect of the nutritional advice on the lives of people with several LTCs. METHODS: The experiences of 16 people with several advanced LTCs were explored using multiple qualitative case studies. Over an 18-month period, contact with participants included monthly conversations, two longer, semi-structured interviews and one interview with their primary care clinicians. The data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There was profound social, psychological and cultural significance of food to the participants. These aspects of food were then described using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health. The approach to food and nutrition participants experienced in health care was closely associated with conventional weight management. They found this advice largely irrelevant and therefore ineffective. DISCUSSION: The pressure people with several LTCs experience during clinical encounters has perverse effects on wellbeing and reinforces an overall sense of failure. This research challenges the assumption that all people have the will, agency and income to follow the advice they receive about nutrition and exercise. Considering people's needs using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health offers clinicians a framework to re-conceptualise the core features of self-management support and provide realistic, compassionate care that will optimise the quality of life for people with multiple LTCs.</ab>

        <ab>Although care management approaches have potential to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs, little is known about the feasibility of these interventions in patients with complex substance use disorders (SUDs), which are characterized by psychosocial, psychological and/or medical needs and high acute healthcare utilization. We assessed the feasibility of recruitment, treatment engagement, compliance with follow-up assessments, and patients' use of a care management model (CMM) at one medical center. This pilot study enrolled patients with complex SUDs and high healthcare utilization in a prospective, 1-year open trial of a CMM adapted for specific needs of this patient population. Patients completed baseline assessment, monthly assessments of treatment progress and follow-up assessments at 6- and 12-months. Patients' use of CMM services were abstracted from medical records. Of 33 eligible patients approached, 23 (69.6%) men enrolled in the study. Approximately 59.1% of patients attended a CMM visit in ≥8 of 12 months enrolled. Patients completed monthly assessments in 4.9 (SD = 3.1) of 12 months enrolled, and 68.2% and 41.0% completed 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments, respectively. The most common CMM service delivered was care coordination/case management, followed by supportive counseling, motivational interviewing, and medication management. Recruitment and engagement results suggest that use of CMM for complex SUDs and high healthcare utilization is feasible. More robust outreach services may be needed to increase engagement among those who did not engage or lost contact with the CMM team. Additional research is needed to evaluate if CMM enhances retention, improves outcomes and reduces acute healthcare utilization of patients with complex SUDs.</ab>

        <ab>Sarcopenia is a major source of disability in older adults. However, limited data are available about sarcopenia components (i.e., muscle mass, strength, and function) and their relationship to psychosocial factors among older adults living in residential care apartment complexes (RCACs). The current study examined muscle mass, strength, and function and explored their relationship to self-efficacy for exercise, depressive symptoms, and social support in 31 RCAC residents. RCAC residents had lower muscle mass, strength, and function compared to values reported in studies of community-dwelling older adults. Men had higher muscle mass and strength than women. The current fi ndings showed a trend for individuals with high self-efficacy, without depressive symptoms, and with strong social support to present numerically greater muscle mass, strength, and function. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm the current study fi ndings and inform development of interventions implemented in RCAC settings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective To investigate the associations of balance confidence with physical and cognitive markers of well-being in older adults receiving government-funded aged care services and whether progressive resistance plus balance training could positively influence change. Design Intervention study. Setting Community-based older adult–specific exercise clinic. Participants Older adults (N=245) with complex care needs who were receiving government-funded aged care support. Interventions Twenty-four weeks of twice weekly progressive resistance plus balance training carried out under the supervision of accredited exercise physiologists. Main Outcome Measures The primary measure was the Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale. Secondary measures included the Short Physical Performance Battery; fall history gathered as part of the health history questionnaire; hierarchical timed balance tests; Geriatric Anxiety Index; Geriatric Depression Scale; Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, Loss of Weight scale; and EuroQoL-5 dimension 3 level. Results At baseline, better physical performance ( r =.54; P &lt;.01) and quality of life ( r =.52; P &lt;.01) predicted better balance confidence. In contrast, at baseline, higher levels of frailty predicted worse balance confidence ( r =−.55; P &lt;.01). Change in balance confidence after the exercise intervention was accompanied by improved physical performance (+12%) and reduced frailty (−11%). Baseline balance confidence was identified as the most consistent negative predictor of change scores across the intervention. Conclusions This study shows that reduced physical performance and quality of life and increased frailty are predictive of worse balance confidence in older adults with aged care needs. However, when a targeted intervention of resistance and balance exercise is implemented that reduces frailty and improves physical performance, balance confidence will also improve. Given the influence of balance confidence on a raft of well-being determinants, including the capacity for positive physical and cognitive change, this study offers important insight to those looking to reduce falls in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Distal radius fractures are associated with a high incidence of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. This study aims to evaluate the status of TFCC after the healing of distal radius fractures, and its clinical significance.Methods: Wrist arthroscopies were performed on 43 distal radius fractures, with an average age of 54 years old.Results: Twenty-six complete tears and 15 partial healed tears were noted. Five out of eight patients with intact TFCC tears had neither signs nor symptoms, while eight patients with TFCC tears had no complaint. While no association was found between ulnar wrist pain and TFCC tears, there was association between DRUJ instability and TFCC tears and fovea tears. The function outcome did not differ with respect to the integrity of TFCC.Conclusions: A large majority of TFCC tears remained unhealed after the union of distal radius fractures. However, not all patients with tear were symptomatic.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To evaluate the outcomes of rotational atherectomy for heavily-calcified side branches of coronary bifurcation lesions.Background: Side-branch (SB) preservation is clinically important but technically challenging in heavily-calcified non-left main true bifurcation lesions. SB rotational atherectomy (SB RA) is sometimes mandatory but the clinical outcomes are not well studied.Methods: We retrospectively studied the outcomes of patients who underwent RA at our institute for heavily calcified, balloon-uncrossable or-undilatable SB lesions over an approximately 5-year period (January 2011 to September 2016).Results: Two hundred and forty-four patients underwent main vessel only RA (SB-MV + RA group) and another 48 patients underwent SB RA (SB + MV ± RA group) for 49 side branches. The demographic variables were comparable between the two groups. However, patients underwent SB RA experienced more SB perforations and greater acute contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Among the SB RA patients, 30 (62.5%) underwent RA for both SB and MV (SB + MV + RA subgroup), whereas the other 18 underwent SB only RA (SB + MV-RA subgroup). Patients in these two subgroups could be completed with similar procedural, fluoroscopic durations, and contrast doses. The long-term MACE rate of SB RA was 27.1% over a mean follow-up period of 25.1 months with no differences between the two subgroups.Conclusions: RA for SB preservation in complex and heavily-calcified bifurcation lesions was feasible with high success rate and quite favorable long-term outcomes in the drug-eluting stent (DES) era. Given the higher rates in SB perforation and acute CIN, we recommend that SB RA should be conducted by experienced operators.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of RMMRs on medication regimen complexity, as assessed by a validated measure.Methods: Retrospective analysis of RMMRs pertaining to 285 aged care residents aged ≥ 65 years in Sydney, Australia. Medication regimen complexity was measured using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) at baseline, after pharmacists' recommendations (assuming that all of the pharmacists' recommendations were accepted by the General Practitioner (GP)), and after the actual uptake of pharmacists' recommendations by the GP. Differences in the regimen complexity was measured using the Wilcoxon sign rank test.Results: Pharmacists made 764 recommendations (average 2.7 recommendations per RMMR), of which 569 (74.5%) were accepted by GPs. The median MRCI at baseline in the sample was 25.5 (IQR = 19.0-32.5). No statistically significant differences were demonstrated in the MRCI scores after pharmacists' recommendations (p = 0.53) or after GPs' acceptance of these recommendations (p = 0.07) compared to the baseline.Conclusion: Our study revealed high acceptance of pharmacists' recommendations by GPs. This suggests that RMMRs are useful for identifying and resolving drug-related issues among residents of ACFs. However, our study failed to show a significant effect of RMMRs in reducing the medication regimen complexity, as measured by the MRCI. Further studies are needed to establish the association of medication regimen complexity and clinical outcomes in residents of ACFs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Health promotion is a key process of current health systems. Primary Health Care (PHC) is the ideal setting for health promotion but multifaceted barriers make its integration difficult in the usual care. The majority of the adult population engages two or more risk behaviours, that is why a multiple intervention might be more effective and efficient. The primary objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness and an implementation strategy of a complex multiple risk intervention to promote healthy behaviours in people between 45 to 75 years attended in PHC.Methods: This study is a cluster randomised controlled hybrid type 2 trial with two parallel groups comparing a complex multiple risk behaviour intervention with usual care. It will be carried out in 26 PHC centres in Spain. The study focuses on people between 45 and 75 years who carry out two or more of the following unhealthy behaviours: tobacco use, low adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern or insufficient physical activity level. The intervention is based on the Transtheoretical Model and it will be made by physicians and nurses in the routine care of PHC practices according to the conceptual framework of the "5A's". It will have a maximum duration of 12 months and it will be carried out to three different levels (individual, group and community). Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained measured by the tariffs of the EuroQol-5D questionnaire will be estimated. The implementation strategy is based on the "Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research", a set of discrete implementation strategies and an evaluation framework.Discussion: EIRA study will determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a complex multiple risk intervention and will provide a better understanding of implementation processes of health promotion interventions in PHC setting. It may contribute to increase knowledge about the individual and structural barriers that affect implementation of these interventions and to quantify the contextual factors that moderate the effectiveness of implementation.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03136211 .Retrospectively registered on May 2, 2017.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects an estimated 7 to 10 million people worldwide, and only symptomatic treatments are presently available to relieve the consequences of brain dopaminergic neurons loss. Neuronal degeneration in PD is the consequence of neuroinflammation in turn influenced by peripheral adaptive immunity, with CD4+ T lymphocytes playing a key role. CD4+ T cells may however acquire proinflammatory phenotypes, such as T helper (Th) 1 and Th17, as well as anti-inflammatory phenotypes, such as Th2 and the T regulatory (Treg) one, and to what extent the different CD4+ T cell subsets are imbalanced and their functions dysregulated in PD remains largely an unresolved issue.Methods: We performed two cross-sectional studies in antiparkinson drug-treated and drug-naïve PD patients, and in age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. In the first one, we examined circulating Th1, Th2, Th17, and in the second one circulating Treg. Number and frequency of CD4+ T cell subsets in peripheral blood were assessed by flow cytometry and their functions were studied in ex vivo assays. In both studies, complete clinical assessment, blood count and lineage-specific transcription factors mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells were independently assessed and thereafter compared for their consistency.Results: PD patients have reduced circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes, due to reduced Th2, Th17, and Treg. Naïve CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood of PD patients preferentially differentiate towards the Th1 lineage. Production of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α by CD4+ T cells from PD patients is increased and maintained in the presence of homologous Treg. This Th1-biased immune signature occurs in both drug-naïve patients and in patients on dopaminergic drugs, suggesting that current antiparkinson drugs do not affect peripheral adaptive immunity.Conclusions: The complex phenotypic and functional profile of CD4+ T cell subsets in PD patients strengthen the evidence that peripheral adaptive immunity is involved in PD, and represents a target for the preclinical and clinical assessment of novel immunomodulating therapeutics.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess clinical outcomes of Amphilimus Sirolimus-Eluting Stents (A-SES) as compared to Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents (ZES) in complex real-world diabetic patients.Background: Patients with diabetes mellitus represent one of the most challenging scenarios with high rates of restenosis and stent thrombosis in the current era of drug-eluting stents. Hence, we assessed the safety of A-SES versus ZES in complex diabetic patients.Methods: In this observational study, we analyzed all consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus referred to our center from November 2012 to November 2014. The primary outcome was target-lesion failure at 1-year follow-up.Results: A total of 165 consecutive diabetic patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with A-SES or ZES for stable coronary artery disease in our tertiary center. Using the Kaplan Meier method the cumulative incidence of target-lesion failure was 6.7% (5.9% A-SES versus 7.5% ZES, p=0.19) at 1-year follow-up. Event-free survival at 1year follow-up was similar (89.4% A-SES vs. 83.3% ZES, p=0.29). Interestingly, we did not find any cases of definite-, and only one case of probable stent thrombosis in this high risk cohort.Conclusion: In this real-world registry, A-SES and ZES seems to be associated with promising 1-year clinical safety outcomes following PCI in a contemporary cohort of high-risk diabetic patients. Our results should be considered hypothesis generating, as the clinical safety of A-SES has to be confirmed in a large trial.</ab>

        <ab>In the context of an aging population, both the need for home care services and its complexity of care have increased in many high-income countries. Yet, the definition of what constitutes complex care is largely elusive. This systematic review examined the conceptual definition of complex care within the home care environment using several social and health science databases for research published from 2000 to 2017. Of the 25 articles and reports identified, only 16 addressed complex care specifically and included older adults, aging, and/or home care. The results showed that complex care for older adults is primarily defined from a biomedical approach focusing on chronic disease and management and less commonly from the perspective of the social determinants of health. Future studies should consider the importance of the continuum of care needs from both the biomedical and the social determinants to adequately plan and provide care for older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the safety and performance of a gelling fibre dressing, with respect to wound exudate management, maceration and periwound skin conditions. Method: Complex (non-healing) surgical or chronic wounds healing by secondary intention were treated with a gelling fibre dressing (Biosorb, Acelity) as part of a prospective, two-centre case series product evaluation study. Dressing performance was evaluated at each change, and weekly for up to four weeks or until the wound healed, if this was in less than four weeks. The main outcome measure was dressing performance, wound bed and periwound skin condition. Results: A total of 15 patients, aged 26–87 years, were enrolled; 10 patients (66.7%) presented with chronic wounds including venous leg ulcers (VLUs), arterial leg ulcer, one mixed leg ulcer, pressure ulcer (PU), and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). The remaining wounds (33.3%) were postsurgical complex wounds healing by secondary intention, located in the upper leg, foot, abdomen, and sacrum. Mean wound area was 22.6±36.6cm2 (range: 1.3–144.0cm2). Treated wounds showed complete granulation in eight (53.0%) wounds, 75% granulation coverage in two (13.3%) wounds, 50% coverage in three (20.3%), and 25% coverage in two (13.3%) wounds. Patients evaluated the dressing effectiveness as ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ in 45% of cases, ‘moderate’ in 45%, and ‘poor’ in 10% of cases. Results of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) showed 70% of patients rated their pain as ‘low’ and 30% as ‘moderate’ at dressing removal. Clinicians' evaluation of dressing ability to absorb and retain wound exudate was rated ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ in 80% of cases, and moderate in 20% and poor in 10% of cases. Overall, clinicians' impression of the dressing performance was reported as ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ in 80% of cases and ‘moderate’ in 20% of cases. No patient had to be removed from the study due to adverse events directly related to the dressing or its performance. Conclusion: These clinical findings suggest the new gelling fibre dressing to be safe and effective in wound treatment of complex (non-healing) surgical or chronic wounds, to manage exudate effectively, and to optimise the conditions of wounds healing by secondary intention</ab>

        <ab>Background: Soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) is a biomarker of fibrin formation abnormally elevated in clinical situations of hypercoagulability.Objective: We investigated the association and predictive performance of SFMC for stroke, adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in a cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulant therapy.Design: During the second semester of 2007, we included 1226 AF outpatients stable on VKAs (INR 2.0-3.0) over a period of 6 months. SFMC levels were assessed at baseline. During 6.5 (IQR 4.4-8.0) years of follow-up, we recorded all ischemic strokes, adverse cardiovascular events (composite of stroke, acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome and cardiovascular death), cardiovascular deaths and all-cause deaths.Participants: All patients were recruited consecutively. We excluded patients with rheumatic mitral valves, prosthetic heart valves, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, hemodynamic instability, hospital admissions or surgical interventions within the preceding 6 months.Main Measures: SFMC levels were measured in plasma by immunoturbidimetry in an automated coagulometer (STALiatestFM, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France).Key Results: We recorded 121 (1.52%/year) ischemic strokes, 257 (3.23%/year) cardiovascular events, 67 (0.84%/year) cardiovascular deaths and 486 (6.10%/year) all-cause deaths. SFMC &gt;12 μg/mL was not associated with stroke but was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.31-2.26), cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.30-3.57) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.55). When SFMC &gt;12 μg/mL was added to the CHA2DS2-VASc, there were significant improvements in predictive performance, sensitivity and reclassification for adverse cardiovascular events (c-index: 0.645 vs. 0.660, p = 0.010; IDI = 0.013, p &lt; 0.001; NRI = 0.121, p &lt; 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (c-index: 0.661 vs. 0.691, p = 0.006; IDI = 0.009, p = 0.049; NRI = 0.217, p &lt; 0.001), but decision curves demonstrated a similar net benefit and clinical usefulness.Conclusions: In AF patients taking VKAs, high SFMC levels were associated with the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. The addition of SFMC to the CHA2DS2-VASc score improved its predictive performance for these outcomes, but failed to show an improvement in clinical usefulness.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Different strategies exist for dosing four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC4) for international normalized ratio (INR) reversal in the setting of life-threatening bleeding. Fixed doses ranging from 1000 IU to 1750 IU have demonstrated efficacy similar to weight-based dosing, however, few studies look exclusively at intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).Objective: Our aim was to evaluate whether a fixed dose of 1000 IU of PCC4 achieves INR reversal similar to weight-based dosing in patients with ICH who were anticoagulated with warfarin.Methods: We compared a weight-based dose vs. 1000 IU PCC4 between January 2014 and January 2017. The primary end point was achieving an INR &lt; 1.5. Secondary end points included in-hospital mortality, patient disposition, and reversal defined by INR &lt; 1.6.Results: A total of 31 patients were included in the weight-based group and 30 were included in the fixed-dose group, with baseline INRs of 2.98 and 2.84, respectively (p = 0.39). Twenty-two patients (71%) achieved an INR &lt; 1.5 in the weight-based group vs. 16 (53%) in the fixed-dose group (p = 0.15), while 25 (81%) achieved an INR &lt; 1.6 in the weight-based group vs. 22 (73%) in the fixed-dose group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in the number of patients discharged to home (19% vs. 20%; p = 0.95) or in-hospital mortality (26% vs. 27%; p = 0.93).Conclusions: We found a non-statistically significant difference in warfarin reversal to an INR goal of &lt; 1.5 when comparing a fixed dose of 1000 IU PCC4 and a weight-based dose for ICH. Further studies correlating clinical outcomes with INR reversal are needed.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To determine whether the UK Functional Assessment Measure (UK FIM+FAM) fits the Rasch model in stroke patients with complex disability and, if so, to derive a conversion table of Rasch-transformed interval level scores. Methods: The sample included a UK multicentre cohort of 1,318 patients admitted for specialist rehabilitation following a stroke. Rasch analysis was conducted for the 30-item scale including 3 domains of items measuring physical, communication and psychosocial functions. The fit of items to the Rasch model was examined using 3 different analytical approaches referred to as "pathways". Results: The best fit was achieved in the pathway where responses from motor, communication and psychosocial domains were summarized into 3 super-items and where some items were split because of differential item functioning (DIF) relative to left and right hemisphere location (χ² (10) = 14.48, p = 0.15). Re-scoring of items showing disordered thresholds did not significantly improve the overall model fit. Conclusion: The UK FIM+FAM with domain superitems satisfies expectations of the unidimensional Rasch model without the need for re-scoring. A conversion table was produced to convert the total scale scores into interval-level data based on person estimates of the Rasch model. The clinical benefits of interval-transformed scores require further evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the scaling properties of the Patient Categorisation Tool (PCAT) as an instrument to measure complexity of rehabilitation needs. Design: Psychometric analysis in a multicentre cohort from the UK national clinical database. Patients: A total of 8,222 patents admitted for specialist inpatient rehabilitation following acquired brain injury. Methods: Dimensionality was explored using principal components analysis with Varimax rotation, followed by Rasch analysis on a random sample of n = 500. Results: Principal components analysis identified 3 components explaining 50% of variance. The partial credit Rasch model was applied for the 17-item PCAT scale using a "super-items" methodology based on the principal components analysis results. Two out of 5 initially created super-items displayed signs of local dependency, which significantly affected the estimates. They were combined into a single superitem resulting in satisfactory model fit and unidimensionality. Differential item functioning (DIF) of 2 super-items was addressed by splitting between age groups (&lt; 65 and &gt; 65 years) to produce the best model fit (χ²/df= 54.72, p = 0.235) and reliability (Person Separation Index (PSI) = 0.79). Ordinal-to-interval conversion tables were produced. Conclusion: The PCAT has satisfied expectations of the unidimensional Rasch model in the current sample after minor modifications, and demonstrated acceptable reliability for individual assessment of rehabilitation complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Background and purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to describe the impact of one aspect of an academic-clinical partnership that showed how assigning nurse practitioner faculty to deliver home-based primary care services to clinically complex patients would decrease rehospitalizations and emergency department visit rates. Methods: Rehospitalizations and emergency department visits of a cohort of 82 patients were recorded from April 15, 2016 to August 25, 2016 and compared with the same cohort during the two pre-home care inception periods (6 months and 1 year) using insurance claims-based data. Conclusions: Compared with the 1-year pre-home care inception period, there was a decrease of 23.7% in emergency department visits and 34.9% decrease in rehospitalizations after the implementation of the home-based primary care program and a decrease of 35.6% in emergency department visits and 59.4% decrease in rehospitalizations compared with 6 months of pre-home care inception. Implications for practice: Allowing nurse practitioners with full practice authority to deliver home-based primary health care services to homebound, chronically ill, recently discharged, and/or disabled patients can decrease costs and promote optimum health care in this population. In addition, these programs provide valuable learning experiences for nurse practitioner students and their preceptors.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The lack of an antidote against factor Xa inhibitors in case of major bleeding or need for urgent surgery is a concern to clinicians. Guidelines on managing major bleeding in patients under anticoagulation with a factor Xa inhibitor suggest several hemostatic agents to reverse the effect, but there is no consensus regarding the choice of drug or appropriate dose. The ability of prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VIIa to reverse the effect of factor Xa inhibitors has been evaluated in animal studies, in vitro studies, and healthy volunteers, but not yet in randomized clinical studies.Case Presentation: We report a consecutive case series of patients under factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban) treatment who received activated prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse the anticoagulation effect before emergency cardiovascular surgery. Patient 1, a 63-year-old white man, was operated with replacement of the aortic valve; patient 2, a 65-year-old white man, underwent heart transplantation; patient 3, a 68-year-old white man, was operated for acute type A aortic dissection. They all received activated prothrombin complex concentrate 25 IU/kg immediately before surgery. In two of the cases, the global coagulation assay thromboelastometry (ROTEM™) was performed before and after administering activated prothrombin complex concentrate. The ROTEM™ clotting time was reduced from 1900 seconds to 740 seconds and from 1482 to 807 seconds, respectively, after administering a dose of 25 IU/kg activated prothrombin complex concentrate. The apixaban concentration before reversal was within the range considered to be the therapeutic level in all cases. No bleeding complications occurred during surgery, but one case was complicated with bleeding postoperatively. No thromboembolic complications were observed during or after surgery.Conclusions: Activated prothrombin complex concentrate 25 IU/kg reversed the anticoagulation effect of apixaban effectively and safely before emergency cardiovascular surgery.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Therapeutic options for rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonist therapy include 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC4) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). These agents have unique requirements for preparation, potential adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness considerations.Objective: To retrospectively assess whether our process for collaborative prospective review and pharmacy preparation facilitates timely and safe warfarin reversal with PCC4 as compared with FFP and to compare effectiveness and safety of the agents in practice.Methods: We performed a retrospective, single-center, before and after cohort study of patients requiring warfarin reversal for life-threatening bleeding or urgent invasive procedures over an 18-month period. The primary end point was time from ordering of reversal agent to administration. Secondary end points measured time to therapeutic effect and rates of adverse events.Results: Of 98 patients studied, 72 received FFP, and 26 received PCC4. The median times from ordering to administration of FFP and PCC4 were 69 and 44 minutes, respectively ( P = 0.015). Median time from ordering to end of infusion was significantly shorter for PCC4 compared with FFP (54 vs 151 minutes, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001). In all, 72% of PCC4 patients and 28% of FFP patients achieved the goal international normalized ratio (INR) of ≤1.4 at the first INR check ( P &lt; 0.0001). Adverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients in each group.Conclusion: In routine clinical practice incorporating collaborative prospective review and dispensing from the institution's pharmacy, PCC4 was associated with faster administration, a higher rate of INR correction, and similar rates of adverse events compared with FFP.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To describe the relationship between nursing facility resident risk conditions and signs and symptoms at time of acute transfer and diagnosis of conditions associated with potentially avoidable acute transfers (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, dehydration, pressure sores). Design: As part of a demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospital transfers, Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project clinical staff collected data on residents who transferred to the emergency department (ED) or hospital. Cross‐tabulations were used to identify associations between risk conditions or symptoms and hospital diagnoses or death. Mixed‐effects logistic regression models were used to describe the significance of risk conditions, signs, or symptoms as predictors of potentially avoidable hospital diagnoses or death. Setting: Indiana nursing facilities (N=19). Participants: Long‐stay nursing facility residents (N=1,174), who experienced 1,931 acute transfers from November 2014 to July 2016. Measurements: Participant symptoms, transfers, risk factors, and hospital diagnoses. Results: We found that 44% of acute transfers were associated with 1 of 6 potentially avoidable diagnoses. Symptoms before transfer did not discriminate well among hospital diagnoses. Symptoms mapped into multiple diagnoses and most hospital diagnoses had multiple associated symptoms. For example, more than two‐thirds of acute transfers of residents with a history of CHF and COPD were for reasons other than exacerbations of those two conditions. Conclusion: Although it is widely recognized that many transfers of nursing facility residents are potentially avoidable, determining “avoidability” at time of transfer is complex. Symptoms and risk conditions were only weakly predictive of hospital diagnoses.</ab>

        <ab>Occam's razor proposes that the simplest solution is preferable; however, in the science of cancer and cancer symptoms, simple solutions have been elusive. Understanding individual symptoms continues to confound the science community, and symptom cluster science appears to be an incredibly complex schema of individual symptoms co-occurring and interacting with one another. The simplest explanation for symptom clusters would be a common underlying mechanism at the human genome level. Such a finding could greatly simplify and perhaps revolutionize symptom management.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Surgical treatment of complicated aortic valve endocarditis often is challenging, even for experienced surgeons. We aim at demonstrating a standardized surgical approach by stentless bioprostheses for the treatment of aortic valve endocarditis complicated by paravalvular abscess formation.Methods: Sixteen patients presenting with aortic valve endocarditis (4 native and 12 prosthetic valves) and paravalvular abscess formation at various localizations and to different extents were treated by a standardized approach using stentless bioprostheses. The procedure consisted of thorough debridement, root replacement with reimplantation of the coronary arteries and correction of accompanying pathologies (aortoventricular and aortomitral dehiscence, septum derangements, Gerbode defect, total atrioventricular conduction block, mitral and tricuspid valve involvement).Results: All highly complex patients included (14 males and 2 females; median age 63 years [range 31-77]) could be successfully treated with stentless bioprostheses as aortic root replacement. Radical surgical debridement of infected tissue with anatomical recontruction was feasible. Although predicted operative mortality was high (median logarithmic EuroSCORE I of 40.7 [range 12.8-68.3]), in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were favorable (18.8 and 12.5% respectively).Conclusions: Repair of active aortic valve endocarditis complicated by paravalvular abscess formation and destruction of the left ventricular outflow tract with stentless bioprosthesis is a valuable option for both native and prosthetic valves. It presents a standardized approach with a high success rate for complete debridement, is readily available, and yields comparable clinical outcomes to the historical gold standard, repair by homografts. Additionally, use of one type of prosthesis reduces logistical issues and purchasing costs.</ab>

        <ab>Older people living in residential aged care often experience complex persistent pain because of the presence of multiple comorbidities and geriatric syndrome. Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration needs to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population can be improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary suffering.</ab>

        <ab>Prevalence rates are still lacking for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) diagnoses based on the new ICD-11 criteria. In a nationwide representative German sample (N = 2524; 14-99 years), exposure to traumatic events and symptoms of PTSD or CPTSD were assessed with the International Trauma Questionnaire. A clinical variant of CPTSD with a lower threshold for core PTSD symptoms was also calculated, in addition to conditional prevalence rates dependent on trauma type and differential predictors. One-month prevalence rates were as follows: PTSD, 1.5%; CPTSD, 0.5%; and CPTSD variant, 0.7%. For PTSD, the highest conditional prevalence was associated with kidnapping or rape, and the highest CPTSD rates were associated with sexual childhood abuse or rape. PTSD and CPTSD were best differentiated by sexual violence. Combined PTSD and CPTSD (ICD-11) rates were in the range of previously reported prevalences for unified PTSD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition; ICD-10). Evidence on differential predictors of PTSD and CPTSD is still preliminary.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose was to explore the presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) complex as a surrogate marker of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the middle ear fluid, and to clarify the correlation between its quantifiable level and hearing outcome in patients with otitis media associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).Study Design: Prospective study.Setting: Tertiary referral center.Patients: Nine AAV patients presenting with otitis media.Intervention: Collection of the fluid samples from middle ear.Main Outcome Measure: The quantifiable levels of MPO-DNA complex using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results: The quantifiable levels of MPO-DNA complex in patients with AAV were significantly higher than those in controls (p &lt; 0.001). In particular, both ANCA-positive and -negative cases indicated higher levels of MPO-DNA complex compared with the controls (p = 0.004 and p = 0.006, respectively). The significant negative correlations were observed between the level of MPO-DNA complex and the functional hearing values for air (r = -0.82, p = 0.009) and bone conduction (r = -0.73, p = 0.028), respectively.Conclusion: This analysis is the first to reveal the presence of elevated levels of MPO-DNA complex in the middle ear fluid, suggesting the pathogenic role of NETs in otitis media associated with AAV. NETs may be a valuable biomarker for use in clinical decision-making and predicting hearing outcome, regardless of ANCA status.</ab>

        <ab>Background: self-care is critical to enable community-dwelling older adults to live independently. Complex interventions have emerged as a strategy to support self-care, but their effectiveness is unknown. Our objective was to review systematically their effectiveness on both positive (increased scores in self-rated health, Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, quality of life) and negative aspects (increased incidence of falls, fear of falling, hospital and nursing home admission, increased depression score), and to determine which intervention components explain the observed effects. Methods: CINAHL, MEDLINE, British Nursing Index, PsycInfo and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from January 2006 to October 2016. Randomised controlled trials providing at least two of these components: individual assessment, care planning or provision of information were reviewed. Outcomes were pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. Results: twenty-two trials with 14,364 participants were included with a low risk of bias. Pooled effects showed significant benefits on positive aspects including self-rated health [standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.17] and the mental subscale of quality of life (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.09-0.80) as well as on the negative aspect of incidence of falls [odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.79]. There was no significant improvement in ADL, IADL, overall quality of life, fear of falling, reduction in health service utilisation or depression levels. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis did not identify any specific component or characteristic in complex interventions which explained these effects. Conclusion: based on current evidence, supporting self-care in community-dwelling older adults using complex interventions effectively increases self-rated health, reduces the occurrence of falls and improves the mental subscale of quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Children with medical complexity receive care from many healthcare providers including home healthcare nurses. The objective of our study, based on a conceptual framework, was to describe the relationships between parents/ caregivers of children with medical complexity and home healthcare nurses caring for these children. We collected qualitative data in 20 semistructured in-depth interviews (15 English, 5 Spanish) with 26 primary caregivers of children with medical complexity, and 4 focus groups of 18 home healthcare nurses inquiring about their experiences about home healthcare nursing services for children with medical complexity. During an iterative analysis process, we identified recurrent themes related to caregiver-nurse relationships. Our study showed that: (1) caregiver-nurse relationships evolved over time and were determined by multiple factors; (2) communication and trust were essential to the establishment of caregiver-nurse relationships; (3) both caregivers and nurses described difficulties of navigating physical, professional, personal, and emotional boundaries, and identified strategies to maintain these boundaries; and (4) good caregiver-nurse relationships helped in the care of children with medical complexity, reduced caregiver burden, resulted in less stress for nurses, and was a factor in nurse retention. We conclude that trusted relationships between caregivers and nurses are important to the home care of children with medical complexity. Interventions to develop and maintain good caregiver-nurse relationships are necessary.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in their daily lives. Background: A better understanding of the personal experience of frailty in the context of fluctuating ill‐health has the potential to contribute to the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. Design: An ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a community matron service in a large city in the North of England. Methods: Up to six care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11 months. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4‐year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method. Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: &lt;italic&gt;Fluctuating ill‐health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living&lt;/italic&gt;. Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person‐centred care . Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Contemporary rotating hinge knee (RHK) prosthesis has shown improved survival rates over earlier generations. However, reports of high complication and mechanical failure rates highlight the need for more clinical outcome data in the complex primary and revision setting. The purpose of this study is to report our results of using a contemporary rotating hinge for complex primary and revision total knee arthroplasty.Methods: Using a prospectively maintained surgical database, 79 knees in 76 patients who underwent an RHK of a single design for either a complex primary (14 knees) or revision total knee arthroplasty (65 knees) were identified. This included 19% undergoing an RHK for periprosthetic joint infection and 32.9% who had concomitant extensor mechanism repair. The cohort consisted of 60 women and 16 men with a mean age of 66.7 years (range 39-89) at the time of surgery. Patient outcomes were assessed using Knee Society Scores and radiographs were reviewed for signs of wear and loosening. Failure rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.Results: At a minimum of 2 years, 13 patients had died and 4 were lost to follow-up, leaving 62 knees in 59 patients who were followed for a mean of 55.2 months (range 24-146). The mean Knee Society Scores improved from 35.7 to 66.2 points (P &lt; .01). The incidence of complications was 38.7%. The most common complications were periprosthetic fracture, extensor mechanism rupture, and periprosthetic infection. Estimated survival was 70.7% at 5 years.Conclusion: Despite improvements in design and biomaterials, there remains a relatively high complication rate associated with the use of a modern RHK implant. While aseptic loosening was rare, periprosthetic fracture, infection, and extensor mechanism failure were substantial emphasizing the complex nature of these cases.</ab>

        <ab>Background: As the population of the United States ages, chronic diseases increase and treatment options become technologically more complicated. As such, patients' autonomy, or the right of patients to accept or refuse a medical treatment, may become a more pressing and complicated issue. This autonomy rests upon a patient's capacity to make a decision. As more older, cognitively and functionally impaired individuals enter healthcare systems, quality assessments of decision-making capacity must be made. These assessments should be done in a time-efficient manner at a patient's bedside by the patient's own physician. Thus, a clinically practical tool to assist in decision-making capacity assessments could help guide physicians in making more accurate judgments.Objectives: To create a clinically relevant Bedside Capacity Assessment Tool (BCAT) to help physicians make timely and accurate clinical assessments of a patient's decision-making capacity for a specific decision.Setting: The Department of Medicine, Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell .Participants: Geriatric medicine fellows, palliative medicine fellows, and internal medicine residents (n = 30).Measurements: Subjects used the BCAT to assess the decision-making capacity of patients described in 10 written, clinically complex capacity assessment vignettes. Subjects' conclusions were compared to those of experts.Results: The subjects' and experts' assessments of capacity had a 76.1 percent rate of agreement, with a range of 50 percent to 100 percent. With removal of three complex outlier vignettes, the agreement rate reached 83.2 percent.Conclusion: The strong correlation between the two groups-one of physicians in training utilizing the BCAT and the other of specialists in this area-suggests that the BCAT may be a useful adjunct for clinicians who assess decision-making capacity in routine practice. The range indicates that further refinement and testing of this tool is necessary. The potential exists for this tool to improve capacity assessment skills for physicians in clinical practice.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of elective, robot-assisted choledochotomy and common bile duct exploration (RCD/CBDE) compared to open surgery for ERCP refractory choledocholithiasis.Method: A prospective database of all RCD/CBDE has been maintained since our first procedure in April 2007 though April 2016. With ethics approval, this database was compared with all contemporaneous elective open procedures (OCD/CBDE) performed since March 2005. Emergency procedures were excluded from analysis. Cost analysis was calculated using a micro-costing approach. Outcomes were analyzed on the basis of intent-to-treat. A p value of 0.05 denoted statistical significance.Results: A total of 80 cases were performed since 2005 compromising 50 consecutive, unselected RCD/CBDE and 30 OCD/CBDE. Comparing RCD/CBDE to OCD/CBDE there were no significant differences between groups with respect to age (65 ± 20 vs. 67 ± 18 years, p = 0.09), gender (14/30 vs. 16/25 male/female, p = 0.52), ASA class or co-morbidities. The mean duration of surgery for RCD/CBDE trended longer compared to OCD/CBDE (205 ± 70 min vs. 174 ± 73 min, p = 0.08). However, there was significant reduction in postoperative complications with RCD/CBDE versus OCD/CBDE (22% vs. 56%, p = 0.002). Median hospital stay was also significantly reduced (6 vs 12 days, p = 0.01). The net overall hospital cost for RCD/CBDE was lower ($8449.88 CAD vs. $11671.2 CAD).Conclusion: In this single-centre, cohort study, robotic-assisted CD/CBDE for ERCP refractory common bile duct stones provides the dominating strategy of improved patient outcomes with a reduction of overall cost.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Joint contractures in nursing home residents limit the capacity to perform daily activities and restrict social participation. The purpose of this study was to develop a complex intervention to improve participation in nursing home residents with joint contractures.Methods: The development followed the UK Medical Research Council framework using a mixed-methods design with re-analysis of existing interview data using a graphic modelling approach, group discussions with nursing home residents, systematic review of intervention studies, structured 2-day workshop with experts in geriatric, nursing, and rehabilitation, and group discussion with professionals in nursing homes.Results: Graphic modelling identified restrictions in the use of transportation, walking within buildings, memory functions, and using the hands and arms as the central target points for the intervention. Seven group discussions with 33 residents revealed various aspects related to functioning and disability according the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health domains body functions, body structures, activities and participation, environmental factors, and personal factors. The systematic review included 17 studies with 992 participants: 16 randomised controlled trials and one controlled trial. The findings could not demonstrate any evidence in favour of an intervention. The structured 2-day expert workshop resulted in a variety of potential intervention components and implementation strategies. The group discussion with the professionals in nursing homes verified the feasibility of the components and the overall concept. The resulting intervention, Participation Enabling CAre in Nursing (PECAN), will be implemented during a 1-day workshop for nurses, a mentoring approach, and supportive material. The intervention addresses nurses and other staff, residents, their informal caregivers, therapists, and general practitioners.Conclusions: In view of the absence of any robust evidence, the decision to use mixed methods and to closely involve both health professionals and residents proved to be an appropriate means to develop a complex intervention to improve participation of and quality of life in nursing home residents. We will now evaluate the PECAN intervention for its impact and feasibility in a pilot study in preparation for an evaluation of its effectiveness in a definitive trial.Trial Registration: German clinical trials register, reference number DRKS00010037 (12 February 2016).</ab>

        <ab>Background: Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are a major clinical feature in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Spontaneous bleeding can be life threatening, and appropriate information and proper surveillance and management are important to limit morbidity and mortality. Because TSC is a rare disease, patients are at risk of suboptimal medical management. Our aim was to investigate patients' and parents' knowledge about renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and to identify current routines for renal follow-up.Methods: A questionnaire survey was initiated by the French Reference Centre on TSC. It was distributed in France through university hospitals and the patients' association (2009-2011), and to patients registered by the Norwegian National Centre for Rare Epilepsy-Related Disorders (2013-2014). Contingency tables with Chi-Square test for independence (with Yates Continuity Correction) and Pearson-Chi-Square value were used for correlation statistics.Results: We included 357 patients (France, n=257; Norway n=100). Most participants knew that TSC is associated with AMLs. However, 42 % did not know about the risk of AMLrelated bleeding, and 37 % had been informed about the risk of bleeding only after the age of 15 years. Furthermore, 14 % did not know whether they themselves or their child had AMLs. Patients had less knowledge than parents. Medical consultations and patient associations were the main sources of information. Among 30 % of patients, renal imaging was not received at all, or not conducted every 1-3 years, as recommended by current guidelines. Regular imaging was more frequent in patients with AMLs &lt; 15 years, than in patients with AMLs ≥ 15 years. Ultrasound was the most frequently used imaging modality.Conclusions: Knowledge of renal AML in TSC patients and their parents was lower than expected, and follow-up by renal imaging was suboptimal for a substantial proportion of patients. Patients and parents should be informed about the risk and symptoms of renal bleeding, at the latest when the patient is 15 years. Monitoring the growth of AMLs should be standardized to comply with guidelines. Transition between adolescence and adulthood is a high-risk period and ensuring appropriate follow-up at this time is particularly important.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Pulmonary disease (PD) caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is increasing worldwide. We conducted a systematic review of studies that include microbiologic outcomes to evaluate current macrolide-based treatment regimens.Methods: We searched literature published before April 2017 by using the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Risk of bias in randomized trials was assessed using the Cochrane tool.Results: We retrieved 333 citations and evaluated 42 studies including 2,748 patients: 18 studies were retrospective chart reviews, 18 were prospective, and six were randomized. The weighted average proportion of sputum culture conversions in macrolide-containing regimens after subtracting posttreatment microbiologic recurrences was 52.3% (95% CI, 44.7%-59.9%). Using the triple-drug regimens recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) achieved treatment success in 61.4% (95% CI, 49.7%-72.5%), which further increased to 65.7% (95% CI, 53.3%-77.4%) when drugs were taken for at least 1 year by patients who were macrolide susceptible and had previously untreated MAC. The overall risk of bias was low in five of the six randomized trials. However, selective outcome reporting because of a posteriori exclusion of initially included patients (14.0%), uncompleted treatment (17.6%), and inconsistent use of outcome parameters (17 definitions of treatment success) hampered the comparison of nonrandomized trials.Conclusions: To date, randomized studies on treatment outcome in patients with MAC PD are scarce. Long-term treatments with ATS-recommended regimens for patients who are macrolide susceptible are superior to other macrolide-based therapies. A standardized definition of treatment success and genotypic distinction between reinfection and relapse by means of pretreatment and posttreatment identification of MAC species in cases of microbiologic recurrences may help to optimize evaluation of treatment regimens in the future.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The efficacy of Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) for the management of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is supported by evidence, but its treatment effect remains generally modest. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been advocated as an adjunct intervention to enhance the effect of motor imagery approaches in pain populations.Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of GMI+active tDCS compared with the GMI+sham tDCS in the treatment of CRPS type I.Methods: A total of 22 patients (n=11/group) were randomly assigned to the experimental (GMI+tDCS) or placebo (GMI+sham tDCS) group. GMI treatments lasted 6 weeks; anodal tDCS was applied over the motor cortex for 5 consecutive days during the first 2 weeks and once a week thereafter. Changes in pain perception, quality of life, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, anxiety and mood were monitored after 6 weeks of treatment (T1) and 1-month posttreatment (T2).Results: GMI+tDCS induced no statistically significant reduction in pain compared with GMI+sham tDCS. Although we observed significant group differences in kinesiophobia (P=0.012), pain catastrophizing (P=0.049), and anxiety (P=0.046) at T1, these improvements were not maintained at T2 and did not reached a clinically significant difference.Discussion: We found no added value of tDCS combined with GMI treatments for reducing pain in patients with chronic CRPS. However, given that GMI+sham tDCS induced no significant change, further studies comparing GMI+tDCS and tDCS alone are needed to further document tDCS's effect in CRPS.</ab>

        <ab>Mental health conditions are underdiagnosed and undertreated in older veterans, as with all older adults. Social workers bring an important perspective to the interdisciplinary team for the care of older veterans with mental health conditions. In this study authors assessed 50 older veterans referred for mental health treatment (mean age = 74.52 years, SD = 6.48) with standardized measures of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and cognitive impairment. At initial assessment, 24 percent had moderate depression, 30 percent had PTSD, and 62 percent (n = 31) had (mostly mild) cognitive impairment based on cut scores. These conditions were often comorbid with each other and with social (60 percent), retirement (26 percent), bereavement (32 percent), and financial (36 percent) stressors. Depression improved after three months of treatment [t(30) = 2.12, p = .04], but those with comorbid PTSD or social stressors had more depressive symptoms at follow-up [R2 = .36, F(4, 26) = 3.57, p = .02]. Interdisciplinary care is essential to address the multiple comorbidities and practical complexities of geriatric mental health care. Social workers play a valuable role on the interprofessional team in addressing these complexities.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Adverse events during hospitalization are a major worry considering their frequency and their burden. Many could be avoided by immediate identification of at-risk patients at admission and adapted prevention. The complexity of a patient's medication regimen immediately available at admission is a good indicator of the complexity of the patient's condition. This study aims to determine whether the electronic Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) at admission is associated with complications during hospitalization.Design: We performed a multilevel logistic regression model, adjusted for age and sex.Setting: Premier Perspective™ database, a clinical and financial information system from 417 US hospitals.Participants: Adults hospitalized for more than 3 days in a medical ward and included in Premier's Perspective™ database for 2006.Intervention(s): Multilevel logistic regression.Main Outcome Measure: Association of the MRCI and complications during hospitalization, defined as in-hospital death, hospital-acquired infection, pressure ulcers; and need for highly technical healthcare, identified as the secondary introduction of catecholamines.Results: In total, 1 592 383 admissions were included. The median MRCI at admission was 13 [interquartile range: 9-19]. The higher the MRCI, the higher the adjusted odds ratio of the following: in-hospital mortality, hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers and the secondary introduction of catecholamines.Conclusions: Our results suggested that the MRCI at admission was correlated with patient complexity, independent of age. Considering that patients with complex conditions pose a heavier workload for staff, measuring MRCI at admission could be used to allocate resources in medical wards at an institutional level. The MRCI might be a useful tool to assess the management of care.</ab>

        <ab>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a complex pain disorder that can emerge after limb trauma or a lesion in the peripheral nervous system. Typical features include continuing pain, sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor, and trophic changes as well as edema. These signs provide the basis of CRPS diagnosis. A detailed description of the signs, symptoms, and medical history of CRPS could potentially facilitate an earlier and more accurate diagnosis. The aim of this study was to provide such a description, on the basis of epidemiological measures, clinical presentation, and a thorough description of pain sensations. Some signs (eg, differences of skin temperature &gt;1°C), which have been thought to be crucial for diagnosis, were less common than assumed. We identified 11 distinct etiological triggers, which cover more than 99% of the study participants. We developed a weighted score on the basis of the most decisive data, which achieved a sensitivity of .869 and a specificity of .829, compared with .819 and .679 for the Budapest criteria. The weighted diagnostic criteria may help to better aid in distinguishing CRPS from other pain disorders.Perspective: This article provides a retrospective epidemiological analysis of 1,043 CRPS patients compared with 421 patients with other pain disorders. The findings could potentially facilitate a more reliable and earlier diagnosis of CRPS, a better differentiation from other pain disorders, and ultimately in a more targeted and effective therapy.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The PACE-UP trial demonstrated positive effects of a pedometer-based walking intervention on objective physical activity (PA) outcomes at three and 12 months in 45-75-year-old primary care patients, in postal and nurse-supported trial arms compared with controls. We explored associations between process evaluation measures and change in PA outcomes.Methods: The MRC framework guided process evaluation. Three quantitative measures (nurse session attendance [dose delivered], PA diary completion [fidelity] and pedometer use [fidelity]) were selected as independent variables in multi-level models estimating intervention effectiveness on PA outcomes (changes in step-counts and time in moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA] levels in ≥ 10-min bouts).Results: Dose: attending all three nurse sessions compared with 0-2 sessions was associated with an increase in steps/day at three and 12 months of 1197 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 627-1766) and 605 (95% CI = 74-1137), respectively; and MVPA in bouts (min/week) at three and 12 months by 74 (95% CI = 45-103) and 30 (95% CI = 3-57), respectively. Fidelity: postal and nurse groups showed strong positive associations of diary return with steps/day at three months: postal 1458 (95% CI = 854-2061), nurse 873 (95% CI = 190-1555). MVPA in bouts (min/week): postal 64 (95% CI = 33-94), nurse 50 (95% CI = 15-85). At 12 months, only the postal group effects remained statistically significant: steps/day 1114 (95% CI = 538-1689), MVPA 47 (95% CI = 18-75). Regular pedometer use in the postal group only was associated with higher three-month and 12-month steps/day: 1029 (95% CI = 383-1675) and 606 (95% CI = 22-1190), respectively, and with MVPA in bouts at three months: 40 (95% CI = 6-73).Conclusion: Process evaluation measures demonstrated significant associations with PA outcomes at three and 12 months. We cannot infer causality, but the associations between the process measures and PA outcomes suggest that they were important in enabling the trial changes observed and should be considered core components of the PACE-UP nurse and postal interventions. We have shown the MRC framework to be a useful tool for process evaluation of intervention implementation.Trial Registration: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN98538934 . Registered on 2 March 2012.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patients with serious chronic illness are at a greater risk of depersonalized, overmedicalized care as they move into later life. Existing intervention research on person-focused care for persons in this transitional period is limited. Objective: To test the effects of LifeCourse, a team-based, whole-person intervention emphasizing listening to and knowing patients, on patient experience at 6 months. Design: This is a quasi-experimental study with patients allocated to LifeCourse and comparison groups based on 2 geographic locations. Robust change-score regression models adjusted for baseline differences and confounding. Setting/Participants: Patients (113 intervention, 99 comparison in analyses) were individuals with heart failure or other serious chronic illness, cancer, or dementia who had visits to hospitals at a large multipractice health system in the United States Midwest. Measurements: Primary outcome was 6-month change in patient experience measured via a novel, validated 21-item patient experience tool developed specifically for this intervention. Covariates included demographics, comorbidity score, and primary diagnosis. Results: At 6 months, LifeCourse was associated with a moderate improvement in overall patient experience versus usual care. Individual domain subscales for care team, communication, and patient goals were not individually significant but trended positively in the direction of effect. Conclusion: Person-focused, team-based interventions can improve patient experience with care at a stage fraught with overmedicalization and many care needs. Improvement in patient experience in LifeCourse represents the sum effect of small improvements across different domains/aspects of care such as relationships with and work by the care team.</ab>

        <ab>Variations of the arterial and venous system of the abdomen and pelvis have important clinical significance in hepatobiliary surgery, abdominal laparoscopy, and radiological intervention. A case of double inferior vena cava (IVC) with complex interiliac communication and variation of the common hepatic artery (CHA) arising from superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in a 79-year-old male cadaver is presented. Both IVCs ascended on either side of the abdominal aorta. The left-sided IVC crossed anterior to the aorta at the level of the left renal vein. The union of both IVCs was at the level just above the right renal vein. The diameter of right-sided IVC, left-sided IVC and the common IVC were 16.73 mm, 21.57 mm and 28.75 mm, respectively. In the pelvic cavity, the right common iliac vein was formed by a union of right external and internal iliac veins while the formation of left common iliac vein was from the external iliac vein and two internal iliac veins. An interiliac vein ran from right internal iliac vein to left common iliac vein with an additional communicating vein running from the middle of this interiliac vein to the right common iliac vein. Another co-existence variation in this case was the origin of the CHA arising from the SMA with a suprapancreatic retroportal course. Clinical importance of double IVC are observed in retroperitoneal surgery, whole organ transplantation or radical nephrectomy, surgical ligation of the IVC or the placement of an IVC filter for thromboembolic disease. The variation of CHA has an important clinical significance in liver transplantation, abdominal laparoscopy and radiological abdominal intervention. (Folia Morphol 2018; 77, 1: 151-155).</ab>

        <ab>Background: Internationally, increasing attention is being paid to understanding patient experiences of health care. Within palliative care, the Views of Informal Carers -- Evaluation of Services (VOICES) questionnaire is commonly used for this purpose. Among its objectives is to ask family members if their relatives were treated with dignity at the end of life. This is regarded as useful for understanding the quality of the health care received. Aim: To highlight the differences between family members' reports of dignity in the care provided to their relatives at the end of life, as reported in the VOICES questionnaire, and their narratives about the care their relatives received. Methods: A total of 21 cognitive interviews were conducted during a New Zealand pilot of the VOICES questionnaire. Results: Discrepancies between ratings of dignity and the lived experience of care suggest that lay understandings of dignity may not be congruent with that of health care providers. Conclusions: Bereaved family members' self-reports of dignity in end-of-life care captured using survey methods alone are inadequate to understand the complex ways in which individuals conceptualise and experience dignity within a health care context. The authors advocate consideration of multiple, complementary approaches to gathering consumer experiences of end-of-life care, as well as research which enables service users to interrogate what dignity in care means in an end-of-life context.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The bedridden elderly with moderate-to-severe dementia account for a large proportion of the residents in nursing homes and form a specialized group requiring customized care in order to encourage their remaining functions, which determine the quality of their residual life. The purpose of this study was to search for ways to invigorate and foster the remaining functions of this complex-disability group, based on practical nursing strategies in nursing homes. Methods The qualitative thematic analysis was done by conducting in-depth interviews with 29 nurses working at 11 different nursing homes in South Korea. Results This study proposed four main themes and 19 sub themes as keys for providing specialized nursing care to the elderly with physical and cognitive disabilities. The main themes encourage the residents' remaining functions: (i) accurate identification of an elderly resident's physical, cognitive, and behavioral baseline is necessary in order to determine their functional levels; (ii) nurses provide meticulous management to support the remaining functions in order to prevent further deterioration; (iii) optimized know-how, based on accumulated experience and knowledge, is reflected in nursing strategies that maximize the effects of nursing interventions; and (iv) steady compliance with nursing guidelines and standards in nursing homes creates the best therapeutic environment and brings unexpected positive changes in the elderly's status. Conclusion A practical nursing strategy to target the group with a demented and complex disability in nursing homes was developed through thematic analysis of the empirical knowledge of nurses. The findings provide new insights for developing specialized nursing interventions and practical nursing models in long-term care facilities.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Tuberosity healing is known to be one of the factors that increase functional outcome in Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (rTSA). In fragility fractures, tuberosity healing is difficult to be achieved. The fragment stability and bone-forming agent application become strategies to overcome this problem. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefit of teriparatide application to promote tuberosity union in rTSA on four-part proximal humeral fractures to achieve better functional outcome.Methods: A retrospective study of a prospectively collected shoulder arthroplasty medical record was performed. Eleven patients were included in this analysis and consisted of two groups, teriparatide and no-teriparatide groups. Patients were evaluated on the range of motions and clinical outcome using the American Shoulder Elbow Surgeon (ASES) Shoulder Score and X-ray to determine tuberosity union. The group differences were analyzed by t-test or Mann-Whitney U test with SPSS version 20.0 for Windows.Results: The statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in mean age in both the groups. There were significant differences between teriparatide and no-teriparatide groups in external rotation (29.5° vs. 7.5°; p = 0.004), external rotation in 90° abduction (55° vs. 12.5°; p &lt; 0.020), forward flexion (120° vs. 105°; p = 0.002) range of motions, and ASES (84.5 vs. 74.6; p = 0.019). We found clinical difference between teriparatide and no-teriparatide groups in time to achieve the initial callus (33 ± 18.3 days vs. 150 ± 42.4 days) and tuberosity consolidation (165.8 ± 70.3 days vs. 315 ± 106.1 days).Conclusions: Teriparatide administration supports tuberosity repair results in a high tuberosity healing rate with restoration of external rotation after rTSA in acute complex proximal humeral fractures.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to identify factors associated with complex surgical wounds in the breasts and abdomen in outpatients. Method: observational case-control study involving 327 patients, distributed into 160 cases (complex surgical wound) and 167 controls (simple surgical wound). Data were extracted from the medical records and a binary logistic regression model was used for analysis, considering a significance level of 5%. Results: the factors associated with greater chance of occurrence of complex surgical wound were 18 to 59 years of age (p = 0.003), schooling &lt; 8 years (p = 0.049), radiotherapy (p &lt; 0.001), hysterectomy (p = 0.003), glycemia (≤ 99 mg/dL) and arterial hypertension (p = 0.033), while quadrantectomy (p = 0.025) served as a protective factor. Conclusion: radiotherapy was the most significant factor for surgical wound complications. Glycemic alteration was an unexpected result and shows the need for further studies related to this topic.</ab>

        <ab>Proposal: Model of early palliative care (PC) integrated in oncology is based on shared care from the diagnosis to the end of life and is mainly focused on patients with greater complexity. However, there is no definition or tools to evaluate PC complexity. The objectives of the study were to identify the factors influencing level determination of complexity, propose predictive models, and build a complexity scale of PC.Patients and Method: We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study in a cohort of advanced cancer patients with an estimated prognosis ≤ 6 months. An ad hoc structured evaluation including socio-demographic and clinical data, symptom burden, functional and cognitive status, psychosocial problems, and existential-ethic dilemmas was recorded systematically. According to this multidimensional evaluation, investigator classified patients as high, medium, or low palliative complexity, associated to need of basic or specialized PC. Logistic regression was used to identify the variables influencing determination of level of PC complexity and explore predictive models.Results: We included 324 patients; 41% were classified as having high PC complexity and 42.9% as medium, both levels being associated with specialized PC. Variables influencing determination of PC complexity were as follows: high symptom burden (OR 3.19 95%CI: 1.72-6.17), difficult pain (OR 2.81 95%CI:1.64-4.9), functional status (OR 0.99 95%CI:0.98-0.9), and social-ethical existential risk factors (OR 3.11 95%CI:1.73-5.77). Logistic analysis of variables allowed construct a complexity model and structured scales (PALCOM 1 and 2) with high predictive value (AUC ROC 76%).Conclusion: This study provides a new model and tools to assess complexity in palliative care, which may be very useful to manage referral to specialized PC services, and agree intensity of their intervention in a model of early-shared care integrated in oncology.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The practice of lead abandonment at the time of cardiac implantable electronic device upgrade remains a controversial topic but is affecting an increasing number of patients. Inherent risks include high-risk extractions of redundant leads when extraction is required at a later date.Objectives: We aimed to report our experience with transvenous lead extraction (TLE) at the time of device upgrade.Methods: All consecutive TLE procedures at the time of device upgrade at the Cleveland Clinic between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2012 were included (n = 503). Success and complications were defined according to the Heart Rhythm Society consensus document on TLE.Results: There were a total of 984 leads in place, and 719 were targeted with extraction (589 pacer and 130 defibrillator leads, 63 of them being dual-coil leads). In all patients, TLEs aimed to avoid abandoning leads. Concomitant lead management issues included lead malfunction (15%), previously abandoned leads (9%), vascular access occlusion (6%), or leads on advisory (3%). In most procedures (75.4%), special extraction tools were needed. The complete procedural and clinical success rates were 96.6% and 97.2%, respectively. During planned extractions, damage of coexisting leads occurred in 19 patients (3.8%), eventually requiring extraction. The major and minor complication rates were 1% and 1.4%, respectively.Conclusion: In a high-volume center, TLEs at the time of device upgrade were successful in the vast majority of patients with a low complication rate.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To estimate the prevalence of difficult venous access in complex patients with multimorbidity and to identify associated risk factors. Background In highly complex patients, factors like ageing, the need for frequent use of irritant medication and multiple venous catheterisations to complete treatment could contribute to exhaustion of venous access. Design A cross-sectional study was conducted. Methods 'Highly complex' patients ( n = 135) were recruited from March 2013-November 2013. The main study variable was the prevalence of difficult venous access, assessed using one of the following criteria: (1) a history of difficulties obtaining venous access based on more than two attempts to insert an intravenous line and (2) no visible or palpable veins. Other factors potentially associated with the risk of difficult access were also measured (age, gender and chronic illnesses). Univariate analysis was performed for each potential risk factor. Factors with p &lt; 0·2 were then included in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios were also calculated. Results The prevalence of difficult venous access was 59·3%. The univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that gender, a history of vascular access complications and osteoarticular disease were significantly associated with difficult venous access. The multivariable logistic regression showed that only gender was an independent risk factor and the odds ratios was 2·85. Conclusions The prevalence of difficult venous access is high in this population. Gender (female) is the only independent risk factor associated with this. Previous history of several attempts at catheter insertion is an important criterion in the assessment of difficult venous access. Relevance to clinical practice The prevalence of difficult venous access in complex patients is 59·3%. Significant risk factors include being female and a history of complications related to vascular access.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To identify factors influencing falls and the fear of falling among older adults with chronic diseases in Korea. Background The fear of falling and falls in older adults are significant health problems towards which healthcare providers should direct their attention. Further investigation is needed to improve nursing practice specifically decreasing risk of falls and the fear of falling in Korea. Design Descriptive, cross-sectional survey. Methods A convenience sample of 108 patients was recruited at the geriatric outpatient department of a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medication use, fall history, level of physical activity, activities of daily living, mobility, muscle strength, and a fear of falling were investigated. Student's t tests, chi-square tests and multiple linear regressions were used in statistical analysis. Results Thirty-six participants (33.3%) among 108 subjects reported experiencing ≥1 falls in the past year. Marital status and the use of antipsychotics were associated with falls, while other factors were not significantly related to falls. Only benign prostatic hypertrophy and polypharmacy were significantly related to the fear of falling in the analysis of the relationships between chronic disease, medication use and fear of falling. In the regression model, the number of comorbidities, level of physical activity, activities of daily living and mobility were predictors of a fear of falling. Medication use was marginally significant, in the model. Conclusion Increasing physical activity, functional fitness and physical independence is important to decrease the fear of falling, and to encourage active and healthy lives in older adults. Relevance to clinical practice The findings from this study provide evidence for the development of nursing interventions for older adults. We recommend early screening for a fear of falling and nursing interventions to decrease the fear of falling through enhancing physical activity level and function.</ab>

        <ab>Although i(17q) [i(17q)] is frequently detected in hematological malignancies, few studies have assessed its clinical role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We recruited a cohort of 22 CLL patients with i(17q) and described their biological characteristics, mutational status of the genes TP53 and IGHV and genomic complexity. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of the type of cytogenetic anomaly bearing the TP53 defect on the outcome of CLL patients and compared the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of i(17q) cases with those of a group of 38 CLL patients harboring other 17p aberrations. We detected IGHV somatic hypermutation in all assessed patients, and TP53 mutations were observed in 71.4% of the cases. Patients with i(17q) were more commonly associated with complex karyotypes (CK) and tended to have a poorer OS than patients with other anomalies affecting 17p13 (median OS, 44 vs 120 months, P = 0.084). Regarding chromosomal alterations, significant differences in the median OS were found among groups (P = 0.044). In conclusion, our findings provide new insights regarding i(17q) in CLL and show a subgroup with adverse prognostic features.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports finding from a nested qualitative study designed to elicit the views and perceptions of those who participated in a randomised controlled feasibility trial testing a non-pharmacological intervention, Respiratory Distress Symptom Intervention (RDSI), for the management of the breathlessness-cough-fatigue symptom cluster in lung cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 lung cancer patients, three caregivers and seven researchers involved in recruitment, consent, RDSI training and delivery and participant follow-up. Thematic analysis identified key considerations including: the importance of informed consent emphasising commitment to completion of paperwork and raising awareness of potential sensitivities relating to content of questionnaires; ensuring screening for the presence of symptoms reflects the language used by patients; appreciation of the commitment required from participants to learn intervention techniques and embed them as part of everyday life; conduct of interviews with patients who decline to participate; and conduct of serial interviews with those receiving RDSI to further inform its routine implementation into clinical practice. This study will inform the development of a fully powered follow-on trial testing the hypothesis that RDSI plus usual care is superior to usual care alone in the effective management of this symptom cluster in lung cancer.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the combined use of cryopreserved human umbilical cord (cUC) allograft and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in treating complex diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) with bone exposure and osteomyelitis. These types of wound are known to carry a high morbidity and mortality. Methods: A single-center, retrospective chart review was performed to assess the efficacy of the combined use of cUC with NPWT, by the same surgeon, to help promote the closure of complex DFUs presenting with biopsy-proven osteomyelitis. Change in wound size and volume, time to wound closure, and number of cUC applications were assessed. Results: We identified of 14 wounds in 13 patients, with an average initial wound area of (mean±standard devaition) 33.2±21.7cm² and wound volume of 52±26.2cm³. All achieved complete re-epithelialisation with an average time to closure of 24.0±10.9 weeks, using between 2-5 cUC applications. No adverse events were noted and none of the wounds required limb amputation during the a follow-up of 24 months for each patient. Conclusion: The results suggest that combined use of cUC and NPWT may be effective in improving the healing of complex DFUs that present with osteomyelitis. Prospective, randomised controlled trials are warranted to confirm this efficacy as well as its potential applications in other chronic wounds.

        <ab>Background: Angioplasty on the radial artery have been performed with good success rates in patients with critical hand ischemia. We sought to assess the feasibility and safety of radial angioplasty on complex radial access in patients undergoing coronary angiography.Methods/material: A prospective series of procedures with complex radial/ulnar access to which radial-ulnar angioplasty (RU-A) was performed. We set goals of efficacy and safety that included the success rate of the procedure (need for ¨Crossover femoral¨) and the existence of radial pulse at one month.Results: 18 cases of RU-A out of 11,500 procedures from March 2010 to July 2016 (0.15%) were included. The majority of the patients were men with a variety of cardiovascular risk factors (age 71±9; 94% Hypertensive, 56% Diabetic, 18% chronic kidney disease). The most common indication for radial/ulnar angioplasty was severe arteriosclerotic stenosis. Angioplasty was performed with different types of over the wire peripheral balloons (Mean diameter 4,3±1 and mean length 42±15mm), in one case a stent implantation was needed. The success rate was 100% without vascular complications at 1-month clinical and vascular doppler follow-up.Conclusions: Radial/ulnar artery angioplasty is feasible and safe in selected patients undergoing elective angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention using complex forearm approach.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In Norway, as in many Western countries, a shift from institutional care to home care is taking place. Our knowledge is limited regarding which needs for nursing interventions patients being cared for in their home have, and how they are met. We aimed at assessing aspects of health and function in a representative sample of the most vulnerable home-dwelling elderly, to identify their needs for nursing interventions and how these needs were met.Methods: In this observational study we included patients aged 75+ living in their own homes in Oslo, who received daily home care, had three or more chronic diagnoses, received daily medication, and had been hospitalized during the last year. Focused attention and cognitive processing speed were assessed with the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), handgrip strength was used as a measure of sarcopenia, mobility was assessed with the "Timed Up-and-Go" test, and independence in primary activities of daily living by the Barthel Index. Diagnoses and medication were collected from electronic medical records. For each diagnosis, medication and functional impairment, a consensus group defined which nursing service that the particular condition necessitated. We then assessed whether these needs were fulfilled for each participant.Results: Of 150 eligible patients, 83 were included (mean age 87 years, 25% men). They had on average 6 diagnoses and used 9 daily medications. Of the 83 patients, 61 (75%) had grip strength indicating sarcopenia, 27 (33%) impaired mobility, and 69 (83%) an impaired TMT-A score. Median amount of home nursing per week was 3.6 h (interquartile range 2.6 to 23.4). Fulfilment of pre-specified needs was &gt;60% for skin and wound care in patients with skin diseases, observation of blood glucose in patients taking antidiabetic drugs, and in supporting food intake in patients with eating difficulties. Most other needs as defined by the consensus group were fulfilled in &lt;10% of the patients.Conclusions: We identified a very frail group of home-dwelling patients. For this group, resources for home nursing should probably be used in a more flexible and pro-active way to aim for preserving functional status, minimize symptom burden, and prevent avoidable hospitalisations.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To describe the prevalence of nursing diagnoses on admission among inpatient units and medical diagnoses and to analyse the relationship of nursing diagnoses to patient characteristics and hospital outcomes. Background Nursing diagnoses classify patients according to nursing dependency and can be a measure of nursing complexity. Knowledge regarding the prevalence of nursing diagnoses on admission and their relationship with hospital outcomes is lacking. Design Prospective observational study. Methods Data were collected for 6 months in 2014 in four inpatient units of an Italian hospital using a nursing information system and the hospital discharge register. Nursing diagnoses with prevalence higher or equal to 20% were considered as 'high frequency.' Nursing diagnoses with statistically significant relationships with either higher mortality or length of stay were considered as 'high risk.' The high-frequency/high-risk category of nursing diagnoses was identified. Results The sample included 2283 patients. A mean of 4·5 nursing diagnoses per patient was identified; this number showed a statistically significant difference among inpatient units and medical diagnoses. Six nursing diagnoses were classified as high frequency/high risk. Nursing diagnoses were not correlated with patient gender and age. A statistically significant perfect linear association (Spearman's correlation coefficient) was observed between the number of nursing diagnoses and both the length of stay and the mortality rate. Conclusion Nursing complexity, as described by nursing diagnoses, was shown to be associated with length of stay and mortality. These results should be confirmed after considering other variables through multivariate analyses. The concept of high-frequency/high-risk nursing diagnoses should be expanded in further studies.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Poor-quality transitions of care from hospital to home contribute to high rates of readmission after complex abdominal surgery. The Coordinated Transitional Care (C-TraC) program improved readmission rates in medical patients, but evidence-based surgical transitional care protocols are lacking. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an adapted surgical C-TraC protocol.Study Design: The intervention includes in-person enrollment of patients. Follow-up protocolized phone calls by specially trained surgical C-TraC nurses addressed medication management, clinic appointments, operation-specific concerns, and identification of red-flag symptoms. Enrollment criteria included pancreatectomy, gastrectomy, operative small bowel obstruction or perforation, ostomy, discharge with a drain, in-hospital complication, and clinician discretion. Engaged patients participated in the first phone call, which was within 48 to 72 hours of discharge and continued every 3 to 4 days. Patients completed the program once they and surgical C-TraC nurse agreed that no additional follow-up was needed or the patient was readmitted.Results: Two hundred and twelve patients were enrolled, October 2015 through April 2016, with a mean age of 56 years (range 19 to 89 years); 33% of patients were 65 years or older. Surgery sites included colon (46%), small bowel (16%), pancreas (12%), multivisceral (9%), liver (4.5%), retroperitoneum/soft tissue (4.5%), gastric (4%), biliary (2%), and appendix (1.5%). Refusal rate was 1% and engagement was 95%. At initial call, 47% of patients had at least 1 medication discrepancy (range 0 to 6). Mean number of calls from provider to patient was 3.2 (range 0 to 20, median 3).Conclusions: A phone-based transitional care protocol for surgical patients is feasible, with &lt;1% refusals and 95% engagement. Medication management is a prominent issue. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of surgical C-TraC on post-discharge healthcare use.</ab>

        <ab>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and sustained high blood glucose as prediabetes are an established comorbidity. People's experience in reconciling these long-term conditions requires deeper appreciation if nurses are to more effectively support person-centred care for people who have them. Our analysis explores the initial experience of people admitted to hospital with CVD who then find they also have sustained high blood glucose. Our methodology is informed by the philosophy of Gadamer and applies interpretive description to develop an interpretation of participant experiences. The major theme emerging from participant interviews was the 'invisible disequilibrium' characterised by three subthemes: 'losing equilibrium', 'becoming embattled' and 'evolving illness'. This study examines CVD and prediabetes in conjunction with the Gadamerian notion of the 'whole', as being in a social and emotional world in which illness is also a component part. We explore how participants lived within an 'invisible disequilibrium', with prediabetes frequently remaining unnoticed, while CVD was manifest. To identify multiple conditions and support effective intervention to manage them as part of person-centric care, nursing practice should explore the 'whole' of the person's experience, value people's knowledge as potential indicators of complex illness, thereby reducing the risk of accelerating complex illness.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Our objective is to identify the effect of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) by evaluating intraparenchymal hematoma expansion between initial and follow-up head CT at 5-24 h, in those with positive CTA spot sign (CTASS). CTASS is an independent predictor of hematoma growth (1). Acute ICH, regardless of etiology, can present with quick mental status decline often resulting in irreversible brain damage. Hematoma expansion appears to be a modifiable predictor of clinical outcome and an appropriate target for medical therapy. PCC is a procoagulant which is the agent of choice in warfarin-related ICH. We explore utility of PCC in all patients regardless of warfarin status.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with ICH at our NY State designated Stroke Center from Nov 2013 to Dec 2015. Twenty-three of the 85 patients with ICH received PCC, of which 8 had positive CTASS (E = 8). Four of the 62 patients without PCC, had a positive CTASS (C = 4). Interval change in ICH volume at 5-24 h was measured using ABC/2 formula, which is an accurate predictor of ICH volume (5).Results: Control group (C) showed increase in mean ICH volume of 46% (SD = 37.3%), whereas experimental group (E) showed a decrease of 13% (SD = 29.9%) (p value = 0.012).Conclusions: We found a strong statistical correlation favoring our hypothesis. Use of PCC in active ICH with positive CTASS resulted in overall decrease in the mean hematoma size at 24 h, whereas the control group showed an overall increase.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose:Over the past two decades, attempts have been made to describe the nurse’s role and functions in the inpatient stroke rehabilitation; however, the nursing contribution is neither clear nor well-defined. Previous studies have highlighted the need for research aimed at developing interventions in the neuro-nursing area. The objective of this paper was to describe the development of a nursing intervention aimed at optimising the inpatient rehabilitation of stroke patients by strengthening the role and functions of nursing staff. Method:A systematic approach was used, consistent with the framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions by the UK’s Medical Research Council (MRC). Based on qualitative methods and using the Behaviour Change Wheel’s (BCW) stepwise approach, we sought behaviours related to nursing staffs’ roles and functions. Results:We conducted a behavioural analysis to explain why nursing staff were or were not engaged in these behaviours. The nursing staff’s Capability, Opportunity and Motivation were analysed with regard to working systematically with a rehabilitative approach and working deliberately and systematically with the patient’s goals. Conclusion:We developed the educational intervention Rehabilitation 24/7. Following the MRC and the BCW frameworks is resource-consuming, but offers a way of developing a practical, well-structured intervention that is theory- and evidence based.</ab>

        <ab>Background Older persons with multimorbidity being cared for at home often have complex needs which cannot be met by one single caregiver. Interprofessional collaboration is therefore considered necessary if care is to be organised according to the needs of the older person. To achieve coherent health care, municipalities and county councils need to develop their collaboration. Aim The aim of this study was to illustrate how various professionals belonging to homemaker services, home care services in municipality and hospital-based home care services experience collaboration in caring for older persons with multimorbidity. Method A hermeneutic approach was used. Eleven informants participated in the study and were individually interviewed. Findings The findings show that collaboration between players comprises various types of experiences which influence not only the staff who are involved in collaboration but also the outcome of the collaboration itself. The informants' experience of collaboration was defined by distrust and trust and by insecurity and security. To focus on patients' needs and to develop the collaboration further, it was important for informants to take the relations into account and have a reflective and questioning approach. This attitude resulted in a feeling of trust and security, and a flexible and critical approach without boundary drawings between basic and specialised care. Conclusion and relevance of practice Complex situations cannot be solved with simple models. Instead, a flexible approach appears necessary with focus shifting from structures to interpersonal relations and interactions. Therefore, the different professionals have to work as a transprofessional team where close interactions, flexibility and improvisation are keys to success. The transprofessional team approach is suggested to have the potential to take the competence of all staff into account when high-quality home health care to older persons with multimorbidity is to be provided by multiple caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To systematically review clinical outcomes associated with medication regimen complexity in older people. Design Systematic review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane library. Setting Hospitals, home, and long-term care. Participants English-language peer-reviewed original research published before June 2016 was eligible if regimen complexity was quantified using a metric that considered number of medications and at least one other parameter, regimen complexity was calculated for participants' overall regimen, at least 80% of participants were aged 60 and older, and the study investigated a clinical outcome associated with regimen complexity. Measurements Quality assessment was conducted using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Results Sixteen observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Regimen complexity was associated with medication nonadherence (2/6 studies) and higher rates of hospitalization (2/4 studies). One study found that participants with less-complex medication administration were more likely to stop medications when feeling worse. One study each identified an association between regimen complexity and higher ability to administer medications as directed, medication self-administration errors, caregiver medication administration hassles, hospital discharge to non-home settings, postdischarge potential adverse drug events, all-cause mortality, and lower patient knowledge of their medication. Regimen complexity had no association with postdischarge medication modification, change in medication- and health-related problems, emergency department visits, or quality of life as rated by nursing staff. Conclusion Research into whether medication regimen complexity is associated with nonadherence and hospitalization has produced inconsistent results. Moderate-quality evidence from four studies (two each for nonadherence and hospitalization) suggests that medication regimen complexity is associated with nonadherence and higher rates of hospitalization.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Voltage-gated Kv1 potassium channel complex (VGKC) autoantibodies subtyped for leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated-proteinlike 2 (CASPR2), and Kv IgGs have a spectrum of neurological presentations. Painful polyneuropathy is seen in some patients, but nerve pathology descriptions are lacking.Methods: Clinicopathologic features were studied in subtyped VGKC-autoantibody-seropositive patients who had undergone nerve biopsies.Results: Five patients were identified, 1 LGI1 IgG positive and 1 CASPR2 IgG positive, but all negative for Kv1.1-, 1.2-, 1.6-subtyped IgG autoantibodies. Median symptom duration was 17 months. Pain was the predominant symptom; 3 had mild sensory loss and/or weakness. Histopathological abnormalities were limited to axonal loss in 3. None had mononuclear cellular infiltrates. Electron micrographs revealed no interstitial abnormalities. Three patients reported marked improvement in pain with immunotherapy.Conclusions: The nerve biopsy histopathology of patients subtyped for LGI1 and CASPR2 IgGs within the VGKC-complex spectrum disorders shows either normal density or axonal fiber loss without inflammatory infiltrates. A reversible neural hyperexcitable mechanism is considered to be the cause of this painful polyneuropathy. Muscle Nerve 55: 520-525, 2017.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT Background Nursing plays a central role in facilitating care transitions for complex older adults, yet there is no consensus of the components of nurse-led care transitions interventions to facilitate high quality care transitions among complex older adults. A structured expert panel was established with the purpose of identifying effective nurse-led care transition interventions. Methods A modified Delphi consensus technique based on the RAND method was employed. Panelists ( n = 23) were asked to individually rate a series of statements derived from a realist synthesis of the literature for relevance, feasibility and likely impact. Statements receiving an aggregate score of ≥75% (7/9) were reviewed and revised at a face-to-face consensus meeting. A second round of rating following the same process as round one was used, followed by a final ranking of the statements. Results The five highest ranked intervention components and contextual factors were: (a) educating and coaching patients, their family members and caregivers about self-management skills; (b) ensuring patients, their family members and caregivers are aware of follow-up medical appointments and postdischarge care plan; (c) using standardized documentation tools and comprehensive communication strategies during care transitions; (d) optimizing nurses' roles and scopes of practice across the care transitions spectrum; and (e) having strong leadership, strategic alignment and accountability structures in organizations to enable quality care transitions for the complex older person population. Linking Evidence to Action Key insights on optimizing the nurses' roles and scope of practice during care transitions included having nurses provide 'warm hand-offs' and serve as the 'go-to person.' The panel also identified current challenges to optimizing the nurses' roles and scope of practice across care transition points. Future research is required to determine effective nurse-led intervention components and in which context do they work or do not.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To explore current knowledge of medical assessment units (MAUs) with specific reference to older people with complex needs and to stimulate new topics and questions for future policy, research and practice. Methods A scoping review was conducted using an integrated-latent thematic approach. Results This review provides a unique perspective on MAUs and older people which is framed using four themes: efficiency, effectiveness, equity and time. Eighteen articles were reviewed. Most (14) articles reported on efficiency and effectiveness while none reported explicitly on equity. Time was identified as a fourth, latent theme within the literature. Conclusion Findings from this review indicate that future policy, research and practice relating to MAUs should focus on older people with complex needs, patient-centred metrics and those MAU characteristics most likely to deliver positive health outcomes to this particular cohort of patients.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Nursing staff working with intellectually disabled in-patients experience unique stress factors that can influence their personal well-being and work performance. Objectives: To compile a profile of stress factors experienced by nursing staff working with intellectually disabled in-patients at the Free State Psychiatric Complex (FSPC). Methods: This descriptive study included 89 nursing staff members from this environment. A questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic information and determine personal and occupational stressors. The data were summarised by frequencies and percentages (categorical variables) and means or percentiles (numerical variables). Results: Most participants were aged between 46 and 55 (41.2%), female (93.2%) and black (93.2%), and 76.7% had children or dependant minors. The main stressors among participants were pressure providing financially for their children and dependant minors (71.2%), caring for them (39.4%) and fearing them moving away (25.8%). Occupational stressors included high workload (66.3%), lack of decision-making by superiors (58.1%), underpayment (53.5%), endangerment of physical health (52.3%) and safety (50.0%), working hours (51.2%), pressure of expectations from superiors (48.8%), uncertainty of employment (48.8%), work responsibilities (47.7%) and perceiving that skills and training were not appreciated. They experienced stress regarding health issues such as hyper- and hypotension (35.3%). Because of stress 34.5% of participants took leave, 34.5% developed depression and 14.3% had panic attacks. Conclusion: Most of the respondents experienced personal and occupational stress that influenced their health, which poses serious challenges for the management of the FSPC. Security should be upgraded, medical and psychological support for the staff and care facilities for their dependants should be provided, and financial problems experienced by these staff members should be addressed. The workload of the nursing staff at FSPC needs urgent attention. This can be done by means of a workforce analysis to determine minimum staffing levels for nursing.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Recent evidence indicates that home telemonitoring of chronic patients reduces the use of healthcare resources. However, further studies exploring this issue are needed in primary care.Objectives: To assess the impact of a primary care-based home telemonitoring intervention for highly unstable chronic patients on the use of healthcare resources.Methods: A one-year follow-up before and after exploratory study, without control group, was conducted. Housebound patients with heart failure or chronic lung disease, with recurrent hospital admissions, were included. The intervention consisted of patient's self-measurements and responses to a health status questionnaire, sent daily from smartphones to a web-platform (aided by an alert system) reviewed by healthcare professionals. The primary outcome measure was the number of hospital admissions occurring 12 months before and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and number of emergency department attendances. Primary care nurses were mainly in charge of the telemonitoring process and were assisted by the general practitioners when required.Results: For the 28 patients who completed the follow-up (out of 42 included, 13 patients died and 1 discontinued the intervention), a significant reduction in hospitalizations, from 2.6 admissions/patient in the previous year (standard deviation, SD: 1.6) to 1.1 (SD: 1.5) during the one-year telemonitoring follow-up (P &lt;0.001), and emergency department attendances, from 4.2 (SD: 2.6) to 2.1 (SD: 2.6) (P &lt;0.001) was observed. The length of hospital stay was reduced non-significantly from 11.4 to 7.9 days.Conclusion: In this small exploratory study, the primary care-based telemonitoring intervention seemed to have a positive impact decreasing the number of hospital admissions and emergency department attendances.</ab>

        <ab>Aims The aim of this study was to explore the extent to which Australian child and family health nurses work with families with complex needs and how their practice responds to the needs of these families. Background Many families with young children face challenges to their parenting capacity, potentially placing their children at risk of poorer developmental outcomes. Nurses increasingly work with families with mental health problems, trauma histories and/or substance dependence. Universal child health services must respond effectively to these challenges, to address health inequalities and to promote the best outcomes for all children and families. Design The descriptive study used cross-sectional data from the first national survey of child and family health nurses in Australia, conducted during 2011. Methods Survey data reported how often, where and how child and family health nurses worked with families with complex needs and their confidence in nursing tasks. Findings Many, but not all, of the 679 respondents saw families with complex needs in their regular weekly caseload. Child and family health nurses with diverse and complex caseloads reported using varied approaches to support their clients. They often undertook additional professional development and leadership roles compared with nurses who reported less complex caseloads. Most respondents reported high levels of professional confidence. Conclusion For health services providing universal support and early intervention for families at risk, the findings underscore the importance of appropriate education, training and support for child and family health professionals. The findings can inform the organization and delivery of services for families in Australia and internationally.</ab>

        <ab>Aim and objectives To investigate staff perception of the changing complexity of mothers and infants admitted to two residential parenting services in New South Wales in the decade from 2005-2015. Background For many mothers with a young child, parenting is difficult and stressful. If parenting occurs within the context of anxiety, mental illness or abuse it often becomes a high-risk situation for the primary caregiver. Residential parenting services provide early nursing intervention before parenting problems escalate and require physical or mental health focused care. Design A qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured interview questions was used as phase three of a larger study. Data were gathered from 35 child and family health nurses and ten physicians during eight focus groups. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) dealing with complexity; (2) changing practice; and (3) appropriate knowledge and skills to handle greater complexity. Conclusions There was a mix of participant opinions about the increasing complexity of the mothers presenting at residential parenting services during the past decade. Some of the nurses and physicians confirmed an increase in complexity of the mothers while several participants proposed that it was linked to their increased psychosocial assessment knowledge and skill. All participants recognised their work had grown in complexity regardless of their perception about the increased complexity of the mothers. Relevance to clinical practice Australian residential parenting services have a significant role in supporting mothers and their families who are experiencing parenting difficulties. It frequently provides early intervention that helps minimise later emotional and physical problems. Nurses are well placed to work with and support mothers with complex histories. Acknowledgement is required that this work is stressful and nurses need to be adequately supported and educated to manage the complex presentations of many families.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to explore nurses' experiences working on a chronic ventilator-dependent unit with a predominance of elderly Orthodox Jewish patients at the end of life. Little is known about how cultural complexity creates differences between nurses' and family's expectations for patient care at the end of life. A qualitative study of 27 nurses was conducted using focus groups. Early interviews led to the expansion of the original question to include exploring nurses' moral distress. Content analysis revealed 3 categories of themes, one of which is highlighted in this article. The main finding was an incongruence of perspectives, described as depth-of-field dissimilarity, in which the focus and depth of perspective depend on the person doing the looking. This study suggests that depth-of-field dissimilarity can be used to develop educational strategies, clinical interventions, and research to address moral distress and cultural complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Millions of patients receive vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy worldwide. Annually 0.2-1 % of all VKA users develops an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is administered to restore the INR ≤ 1.5 in an attempt to limit hematoma growth. In order to facilitate PCC dosing, our hospital recently changed from a variable dose based on bodyweight, baseline- and target-INR, to a fixed 1000 IU fIX PCC dosing protocol for ICH.Methods: In a before and after design, we compared successful achievement of an INR ≤ 1.5 with a fixed dosing strategy versus the variable dosing strategy of PCC in patients presenting with intracranial bleeding complications of VKA. Data of the two cohorts of patients were retrospectively collected from medical records.Results: A median dosage of 1750 IU was given per patient in the variable dose group (n = 25) versus 1000 IU in the fixed dose group (n = 28). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 96 % achieved an INR ≤ 1.5 after an initial dose in the variable dose cohort compared to 68 % in the fixed dose cohort (p = 0.01). An additional dose was given in 2 (8 %) versus 9 (32 %) patients, respectively (p = 0.04). The median door-to-PCC-order time was 42 versus 32 min (p = 0.37) and the door-to-needle time was 81, respectively 60 min (p = 0.42).Conclusion: The fixed dose protocol necessitates additional PCC infusions more frequently to achieve a target INR ≤ 1.5. Door-to-order and door-to-needle time were shorter but, in this small cohort, not significantly so. The effect on clinical outcome remains unknown.</ab>

        <ab>Progressive resistance plus balance training (PRBT) has been demonstrated as effective in reducing later life physical disability, falls risk and poor health, even among those with complex health care needs. However, few studies have examined the influence of PRBT on health service utilisation, cognitive wellbeing and training modality acceptance or undertaken a cost benefit analysis. This project will investigate the broad scope benefits of PRBT participation among community-dwelling older Australians receiving Government supported aged care packages for their complex health care needs. Using a modified stepped-wedge design, 248 community-dwelling adults 65 years and older with some level of government support aged care have been randomised into the study. Those randomised to exercise undertake six months of twice weekly machine-based, moderate to high intensity, supervised PRBT, followed by a six month unsupervised, unsupported follow-up. Controls spend six months undertaking usual activities, before entering the PRBT and follow-up phases. Data are collected at baseline and after each of the six month phases. Measures include level of and change in health and care needs, body composition, muscle capacity, falls, sleep, quality of life, nutritional and mental health status. In addition, acceptance and engagement is determined through telephone and focus group interviews complementing a multi-model health cost benefit evaluation. It is hypothesised this study will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of PRBT in improving primary and secondary health outcomes for older adults with aged care needs, and will support the value of this modality of exercise as an integral evidence-based service model of care.</ab>

        <ab>This paper recounts the process of undertaking a randomised controlled trial which was designed to examine the effectiveness of an intervention for socially isolated older people aged 75 years and over. It describes the reasons for early cessation of the study and raises the implications of this outcome for policy, practice and research. The intervention under investigation was designed to alleviate loneliness and foster companionship. It involves participants being linked with a small group of others through a teleconferencing system with each group being facilitated by trained volunteers. There was a requirement to recruit and train a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 60 volunteers over 1 year to facilitate 20 friendship groups to meet the number of older people required to be recruited to the study. Problems with recruiting and retaining the volunteer workforce by the voluntary sector organisation, who were commissioned to do so, led to the study closing even though older people were recruited in sufficient numbers. The paper draws upon analysis of various data sources from the study to identify the potential reasons. The discussion raises considerations regarding the extent of infrastructure required to deliver community services to vulnerable user groups at scale, identifies some of the issues that need to be addressed if such volunteer-initiated services are to be successful and informs future research programmes in this area.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: We evaluate the clinical and functional outcome of open primary repair of acute TFCC tears in distal radius fracture, when there is gross intraoperative distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability after fixation of the distal radius, in the absence of an ulnar styloid fracture or when the ulnar fracture fragment is too small to be fixed.Methods: A retrospective review of our institution's distal radius fracture database over a 4-year period (January 2010 to December 2013). A total of 12 (1.38%) out of 3379 patients had an open TFCC repair in the same setting as fixation of distal radius. Assessment of outcome involved the analysis of objective and subjective clinical and functional outcomes.Results: All patient regained Activities of Daily Living (ADL) independence; eleven out of 12 patients (91.7%) returned to pre-injury function and 8 out of 11 patients (72.7%) returned to their jobs. DRUJ stability was preserved in 10 patients (83.3%) with 10 patients (83.3%) having grip strength of at least 50%, compared to the uninjured hand, and 7 (58.3%) with grip strength of more than or equal to 75%. Complications of surgery identified can be classified into 4 broad categories: infection, neurological complications, persistent DRUJ instability and prolonged pain.Conclusion: The authors believe a primary open repair of the TFCC should be considered when patients present with instability during intra-operative DRUJ ballottement test after distal radius fixation, in the absence of an ulnar styloid fracture or when the ulnar fracture fragment is too small to be fixed.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses issues concerning case management of the wishes of medically complex older patients. Topics covered include grouping of chronically ill patients into active and healthy, medically challenging and nearing the end of life categories, the need for case managers to discuss end-of-life issues with physicians and patients, and the importance of assessing patients' attitudes towards respirators and feeding tubes.</ab>

        <ab>Causality of the relationship between the objective quality outcomes of care and patient satisfaction has been questioned in many studies. Consequently, it is highly important to study potential confounders in order to improve reliability and validity of patient satisfaction surveys and enable comparisons between objective and subjective outcomes. This study aimed to test the effect of item-level response rate on the results of patient satisfaction surveys and its interaction with another potential confounding factor, patient age. The data included 39 surveys with balanced Likert-scale items. The surveys were systematically gathered from PubMed and had been published 2005–2014. The relationship between the item-level patient satisfaction and item-level response rate was almost without exception positive when the overall patient satisfaction was &gt;4.2 on a traditional 1–5 scale and patients were middle-aged or older. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the relationship between item-level patient satisfaction and item-level response rate is situational, and generalisations regarding the size of the correlation should be made with caution. Controlling for item-level response rate and patient age, simultaneously, is necessary to improve validity of patient satisfaction surveys. The present study calls for novel age-specific approaches to deal with missing data.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Movement changes in autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias are suggested to occur many years before clinical manifestation. Detecting and quantifying these changes in the preclinical phase offers a window for future treatment interventions and allows the clinician to decipher the earliest dysfunctions starting the evolution of spinocerebellar ataxia. We hypothesized that quantitative movement analysis of complex stance and gait tasks allows to (i) reveal movement changes already at early stages of the preclinical phase when clinical ataxia signs are still absent and to (ii) quantify motor progression in this phase.Methods: A total of 46 participants (14 preclinical spinocerebellar ataxia mutation carriers [spinocerebellar ataxias 1,2,3,6], 9 spinocerebellar ataxia patients at an early stage; 23 healthy controls) were assessed by quantitative movement analyses of increasingly complex stance and walking tasks in a cross-sectional design.Results: Body sway in stance and spatiotemporal variability in tandem walking differentiated between preclinical mutation carriers and healthy controls (P &lt; .01). Complex movement conditions allowed one to discriminate even those mutation carriers without any clinical signs in posture and gait (SARAposture&amp;gait  = 0; P &lt; .04). Multivariate regression analysis categorized preclinical mutation carriers on a single-subject level with 100% accuracy within a range of 10 years to the estimated onset. Movement features in stance and gait correlated significantly with genetically estimated time to onset, indicating a gradual increase of motor changes with increasing proximity to disease manifestation.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for subclinical motor changes in spinocerebellar ataxia, which allow to discriminate patients without clinical signs even on a single-subject basis and may help capture disease progression in the preclinical phase. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.</ab>

        <ab>Heart failure is a complex condition to manage and patients often have more than one comorbidity. There is a wealth of evidence for treatment of heart failure as a condition but a paucity of evidence for diuretic therapy and symptom control. This case study reflects the complexities of symptom management and decision-making in a patient with heart failure reduced ejection fraction, chronic kidney disease and hyponatraemia. This article considers the evidence base for diuretic therapy in this patient group and reviews non-pharmacologic interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Complex older patients represent about half of all acute public hospital admissions in Australia. People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed. This paper offers a theoretical proposition of ‘Failure to Maintain’ as a conceptual framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of ‘Failure to Maintain’. Hospital focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). ‘Failure to Maintain’ offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, this vulnerable population. Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide patient focussed care, and avoid ‘Failing to Maintain’. The research field of acute geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Cryopreserved amniotic suspension allograft (CASA) is a regenerative tissue suspension containing amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid components used for soft-tissue repair, replacement, and reconstruction. The aim of this case series is to examine its effects in different wound types. Method: In a retrospective series CASA was applied to chronic non-healing wounds. All patients were treated at a single center between June 2013 and December 2014. The criterion for application of CASA was lack of progress toward wound healing despite standard treatments and adjuvant therapies. Results: We assessed five patients aged between 39 to 86 years old. Three patients had surgical/radiation wounds, one had a sacral pressure ulcer, and one had a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). All patients experienced progressive improvement in wound area and volume during treatment with CASA. One patient (postmastectomy tissue necrosis) required surgical closure in conjunction with removal of retained sutures. CASA applied topically and subcutaneously was particularly well suited to application in these wounds with large sinus tracts or undermining. All five patients experienced complete wound closure following one to two applications of CASA over 5 to 22 weeks. Conclusion: This series highlights the effective use of CASA in recalcitrant large soft-tissue wounds, DFUs, and deep wounds with tendon exposure. Declaration of interest: This study was supported by a grant from Derma Sciences (Princeton, NJ, US).</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Advances in wound treatment have yielded successful approaches to complex wound closure through plastic surgery or other staged surgical methods. However, not all patients or wounds are candidates for such increasingly rigorous levels of interventions. The exploration of non-surgical treatment options that promote anatomical and functional tissue replacement on an outpatient basis without donor site morbidity is necessary to maximise opportunities for patient mobility and rehabilitation. The native components found in human placental membranes may offer alternative properties for the clinical management of these complex wounds. Method: A 10-month, single-centre effectiveness review was conducted on the clinical outcomes in patients (n=12) treated with Grafix, a viable intact cryopreserved human placental membrane (vCPM), for complex wounds characterised by exposed bone, tendon, muscle, or hardware. Wounds were treated with routine standard of care in addition to weekly grafting with a vCPM. Results: The average baseline wound area and duration at presentation were 17.5cm² and 11.2 weeks. All twelve cases resulted in granulation over the exposed structures followed by complete wound re-epithelialisation without the concomitant use of negative pressure wound therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or surgical intervention. The mean 4-week percentage area reduction was 62.5%. The mean time to closure was 10 weeks with a mean graft use of 8.1 grafts. Of the wounds seven (58%) presented with exposed tendon associated with an actively moving joint, the functional integrity of which was maintained with a return to the previous range of motion upon wound closure. Conclusion: These outcomes illustrate that vCPM is a clinically effective option in the non-surgical management of complex wounds in the outpatient setting, contributing to timely definitive closure without the risk of associated donor site morbidity.

        <ab>Aims and objectives To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. Background Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched. Design An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism. Methods The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. Results Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions. Conclusions This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention. Relevance to clinical practice Increased focus on musculoskeletal conditions and moving and handling implications is required.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To develop and optimise a primary care-based complex intervention (CARE Plus) to enhance the quality of life of patients with multimorbidity in the deprived areas. Methods Six co-design discussion groups involving 32 participants were held separately with multimorbid patients from the deprived areas, voluntary organisations, general practitioners and practice nurses working in the deprived areas. This was followed by piloting in two practices and further optimisation based on interviews with 11 general practitioners, 2 practice nurses and 6 participating multimorbid patients. Results Participants endorsed the need for longer consultations, relational continuity and a holistic approach. All felt that training and support of the health care staff was important. Most participants welcomed the idea of additional self-management support, though some practitioners were dubious about whether patients would use it. The pilot study led to changes including a revised care plan, the inclusion of mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques in the support of practitioners and patients, and the stream-lining of the written self-management support material for patients. Discussion We have co-designed and optimised an augmented primary care intervention involving a whole-system approach to enhance quality of life in multimorbid patients living in the deprived areas. CARE Plus will next be tested in a phase 2 cluster randomised controlled trial.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: This article explores the complexities of leprosy-related stigma and the potential effectiveness of a socio-economic intervention in Cirebon District, Indonesia. Methods: A qualitative approach was adopted. 53 people affected by leprosy were interviewed, and 17 focus group discussions were conducted among people affected by leprosy, community and religious leaders, and health providers and other key persons who were all purposively selected. Results: People affected by leprosy face major socio-economic consequences. This was confirmed by key persons. Several opportunities for a possible socioeconomic intervention were perceived, as also the barriers. People affected by leprosy are constrained by certain aspects of the health system (e.g., the health providers' negative attitudes), views in society (e.g., misunderstandings about the condition, stigma), and the physical and social consequences of the disease (impairments, feelings of shame). Study participants identified strategies to deal with these barriers, as well as specific activities for a socio-economic intervention; in particular, the training of staff responsible for implementation. Conclusion and Implications: Socio-economic interventions in the field of leprosy need to anticipate the barriers and develop strategies to deal with them. Cooperation between people working in the health system and those in the welfare / financial system is needed, to improve the quality of life of people affected by leprosy.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between polypharmacy with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and medication regimen complexity with HRQoL in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Methods: A cross-sectional study of 383 residents from six Australian RACFs was conducted. The primary exposures were polypharmacy (≥9 regular medications) and the validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). The outcome measure was staff informant rated quality of life assessed using the Quality of Life Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) scale. Covariates included age, sex, Charlson's comorbidity index, activities of daily living, and dementia severity. Logistic quantile regression was used to characterize the association between polypharmacy and QoL-AD (model 1) and MRCI and QoL-AD (model 2). Results: The median age of the 383 residents was 88 years and 297 (78 %) residents were female. In total, 63 % of residents were exposed to polypharmacy and the median MRCI score (range) was 43.5 (4-113). After adjusting for the covariates, polypharmacy was not associated with either higher or lower QoL-AD scores (estimate −0.02; 95 % confidence interval (CI) −0.165, 0.124; p = 0.78). Similarly, after adjusting for the covariates, MRCI was not associated with either higher or lower QoL-AD scores (estimate −0.0009, 95 % CI −0.005, 0.003; p = 0.63). Conclusions: These findings suggest that polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity are not associated with staff informant rated HRQoL. Further research is needed to investigate how specific medication classes may impact change in quality of life over time.</ab>

        <ab>Complex lower extremity ulcers with exposed bone, tendon, muscle, and/or joint capsule as well as multiple comorbidities including diabetes, ischemia, and underlying osteomyelitis are difficult to heal and associated with high morbidity and mortality and high rates of amputation. A retrospective review was performed to assess healing of 31 patients presenting with 33 complex foot ulcers with a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of osteomyelitis treated by the same surgeon at a single wound care center by the following treatment regimen: sharp debridement, resection of infected bone when necessary, open cortex, antibiotics, and application of cryopreserved umbilical cord (cUC). The average ulcer size was 15.6 ± 17.7 cm2 (0.4-73.95 cm2). Overall, 26 out of the 33 wounds achieved complete closure (78.8%). Five patients were lost to follow-up and one patient expired during the course of treatment, not believed to be treatment related. Of the remaining 27 wounds in patients not lost to follow-up, 26 achieved complete healing with an average time to healing of 16 weeks and an average of 1.24 applications of cUC. The results suggest that cUC used as an adjunctive tissue therapy in conjunction with surgical debridement, resection of infected bone, open cortex, and antibiotic treatment may be an effective overall treatment strategy to promote wound healing of complex foot ulcers associated with osteomyelitis. The preliminary results are encouraging and warrant further randomized control studies to determine whether cUC might help address such an unmet medical need.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection commonly occurs during the immunosuppression associated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Prophylaxis of recurrent infection and management of clinical infection have relied upon acyclovir and congeners. More recently, resistant HSV infection is seen in HSCT and presents new challenges in management. We present a case of HSV following HSCT that provided effective symptomatic management.Results: Oral symptoms and lesions were repeatedly reduced when topical cidofovir was used, strongly supporting the effect of cidofovir used in a host who could not tolerate systemic antiviral medications.Conclusions: Topical cidofovir can provide effective management of symptomatic oropharyngeal HSV while reducing risk of systemic toxicity and drug interaction and represents an additional approach to management for management in medically compromised patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Single-dose human fibrinogen concentrate (FCH) might have haemostatic benefits in complex cardiovascular surgery.Methods: Patients undergoing elective aortic surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to receive FCH or placebo. Study medication was administered to patients with a 5 min bleeding mass of 60-250 g after separation from bypass and surgical haemostasis. A standardized algorithm for allogeneic blood product transfusion was followed if bleeding continued after study medication.Results: 519 patients from 34 centres were randomized, of whom 152 (29%) met inclusion criteria for study medication. Median (IQR) pretreatment 5 min bleeding mass was 107 (76-138) and 91 (71-112) g in the FCH and placebo groups, respectively (P=0.13). More allogeneic blood product units were administered during the first 24 h after FCH, 5.0 (2.0-11.0), when compared with placebo, 3.0 (0.0-7.0), P=0.026. Fewer patients avoided transfusion in the FCH group (15.4%) compared with placebo (28.4%), P=0.047. The FCH immediately increased plasma fibrinogen concentration and fibrin-based clot strength. Adverse event rates were comparable in each group.Conclusions: Human fibrinogen concentrate was associated with increased allogeneic blood product transfusion, an unexpected finding contrary to previous studies. Human fibrinogen concentrate may not be effective in this setting when administered according to 5-minute bleeding mass. Low bleeding rates and normal-range plasma fibrinogen concentrations before study medication, and variability in adherence to the complex transfusion algorithm, may have contributed to these results.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier no. NCT01475669; EudraCT trial no. 2011-002685-20.</ab>

        <ab>Lymphatic filariasis puts billions of people around the world at risk. Despite this, little is known about the impact of chronic disease morbidity, such as lymphedema. The complex decongestant therapy is a gold standard for treating lymphedemas, but there are no viable protocols for implementation in developing countries. The objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of this technique with the use of alternative material and compare its effects on quality of life, functionality and body weight. The intervention and control groups were evaluated using perimetry and limb volume calculation, the Whoqol-bref quality of life questionnaire, the Functional and Mobility test of the lower limbs Timed Up and Go, and body weight assessment. The intervention group received the complex decongestant therapy twice a week for ten weeks, using an alternative material for the bandaging, made with cambric tissue, which presents low cost in relation to the imported bands. The control group received a lecture with information about the disease and care and hygiene guidelines of the members. The sample consisted of thirty patients with a mean age of 50.8 ± 10 years, 52.9% of whom were women. In the statistical analysis, Student’s t test, Multivariate analysis of variance, Wilcoxon test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used. The significance was 5% (p&lt;0.05). There was a significant reduction in lymphedema volume and 268 perimetry in the intervention group, and increased in the control group. The functionality did not show significant improvement in the evaluation by the Timed Up and Go test. The quality of life had significant improvement in the physical and environmental domains in the intervention group. The effect of treatment on body weight was also significant, presenting reduction in the control group and intergroups. Complex decongestant therapy was effective in reducing and controlling lymphedema and positively impacted, increasing the numerical values of the physical and environmental aspects of the quality of life of the intervention group.</ab>
        <ab>La filariasis linfática presenta riesgo para muchas personas en el mundo. Pero poco se sabe acerca del impacto de la morbilidad crónica de esta enfermedad, como es el linfedema. Y surge la terapia compleja descongestiva como la forma de tratarlo, pero todavía no hay protocolos que le posibilite su implementación en países en desarrollo. Este estudio clínico tiene el propósito de valorar la eficacia de esta técnica, con el empleo de material alternativo, y de comparar sus efectos en la calidad de vida, funcionalidad y peso corporal. Se evaluaron a los grupos intervención y control a través de medición y cálculo del volumen de los miembros, de cuestionario de calidad de vida Whoqol-Bref, de la prueba de funcionalidad y movilidad de los miembros inferiores Timed Up and Go y la evaluación del peso corporal. El grupo intervención hizo la terapia compleja descongestiva dos veces a la semana, durante diez semanas, y utilizó un material alternativo, el linón, para el vendaje, lo que mostró ser de bajo costo en comparación a otras vendas importadas. El grupo control vio una charla que exponía informaciones sobre la enfermedad y sobre los cuidados e higienización de los miembros. Treinta pacientes con promedio de edad de 50,8±10 años formaron la muestra, con un 52,9% de participantes mujeres. En el análisis estadístico se emplearon las pruebas t de Student, Multivariate analysis of variance, la prueba de Wilcoxon y Kolmogorov-Smirnov. El nivel de significación ha sido de 5% (p&lt;0,05). Se observó una significativa reducción en el volumen y en la medición del linfedema en el grupo intervención, pero había aumentado en el grupo control. La funcionalidad no ha presentado mejora en la evaluación por la prueba Timed Up and Go. La calidad de vida ha presentado mejora en los dominios físico y medioambiente en el grupo intervención. El efecto del tratamiento en el peso corporal también ha sido significativo por presentar reducción en el grupo control e intergrupal. La terapia compleja descongestiva puede ser eficaz en la reducción y en el control del linfedema, además de aumentar positivamente los valores en los dominios físico y medioambiente de la calidad de vida del grupo intervención.</ab>

O grupo intervenção recebeu a terapia complexa descongestiva duas vezes por semana, durante dez semanas, utilizando-se um material alternativo para o enfaixamento, confeccionado com tecido de cambraia, o que apresenta baixo custo em relação às faixas importadas. O grupo controle recebeu palestra com informações sobre a doença e orientações de cuidados e higiene dos membros. A amostra foi composta por trinta pacientes com idade média de 50,8±10 anos, sendo 52,9% mulheres. Na análise estatística foram utilizados os testes t de Student, Multivariate analysis of variance, teste de Wilcoxon e Kolmogorov-Smirnov. A significância adotada foi de 5% (p&lt;0,05). Houve redução significativa do volume e perimetria do linfedema no grupo intervenção, e aumentou no grupo controle. A funcionalidade não apresentou melhora significativa na avaliação pelo teste Timed Up and Go. A qualidade de vida teve melhora significativa nos domínios físico e meio ambiente no grupo intervenção. O efeito do tratamento no peso corporal também foi significativo, apresentando redução no grupo controle e intergrupos. A terapia complexa descongestiva mostrou-se eficaz na redução e no controle do linfedema e impactou de maneira positiva, aumentando os valores numéricos dos aspectos físico e meio ambiente da qualidade de vida do grupo intervenção.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: This cost analysis aimed to prospectively assess differences in costs between TomoTherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with head and neck cancer.Methods and Materials: Economic data were gathered from a multicenter study. However, randomization was not possible due to the availability of equipment. Costs were calculated using the microcosting technique from the hospital's perspective (in 2013 euros), and the time horizon was radiation therapy. Only resources that entered the hospital production process and which were likely to vary between the strategies being compared were considered. Acute adverse events observed within the time horizon were also assessed.Results: The cost analysis was based on a total of 173 patient treatments given between 2010 and 2012 in 14 French cancer centers: 73 patients were treated with TomoTherapy, 92 with VMAT RapidArc, and 8 with VMAT SmartArc. Estimated costs of SmartArc were removed from the comparison due to the small sample size. The mean ± SD cost per patient of the treatment planning phase was €314 (±€214) for TomoTherapy and €511 (±€590) for RapidArc. Mean costs ± SD per patient of irradiation reached €3144 (±€565) for TomoTherapy and €1350 (±€299) for RapidArc. The most sensitive parameter of irradiation was the annual operating time of accelerators. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the mean costs of irradiation were €3016 to €3272 for TomoTherapy and €1281 to €1408 for RapidArc. The number of acute adverse events during radiation therapy was not significantly different between strategies.Conclusions: TomoTherapy appeared to be more expensive than RapidArc mainly due to the higher price of the accelerator, the higher costs of maintenance, and the longer duration of treatment sessions. Because strategies were not significantly different in clinical effect, RapidArc appeared to be the strategy to be recommended at this stage of knowledge.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To describe the nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions for patients admitted to intensive care units and to assess their possible relation with classical outcomes like length of stay and mortality. Background The analysis of nursing diagnosis frequencies may help to estimate the patients' complexity and the need for nursing interventions and can predict hospital outcomes. Nonetheless, few studies were conducted on critical patients. Design Prospective cohort observational study. Methods Between 15 July-31 October 2013 we collected the above-described nursing parameters of 100 subjects throughout their stay in intensive care. We classified the parameters according to established taxonomies. The independent association between the number of nursing diagnoses and length of stay/mortality was investigated with multiple regressions. Results We found an average of 19 diagnoses, 24 outcomes and 60 interventions per patient. Most frequently, the plans of care involved support for self-care deficits or interrupted family processes. They also included strategies to prevent infection, disuse syndrome and impairment of skin integrity. Nineteen nursing diagnoses were significantly related with mortality or length of stay in bivariate analyses. In regression models, the number of such diagnoses explained 29·7% of the variance in length of stay and was an independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion In critically ill patients, the analysis of nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions confirmed an intense activity in response to a broad spectrum of patient needs. The number of nursing diagnoses allowed to predict patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: To evaluate mobility outcomes and concerns about falling for community dwelling medically complex clients (MCCs) participating in an individualized falls prevention clinic. Methods: A quantitative retrospective chart review with one group pretest, posttest design compared four outcome measures of Gait Speed, 30 Second Sit-to-Stand Test, Timed Up and Go, and The Falls Efficacy Scale International. Consecutive participants discharged from the Falls Prevention Clinic between January 2014 and December 2014 were screened. Paired t-test was used to determine outcome measure significance. Descriptive statistics and analysis of participant satisfaction surveys were completed. Results: Sixty-nine participants were included. Over 75% of participants had at least one fall in the past year and average number of falls totaled five. Statistical significance was achieved on all four outcome measures. Conclusions: An individualized, multifactorial approach appears to benefit MCCs despite average outcome measure scores still indicating a falls risk. Further examination of defining falls risk for MCCs is warranted.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease requires prolonged treatment with multiple antibiotics. Drug intolerances and interactions are common with the current recommended treatment. There is limited information on outcomes with alternative medications.Methods: Retrospective review including adult patients with MAC lung disease who were treated and monitored for at least 6 months posttreatment. The aim was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic outcomes in patients treated with regimens including clofazimine and/or rifampin.Results: One hundred and seven patients were included (79% were female; mean age, 67 years). Sputum samples were smear positive in 54% of patients. The majority (84%) were treated with clofazimine in combination with a macrolide and ethambutol. Fourteen patients (13%) were treated with rifampin, macrolide, and ethambutol. Most patients (95%) converted from positive to negative sputum culture results in an average of 4.5 ± 4.2 months (range, 0-30 months). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with clofazimine converted to negative culture results compared with those treated with rifampin (100% vs 71%; P = .0002). Microbiologic relapse occurred in 52 of 107 patients (49%). Thirty-six percent of patients required retreatment. There was no difference in microbiologic relapse or re-treatment rates between the two treatment groups.Conclusions: The majority of patients with MAC lung disease achieve negative sputum culture results. Re-treatment is needed in approximately one-third of patients. In this cohort, both initial outcomes and re-treatment rates were at least as good in patients treated with clofazimine-containing regimens as in patients receiving rifampin-containing regimens. Clofazimine should be considered as an alternative drug for the treatment of MAC lung disease.</ab>

        <ab>We describe 2 fatal cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal complex 398 septicemia in persons who had no contact with livestock. Whole-genome sequencing of the isolated MRSA strains strongly suggest that both were of animal origin and that the patients had been infected through 2 independent person-to-person transmission chains.</ab>

        <ab>This is the third in a short series that presents case study examples of the application of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic assessment model, which is designed to determine a frail older person's medical and mental health status, as well as functional, social and environmental issues. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised care planning. The case study presented explores the application of CGA with an 89-year-old patient with complex health and social care needs. It demonstrates how a hospital admission was avoided and the patient's health outcomes improved, by using a nurse-led systematic approach to assessment and by careful consideration of CGA domains.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Certain advanced chronic conditions (heart failure, chronic lung disease) are associated with high mortality. Nevertheless, most of the time, patients with these conditions are not given the same level of attention or palliative care as those with cancer. The objective of this study was to assess mortality and its association with other variables in a cohort of complex multimorbid patients with heart failure and/or lung disease from two consecutive telemonitoring studies. Methods: This multicentre longitudinal study was conducted between 2010 and 2015. We included 83 patients (27 without telemonitoring) with heart failure and/or lung disease with &gt; 1 hospital admission in the previous year and great difficulties leaving home or were housebound. The following variables were indicators of their complex clinical condition: old age (mean: 81 years), comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index score = 2: 86.2 %), both conditions concurrently (54.2 %) and home oxygen therapy (52 %). We assessed mortality (rate, cause and place of death) and its association with: age, sex, telemonitoring, functional status (Barthel score), quality of life (EQ-5D visual analogue scale), number of medications, and all-cause and condition- specific (due to conditions prompting inclusion) admissions during the previous year. Uni- and bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed, considering p&lt; 0.05 significant. Results: A total of 61 patients died within 5 years, representing 31.2 %/year (95 % CI: 23-40.1 %), considering the overall follow-up (sum of individual follow-up days). Of these, 81 % of deaths (95 % CI: 69.1-89-1 %) were due to the condition prompting inclusion, and 83.3 % (95 % CI: 72-90.7 %) died in hospital (median: 8.5 days). Mortality was lower among those under telemonitoring (p= 0.027), and with fewer condition-specific admissions the previous year (p= 0.006); the latter also showed the strongest association in the multivariate analysis (Exp(B) = 6.115). Conclusions: Complex patients with multimorbidity had a high mortality rate, generally dying due to the condition for which they had been included, and in hospital (83.3 %). New approaches for managing such patients should be considered, introducing palliative care as required, and using more comprehensive predictors of mortality (functional status and quality of life), together with those related to the illness itself (previous admissions, progression and symptoms).</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors and outcomes of bloodstream infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a hospital of Northern China. Risk factors associated with MDR A baumannii complex included older age, pneumonia, using drainage catheters, and intensive care unit stay. Multivariate analysis showed that multidrug resistance and mechanical ventilation were identified as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients with A baumannii complex bacteremia.</ab>

        <ab>Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is characterized by nocturnal violence, increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep and the lack of any other neurological disease. However, idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder can precede parkinsonism and dementia by several years. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging and neuromelanin-sensitive sequences, we previously found that the signal intensity was reduced in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area of patients with Parkinson's disease and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Here, we studied the integrity of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex with neuromelanin-sensitive imaging in 21 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and compared the results with those from 21 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent a clinical examination, motor, cognitive, autonomous, psychological, olfactory and colour vision tests, and rapid eye movement sleep characterization using video-polysomnography and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. The patients more frequently had preclinical markers of alpha-synucleinopathies, including constipation, olfactory deficits, orthostatic hypotension, and subtle motor impairment. Using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, reduced signal intensity was identified in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex of the patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour. The mean sensitivity of the visual analyses of the signal performed by neuroradiologists who were blind to the clinical diagnoses was 82.5%, and the specificity was 81% for the identification of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour. The results confirm that this complex is affected in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour (to the same degree as it is affected in Parkinson's disease). Neuromelanin-sensitive imaging provides an early marker of non-dopaminergic alpha-synucleinopathy that can be detected on an individual basis.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: Self-expanding stents represent a re-emerging option for percutaneous coronary interventions. Their application covers a wide spectrum of angiographic situations, i.e., coronary bifurcations, acute coronary syndromes with large thrombotic burden and stenosis of ectatic coronaries. We review our experience with self-expanding stents for different clinical and angiographic indications, with long clinical follow-up.Methods: From 2011 to 2013 we used self-expanding STENTYS® stents in 40 consecutive patients followed-up for death from any cause and from cardiovascular cause, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR), stent thrombosis (mean 21±13months). We also revised rate of procedural outcomes, acute stent thrombosis and TLR in patients treated with conventional stents for similar clinical/angiographic situations, in the same period at our institution.Results: We identified three anatomical settings of STENTYS® use: coronary bifurcations with proximal/distal main branch diameter discrepancy (55% of cases), massive thrombotic burden in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (35% of cases) and stenosis of ectatic coronaries (15%). We observed one death related to acute heart failure and 1 case (2.5%) of acute stent thrombosis (2.5% in the control group). During follow-up 2 cases of stent restenosis leading to TLR (5%) occurred (6.25% in the control group).Conclusions: According to our real life experience, self-expanding STENTYS® stents appear to be an effective tool for different angiographic situations in which they may be preferable to balloon-expandable stents, showing a low rate of complications and good results at long term follow-up.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) is common in serum of elderly individuals receiving folic acid (FA)-fortified foods or supplements. We studied the effect of supplementing FA or B-complex on serum concentrations of (6 S)-5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamate [(6S)-5-CH-HPte] and UMFA in elderly people and explored factors associated with detectable UMFA post-supplementation. Methods: This is a randomized single-blind non-controlled trial on 58 elderly people using daily 400 µg FA ( n = 31) or 400 µg FA, 10 µg cyanocob(III)alamin and 8 mg pyridoxine ( n = 27) for a median of 23 days. Main outcome includes changes in concentrations of serum (6S)-5-CH-HPte and UMFA. Results: Total homocysteine declined by a median of 1.6 ( p = 0.074) in the FA and 1.3 µmol/L ( p = 0.009) in the B-complex arms ( p = 0.66 between the arms). Serum (6S)-5-CH-HPte significantly ( p &lt; 0.001 vs. baseline) increased by a median of 9.2 and 6.5 nmol/L in the FA and B-complex groups, respectively ( p = 0.152 between the groups). Compared to FA, B-complex reduced cystathionine and caused lower post-intervention serum UMFA, percentage of UMFA to (6S)-5-CH-HPte and prevalence of UMFA ≥ 0.21 nmol/L. Higher serum cystathionine and whole-blood folate predicted higher post-intervention serum UMFA. Conclusions: FA caused higher UMFA as compared to B-complex. Pyridoxine appears to improve folate recycling. Data on serum UMFA should be interpreted in relation to other vitamins involved in folate metabolism. Serum UMFA is suggested to play a sensory role through which the cell recognizes FA available for metabolism via dihydrofolate reductase.</ab>

        <ab>* Objective: Complex wounds are often difficult to close and sometimes require a split-thickness skin graft (STSG). However, epidermal skin grafts, which contain only an epidermal layer of skin, are a viable option for wound coverage in these challenging wounds. We report our experience using an automated epidermal harvesting tool to harvest epidermal skin grafts for the treatment of complex wounds. * Method: Epidermal skin grafts were harvested from the patient's thigh, which was first washed with isopropyl alcohol. After harvesting, they were transferred to the recipient site using a film dressing. A bolster dressing using gauze and a self-adherent wrap held the grafts in place. * Results: We selected 34 patients with wounds that had been present from several weeks to over a year. Prior treatments, included skin substitutes, alginate dressings, Unna Boot, and collagen dressings. There were 17 female and 17 male patients with a mean age of 67.1 years (range: 37-103). Wound types were: traumatic wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, pressure ulcers, and surgical wounds. Patient comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and osteoarthritis. Mean epithelialisation rate at the recipient site was 7.0 weeks (range: 1-35 weeks).Wound complications included drainage, hypergranulation, and oedema. At follow-up 82.4% (28/34) of wounds were healed, 2.9% (1/34) wounds showed improved healing, 11.8% (4/34) of wounds did not heal, and 2.9% (1/34) were lost to follow-up. All donor sites healed without complications. * Conclusion: In our cohort, use of epidermal skin grafts in conjunction with bolster dressings resulted in full closure or wound improvement of a majority of patients. Epidermal grafting provides another treatment option to physicians when only the epidermal layer is needed. * Declaration of interest: Dr. Bhatia is a consultant for KCI,an Acelity company.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To review outcomes of continuous motor/somatosensory-evoked potential (MEP/SSEP) monitoring, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and selective use of iliofemoral conduits in patients undergoing endovascular repair of descending thoracic aneurysm (DTA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs).Methods: The clinical data of 49 patients (mean age 75±8 years; 38 men) who underwent endovascular repair of DTA and TAAAs (2011-2014) were reviewed. All patients had cerebrospinal fluid drainage, permissive hypertension (mean arterial pressure ≥80 mm Hg), and MEP/SSEP monitoring. There were 44 (90%) patients with TAAAs and 5 (10%) with DTA. Types I and II TAAAs were repaired in staged procedures. Iliofemoral conduits were used for small iliac arteries and to minimize time of lower extremity ischemia in patients with difficult anatomy. In patients with changes in MEP/SSEPs, a standardized protocol was employed to optimize spinal cord perfusion and restore lower extremity blood flow. Endpoints were mortality, spinal cord injury (SCI), and lower extremity ischemic complications.Results: Sixteen (33%) patients had staged TAAA repair. A total of 163 visceral arteries were targeted by fenestrations and branches (mean 3.7±1.0 vessels/patient). Temporary iliofemoral conduits were used in 16 limbs/14 patients. A stable MEP/SSEP was achieved in all patients. Thirty-one (63%) patients had a ≥75% decrease in MEP/SSEP amplitude in 50 limbs starting on average 75±28 minutes after obtaining vascular access. MEP/SSEP amplitude improved with maneuvers in 12 (39%) patients and returned to baseline with restoration of lower extremity flow in all except 1 patient who developed immediate SCI. Thirty-day mortality was 4%. Three (6%) patients had SCI, 2 permanent and 1 temporary at 14 days. There were no lower extremity ischemic complications.Conclusion: Neuromonitoring predicted immediate SCI and allowed use of a protocol to optimize spinal cord and lower extremity perfusion during complex endovascular aortic repair. Larger clinical experience is needed to evaluate the efficacy of neuromonitoring to prevent SCI.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale, aims and objectives To assess the outcomes of a clinical decision support ( CDS) intervention designed for home care patients with high medication regimen complexity ( MRC) and to examine correlates of CDS use. Method The CDS consisted of a computerized algorithm that identified high MRC patients, electronic alerts and a care management module. Nurses were randomized upon identification of an eligible patient. Full intention to treat and intervention group-only analyses were completed. Regression-adjusted outcomes were hospitalization, emergency department use and reduction in MRC. Results Five hundred nurses were randomized with 7919 of their patients. Approximately 20% of the intervention group was hospitalized versus 21% in the control group; 16.5% versus 16.7% had an emergency department visit; and 6% in each group dropped below the high MRC threshold. No statistically significant differences were found in the intention to treat analysis. Eighty-two percent of intervention nurses used the CDS but for only 42% of their patients. Among intervention patients, CDS use (vs. non-use) was associated with reduced MRC and hospitalization. CDS use was associated with various clinician and patient characteristics. Conclusion CDS use was limited, negating the impact of the intervention overall. Findings on correlates of CDS use and the relationship between CDS use and positive outcomes suggest that CDS use and outcomes could be enhanced by avoiding short patient lengths of stay, improving continuity of care, increasing reliance on salaried nurses and/or increasing per diem nurses' incentives to use CDS.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale, aims and objectives Case management is commonly used to provide health care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. However, the most effective form of team organization and the necessary support structures need to be identified. In this respect, patients' views could provide a valuable contribution to improving the design of these services. To analyse the experiences of patients with chronic diseases and of caregivers, in relation to health care services and mechanisms, and to identify means of modelling case management services. Methods The method used was a qualitative study based on life stories, and semi-structured interviews with 18 patients with complex chronic diseases and with their family caregivers, selected by purposeful sampling in primary health care centres in Andalusia (southern Spain) from 2009 to 2011. Results Three transition points were clearly identified: the onset and initial adaptation, the beginning of quality-of-life changes, and the final stage, in which the patients' lives are governed by the complexity of their condition. Health care providers have a low level of proactivity with respect to undertaking early measures for health promotion and self-care education. Care is fragmented into a multitude of providers and services, with treatments aimed at specific problems. Conclusions Many potentially valuable interventions in case management, such as information provision, self-care education and coordination between services and providers, are still not provided.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. To examine the extent and complexity of the morbidity burden in 85-year-olds; identify patterns within multimorbidity; and explore associations with medication and healthcare use. Participants. 710 men and women; mean (SD) age 85.5 (0.4) years. Methods. Data on 20 chronic conditions (diseases and geriatric conditions) ascertained from general practice records and participant assessment. Cluster analysis within the multimorbid sample identified subgroups sharing morbidity profiles. Clusters were compared on medication and healthcare use. Results. 92.7% (658/710) of participants had multimorbidity; median number of conditions: 4 (IQR 3–6). Cluster analysis (multimorbid sample) identified five subgroups sharing similar morbidity profiles; 60.0% (395/658) of participants belonged to one of two high morbidity clusters, with only 4.9% (32/658) in the healthiest cluster. Healthcare use was high, with polypharmacy (≥5 medications) in 69.8% (459/658). Between-cluster differences were found in medication count (p=0.0001); hospital admissions (p=0.022); and general practitioner (p=0.034) and practice nurse consultations (p=0.011). Morbidity load was related to medication burden and use of some, but not all, healthcare services. Conclusions. The majority of 85-year-olds had extensive and complex morbidity. Elaborating participant clusters sharing similar morbidity profiles will help inform future healthcare provision and the identification of common underlying biological mechanisms.</ab>

According to the author, the idea that community-based care for the elderly should be problem-based, person-centered, and goal-oriented, is not supported by a number of experimental studies. Information on Safer Care for Older Persons (ISCOPE) trial is also offered.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The aim of the present study was translation, cultural adaption and validation of the extended version 12 of the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale (RCS-E) in a sample of patients with stroke and total hip replacement.Method: The cross-cultural validation required RCS-E forward–backward translation, revision by an expert committee and its application in an Intensive Rehabilitation setting through a retrospective collection of data from clinical records. The evaluation of the psychometric properties was carried out by analyzing the correlations between RCS-E score and other measures (Functional Independence Measure, Braden, Morse, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale) and the assessment of reliability in terms of reproducibility (inter-observer agreement) and repeatability (intra-observer agreement).Results: The backward and forward processes of translation of the scale did not create problems of interpretation of terms. Some adaptation was required for the items nursing (N), medical care (M) and therapeutic intensity (TI) due to differences on the national health system structure. The Italian version of the scale proved to be valid, reliable with high reproducibility and repeatability.Conclusions: The Italian version RCS-E has been successfully validated, showing good psychometric properties, which partly reproduce the results obtained for the original version. However, some assumption was made for some items thus preventing possible comparison with other countries.Implications for RehabilitationAdmittance at an Intensive Rehabilitation care setting in Italy requires to evaluate the complexity of rehabilitation needs.The Rehabilitation Complexity Scale (RCS-E) has proved to be reliable for assessing clinical complexity and consequently for planning rehabilitation needs.The Italian version of RCS-E has been successfully validated, showing good psychometric properties, which reproduce the results obtained for the original version.The items included in the therapy intensity subscale do not fit the Italian health system rules for intensity of rehabilitation care and needs adaptation.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to describe the problem-situations and their degree of complexity in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome. Method: a descriptive study with a qualitative approach, performed in a public hospital from interviews and document analysis on records. Data analysis consisted of distributions of frequencies, calculating the average and standard deviation statistics. Results: there were 26 problem-situations described, sent to experts nurses for analysis and classification of degrees of complexity. Higher Complexity Problem-situations were the most, in relation to the Medium and Lower Complexity. Conclusion: the problemsituations and degrees of complexity directed to the evident and not evident problems that involve the patient, which are not related only to the signs and symptoms of the disease, but with the environment, the family, nursing care to which they are submitted and nurse-patient interaction during hospitalization were identified.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to estimate the healing rate of complex surgical wounds and its associated factors. Method: retrospective cohort study from 2003 to 2014 with 160 outpatients of a Brazilian university hospital. Data were obtained through consultation of the medical records. Survival function was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model to estimate the likelihood of the occurrence of healing. Results: the complex surgical wound healing rate was 67.8% (95% CI: 60.8-74.9). Factors associated with a higher likelihood of wound healing were segmentectomy/ quadrantectomy surgery, consumption of more than 20 grams/day of alcohol, wound extent of less that 17.3 cm2 and the length of existence of the wound prior to outpatient treatment of less than 15 days, while the use of hydrocolloid covering and Marlex mesh were associated with a lower likelihood of healing. Conclusion: the wound healing rate was considered high and was associated with the type of surgical intervention, alcohol consumption, type of covering, extent and length of wound existence. Preventive measures can be implemented during the monitoring of the evolution of the complex surgical wound closure, with possibilities of intervention in the modifiable risk factors.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Modern chemotherapy regimens are growing increasingly complex, involving lengthy outpatient infusions, and additional visits for supportive care. The treatment of advanced-stage patients is uniquely one of unremitting therapy and varying complexity. The study's purpose was to describe and quantify the dimensions of treatment complexity in terms of chemotherapy (CT) and supportive care (SC) visits.Methods: Electronic medical records for 121 subjects with stages III and IV cancer were reviewed. Visits were classified as SC and CT types, and actual hours and visit numbers were calculated for a 3-month treatment period. Analysis included descriptive and generalized linear modeling statistics.Results: Subjects ≥65 years spent fewer total hours (M = 18.17 h, SD = 10.17 h, p = 0.04), but experienced more total visits (M = 10.96 visits, SD = 4.65 visits, p = 0.02) than younger subjects. More than 71% of younger patients spent two or more hours per chemotherapy visit, compared to 41.7% of older patients (p = 0.001). Older subjects were more likely to have a SC visit (p = 0.03), but did not differ from younger subjects in SC visit numbers (p = 0.3) or hours (p = 0.6). Females averaged 3.81 more total hours (M = 22. 61 h, SD = 11.06 h, p = 0.055) and had more total visits (M = 10.80 visits, SD = 3.71, p = 0.02) than males. By visit type, women spent twice the hours undergoing SC than males (M = 3.3 vs. 1.5 h, p = 0.051), but genders did not differ in CT visit hours or average length. By diagnosis, colon/esophageal subjects spent more hours in CT visits (M = 21.90 h, SD = 8.60 h, p &lt; 0.01), and lung subjects trended toward spending more hours in SC visits (M = 4.80 h, SD = 8.23 h, p &lt; 0.06).Conclusions: Advanced-stage cancer patients differed in visit types, hours, and treatment length undergoing CT and SC visits. Age, gender, and diagnosis explained the differences, and this study adds new understanding to the phenomenon of treatment complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The midwifery profession is crucial for a functioning health system aiming at improved maternal and child health outcomes. Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) can be used as a tool to understand actors' interactions in the system around midwifery profession for improved maternal and child health. The purpose of this study is to explore how actors connect to promote the Bangladesh's midwifery profession.Methods: An explorative study based on the framework of CAS was performed. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 16 key persons representing nine different organisations promoting the establishment of the midwifery profession. Qualitative analysis was used.Results: Findings show that the actors were intertwined and driving towards a common goal; to save lives through education and deployment of 3000 midwives. The unique knowledge contributions of everyone involved were giving the system strength and power to perform. Collaboration was seen as more could be achieved compared to what an individual organisation could do. Significant results of this were that two midwifery curricula and faculty development had been produced. Although collaboration was mostly seen as something positive to move the system forward, the approach to reach the set goal varied with different interests, priorities and concerns, both on individual organisational level as well as at system level. Frequent struggles of individual philosophies versus organisational mandates were seen as competing interests for advancing the national priorities. It would appear that newcomers with innovative ideas were denied access on the same terms as other actors.Conclusions: This study illustrates that CAS thinking can be used as a metaphor to understand how to adapt more emergent ways of working instead of the traditional planned approaches to change and develop in order to deal better with a more complex world. Through examining how actors connect for establishing a midwifery profession, offers insights of shared interests towards stepping up efforts for a competent midwifery profession in Bangladesh and elsewhere. Good relationships, where everyone's expertise and innovations, are used to the full, are crucial for establishing a strong midwifery profession and thus improved maternal and child health.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) have impaired movement due to a brain injury near birth. Understanding how neuromuscular control is altered in CP can provide insight into pathological movement. We sought to determine if individuals with CP demonstrate reduced complexity of neuromuscular control during gait compared with unimpaired individuals and if changes in control are related to functional ability.Method: Muscle synergies during gait were retrospectively analyzed for 633 individuals (age range 3.9-70y): 549 with CP (hemiplegia, n=122; diplegia, n=266; triplegia, n=73; quadriplegia, n=88) and 84 unimpaired individuals. Synergies were calculated using non-negative matrix factorization from surface electromyography collected during previous clinical gait analyses. Synergy complexity during gait was compared with diagnosis subtype, functional ability, and clinical examination measures.Result: Fewer synergies were required to describe muscle activity during gait in individuals with CP compared with unimpaired individuals. Changes in synergies were related to functional impairment and clinical examination measures including selective motor control, strength, and spasticity.Interpretation: Individuals with CP use a simplified control strategy during gait compared with unimpaired individuals. These results were similar to synergies during walking among adult stroke survivors, suggesting similar neuromuscular control strategies between these clinical populations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Delivery of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programs by community pharmacists appears effective and enhances health service access. However, their capacity to implement complex behavioural change processes during patient counselling remains largely unexplored. This study aims to determine intervention fidelity by pharmacists for behavioural components of a complex educational intervention for CVD prevention. After receiving training to improve lifestyle and medicines adherence, pharmacists recruited 70 patients aged 50-74 years without established CVD, and taking anti-hypertensive or lipid lowering therapy. Patients received five counselling sessions, each at monthly intervals. Researchers assessed biomedical and behavioural risk factors at baseline and six months. Pharmacists documented key outcomes from counselling after each session. Most patients (86%) reported suboptimal cardiovascular diets, 41% reported suboptimal medicines adherence, and 39% were physically inactive. Of those advised to complete the intervention, 85% attended all five sessions. Pharmacists achieved patient agreement with most recommended goals for behaviour change, and overwhelmingly translated goals into practical behavioural strategies. Barriers to changing behaviours were regularly documented, and pharmacists reported most behavioural strategies as having had some success. Meaningful improvements to health behaviours were observed post-intervention. Findings support further exploration of pharmacists' potential roles for delivering interventions with complex behaviour change requirements.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Severe primary (degenerative) mitral regurgitation (MR) is repaired with durable results when simple single-scallop disease is addressed. The midterm quality outcomes of minimally invasive repair for complex disease are unknown, however.Methods and Results: From January 2008 to January 2015, 487 patients (56±11 years, 360 men, ejection fraction 65±6%, 98.8% complete follow-up) underwent robotic mitral valve repair for severe nonischemic degenerative MR. Simple pathology was addressed in 289 of 487 (59%) patients, and complex repair (all others) was performed in 198 of 487 (41%). Four patients died during follow-up with a 5-year survival rate 99.5% (99.4% simple; 99.5% complex; hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-4.59); and New York Heart Association functional class I/II was documented in 97.9% (477/487). Eight patients had recurrence of moderate-to-severe MR (4 simple, 4 complex), with a 5-year freedom from MR of 94.6% (96.2% simple; 92.7%, complex; P=0.67; hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-5.43). Seven patients (2 simple, 5 complex), underwent mitral reoperation, with a 5-year freedom from reoperation of 97.7% (99.1% simple; 95.7% complex; P=0.13; hazard ratio, 3.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-17.32).Conclusions: At a large tertiary care referral center, midterm quality outcomes after robotic correction of degenerative MR are excellent, with very high survival, infrequent complications, and a low likelihood of MR recurrence, regardless of mitral valve repair complexity. Awareness of these improvements in outcome is important to inform contemporary decisions regarding high-quality alternatives to conventional and percutaneous mitral repair.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUNDThe pandemic of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) was primarily due to clonal spread of blaKPC producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Thus, thoroughly studied CRE cohorts have consisted mostly of K. pneumoniae.OBJECTIVETo conduct an extensive epidemiologic analysis of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter spp. (CREn) from 2 endemic and geographically distinct centers.METHODSCREn were investigated at an Israeli center (Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, January 2007 to July 2012) and at a US center (Detroit Medical Center, September 2008 to September 2009). blaKPC genes were queried by polymerase chain reaction. Repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were used to determine genetic relatedness.RESULTSIn this analysis, 68 unique patients with CREn were enrolled. Sixteen isolates (24%) were from wounds, and 33 (48%) represented colonization only. All isolates exhibited a positive Modified Hodge Test, but only 93% (27 of 29) contained blaKPC. Forty-three isolates (63%) were from elderly adults, and 5 (7.4%) were from neonates. Twenty-seven patients died in hospital (40.3% of infected patients). Enterobacter strains consisted of 4 separate clones from Assaf Harofeh Medical Center and of 4 distinct clones from Detroit Medical Center.CONCLUSIONSIn this study conducted at 2 distinct CRE endemic regions, there were unique epidemiologic features to CREn: (i) polyclonality, (ii) neonates accounting for more than 7% of cohort, and (iii) high rate of colonization (almost one-half of all cases represented colonization). Since false-positive Modified Hodge Tests in Enterobacter spp. are common, close monitoring of carbapenem resistance mechanisms (particularly carbapenemase production) among Enterobacter spp. is important.Infect.

        <ab>Background: The INTERMED was developed for the early identification of biological, psychological, social and health system factors considered interacting in health complexity. This is defined as the interference with the achievement of expected or desired health and service use outcomes when patients are exposed to standard care.Objective: The aim of this study was to test the INTERMED's ability to identify 'case' and 'care' complexity, identifying patients that would especially benefit from integrated care.Methods: Observational longitudinal study of Internal medicine in patients in two National Health System hospitals in Spain using the INTERMED (patients scoring ≥ 21 were considered to be 'complex'); the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), a severity of illness assessment; and standard clinical variables.Results: Six hundred and fifteen consecutives were included, and the prevalence of health complexity was 27.6%. The greatest differences between patients with and without health complexity were observed in the non-biological domains. Eighty-five per cent of patients with health complexity had non-biological items considered to require timely (immediately or soon) assistance or intervention compared to 30% of those without, nearly a threefold difference. Complex patients had a significantly higher number of medical diagnoses (p = 0.002) and number of psychiatric referrals (p = 0.041), but there were no differences in CIRS scores or lengths of stay.Conclusion: The INTERMED has the potential to identify a considerable subset of complex internal medicine inpatients for which timely corrective action related to non-biological risk factors not typically uncovered during standard medical evaluations would be considered beneficial.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Guided by the Preliminary Live with Love Conceptual Framework (P-LLCF) for Cancer Couple Dyads, a Caring for Couples Coping with Cancer (4Cs) program was developed to support couples coping with cancer as a unit. This study examined the acceptability, feasibility, and the preliminary effect of the 4Cs program.Methods: A pre- and post-intervention study design with no control group was conducted among Chinese cancer patients and their spousal caregivers. Among the 135 couples approached, a total of 117 dyads were successfully recruited at baseline, with 92 dyads successfully followed-up at 6 weeks. Outcome measures, including dyadic mediators (self-efficacy), dyadic appraisal (Cancer Related Communication Problem, CRCP), dyadic coping (Dyadic Coping Inventory, DCI), and dyadic outcomes (physical and mental health, negative and positive emotions, and marital satisfaction), were assessed at T0 (pre-intervention) and T1 (post-intervention). Repeated measures analysis of variance was applied in testing the outcomes of the 4Cs program.Results: The recruitment and retention rates were 86.7% and 78.6%, respectively. Significant improvements were seen in the couples' scores on overall (total) self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.01), CRCP (P &lt; 0.05), DCI (P &lt; 0.05), the physical component summary (PCS) of SF-12 (P &lt; 0.05), anxiety (P &lt; 0.01), and benefit findings (P &lt; 0.05) from T0 to T1. Spousal caregivers scored significantly higher on self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.05), the PCS (P &lt; 0.01), and anxiety (P &lt; 0.05) than the patients. The overall effect sizes calculated in this study ranged from medium to small.Conclusions: This study provides evidence suggesting that the 4Cs program is acceptable, feasible, and improved outcomes in supporting Chinese couples coping with cancer as dyads.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To investigate the coevolution of depression and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in old age.Methods: In a representative survey of the German general population aged 75 years and older, the course of HRQoL and depression was observed over 4.5 years (3 waves). HRQoL was assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) of the EQ-5D instrument, while the Geriatric Depression Scale was used to measure depression. A panel vector autoregressive model was used to account for the complex coevolution of depression and HRQoL. Unobserved heterogeneity was taken into account by taking the first differences.Results: We revealed a robust negative association between an initial change in HRQoL and a subsequent change in depression score, with substantial sex differences: In women there was a robust association, while in men the significance of this association depended on the model specification. Surprisingly, in the total sample and in both sexes, no robust association between an initial increase in depression and a subsequent change in HRQoL was found.Conclusion: Findings indicate that the direction of evolution from HRQoL to depression deserves more attention. Furthermore, treatment of depression in late life should aim at improving HRQoL in which remission of depressive symptoms is necessary but not sufficient.</ab>

        <ab>Depending on the patient's presenting factors, managing complex or 'hard-to-heal' wounds can be a significant challenge for the community nurse. Increased longevity, while a positive also means that people are surviving medical and surgical procedures which were life-threatening in the past, with a 20% reduction in avoidable deaths. The delivery of complex community wound care is not a new concept, however, it is dependent on a number of factors such as the expectations of commissioners, providers, and health and social care policymakers, as well as the patient and the skill of the clinicians performing the care. Financial cutbacks in the NHS have also had a negative impact on the delivery of some community healthcare services. This article investigates whether all of these factors have impacted on the amount of complex wounds now being managed in the community setting.</ab>

        <ab>Pain is common in older people and its assessment is an important part of the nurse's role. Asking people about their pain is considered the most accurate and reliable assessment because of the subjective nature of pain. A number of simple and easy-to-administer self-rating scales are available to measure pain intensity. To rate their pain, however, people need to understand the request, as well as recall and interpret the painful signal. Observing specific behaviours associated with pain is advocated when communication and cognitive function are impaired, for example, in people with advanced dementia. A number of pain assessment tools have been developed that involve observation of some or all of the behaviours. The aim of this article is to highlight the importance of pain assessment, discuss the various pain assessment scales and tools available and identify some of the factors that can make comprehensive assessment of pain in older people and those with cognitive impairment complex.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The complexity of a medication regimen is related to the multiple characteristics of the prescribed regimen and can negatively influence the health outcomes of patients. Objective: To propose cut-off points in the complexity of pharmacotherapy to distinguish between patients with low and high complexities seen in a primary health care (PHC) setting to enable prioritization of patient management. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, which included 517 adult and elderly patients, analyzing different cut-off points to define the strata of low and high pharmacotherapy complexities based on percentiles of the population evaluated. Data collection began with the solicitation of prescriptions, followed by a questionnaire that was administered by an interviewer. The complexity of a medication regimen was estimated from the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). High complexity pharmacotherapy scores were analyzed from patient profiles, the use of health services, and pharmacotherapy. The criteria for subject inclusion in the sample population were as follows: inhabitant of the area covered by the municipality, 18 years or older, and being prescribed at least one drug during the collection period. Exclusion criteria at the time of collection were the use of any medication whose prescription was not available. All medications were accessed through the Primary Healthcare Service (PHS). Results: The median total pharmacotherapy complexity score was 8.5. High MRCI scores were correlated with age, medications taken with in the Brazilian PHS, having at least one potential drug-related problem, receiving up to eight years of schooling, number of medications and polypharmacy (five or more medicines), number of medical conditions, number of medical appointments, and number of cardiovascular diseases and endocrine metabolic diseases. We suggest different complexity tracks according to age (e.g., adult or elderly) that consider the pharmacotherapy and population coverage characteristics as high complexity limits. For the elderly patients, the tracks were as follows: MRCI≥25.4, MRCI≥20.9, MRCI≥17.5, MRCI≥15.7, MRCI≥14.0, and MRCI≥13.0. For adult patients, the limits of high complexity were MRCI≥25.1; MRCI ≥ 23.8; MRCI≥21.0; MRCI≥17.0; MRCI≥16.5; and MRCI≥15.5. Conclusion: The medication regimen complexity is associated with the patient's illness profile and problems with the use of drugs; therefore, the proposed scores can be useful in prioritizing patients for clinical care by pharmacists and other health professionals.</ab>
        <ab>Antecedentes: La complejidad de un régimen de medicación se relaciona con las múltiples características del régimen prescrito que pueden influenciar negativamente los resultados en salud de los pacientes. Objetivo: Proponer puntos de corte en la complejidad de la farmacoterapia para diferenciar entre pacientes de baja y alta complejidad que permita la priorización de la gestión de los pacientes entre los atendidos en un centro de cuidados primarios. Métodos: Este es un estudio transversal que incluyó 517 adultos y ancianos analizando diferentes puntos de corte para definir los estratos de alta y baja complejidad de la farmacoterapia basándose en los percentiles de la población evaluada. La recogida de datos comenzó con la solicitud de las prescripciones, seguida de un cuestionario administrado por un entrevistador. La complejidad de la medicación se estimó mediante el Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). En las farmacoterapias de alta complejidad se analizó los perfiles de los pacientes, el uso de servicios de salud, y la farmacoterapia. Los criterios para la inclusión de la muestra fueron: habitantes del área cubierta por el municipio, 18 años o más, y tener prescrito al menos un medicamento durante el periodo de recogida de datos. Los criterios de exclusión durante la recogida de datos fue el uso de algún medicamento que no estaba disponible. Todos los medicamentos eran del Servicio de Cuidados Primarios (PHS). Resultados: La mediana total de puntuación de complejidad de la farmacoterapia fue de 8,5. Las puntuaciones altas del MRCI se correlacionaban con la edad, medicamentos tomados del PHS, tener al menos una interacción potencial medicamento-medicamento, tener más de 8 años de escolaridad, numero de medicamentos, polimedicación (cinco o más medicamentos), número de problemas de salud, número de visitas al médico, y numero de enfermedades cardiovasculares o metabólicas. Sugerimos diferentes tramos de complejidad de acuerdo a la edad (e.g. adultos o ancianos) que tienen en cuenta las características de la población y la farmacoterapia como límites de alta complejidad. Para los ancianos los tramos eran: MRCI≥25,4, MRCI≥20,9, MRCI≥17,5, MRCI≥15,7, MRCI≥14,0, y MRCI≥13,0. Para los pacientes adultos los límites de complejidad eran: MRCI≥25,1; MRCI ≥ 23,8; MRCI≥21,0; MRCI≥17,0; MRCI≥16,5; y MRCI≥15,5. Conclusión: La complejidad del régimen de medicación se asocia con el perfil de enfermedad del paciente y sus problemas de uso de medicamentos; por tanto, los limites propuestos pueden ser útiles para priorizar pacientes en cuidados clínicos de los farmacéuticos u otros profesionales de la salud.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Supporting someone through chemotherapy can be emotionally and physically demanding. However, research has yet to establish the type of support carers require or the best way to provide this. This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of a complex intervention for carers that was co-designed by staff and carers of patients starting chemotherapy.Methods: Forty-seven carers were recruited, randomised between the intervention (n = 24) and control (n = 23) groups. A questionnaire was completed pre- and post-intervention measuring knowledge of chemotherapy and its side effects, experience of care, satisfaction with outpatient services, coping and emotional wellbeing. The intervention process was evaluated by carers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in focus groups.Results: Recruitment to the study was unproblematic and attrition from it was low, suggesting the intervention and study processes were acceptable to patients and carers. Carers in receipt of the 'Take Care' intervention reported statistically significantly better understanding of symptoms and side effects and their information needs being more frequently met than carers in the control. Confidence in coping improved between baseline and follow-up for the intervention group and declined for the control although differences were insufficient to achieve statistical significance. There was no significant difference between the two groups' emotional wellbeing. HCP and carer focus groups confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.Conclusions: The 'Take Care' intervention proved acceptable to carers and HCPs and demonstrates considerable promise and utility in practice. Study findings support the conduct of a fully powered RCT to determine the intervention's effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Hospitals are under increasing pressures by governing bodies to meet mandated performance standards and fiscal targets. As a result, hospitals are incentivized by funders to discharge patients efficiently and effectively. Gaining insight into the patient experience of discharge, as well as understanding patient needs and concerns, is prudent. Leveraging this knowledge may expedite patient discharge and potentially minimize hospital readmission rates. The purpose of this study was to better understand the discharge experiences and concerns of patients with multiple chronic diseases--a population currently understudied. In this study, qualitative survey data were analyzed from a large scale, mixed methods study that took place in 2011 at Bridgepoint Hospital, a complex continuing care and rehabilitation facility in Toronto, Canada. One hundred and sixteen patients were interviewed individually using a self-designed survey composed of open- and close-ended questions. All data pertaining to hospital discharge were extracted and examined using qualitative descriptive analysis. Key discharge concerns were related to process (next steps in the care plan, friction in the provider-patient relationship, premature discharge), consequences (relocation, impact on family, leaving the comforts and security of the hospital), and needs (availability of home care, managing daily activities, navigating the predisability home). Our findings are presented in a patient-centered framework that can be used as a guide for future discharge strategies for complex patient populations.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: There is a lack of population-based research about factors associated with medication regimen complexity. This study investigated factors associated with medication regimen complexity in older people, and whether factors associated with regimen complexity were similar to factors associated with number of medications. Methods: This cross-sectional population-based study included 3348 people aged ≥60 years. Medication regimen complexity was computed using the validated 65-item Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Multinomial logistic regression was used to compute unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with regimen complexity. Multivariable quantile regression was used to compare factors associated with regimen complexity and number of medications. Results: In adjusted analyses, participants in the highest MRCI quintile (MRCI &gt; 20) were older (OR = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.02;1.05), less likely to live at home (OR = 0.35, 95 % CI 0.15;0.86), had greater comorbidities (OR = 2.17, 95 % CI 1.89;2.49), had higher cognitive status (OR = 1.06, 95 % CI 1.01;1.11), a higher prevalence of self-reported pain (OR = 2.85, 95 % CI 2.16;3.76), had impaired dexterity (OR = 2.39, 95 % CI 1.77;3.24) and were more likely to receive help to sort their medications (OR = 4.43 95 % CI 2.39;8.56) than those with low regimen complexity (MRCI &gt;0-5.5). Similar factors were associated with both regimen complexity and number of medications. Conclusion: Older people with probable difficulties managing complex regimens, including those with impaired dexterity and living in institutional settings, had the most complex medication regimens even after adjusting for receipt of help to sort medications. The strong correlation between regimen complexity and number of medications suggests that clinicians could use a person's number of medications to target interventions to reduce complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The prognostic significance of premature atrial complex (PAC) burden is not fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the burden of PACs and long-term outcome.Methods and Results: We investigated the clinical characteristics of 5371 consecutive patients without atrial fibrillation (AF) or a permanent pacemaker (PPM) at baseline who underwent 24-hour electrocardiography monitoring between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2004. Clinical event data were retrieved from the Bureau of National Health Insurance of Taiwan. During a mean follow-up duration of 10±1 years, there were 1209 deaths, 1166 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, 3104 hospitalizations for any reason, 418 cases of new-onset AF, and 132 PPM implantations. The optimal cut-off of PAC burden for predicting mortality was 76 beats per day, with a sensitivity of 63.1% and a specificity of 63.5%. In multivariate analysis, a PAC burden &gt;76 beats per day was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio: 1.384, 95% CI: 1.230 to 1.558), cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio: 1.284, 95% CI: 1.137 to 1.451), new-onset AF (hazard ratio: 1.757, 95% CI: 1.427 to 2.163), and PPM implantation (hazard ratio: 2.821, 95% CI: 1.898 to 4.192). Patients with frequent PAC had increased risk of mortality attributable to myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Frequent PACs increased risk of PPM implantation owing to sick sinus syndrome, high-degree atrioventricular block, and/or AF.Conclusions: The burden of PACs is independently associated with mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization, new-onset AF, and PPM implantation in the long term.</ab>

        <ab>Objective We report our initial experience with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in elective high-risk complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Background ECMO has been employed as hemodynamic support in patients with cardiac arrest and hemodynamic shock. Methods We performed a single-center prospectical study, enrolling all patients at very high-risk for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were defined as a composite of death, acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and further need for revascularization. Results Twelve patients underwent elective high-risk PCI with ECMO support (mean age = 63.5 ± 8.7 years). The mean SYNTAX score was 30.1 ± 10.1. All PCI procedures were successful and no in-hospital MACCE was observed. At 6-months, neither death nor MI was noticed. Two patients (17%) required further revascularization, and one patient required chronic hemodialysis. Conclusions Elective high-risk PCI supported by ECMO is a viable alternative for patients who are at very high risk for CABG.</ab>

        <ab>"The care coordination program described here evolved from 5 years of trial and learning related to how to best serve our high-cost, high-utilizing, chronically ill, urban core patient population. In addition to medical complexity, they have daily challenges characteristic of persons served by Safety-Net health systems. Many have unstable health insurance status. Others have insecure housing. A number of patients have a history of substance use and mental illness. Many have fractured social supports. Although some of the best-known care transition models have been successful in reducing rehospitalizations and cost among patients studied, these models were developed for a relatively high functioning patient population with social support. We describe a successful approach targeted at working with patients who require a more intense and lengthy care coordination intervention to self-manage and reduce the cost of caring for their medical conditions. Using a diverse team and a set of replicable processes, we have demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the use of hospital and emergency services. Our intervention leverages the strengths and resilience of patients, focuses on trust and self-management, and targets heterogeneous ""high-utilizer"" patients with medical and social complexity."</ab>

BACKGROUND: Research indicates that nurses are reluctant to bring ethical concerns to nurse leaders for fear of creating trouble, and yet, nurse leaders are key figures in supporting ethics-minded clinicians and cultures. METHODS: The critical incident technique was used to collect descriptions from 100 nurse leaders in California. Responses were qualitatively coded, categorized, and counted. RESULTS: End-of-life situations accounted for the majority of incidents. Most situations had 3 to 4 ethical issues. Healthcare provider and system-level factors were perceived to increase the likelihood of ethical conflicts more often than family and patient factors. Respondents were more likely to identify leader actions that address specific situations rather than specify systemlevel actions addressing root causes of conflicts. CONCLUSIONS: Findings can be used to help leaders create ethics competencies, policies, and education.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Rising prevalence of obesity and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus has resulted in an increasing number of patients with multiple comorbidities who require treatment for chronic complex wounds. Because patients with diabetes and foot ulcers may have a higher risk for amputations, techniques that facilitate complex wound healing and prevent limb amputation are desirable. Here, we investigate a limb preservation strategy that includes application of a human acellular dermal wound matrix (HADWM). l Method: Medical history, physical examination and full wound assessment were completed for all patients. Systemic antibiotics and appropriate offloading were prescribed as needed. Wounds were debrided to create a bleeding bone and/or wound base for HADWM (Graftjacket regenerative tissue matrix, Wright Medical Technology, Inc., licensed by KCI, an Acelity company, San Antonio, TX). Healing progress was monitored over four weeks with weekly postoperative visits. ‘Healed' was defined as full epithelialisation without drainage. l Results: Lower extremity ulcers, 16 in 13 patients, were treated with HADWM between May 2004 and July 2013. The median patient age was 76 years (range: 38-90). The average number of comorbidities was three per patient, while 6 (46%) patients had ≥4 comorbidities. Diabetes mellitus (92%) and peripheral vascular disease (77%) were the two most common. All 16 (100%) wounds healed without complications. There were no recurrences in the 11 wounds of the nine patients available for follow-up. Of these patients two had previously advised to receive major leg amputations retained functional limbs. l Conclusion: The results in this small study reflect our practice’s 10-year experience using HADWM as part of a limb preservation strategy.</ab>

        <ab>Epilepsy is a serious, common neurologic disease that affects people of all ages. As under-scored in the 2012 Institute of Medicine report Epilepsy Across the Spectrum: Promoting Health and Understanding, the millions of people living with epilepsy in the United States face the challenges of seeking out high-quality, coordinated health care and community services; overcoming epilepsy misinformation and stigma; and finding understanding and support in their communities. This article, the first in a two-part series, discusses new research that has increased our understanding of epilepsy's etiology and pathophysiology, new definitions that are changing the ways we evaluate and treat this disease, conditions that frequently present with epilepsy, and psychosocial challenges faced by people with epilepsy. Part 2, which will appear in next month's issue, reviews comprehensive nursing care and evidence-based treatment for epilepsy and presents resources for people with epilepsy and their families.</ab>

        <ab>People diagnosed with a multiple long-term conditions and those with profound and multiple learning disabilities are the most intensive users of health and social care. In addition, around 30% of patients with long-term physical conditions also have a mental health problem. The close relationship between mental and physical health is reflected in the high frequency with which illnesses of both kinds overlap in an age of multi-morbidity. This study demonstrates that those with comorbid mental health problems show poorer clinical outcomes, lower quality of life and reduced ability to manage physical symptoms effectively. This also affects their capacity to engage in treatment and make decisions, which affects not only their care and treatment but ultimately their quality of life. The NHS Call to Action demanded improvement in the service provided to support the needs of people with long-term conditions. The scale of the impact of comorbid mental health problems on costs and outcomes suggests that developing services that respond more effectively to these needs should be a priority.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and Objectives New electrophysiology tools like intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) might help to minimize and early detect complications during cardiac ablation procedures. The aim of the study was to assess the utility and vascular safety of ICE during catheter ablation of complex cardiac arrhythmias in a medium-volume training center. Methods Prospective, observational study consisted of consecutive patients who underwent catheter-based ablation of complex cardiac arrhythmias. All procedures were performed using three-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping and routine cannulation of right and left femoral veins. The ICE probe was initially positioned at the mid-level of the right atrium and properly moved to monitor different steps of the procedure and identify complications. All procedure-related vascular complications were registered. Results One hundred two patients (age 61.4 ± 13.1 years, 69 male) underwent 110 ablation procedures. Pulmonary vein isolation was the most common ablation substrate (55.4%). Ventricular tachycardia (17.2%) and left atrial flutter procedures (16.4%) were also common. The use of ICE enabled us to early initiate anticoagulation and to optimize the transseptal puncture. It also provided the capability to early detect life-threatening complications such as tamponade (3.6%), along with important information during the procedure such as exact catheter location, lesion formation, and stability during radiofrequency delivery. Such benefits were not associated with a higher number of vascular complications. Conclusion The use of ICE during catheter-based ablation of complex cardiac substrates provides technical features that may decrease complications and increase accuracy while applying radiofrequency, especially in training centers where fellows start to perform complex procedures.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE To define the term complexity of care. BACKGROUND The aging population and lack of gerontological preparation in pre-licensure nursing programs are pressing issues. The NLN Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACE.S) project developed a framework to facilitate faculty and student understanding of older adults' care needs. Integral to the framework is the concept of complexity of care. METHOD Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS The analysis identified three antecedents (focus on treatment and cure of disease, multiple comorbidities, and life experiences and culture), five attributes (polypharmacy, use of advanced technologies, novel care models, a fragmented health care system, and the relational nature of caregiving), and two consequences (impact on quality of life and impact on quality of care). CONCLUSION Defining the concept of complexity of care will facilitate student understanding of the unique health care needs of older adults</ab>

        <ab>The academic literature reveals a dearth of evidence regarding the wound prevalence across a community setting, despite the need for both clinicians and commissioners to understand local need. To support the commissioning process, a wound prevalence audit was undertaken across all community services in an inner London borough in 2012 as part of a local needs analysis and to identify where resources were required. Within a population of 254,000, 272 residents had a total of 325 wounds, giving a mean of 1.19 wounds and a community wound prevalence of 1.07 per 1000 residents. The majority were male (51%) and the age range was 9–96 years. Acute and traumatic wounds accounted for 44% followed by foot and leg ulcers at 41%, pressure ulcers at 13% and other wound types at 2.6%. Of the lower leg ulceration group, 34 patients had venous ulceration, giving a prevalence of 0.13 per 1000. The difficulties in establishing a comprehensive wound prevalence that includes acute services are discussed in addition to the significance of the findings in the context of a deprived ethnically diverse borough with a younger population. The number of residents with any wound type was lower than other reported studies with similar methodologies. This paper presents the view that, despite the deprivation of the borough, the combined factors of age, ethnicity and early access to specialist expertise appear to deliver a lower community wound prevalence.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To explore how health professionals, patients and family members communicate about managing medicines across transition points of care in two Australian public hospitals. Background Medicines errors are common at transition points of care. Little qualitative work has targeted communicating about medicines management across patients' journeys from admission through to discharge. Design A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken. Methods In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and family members, and focus groups and interviews were undertaken with doctors, nurses and pharmacists ( n = 103). These individuals were situated in emergency departments and general medical wards. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Four themes were identified: contextual environment of care, competing responsibilities of care, awareness of responsibility for safety, and interprofessional communication. Contextual environment of care was affected by time pressure and efficiency, and an overriding priority to move patients out of emergency departments. In competing responsibilities of care, a reactive focus was displayed in emergency departments while a proactive stance was demonstrated in medical wards. There was an awareness of responsibility for safety, whereby key stakeholders appreciated the chain of events involved, interpersonal communication affected patients and carers, and consequences existed for patient education related to lack of information. Interdisciplinary communication was associated with communication modalities used in encounters, compartmentalised thinking, and medicines changes relayed to external providers. Conclusions Medicines management at transition points involved a complex interplay of dynamic features. This interplay infiltrated across diverse environments, affecting patient care within and outside hospitals. Relevance to clinical practice Health professionals require greater appreciation of each other's roles at transition points of care. Prioritisation of high-risk patients is needed, such as those with cognitive impairment and multiple co-morbidities. Establishing workable protocols of communication etiquette and a structured approach to medicines activities may assist in pre-empting problems before they occur.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This qualitative, longitudinal, descriptive study aimed to understand the lived experience of enacting agency, and to describe the phenomenon of agency and the meaning structure of the phenomenon during the year after a stroke. Agency is defined as making things happen in everyday life through one's actions. Methods: This study followed six persons (three men and three women, ages 63 to 89), interviewed on four separate occasions. Interview data were analysed using the Empirical Phenomenological Psychological method. Results: The main findings showed that the participants experienced enacting agency in their everyday lives after stroke as negotiating different characteristics over a span of time, a range of difficulty, and in a number of activities, making these negotiations complex. The four characteristics described how the participants made things happen in their everyday lives through managing their disrupted bodies, taking into account their past and envisioning their futures, dealing with the world outside themselves, and negotiating through internal dialogues. Conclusions: This empirical evidence regarding negotiations challenges traditional definitions of agency and a new definition of agency is proposed. Understanding clients' complex negotiations and offering innovative solutions to train in real-life situations may help in the process of enabling occupations after a stroke.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports findings drawn from a study of good practice in English social care for adults with disability and older people with severe and complex needs. People with severe and complex needs are a relatively small proportion of adult social care service users, but they are growing in numbers and have resource-intensive needs. The study involved qualitative research with adults with disability and older people with severe and complex needs, family carers and members of specialist organisations (n = 67), focusing on the features of social care services they considered to be good practice. Data were collected between August 2010 and June 2011. The approach to data collection was flexible, to accommodate participants' communication needs and preferences, including face-to-face and telephone interviews, Talking Mats© sessions and a focus group. Data were managed using Framework and analysed thematically. Features of good practice were considered at three levels: (i) everyday support; (ii) service organisation; and (iii) commissioning. Findings relating to the first two of these are presented here. Participants emphasised the importance of person-centred ways of working at all levels. Personalisation, as currently implemented in English social care, aims to shift power from professionals to service users through the allocation of personal budgets. This approach focuses very much on the role of the individual in directing his/her own support arrangements. However, participants in this study also stressed the importance of ongoing professional support, for example, from a specialist key worker or case manager to co-ordinate diverse services and ensure good practice at an organisational level. The paper argues that, despite the recent move to shift power from professionals to service users, people with the most complex needs still value support from professionals and appropriate organisational support. Without these, they risk being excluded from the benefits that personalisation, properly supported, could yield.</ab>

        <ab>The academic literature reveals a dearth of evidence regarding the wound prevalence across a community setting, despite the need for both clinicians and commissioners to understand local need. To support the commissioning process, a wound prevalence audit was undertaken across all community services in an inner London borough in 2012 as part of a local needs analysis and to identify where resources were required. Within a population of 254,000, 272 residents had a total of 325 wounds, giving a mean of 1.19 wounds and a community wound prevalence of 1.07 per 1000 residents. The majority were male (51%) and the age range was 9–96 years. Acute and traumatic wounds accounted for 44% followed by foot and leg ulcers at 41%, pressure ulcers at 13% and other wound types at 2.6%. Of the lower leg ulceration group, 34 patients had venous ulceration, giving a prevalence of 0.13 per 1000. The difficulties in establishing a comprehensive wound prevalence that includes acute services are discussed in addition to the significance of the findings in the context of a deprived ethnically diverse borough with a younger population. The number of residents with any wound type was lower than other reported studies with similar methodologies. This paper presents the view that, despite the deprivation of the borough, the combined factors of age, ethnicity and early access to specialist expertise appear to deliver a lower community wound prevalence.</ab>

        <ab>Complex wounds (superficial-, partial-, or full-thickness skin loss wounds healing by secondary intention) are common; however, there is a lack of high-quality, contemporary epidemiological data. This paper presents point prevalence estimates for complex wounds overall as well as for individual types. A multiservice, cross-sectional survey was undertaken across a United Kingdom city ( Leeds, population 751,485) during 2 weeks in spring of 2011. The mean age of people with complex wounds was approximately 70 years, standard deviation 19.41. The point prevalence of complex wounds was 1.47 per 1,000 of the population, 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.56. While pressure ulcers and leg ulcers were the most frequent, one in five people in the sample population had a less common wound type. Surveys confined to people with specific types of wound would underestimate the overall impact of complex wounds on the population and health care resources.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To determine the medium-term effects of nurse case management on the dependence and satisfaction of patients with complex chronic disease and on caregiver burden. Background Caregiver exhaustion increases the readmission rate of highly dependent patients with complex chronic disease and their consumption of primary care resources. Design An observational and analytical cohort study was undertaken in multimorbid patients. Methods Data were gathered on Barthel Index and Caregiver Burden Index scores, primary care resource consumption, readmission and mortality rates, and patient satisfaction with care and care continuity. Results were compared between nurse case-managed ( n = 62) and control ( n = 193) multimorbid patients using univariate and bivariate analyses. Results The study included 255 patients with complex chronic disease (24·32% in management cohort vs. 75·68% in control cohort). The nurse case-managed group had significantly lower Barthel Index and higher Caregiver Burden Index scores and a significantly longer hospital stay. At 90 days postdischarge, no significant intergroup differences were observed in Barthel Index or Caregiver Burden Index scores, primary care resource consumption, readmission rate or mortality rate; the case-managed patients showed a significantly higher satisfaction level with their care and its continuity. Conclusions Nurse case management prevents a postdischarge increase in the dependence of multimorbid patients and the burden of their caregivers. Relevance to clinical practice Application of nurse case management can reduce the readmission rate and primary care consumption of patients with chronic complex disease after their hospital stay and prevent an exacerbation of caregiver exhaustion.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In response to Medicare reimbursement changes related to central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) effective January 2011, a long-term acute care hospital implemented quality improvement measures to reduce these health care-associated infections. Improvements included alcohol-impregnated port protectors, chlorhexidine gluconate barrier dressings, and didactic/hands on training for care and maintenance. During 2010 the peripherally inserted central line (PICC) team at a neighboring Magnet hospital was asked to partner and develop strategies to further decrease CLABSI. Methods: The PICC team evaluated the effects of an antimicrobial PICC device in an effort to further reduce the incidence of CLABSI. Upon initiation of the evaluation phase, a database was created to track infection/thrombus rate, insertion-related complications, dwell time, diagnosis, tip location, infusate, vein used, and catheter size. Data collection and reporting was managed by the PICC team. Results: Across a 2-year period (July 2011-July 2013), 100 devices were inserted with a total of 1,705 line days without any reported CLABSI. The majority of patients received a 4.5F single lumen device (59%). Dwell time ranged from 1 to 57 days with an average of 17 days. To date, no CLABSIs related to this device have been reported at the long-term acute care hospital. Conclusions: Based on 100 insertions yielding no infections this new product appears to improve patient safety and quality of care. Relative to these results sole use of this product has become their institutional standard for long-term intravenous needs.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the biopsychosocial aspects and aspects of the health system of hospitalized elderly and to classify their degree of care complexity. Methods: This was a quantitative study whose convenience sample consisted of 279 elderly. The Interdisciplinary Medicine Instrument (INTERMED) method was used, a tool that identified biopsychosocial aspects and conditions of the health system and classified the complexity of the patient. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis. Results: The prevailing profile was of elderly women, retired, white, with low educational levels, married and satisfied with their life conditions. The mean age was 72.3 years. The biological domain was the most compromised. As for the complexity of care, 34.8% of the patients required multiprofessional care. Conclusion: The elderly had high care complexity, with the biological and health system domains being the most compromised.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older people often take multiple medications. It is a policy priority to facilitate older people to stay at home longer. Three-quarters of nursing home placements in the US are preceded by a hospitalization. Objective: To investigate the association between polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity with hospital discharge destination among older people. Methods: This prospective cohort study comprised patients aged ≥70 years consecutively admitted to the Geriatric Evaluation and Management unit at a tertiary hospital in Adelaide, Australia, between October 2010 and December 2011. Medication regimen complexity at discharge was calculated using the 65-item validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for medication-related factors associated with discharge directly to home versus non-community settings (rehabilitation, transition care, and residential aged care). Results: From 163 eligible patients, 87 were discharged directly to home (mean age 84.6 years, standard deviation [SD] 6.9; mean MRCI 26.1, SD 9.7), while 76 were discharged to non-community settings (mean age 85.8 years, SD 5.8; mean MRCI 29.9, SD 13.2). After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and activities of daily living, having a high medication regimen complexity (MRCI &gt;35) was inversely associated with discharge directly to home (RR 0.39; 95 % CI 0.20-0.73), whereas polypharmacy (≥9 medications) was not significantly associated with discharge directly to home (RR 0.97; 95 % CI 0.53-1.58). Conclusion: Having high medication regimen complexity was inversely associated with discharge directly to home, while polypharmacy was not associated with discharge destination.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Complex medication regimens may adversely affect compliance and treatment outcomes. Complexity can be assessed with the medication regimen complexity index (MRCI), which has proved to be a valid, reliable tool, with potential uses in both practice and research.Objective: To use the MRCI to assess medication regimen complexity in institutionalized elderly people.Setting: Five nursing homes in mainland Portugal.Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study of institutionalized elderly people (n = 415) was performed from March to June 2009, including all inpatients aged 65 and over taking at least one medication per day.Main Outcome Measure: Medication regimen complexity index.Results: The mean age of the sample was 83.9 years (±6.6 years), and 60.2 % were women. The elderly patients were taking a large number of drugs, with 76.6 % taking more than five medications per day. The average medication regimen complexity was 18.2 (±SD = 9.6), and was higher in the females (p &lt; 0.001). The most decisive factors contributing to the complexity were the number of drugs and dosage frequency. In regimens with the same number of medications, schedule was the most relevant factor in the final score (r = 0.922), followed by pharmaceutical forms (r = 0.768) and additional instructions (r = 0.742).Conclusion: Medication regimen complexity proved to be high. There is certainly potential for the pharmacist's intervention to reduce it as part as the medication review routine in all the patients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) occur in up to 95% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). In most, SSc-associated antibodies are detected (i.e., centromere, topoisomerase I, RNA polymerase III, PM/Scl, Ro52/TRIM21, and U1RNP). Ribonuclease P protein subunit p25, (Rpp25) is an autoantigenic component of the Th/To complex. The contribution of anti-Th/To and anti-Rpp25 antibodies to ANA positivity in patients with SSc remains unknown. METHODS: Sera from 873 patients with SSc were tested for ANA, and SSc-associated antibodies were measured. Samples without antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA; n = 53, ANA+/ENA-), were analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP) and metabolically labeled proteins and for anti-Rpp25 antibodies (n = 50) by a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) and Rpp25 ELISA. RESULTS: Anti-Th/To antibodies occurred in 19/53 (36%), as determined by IP, and were the most common autoantibody in ANA+/ENA- SSc. Of those samples, 50/53 were available for additional testing by CLIA and ELISA. Anti-Rpp25 antibodies were detected in 12 (24% CLIA) or 10 (20% ELISA) of 50 patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed similar discrimination between Th/To IP-positive (n = 19) and -negative samples (n = 31) by CLIA and ELISA (area under the curve 0.90 vs 0.87; p = 0.6691). The positive percent agreement between IP and CLIA or ELISA was 12/19 (63.2%, 95% CI 38.4-83.7%) or 10/19 (52.6%, 95% CI 73.3-94.2%), respectively. Negative percent agreement was 100% for both assays. CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies to the Th/To autoantigen are important in patients with SSc who have been considered negative for SSc-specific or SSc-associated antibodies by widely available commercial assays. Rpp25 can be considered a major target of anti-Th/To antibodies. Assays detecting anti-Th/To and anti-Rpp25 antibodies may be important in SSc.</ab>

        <ab>Despite efforts to promote tissue repair, many wounds heal slowly, do not heal or deteriorate. Management of these chronic wounds is a growing problem. Innovation and cost cutting is key to current health policy and therefore clinicians should be taking advantage of emerging technologies that can improve outcomes for patients while reducing costs. Accel-Heal is an innovative electroceutical device that uses a patented synapse sequence programmed to deliver a specific series of electric energy interactions through the skin to manipulate gene expression and modify specific physiological functions in dermal tissue, improving and accelerating healing. This article examines the use of Accel-Heal in three case studies.  INSET: Box 1. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI).</ab>

        <ab>Terminally ill patients can have unexpected, enigmatic, and profound cognitive shifts that significantly alter their perception of themselves, thereby eliminating their fear of death and dying. However, there are no systematic studies into these remarkable yet ineffable transcendence experiences. They therefore remain easily overlooked or viewed as isolated anomalies and therefore excluded from quality-of-life patient considerations. We use a multimodal methodology for identifying the prevalence and thematic properties of complex emergent metaphors patients use to report these experiences. Although previous research has pioneered the importance of understanding conventional or primary metaphors at the end of life, our findings indicate the considerable potential of more complex metaphors for reducing barriers to effective communication in palliative care.</ab>

        <ab>This article reports findings from a scoping review of the literature on good practice in social care for disabled adults and older people with severe and complex needs. Scoping reviews differ from systematic reviews, in that they aim to rapidly map relevant literature across an area of interest. This review formed part of a larger study to identify social care service models with characteristics desired by people with severe and complex needs and scope the evidence of effectiveness. Systematic database searches were conducted for literature published between January 1997 and February 2011 on good practice in UK social care services for three exemplar groups: young adults with life-limiting conditions; adults who had suffered a brain injury or spinal injury and had severe or complex needs; and older people with dementia and complex needs. Five thousand and ninety-eight potentially relevant records were identified through electronic searching and 51 by hand. Eighty-six papers were selected for inclusion, from which 29 studies of specific services were identified. However, only four of these evaluated a service model against a comparison group and only six reported any evidence of costs. Thirty-five papers advocated person-centred support for people with complex needs, but no well-supported evaluation evidence was found in favour of any particular approach to delivering this. The strongest evaluation evidence indicated the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary specialist team for young adults; intensive case management for older people with advanced dementia; a specialist social worker with a budget for domiciliary care working with psycho-geriatric inpatients; and interprofessional training for community mental health professionals. The dearth of robust evaluation evidence identified through this review points to an urgent need for more rigorous evaluation of models of social care for disabled adults and older people with severe and complex needs.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Over the last few decades, new residential, vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities for persons with intellectual disabilities (ID) in Ontario (Canada) have allowed them to integrate into mainstream society. However, persons with ID continue to struggle to fit into the healthcare system. In particular, previous work reported that persons with ID tended to receive more interventions that focused on behaviour management, and less related to community skills and reintegration. The current study determines whether the presence of an ID diagnosis continues to predict service use. Methods: Analyses are based on anonymized population-level data collected as part of regular clinical practice in inpatient psychiatry (171495 assessments, 3·9% have an ID) and complex continuing care (CCC) hospitals (112021 assessments, 1·32% have an ID) in Ontario. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test the relationship between ID and services, controlling for select confounders. Results: The results showed that persons with and without ID in inpatient psychiatry and CCC continue to have differential odds of receiving various healthcare services, in spite of needs recognized through the assessment. Overall, interventions that target behaviours rather than improvement of skills are received by persons with ID in both settings. Conclusion: Persons with ID continue to experience inequities in the Ontario healthcare system.</ab>

        <ab>he treatment of complex wounds is difficult and not always effective. Various treatment options are used with varying degrees of success. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a cost-efficient and effective way to help treat these wounds. The use of a vacuum device applies the negative pressure to the site of the wound and promotes waste removal and increases circulation and tissue formation. While various NPWT systems are currently on the market, we utilised the ConvaTec Engenex® system with Bio-Dome™ technology; however, our case study is not intended to advocate the specific use of this system, but instead focuses on the use of NPWT as a viable option for wound healing. Each of the following case study patients presented with difficult-to-heal wounds that failed traditional therapeutic approaches. Through the use of NPWT, our patients saw major wound size reductions. Each patient exhibited at least a 94% reduction in wound area, wound volume or both.</ab>

        <ab>The past several years have witnessed an upsurge in the focus on person-centered care for several populations, and especially for vulnerable elders with dementia who reside in nursing homes. The limited ability to accurately detect and quantify complex behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD) patterns has hampered the development and refinement of tailored interventions. This study's purpose was to characterize complex patterns of BSD and examine the association among different BSD patterns and cortisol profiles. Two groups of nursing home residents were analyzed (N = 28,N = 27) using THEME™. Behavioral and cortisol data were collected for four consecutive days. Random effects model was used to characterize BSD trajectories over time. There was a significant difference in BSD between the two groups from late afternoon to early evening. The groups differed significantly in age, comorbidities, antianxiety medication, and the number and complexity of patterns of vocalization and restlessness. THEME™analysis, a first step in developing and timing person-centered interventions, was able to identify BSD patterns that drove the overall time of day pattern.</ab>

        <ab>The use of complex syntax in the spoken discourse of young, middle-aged, and older adults was examined. The purpose of the study was to determine if syntactic complexity would show an age-related decline. Language samples were elicited from healthy adults in their 20 s, 40 s, and 60 s ( n = 20 per group) using a conversational (CON) task and a peer conflict resolution (PCT) task. Each sample was transcribed, segmented into utterances, and coded for main clauses and all types of finite and non-finite subordinate clauses. The results indicated that all groups produced greater syntactic complexity during the PCR task than the CON task as measured by mean length of utterance, clausal density, and the use of left-branching clauses. Additionally, the groups did not differ on any syntactic measures for either task. It is concluded that syntactic complexity in spoken discourse remains stable during the years that span early, middle, and later adulthood.</ab>

        <ab>Background: general opinion is growing that drug cessation in complex older patients is warranted in certain situations. From a clinical viewpoint, drug cessation seems most warranted in four situations, i.e., falls, delirium, cognitive impairment and end-of-life situations. To date, little information about the effects of drug cessation in these four situations is available.Objectives: to identify the effects and effectiveness of drug cessation on falls, delirium and cognitive impairment. For end-of-life situations, we reviewed cessation of inappropriate drug use.Methods: electronic databases were searched using MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Studies published in English were included if they evaluated the effects of drug cessation in older persons, aged ≥65 years, with falls, delirium or cognitive impairment; or cessation of inappropriate drug use in end-of-life situations.Results: we selected seven articles for falls, none for delirium, two for cognition and two for end-of-life situations. Withdrawal of psychotropics reduced fall rate; a prescribing modification programme for primary care physicians reduced fall risk. Withdrawal of psychotropics and a systematic reduction of polypharmacy resulted in an improvement of cognition. Very little rigorous research has been conducted on reducing inappropriate medications in patients approaching end of life.Conclusion: little research has focussed on drug cessation. Available studies showed a beneficial impact of cessation of psychotropic drugs on falls and cognitive status. More research in this field is needed. The issue of systematic drug withdrawal in end-of-life cases is controversial, but is increasingly relevant in the face of rising numbers of older people of this clinical status.</ab>

Very little rigorous research has been conducted on reducing inappropriate medications in patients approaching end of life.Conclusion: little research has focussed on drug cessation. Available studies showed a beneficial impact of cessation of psychotropic drugs on falls and cognitive status. More research in this field is needed. The issue of systematic drug withdrawal in end-of-life cases is controversial, but is increasingly relevant in the face of rising numbers of older people of this clinical status.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Many residents of assisted living (AL) have chronic diseases that are difficult to manage, including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). We estimated the amount and intensity of care delivered by the staff for residents with these conditions. Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis from the Maryland Assisted Living (MDAL) Study (399 residents, 29 facilities). In-person assessments included measures of cognition, function, depression, and general medical health. Diagnosis of CHF, COPD, and DM, as well as current medications was abstracted from AL medical charts. Measures of care utilization were operationalized at the resident level as: 1 ) minutes per day of direct care (caregiver activity scale [CAS]), 2) subjective staff ratings of care burden, and 3) assigned AL 'level of care' (based on state regulatory criteria). Results: In best fit regression models, CHF and DM were not significant predictors of the evaluated care utilization measures; however, COPD was independently associated with increased minutes per day of direct care - 34% of the variance in the caregiver activity scale was explained by degree of functional dependency, cognitive impairment, age, and presence of COPD. Functional dependency, depressive symptoms, and age explained almost a quarter (23%) of the variance of staff care burden rating. For the AL level of care intensity rating, degree of functional dependency, level of cognition, and age were significant correlates, together explaining about 28% of the variance. Conclusion: The presence of COPD was a significant predictor of time per day of direct care. However, CHF and DM were not correlates of care utilization measures. Functional and cognitive impairment was associated with measures of care utilization, reiterating the importance of these characteristics in the utilization and intensity of care consumed by AL residents. Further study of this population could reveal other forms and amounts of care utilization.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: We report on a 68 years old survivor of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with favorable neurological outcome following prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR 59 min) until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The case demonstrates the beneficial effect of an optimal rescue chain including basic life support performed by trained bystanders, short response time of the emergency medical service, uninterrupted CPR during transportation using a mechanical chest compression system (LUCASÂ®), in combination with optimal intensive care management of cardiogenic shock after ROSC including multivessel emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intravascular therapeutic hypothermia (CoolgardÂ®-System).</ab>

        <ab>Aging at home and in one's community poses unique challenges for older adults with multiple chronic conditions and functional difficulties. Addressing the needs of this complex group and creating supportive living environments are essential to improving quality of life and reducing the personal and societal expenditures of this growing segment of the aging population. This article discusses theoretical frameworks for understanding the interplay between intrinsic personal and external environmental factors that impinge on aging in place, and identifies evidence-informed supportive strategies with the potential to address their daily living needs.</ab>

        <ab>Objective This study investigated what is important in care delivery from the perspective of hospital inpatients with complex chronic disease, a currently understudied population. Participants and Setting One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with inpatients at a continuing care/rehabilitation hospital ( n = 116) in Canada between February and July 2011. Design The study design was mixed methods and reports on patient characteristics and care delivery experiences. Basic descriptive statistics were run using SPSS version 17, and thematic analysis on the transcripts was conducted using NVivo9 software. Results Patients had an average of 5 morbidities and several illness symptoms including activity of daily living impairments, physical pain and emotional disturbance. Three broad themes (each with one or more subthemes) were generated from the data representing important components of care delivery: components of the care plan (a comprehensive assessment, supported transitions and a bio-psycho-social care package); care capacity and quality (optimal staff to patient ratios, quicker response times, better patient-provider communication and consistency between providers) and the patient-provider relationships (characterized by respect and dignity). Conclusions As health systems throughout the industrialized world move to sustain health budgets while optimizing quality of care, it is critical to better understand this population, so that appropriate metrics, services and policies can be developed. The study has generated a body of evidence on the important components of care delivery from the perspectives of a diverse group of chronically ill individuals who have spent a considerable amount of time in the health-care system. Moving forward, exploration around the appropriate funding models and skill mix is needed to move the evidence into changed practice.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare online effects of syntactic complexity in written and spoken sentence comprehension in people with aphasia (PWA) and adults with no brain damage (NBD). Method: The participants in Experiment 1 were NBD older and younger adults (n = 20 per group). The participants in Experiment 2 were 10 PWA. In both experiments, the participants read and listened to sentences in self-paced reading and listening tasks. The experimental materials consisted of object cleft sentences (e.g., It was the girl who the boy hugged.) and subject cleft sentences (e.g., It was the boy who hugged the girl.). Results: The predicted effects of syntactic complexity were observed in both Experiments 1 and 2: Reading and listening times were longer for the verb in sentences with object compared to subject relative clauses. The NBD controls showed exaggerated effects of syntactic complexity in reading compared to listening. The PWA did not show different modality effects from the NBD participants. Conclusion: Although effects of syntactic complexity were somewhat exaggerated in reading compared with listening, both the PWA and the NBD controls showed similar effects in both modalities.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT Objectives To report and evaluate a complex touch massage intervention according to the British Medical Research Council framework. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of touch massage on levels of anxiety and physiological stress in patients scheduled for elective aortic surgery. Background The use of touch massage has increased during the past decade but no systematic studies have been implemented to investigate the effectiveness of such treatment. It is important to conduct multidisciplinary investigations into the effects of complex interventions such as touch massage. For this, the British Medical Research Council has provided a useful framework to guide the development, piloting, evaluation and reporting of complex intervention studies. Method A pilot study with a randomized controlled design including 20 patients (10 + 10) scheduled for elective aortic surgery. Selected outcome parameters included; self-reported anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y instrument, and physiological stress, measured by heart rate variability, blood pressure, respiratory frequency, oxygen saturation and concentrations of cortisol, insulin and glucose in serum. Results There were significant differences in self-reported anxiety levels before and after touch massage ( p = 0·007), this was not observed in the control group ( p = 0·833). There was a significant difference in self-reported anxiety levels between the touch massage group and the control group after touch massage and rest ( p = 0·001). There were no significant differences in physiological stress-related outcome parameters between patients who received touch massage and controls. Conclusion In our study, touch massage decreased anxiety levels in patients scheduled for elective aortic surgery, and the British Medical Research Council framework was a useful guideline for the development, evaluation and reporting of a touch massage intervention. Relevance to clinical practice Touch massage can reduce patients' anxiety levels and is thus an important nursing intervention in intensive and post-operative care.</ab>

        <ab>Orthopaedic limb reconstruction patients often have wounds that are difficult to heal either due to the underlying problems, their surgery, underlying comorbidities or a combination of these factors. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a useful tool with which to manage these wounds; however, many systems are not ideal for use in the patient's home, due in part to size and complexity. There are also staff training issues if transferring patients to an area which does not routinely use negative pressure systems. This paper reports the outcomes for some of the patients who were treated with a novel, single-use NPWT device in a orthopaedic trauma/limb reconstruction unit.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a need for individuating those post-stroke patients who may benefit from an optimal and customised rehabilitation plan aiming at early reintegration in community life participation. This study investigated whether the gain of independence in complex Activities of Daily Living (ADL) may be predicted before the discharge from the stroke unit using simple bedside determinants. METHODS: In 104 first-ever stroke patients with no previous disability, ten determinants at 10 days after stroke were selected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the prognostic determinants able to predict independence in complex ADL, as measured by modified Rankin Scale grade ≤2. RESULTS: The model shows that having a Barthel Index ≱9, a Motricity Index- Upper Limb ≱75, an age ≤70 and being a male resulted in 100% probability of achieving independence in complex ADL. If three of the four determinants were present, the probability was more than 90%. With the presence of two of the four determinants, the probability ranged from 87% to 28%. With the presence of only one determinant, the probability was 13%. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate prediction of independence in complex ADL can be made before the discharge from the stroke unit. The strength of the paretic upper limb, age, gender, and the ability of performing basic ADL are the significant variables. The probability of favorable prognosis depends on the presence and on the robustness of each single determinant.</ab>

        <ab>In the past decade, primary care services have expanded in the clinical area of substance misuse. With tiered systems of drug treatment delivery, patients with complex needs are usually treated by specialist services, with primary care seems the less complex patients. This article argues that this approach needs to be re-visited and updated, as primary care can accommodate many patients who are classed as complex. The article illustrates this by examining patients in primary care who are on high doses of methadone and argues that primary care could be expanded further to address the needs of these patients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that low rates of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) use are only partially explained by medical considerations, and that biases, beliefs, systems, and uncertainty affect acute stroke decision-making. METHODS: We generated a list of factors potentially influential in acute stroke decision-making: uncertainty, patient demographics that may predispose to bias (age, sex, comorbidities), physician experiences and beliefs, and systems factors. An online survey was distributed to neurologists in the province of Ontario, Canada, to assess the influence of these elements. A response rate of 69% was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent (79%) of respondents were less likely to administer IV tPA to patients with dementia, and many were less likely to treat patients from nursing homes, with more severe strokes, or over age 80. All respondents recognized the presence of diagnostic uncertainty, and 87% believed that uncertainty in interpreting advanced imaging affected their use of tPA. The majority of respondents (70%) believed that a large left middle cerebral artery territory stroke was a fate worse than death. Four percent did not believe that IV tPA is an effective treatment for stroke. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the presence of uncertainty, beliefs, and biases in acute stroke decision-making. This survey should be considered a preliminary investigation of the multiple factors implicit in IV tPA administration.</ab>

        <ab>Background: A growing body of literature suggests that living with a complex, rare and/or progressive neurological condition can have significant impact on a patient and families/carer psychological and emotional well-being. Leventhal’s Self Regulation theory will underpin understanding of the coping strategies adopted. Leventhal and proponents of this theory suggest that we are active participants in our health care. Therefore, if we are able to recognise patients’ illness representations, we can better coordinate care to suit those who receive it. Bowen’s Family Systems Theory will be referenced when discussing the experience of the patients’ nominated family member.Methods: Secondary data were used from the analysis of the service evaluation study of the ‘My Needs Now’ project hosted by Hertfordshire Community Healthcare Trust.Findings: A number of themes emerged namely, Professional Knowledge and Understanding, Time and Progression, The Family, and Coping Strategies. It is apparent that health professionals need to develop their specific knowledge about complex, neurological and palliative diagnoses and engage with patients and carers as individual cases distributing knowledge appropriately. Whilst patients and carers must adopt a range of coping strategies allowing them to both reactively and proactively engage with support over the course of the disease.</ab>

        <ab>Although age alone is not an independent risk factor for dehydration, converging age-related factors along with personal hydration habits can contribute to risk for dehydration in older adults. This article explores the problem of assessment of dehydration risk in older adults by reviewing major age-related changes including blunted thirst response, decreasing fluid consumption, and unreliability of biochemical indicators of hydration as confounders of assessment of hydration status in older adults. An additional assessment issue of imprecision of dehydration risk screens is also addressed. Given the heterogeneity of health status in older adults, it is suggested that identifying hydration habits can provide important information about an individual's hydration status and that in combination with biochemical indicators of hydration may be the best method for evaluating dehydration risk in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objective: To compare activities of daily living (ADL) staging based on 2-level responses to ADL difficulty questions (simple ADL stages) with ADL staging based on 4-level ADL question responses (complex ADL stages). Design: Analysis of the Second Longitudinal Study of Aging, a prospective cohort study, using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Setting: Participants' homes. Participants: Community-dwelling persons (N=9447) aged ≥70 years in 1994. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Agreement and face validity: baseline simple ADL stage; (2) construct validity: baseline health, difficulty, and need characteristics; (3) prognostic comparison (determined at the Wave 2 interview): primary—nursing home use and/or death; secondary—death. Results: The systems showed good agreement (κ=.75). The simple ADL stages stratified people into distinct groups and reflected the expected stepwise increases from stage 0 to stage IV in health and need characteristics, such as the prevalence of home-related challenges (2.9%–84.5%) and perceived need for home modifications (2.1%–33.6%). In comparing the prognostic ability using the primary outcome, the complex system model demonstrated slightly increased discrimination between milder stages and a slightly higher C statistic (.666 vs .664). Conclusions: Although complex staging appears slightly better at classifying people into distinct prognostic strata with respect to nursing home use and/or death at Wave 2, simple ADL stages demonstrate strong, clinically relevant associations with health and need characteristics.</ab>

        <ab>The cost of care for home health clients with complicated wounds frequently exceeds reimbursement received from Medicare and other payer sources. As a result, home health agencies may be reluctant to accept this type of referral. Many of the costs associated with complex wound care can be substantially reduced by appropriate use of expensive therapies and dressings and establishment of a cost-effective wound care formulary. Costs can also be reduced by collaboration with prescribing providers to ensure that orders are written generically, and avoid unnecessary nursing visits. Knowledgeable WOC nurses can play a critical role in coordinating care that is both clinically and fiscally effective. This article reviews common challenges in caring for complex wounds in the home care setting with a focus on strategies the prescribing provider and wound care clinician can use to optimize outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Oral health has become a topic of increasing concern for speech-language pathologists given recent evidence implicating oral colonization with pathogenic bacteria as a precursor condition contributing to aspiration pneumonia risk. In this study, we conducted an observational study of oral colonization over the 3-month interval between successive dental hygiene appointments for 10 residents of complex continuing care facilities. Oral swabs were taken at 5 time-points per participant and sent to a lab for microbiological analysis, with semi-quantification of bacterial species. The analyses failed to show the predicted pattern of incrementally greater counts of pathogenic bacteria as time post dental hygiene service increased. Additionally, measures of oral dryness using a Modified Schirmer Test failed to show any particular relationship to swab results. We discuss our own learnings regarding the complexity of oral colonization arising from this pilot study.</ab>
        <ab>Avec le temps, la santé buccale est devenue un sujet de préoccupation pour les orthophonistes étant donné les preuves récentes mettant en cause la colonisation buccale par des bactéries pathogéniques comme état précurseur contribuant au risque de pneumonie par aspiration. Dans la présente recherche, nous avons mené une étude observationnelle de la colonisation buccale sur l’intervalle de trois mois séparant des rendez-vous successifs d’hygiène buccale pour dix résidents d’institutions de soins continus complexes. Des échantillons de salive ont été prélevés à cinq moments différents pour chaque participant et envoyés à un laboratoire pour analyse microbiologique, avec semi-quantification des espèces bactériennes. Les analyses n’ont pas montré la progression attendue de bactéries pathogènes en fonction du temps écoulé après le service d’hygiène dentaire. De plus, des mesures de sécheresse buccale à l’aide d’un test Schirmer modifié n’ont pas montré de relation particulière avec les résultats des échantillons de salive. Nous discutons ce que nous avons appris concernant la complexité de la colonisation buccale découlant de cette étude pilote.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To compare the efficacy of chronic heart failure management programmes ( CHF- MPs) according to a scoring algorithm used to quantify the level of applied interventions-the Heart Failure Intervention Score ( HF- IS). Background The overall efficacy of heart failure programmes has been proven in several meta-analyses. However, the debate continues as to which components are essential in a heart failure programme to improve patient outcomes. Design Prospective cohort study of patients participating in heart failure programmes. Method Forty-eight of 62 (77%) programmes in Australia participating in a national register of CHF- MPs were evaluated using the HF- IS: derived from a summed and weighted score of each intervention applied by the CHF- MP (27 interventions overall). The CHF- MPs were prospectively categorised as relatively low ( HF- IS &lt; 190 - n = 39 programmes &amp; 407 patients) or high ( HF- IS ≥ 190 - n = 9 programmes &amp; 166 patients) in complexity. Six-month morbidity and mortality rates in 573 consecutively recruited patients with systolic dysfunction and in New York Heart Association Class II- IV were prospectively examined. Results Patients exposed to CHF- MPs with a high HF- IS had a lower rate of unplanned, all-cause hospitalisation ( n = 24, 14% vs. n = 102, 25%) compared with CHF- MPs with a low HF- IS within six months. On an adjusted basis, CHF- MPs with a high HF- IS were associated with a reduced risk of unplanned hospitalisation and/or death within six months and remained event-free longer. Conclusion High complexity CHF- MPs applying more evidence-based interventions are associated with a higher event-free survival over six months. Relevance to clinical practice The HF- IS is an easy-to-use evidence-based tool to assist programme coordinators to improve the quality of their heart failure programme which may also improve patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) combined with instillation for patients either presenting with a complex wound or after failure of classic NPWT. Method: A retrospective case series study conducted on patients treated using an NPWT instillation system (V.A.C. Instill; KCI Inc.) from January to December 2012. The instillation machine was used with pure saline so as not to interfere with local antibacterial solutions. Two clinical indications-patients presenting either large undermining, deep inaccessible wounds or infected wounds and those for whom conventional NPWT had proved ineffective, were analysed-with efficacy of the promotion of granulation tissue as the primary outcome. Length of instillation time, the rhythm and the amount of liquid to be injected compared with the estimated volume of the cavity were also evaluated. Results: Twenty-four patients were included in this series-12 post-NPWT failures and 12 complex wounds-with positive outcomes in 23 cases. Surgical closure was realised after promotion of granulation tissue, using either flaps or skin grafts alone, or combined with previous application of a dermal substitute. No complications linked to instillation were observed during the period of use. Conclusion: The results of this case series suggests that use of NPWT combined with pure saline instillation could have a positive impact on the healing trajectory of patients with complex wounds or after failure of classic NPWT. Declaration of interest: There were no external sources of funding for this study. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</ab>

        <ab>Older patients are particularly vulnerable to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) because age is associated with changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that may alter drug metabolism. In addition, other conditions, commonly observed in older adults, may increase the risk of ADRs in the older population (including polypharmacy, comorbidity, cognitive and functional limitations). ADRs in older adults are frequently preventable, suggesting that screening and prevention programmes aimed at reducing the rate of iatrogenic illness are necessary in this population. The present study reviews available approaches that may be used to screen and prevent the occurrence of ADRs in older adults, including medication review, avoiding the use of potentially inappropriate medications, computer-based prescribing systems and comprehensive geriatric assessment. Available evidence on these approaches is mixed and controversial, and none of them showed a clear beneficial effect on patients' health outcomes. Limitation of these interventions is the lack of standardisation, and these differences may give reason for the variability of the results documented in randomised clinical studies. Interestingly, most of the available research is focused on a single intervention targeting either clinical or pharmacological factors causing ADRs. When these approaches are combined, positive effects on patients health outcomes can be shown, suggesting that integration of skills from different health care professionals is needed to address medical complexity of the older adults. The challenge for future research is to integrate valuable information obtained by existing instruments and methodologies in a complete and global approach targeting all potential factors involved in the onset of ADRs.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The purpose of this evidence-based management practice project was to analyse dimensions of the Getting my Work Done issue, the only one of seven issues of highest concern for which 907 nurse interviewees were unable to identify effective strategies, formulate a 'best management practice', integrate the practice into clinical settings and evaluate results. Method/process The evidence-based management practice process was used to identify the major impediment to Getting Work Done-assignment to multiple patients with simultaneous complex needs. Best management practice consisted of class presentation of a clinical-management problem scenario to 144 residents in nine Magnet hospitals, a private action commitment, class discussion and terminal action commitments. Results Responses indicated that this 'best management practice' was effective in helping newly licensed registered nurses manage and handle multiple patients with simultaneous complex needs. A major avenue of resolution was perception of professional practice responsibilities as a series of complex, interrelated, adaptive systems. Conclusions/implications for nursing management Perception and use of the principles of complexity science assists newly licensed registered nurses in mastering management dilemmas that inhibit professional practice. In many participating hospitals, plans are underway to expand this best practice to include input and perception exchange among experienced nurses, managers and physicians.</ab>

        <ab>PROBLEM ADDRESSED: The growing number of elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions presents an urgent challenge in primary care. Current practice models are not well suited to addressing the complex health care needs of this patient population. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: The primary objective of the IMPACT (Interprofessional Model of Practice for Aging and Complex Treatments) clinic was to design and evaluate a new interprofessional model of care for community-dwelling seniors with complex health care needs. A secondary objective was to explore the potential of this new model as an interprofessional training opportunity. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The IMPACT clinic is an innovative new model of interprofessional primary care for elderly patients with complex health care needs. The comprehensive team comprises family physicians, a community nurse, a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a dietitian, and a community social worker. The model is designed to accommodate trainees from each discipline. Patient appointments are 1.5 to 2 hours in length, during which time a diverse range of medical, functional, and psychosocial issues are investigated by the full interprofessional team. CONCLUSION: The IMPACT model is congruent with ongoing policy initiatives in primary care reform and enhanced community-based care for seniors. The clinic has been pilot-tested in 1 family practice unit and modeled at 3 other sites with positive feedback from patients and families, clinicians, and trainees. Evaluation data indicate that interprofessional primary care models hold great promise for the growing challenge of managing complex chronic disease.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin associated with genetic polymorphisms in VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP4F2 in Indonesian patients treated with low-dose warfarin. Methods: Genotyping of VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP4F2 was carried out in 103 patients treated with a daily dose of 1-2 mg warfarin, 89 of whom were treated with a fixed daily dose of warfarin (1 mg). The plasma concentrations of S- and R-warfarin and S- and R-7-hydroxywarfarin were used as pharmacokinetic indices, while prothrombin time expressed as the international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was used as a pharmacodynamic index. Results: In patients treated with a fixed daily dose of warfarin (1 mg), a higher PT-INR was associated with VKORC1-1639 AA [median 1.35; interquartile range (IQR) 1.21-1.50] than with the GA (1.18; IQR 1.12-1.32; p &lt; 0.01) and GG (1.02; IQR = 1.02-1.06; p &lt; 0.01) polymorphisms, and with CYP2C9*1/*3 (1.63; IQR 1.45-1.85) compared to *1/*1 (1.23; IQR 1.13-1.43; p &lt; 0.05). The S-warfarin concentration was significantly higher in patients with CYP2C9*1/*3 than in those with *1/*1 ( p &lt; 0.05). With low-dose warfarin administration, there was no significant difference in the concentrations of warfarin metabolites among any of the genotype variants. The genotype variations of CYP2C19 and CYP4F2 were not significantly associated with the PT-INR. Conclusion: For low-dose warfarin treatment, the VKORC1-1639 G &gt; A and CYP2C9 genotype variations affected the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin, while we could not find significant effects of CYP4F2 or CYP2C19 genotype variations on warfarin (metabolite) concentrations or PT-INR.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: A hospital stay is often accompanied by changes in medication therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a transfer across the interfaces on the complexity of therapeutic regimens and patient adherence as well as the attitudes of patients and general practitioners (GPs) towards pharmacotherapies. Methods: This was a prospective observational study that analysed the complexity of medication therapies and the adherence and attitudes of internal medicine and urology patients towards their medication(s) at three time points (hospital admission, discharge and 6 weeks after discharge). GPs of the patients recruited to the study were questioned about the follow-up medication therapy and their opinion on the medication prescribed in hospital. Results: At the time of hospital admission, 60.2 % of the study population were nonadherent. During hospitalization, the number decreased to 37.6 %, but increased to 61.2 % 6 weeks after discharge. Changes in the overall complexity of the therapy regimens were marginal and not statistically significant. Of the long-term medication regimens, 48.6 % were modified during hospital stay. The patients preferred regimens with a minimum of drug administrations. GPs stated to be willing to continue hospital prescriptions but were restricted by financial budgets. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that an increase in adherence during a hospital stay is only transient, underlining the need for interventions to ameliorate medication adherence. They also suggest that patients prefer simple regimens. Although GPs are willing to consider their patient's preferences on pharmacotherapy, they state limitations due to financial budgets. Further studies are needed that investigate the extent to which medication therapies can be simplified and the effect of simplification on adherence.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of the present article was to explore how old athletes relate to their bodies and health in the process of growing old. The findings suggest that the old male athletes controlled their bodies in order to gain physical capital, but that different ways of employing the body were valued in the contexts of aging, athletics and masculinity. On the whole the men displayed a contradictious way of relating to their bodies and health. However, they could to some extent reconcile the tensions between the different norms of body and health by emphasizing the need to preserve physical autonomy, an ideal that appeared to be valid in all three contexts.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Physical activity is essential for older peoples' physical and mental health and for maintaining independence. Guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes weekly, of at least moderate intensity physical activity, with activity on most days. Older people's most common physical activity is walking, light intensity if strolling, moderate if brisker. Less than 20% of United Kingdom 65-74 year olds report achieving the guidelines, despite most being able to. Effective behaviour change techniques include strategies such as goal setting, self-monitoring, building self-efficacy and relapse prevention. Primary care physical activity consultations allow individual tailoring of advice. Pedometers measure step-counts and accelerometers measure physical activity intensity. This protocol describes an innovative intervention to increase walking in older people, incorporating pedometer and accelerometer feedback within a primary care nurse physical activity consultation, using behaviour change techniques.Methods/design: Design: Randomised controlled trial with intervention and control (usual care) arms plus process and qualitative evaluations.Participants: 300 people aged 60-74 years registered with 3 general practices within Oxfordshire and Berkshire West primary care trusts, able to walk outside and with no restrictions to increasing their physical activity.Intervention: 3 month pedometer and accelerometer based intervention supported by practice nurse physical activity consultations. Four consultations based on behaviour change techniques, physical activity diary, pedometer average daily steps and accelerometer feedback on physical activity intensity. Individual physical activity plans based on increasing walking and other existing physical activity will be produced.Outcomes: Change in average daily steps (primary outcome) and average time spent in at least moderate intensity physical activity weekly (secondary outcome) at 3 months and 12 months, assessed by accelerometry. Other outcomes include quality of life, mood, exercise self-efficacy, injuries. Qualitative evaluations will explore reasons for trial non-participation, the intervention's acceptability to patients and nurses and factors enhancing or acting as barriers for older people in increasing their physical activity levels.Discussion: The PACE-Lift trial will determine the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention for increasing physical activity among older primary care patients. Steps taken to minimise bias and the challenges anticipated will be discussed. Word count 341.Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN42122561.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To examine to what extent general practitioners in consultations after a geriatric assessment set shared health priorities with older patients experiencing multimorbidity and to what extent this was facilitated through patient-centered behavior. METHODS: Observation of consultations embedded in a cluster randomized controlled trial,(1) in which 317 patients from 41 general practices received the STEP assessment followed by a care planning consultation with their GPs. GPs in the intervention group used a structured procedure for setting health (care) priorities in contrast to control GPs. A sample of 43 consultations (24 intervention; 19 control) were recorded, transcribed and analyzed with regard to priority setting and patient-centeredness. RESULTS: Patient-centeredness was only moderately apparent in consultations dealing with complex care plans for older patients with multimorbidity. The shared determination of health priorities seemed unusual for both doctors and patients and was rarely practiced, albeit more frequently in intervention consultations. CONCLUSION: Setting health care priorities with patients experiencing multimorbidity is ethically desirable and medically appropriate. Yet a short structured guide for doctors cannot easily achieve this. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More research is needed in regard to handling complex health needs of older patients. It requires a professional approach and training in patient-centered holistic care planning.</ab>

        <ab>What is known and Objective: Older hospital inpatients are often prescribed complex multi-drug regimens; increased regimen complexity is associated with poorer medication adherence and treatment outcomes. There has been little research into methods for reducing regimen complexity. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of incorporating medication regimen simplification into routine clinical pharmacist care for older hospital inpatients and identify barriers to regimen simplification at a major teaching hospital. Methods: Following an educational intervention, clinical pharmacists were encouraged to minimize regimen complexity for their patients by identifying potential simplifications during routine medication regimen reviews (e.g. medication chart reviews, discharge prescription reviews) and discussing these changes with hospital doctors and patients. Pharmacists completed a data collection form for patients aged 60 years or above discharged from their wards during the study period ( n = 205; mean age, 81·3 years), indicating whether they had reviewed the patient's medication regimen complexity (and if not why), whether any changes to simplify the regimen were identified, and whether changes were successfully implemented (and if not why). Results and Discussion: Pharmacists reviewed medication regimen complexity for 173/205 (84·4%) patients and identified 149 potential changes to reduce regimen complexity for 79/173 (45·7%) reviewed patients. Ninety-four (63·1%) changes were successfully implemented in 54/205 (26·3%) patients. Regimens were simplified more often for patients discharged from subacute aged care (geriatric assessment and rehabilitation) wards compared with acute general medicine wards. The most commonly cited reason for not reviewing regimen complexity and not implementing identified simplification-related changes was 'lack of time'. Non-acceptance of pharmacist recommendations by patients or doctors were other common reasons for not implementing changes. What is new and Conclusion: This is the first study to explore pharmacist-led medication regimen simplification and barriers to regimen simplification in the hospital setting. It demonstrates that simplification of older inpatients' regimens is feasible when training in regimen simplification is provided. The main barrier to regimen simplification appears to be lack of pharmacist time.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of the study was to use audit data and case-derived material to explore and illustrate the work of a mainstream, NHS tertiary care psychosexual service. A total of 100 consecutive cases from two psychosexual therapists' caseloads over a 12-month period were examined for evidence of the prevalence of mental disorder and the nature of referred problems. Case illustrations were generated to illuminate the variety of problems this clientele actually present. It was found that only 11% of clients had a severe mental illness, while another 27% had mental disorders (depression, anxiety) commonly treated in primary care settings. Most (62%) had no mental disorders other than their referred or assessed psychosexual problems. Many clients presented with significant social, material and medical problems not reported at referral. It is concluded that most clients might be seen more appropriately in primary care or other non-psychiatric settings. Referring agents might undertake more careful scrutiny of clients' broader biopsychosocial needs before referring them to psychosexual services. Psychosexual services may be confronted with over-facing issues of medical and psychosocial need and risk unless future commissioning processes demarcate their remit accurately.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Pain continues to be a common problem for older hospitalised patients, but little is known about how the complexities of actual clinical practice affect pain assessment and management in these patients. Objective: To examine how pain was assessed and managed in older patients who were admitted to geriatric evaluation and management units. Design, setting and participants: A naturalistic observational research design was used involving observations of interactions between nurses and patients, and follow-up interviews with nurses. Three observation periods were conducted between midnight and midday, which commenced at 03:30, 07:30, and 10:30, and three observation periods were conducted between midday and midnight, which commenced at 15:30, 18:30, and 22:30. Between 12 and 13 observations were conducted for each observation period, each ranging from 2 to 3h. The study was undertaken in two units, each located in an Australian public teaching hospital. Participants included registered nurses employed in the units, and patients in their care. Results: Four major themes were identified: communication among nurses and between older patients and nurses; strategies for pain management; environmental and organisational aspects of care; and complexities in the nature of pain. Nurses tended to use simple questioning with patients about the pain experienced. Despite the availability of ‘as required’ opioid medication for breakthrough or incident pain, nurses often preferred to wait to determine if pain was relieved following administration of fixed-dose paracetamol. Time of day impacted on how pain was managed due to availability of nursing staff. It was unit policy for doctors to reduce medications prescribed, which often extended to analgesics, and nurses were left to deal with patient tensions in addressing analgesic needs. Complexities were associated with the nature of pain experienced, in terms of perceived level of tolerable pain, the simultaneous presence of chronic and acute pain, location of pain, and differentiation of pain from discomfort. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the intricacies associated with how analgesic needs are addressed in older patients, especially those with communication deficits, the complex nature of older patients’ painful experiences, and the precarious balance of attempting to treat pain effectively while avoiding adverse effects of analgesics.</ab>

        <ab>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is difficult to diagnose and is characterised by burning pain in one or more limbs. Treatment is palliative not curative and focuses on improving function. This requires patients to make long-term changes to their behaviour. As with all such regimens, adherence is often poor. This study explored the lived experience of 10 patients who had returned home after completing a two-week in-patient treatment programme. The interviews focused on how they coped with the transition from hospital to home, and on the things that they considered had facilitated or hindered this transition. Battling for Control was an overarching theme that connected the four superordinate themes: ‘Gaining Momentum’ that facilitated the implementation of treatment advice, ‘Distance from the pool of expertise’ that detailed the barriers to adherence experienced; ‘It helped me realise it was not all in my head’ that detailed a facilitative process, and the ‘nag list’ that was a technique patients’ used to garner support. This article offers insights into the transition experience. A key outcome is the recognition of the need to better prepare patients for their transition back home.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To determine the quality of life of complex patients who were part of a case management program in Primary Health Care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on complex patients who had no cognitive impairment selected by consecutive sampling, who were seen, during the last six months of the year 2010, in two Basic Health Areas on the Coast of Barcelona (Spain). The EuroQol test was administered as an individualised questionnaire. The values were assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) and EuroQol index, from the five key dimensions of the instrument. RESULTS: Fifty patients with a mean age of 71.46 years, and 66% of whom were female, were included in the study. Within the key dimensions, pain was the most important problem in 80% of cases, followed by mobility problems, activities of daily life and anxiety/depression problems in 62.5%, and finally, personal care problems in 47.5% of cases. The global values of EQ-VAS and EuroQol index were 51.89 (SD 21.19) and 0.53 (SD 0.26), respectively. The worst quality of life was detected in EQ-VAS and EuroQol Index for women, in situations of loneliness, co-morbidity, and with higher frequency of visits to hospital. In the EQ-VAS, there was a tendency to score higher when older, and significantly less in case of the men living alone (EQ-EVA 36.67±15.27) CONCLUSIONS: Complex patients in our context have a worst quality of life than the general population in Catalonia older than 70 years old. EuroQol is useful to perform comparisons between population groups.</ab>

        <ab>We evaluated an electronic reminder device for detecting non-adherence in elderly patients with complex medication regimens. Randomly selected, home-living elderly patients were studied. The patients were aged over 65 years and were taking more than four drugs. Patients received an electronic reminder device which contained a GSM communications module. They were visited three times over a one-year period by a nurse who counted their medicine supply. We compared the adherence measured by the electronic device with the actual adherence measured by the pill count. Almost half of the 315 patients dropped out of the study for various reasons, so the calculations were performed on 168 patients. The adherence measured by the electronic reminder system was 79% and was 92% measured by pill count (P&lt;0.0001). The limits of agreement estimated by a Bland-Altman analysis were -57 to +30. We also compared electronically measured adherence at morning/evening intake times with pill count adherence in the morning/evening only. For the pill count, there was almost no difference between morning and evening adherence rates (93%). For electronic measurement, adherence rates were lower in the evening (75%) than in the morning (81%). Electronic reminders were less reliable than the pill count in measuring adherence. However, the electronic system may be a useful supplement to other, more time consuming methods for measuring adherence.</ab>

        <ab>This is discussion about the relationship between elderly human beings with ostomy and their environments care, under the perspective of Complexity Edgar Morin. An axis holds the reflection: environments of care for elderly humans with ostomy. In this sense, we present three types of environment that surround the context of elderly humans with ostomy: home environment, group environment and hospital environment. This brings, as a social contribution, a new look about resizing caring of elderly humans with ostomy in their environment. It is considered that the environment hosting this human being contains a diversity of feelings, emotions, experiences; it binds multiple meanings, from the Complexity perspective, about the relationship between the environment and the caring process.</ab>

        <ab>Care transitions, defined as hospital discharge or movement from one health care setting to another, are currently a major concern of health care providers and policy makers. Extensive empirical research has been conducted on care transitions, but the theoretical foundations are rarely made explicit. We propose that integrating concepts on complex adaptive systems from complexity science with classic theory on transitions in nursing provides a powerful new lens through which to study care transitions and improve transition outcomes. We summarize concepts from both theoretical approaches, propose an expanded model of transitions, and apply the model to the transition from hospital to home.</ab>

        <ab>Background: worldwide, the frequency of tuberculosis among older people almost triples that observed among young adults.Objective: to describe clinical and epidemiological consequences of pulmonary tuberculosis among older people.Methods: we screened persons with a cough lasting more than 2 weeks in Southern Mexico from March 1995 to February 2007. We collected clinical and mycobacteriological information (isolation, identification, drug-susceptibility testing and IS6110-based genotyping and spoligotyping) from individuals with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients were treated in accordance with official norms and followed to ascertain treatment outcomes, retreatment, and vital status.Results: eight hundred ninety-three tuberculosis patients were older than 15 years of age; of these, 147 (16.5%) were 65 years of age or older. Individuals ≥65 years had significantly higher rates of recently transmitted and reactivated tuberculosis. Older age was associated with treatment failure (OR = 5.37; 95% CI: 1.06–27.23; P = 0.042), and death due to tuberculosis (HR = 3.52; 95% CI: 1.78–6.96; P &lt; 0.001) adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables.Conclusions: community-dwelling older individuals participate in chains of transmission indicating that tuberculosis is not solely due to the reactivation of latent disease. Untimely and difficult diagnosis and a higher risk of poor outcomes even after treatment completion emphasise the need for specific strategies for this vulnerable group.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The benefits of postoperative mobilization include decreased incidence of pulmonary complications, pressure ulcers, and progression of deep vein thrombosis. However, the complexity of certain spinal reconstructions and the patient's physiologic condition may preclude the possibility of early mobilization. Prolonged bed rest after spine surgery is controversial. Questions/purposes: We evaluated the efficacy of prolonged bed rest after complex spine surgery to determine (1) patient characteristics that led to prescribing bed rest, (2) clinical and radiographic outcomes, (3) complications, and (4) estimated direct costs. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all 11 patients (median age, 50 years) who underwent complex spine surgery followed by prolonged bed rest between 2005 and 2010. All patients were deemed at high risk for developing pseudarthrosis or instrumentation failure without postoperative bed rest. One patient died of complications related to pulmonary tuberculosis at 4 months. The patients averaged 3 months of bed rest. Minimum followup was 24 months (median, 30 months; range, 4-52 months). Results: All patients had (1) tenuous or limited fixation after correction of severe deformity, (2) previously failed spine reconstruction after early mobilization, or (3) limited treatment options if failure occurred again. No patient experienced pseudarthrosis, failure of instrumentation, thromboembolic disease, pressure ulcers, or pneumonia. One patient had a delayed union and one developed late urosepsis. The median cost of skilled nursing facilities during the period of bed rest was $16,702, while the median cost of home health nursing was $5712. Conclusions: For patients with contraindications to early postoperative mobilization, prolonged bed rest may be useful to minimize the risk of complications that can occur with mobilization. Level Of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic study. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.</ab>

        <ab>We aimed to present the educational booklet as a geronto-technological product for caring for ostomized seniors from a complexity perspective. This was accomplished in the second semester of 2007 in a hospital in the south of Brazil. The data were collected through interviews and presented in the form of an educational booklet. The booklet was validated by ostomized seniors and by a nurse who had been working with these elderly patients. The booklet was presented as a geronto-technology able to help ostomized seniors and their families understand the rights of ostomized people; concepts and types of stomas; care of ostomy; and the importance of the family and the support group for care. In conclusion, the educational booklet is presented as a health promotion tool which makes the health educative process easier.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, the authors aim to highlight some of the complex issues surrounding wound healing. They will attempt to highlight how current dressing options can contribute to a considered approach to managing wounds, with particular reference to the 'at-risk' patient. In order to achieve this, the authors have included a case study, which demonstrates the practical application of dressings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study was intended to investigate the clinical significance and molecular epidemiology of Acinetobacter baumannii complex (ABC) isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU) patients, particularly comparing isolates from healthcare workers' (HCW) hands. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 30 patients with CSF cultures positive for ABC seen at our NSICU from the date it first opened, January 2007, to September 2010. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing was performed on 68 strains isolated from 32 patients' CSF and 36 HCWs' hands. Results: ABC isolates were considered to be clinically significant in 21 (70.0%) patients but insignificant in the other nine (30.0%) patients. The prolonged (&gt;7 days) use of cephalosporins was more common in patients with clinically significant ABC isolates ( p = 0.049). Multiple drug resistance (MDR) was observed in 12 (57.1%) clinically significant isolates. Empirical antimicrobial therapies were not appropriate for nine of these 21 patients (42.8%). Mortality was significantly higher in the clinically significant group than in the clinically insignificant group (18/21 vs. 3/9; p = 0.008). Fifty-three isolates (77.9%) were grouped into 15 clusters, three of which contained possibly related isolates from patients' CSF and staff members' hands. Conclusions: The fact that ABC isolates grown from CSF cultures do not always exhibit infection and have high multiple antibiotic resistance, including to carbapenems, should be borne in mind when planning treatment for these patients. In addition, HCWs' hands may play a significant role in transmission to patients, and compliance with infection control procedures, especially hand washing, must be enhanced in order to avoid ABC infections.</ab>

        <ab>The article describes the Tai Chi exercise and activities conducted at a senior residential complex in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Sun-style 12-form Tai Chi is presented which was developed by Doctor Paul Lam and endorsed by the Arthrities Foundation. The conduct of discussions on medical topics are described such as Parkinson's disease and movement disorders. A discussion on Chinese culture is explained which gave elders a virtual tour to exotic places they might never have a chance to visit.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports the clinical experience of a 71-year-old female with resection of the colon, who subsequently developed postoperative complications. A colostomy was carried out; necrosis of the colostomy edges and stoma retraction complicated optimal stoma appliance placement. It was possible to treat the resulting cavity with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) by isolating the stoma and treating the peristomal wound area. The wound was treated with NPWT for 30 days; at day 20, the patient was discharged to home to continue with NPWT for a further 10 days by community nurses, with regular follow-up visits in the outpatient clinic. The patient improved steadily and achieved complete closure of the wound.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The 2008 Sichuan Earthquake caused great damage to the environment and property. In the aftermath, many citizens were relocated to live in newly constructed prefabricated (prefab) communities. Purpose: This paper explored the current quality of life (QOL) of elderly residents living in prefabricated communities in areas damaged by the Sichuan earthquake and identified factors of influence on QOL values. The ultimate objective was to provide evidence-based guidance for heath improvement measures. Methods: The authors used the short form WHOQOL-BREF to assess the quality of life of 191 elderly residents of prefabricated communities in the Sichuan Province 2008 earthquake zone. A Student's t-test, variance analysis, and stepwise multivariate regression methods were used to test the impact of various factors on QOL . Results: Results indicate the self-assessed QOL of participants as good, although scores in the physical (average 56.2) and psychological (average 45.7) domains were significantly lower than the norm in China. Marital status, capital loss in the earthquake, number of children, level of perceived stress, income, interest, and family harmony each correlated with at least one of the short form WHOQOL-BREF domains in t-test and one-way analyses. After excluding for factor interaction effects using multivariate regression, we found interest, family harmony, monthly income and stress to be significant predictors of physical domain QOL, explaining 13.8% of total variance. Family harmony and interest explained 15.3% of total variance for psychological domain QOL; stress, marital status, family harmony, capital loss in the earthquake, number of children and interest explained 19.5% of total variance for social domain QOL; and stress, family harmony and interest explained 16.5% of total variance for environmental domain QOL. Family harmony and interest were significant factors across all domains, while others influenced a smaller proportion. Conclusions: Quality of life for elderly living in prefab communities should be improved. The authors hope study findings will increase awareness among healthcare providers regarding the quality of life of this vulnerable population. Study results suggest that key steps to promoting QOL in this population include improving family harmony, helping to cultivate well-rounded interests, alleviating economic stresses, providing necessary medical and psychological counseling services, and affording more social support.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Medication nonadherence, inconsistent patient self-monitoring, and inadequate treatment adjustment exacerbate poor disease control. In a collaborative, team-based, care management program for complex patients (TEAMcare), we assessed patient and physician behaviors (medication adherence, self-monitoring, and treatment adjustment) in achieving better outcomes for diabetes, coronary heart disease, and depression.Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted (2007-2009) in 14 primary care clinics among 214 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (glycated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)] ≥8.5%) or coronary heart disease (blood pressure &gt;140/90 mm Hg or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dL) with coexisting depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥10). In the TEAMcare program, a nurse care manager collaborated closely with primary care physicians, patients, and consultants to deliver a treat-to-target approach across multiple conditions. Measures included medication initiation, adjustment, adherence, and disease self-monitoring.Results: Pharmacotherapy initiation and adjustment rates were sixfold higher for antidepressants (relative rate [RR] = 6.20; P &lt;.001), threefold higher for insulin (RR = 2.97; P &lt;.001), and nearly twofold higher for antihypertensive medications (RR = 1.86, P &lt;.001) among TEAMcare relative to usual care patients. Medication adherence did not differ between the 2 groups in any of the 5 therapeutic classes examined at 12 months. TEAMcare patients monitored blood pressure (RR = 3.20; P &lt;.001) and glucose more frequently (RR = 1.28; P = .006).Conclusions: Frequent and timely treatment adjustment by primary care physicians, along with increased patient self-monitoring, improved control of diabetes, depression, and heart disease, with no change in medication adherence rates. High baseline adherence rates may have exerted a ceiling effect on potential improvements in medication adherence.</ab>

        <ab>Background: With increasing age and longevity, the rising number of frail elders with complex and numerous health-related needs demands a coordinated health care delivery system integrating cure, care and welfare. Studies on the effectiveness of such comprehensive chronic care models targeting frail elders show inconclusive results. The CareWell-primary care program is a complex intervention targeting community-dwelling frail elderly people, that aims to prevent functional decline, improve quality of life, and reduce or postpone hospital and nursing home admissions of community dwelling frail elderly. Methods/design: The CareWell-primary care study includes a (cost-) effectiveness study and a comprehensive process evaluation. In a one-year pragmatic, cluster controlled trial, six general practices are non-randomly recruited to adopt the CareWell-primary care program and six control practices will deliver 'care as usual'. Each practice includes a random sample of fifty frail elders aged 70 years or above in the cost-effectiveness study. A sample of patients and informal caregivers and all health care professionals participating in the CareWell-primary care program are included in the process evaluation. In the cost-effectiveness study, the primary outcome is the level of functional abilities as measured with the Katz-15 index. Hierarchical mixed-effects regression models / multilevel modeling approach will be used, since the study participants are nested within the general practices. Furthermore, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated as costs per QALY gained and as costs weighed against functional abilities. In the process evaluation, mixed methods will be used to provide insight in the implementation degree of the program, patients' and professionals' approval of the program, and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. Discussion: The CareWell-primary care study will provide new insights into the (cost-) effectiveness, feasibility, and barriers and facilitators for implementation of this complex intervention in primary care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is common in coronary heart disease (CHD) and increases the incidence of coronary symptoms and death in CHD patients. Interventions feasible for use in primary care are needed to improve both mood and cardiac outcomes. The UPBEAT-UK programme of research has been funded by the NHS National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to explore the relationship between CHD and depression and to develop a new intervention for use in primary care. Methods: Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative research to develop a primary care-based nurseled intervention to improve mood and cardiac outcomes in patients with CHD and depression. Iterative literature review was used to synthesise our empirical work and to identify evidence and theory to inform the intervention. Results: We developed a primary care-based nurse-led personalised care intervention which utilises elements of case management to promote self management. Following biopsychosocial assessment, a personalised care plan is devised. Nurses trained in behaviour change techniques facilitate patients to address the problems important to them. Identification and utilisation of existing resources is promoted. Nurse time is conserved through telephone follow up. Conclusions: Application of the MRC framework for complex interventions has allowed us to develop an evidence based intervention informed by patient and clinician preferences and established theory. The feasibility and acceptability of this intervention is now being tested further in an exploratory trial</ab>

        <ab>Background: Prior studies measuring fidelity of complex interventions have mainly evaluated adherence, and not taken factors affecting adherence into consideration. A need for studies that clarify the concept of fidelity and the function of factors moderating fidelity has been emphasized. The aim of the study was to systematically evaluate implementation fidelity and possible factors influencing fidelity of a complex care continuum intervention for frail elderly people.Methods: The intervention was a systematization of the collaboration between a nurse with geriatric expertise situated at the emergency department, the hospital ward staff, and a multi-professional team with a case manager in the municipal care services for older people. Implementation was evaluated between September 2008 and May 2010 with observations of work practices, stakeholder interviews, and document analysis according to a modified version of The Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity.Results: A total of 16 of the 18 intervention components were to a great extent delivered as planned, while some new components were added to the model. No changes in the frequency or duration of the 18 components were observed, but the dose of the added components varied over time. Changes in fidelity were caused in a complex, interrelated fashion by all the moderating factors in the framework, i.e., context, staff and participant responsiveness, facilitation, recruitment, and complexity.Discussion: The Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity was empirically useful and included comprehensive measures of factors affecting fidelity. Future studies should focus on developing the framework with regard to how to investigate relationships between the moderating factors and fidelity over time.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01260493.</ab>

        <ab>Summary: Following a service evaluation methodology, this paper reports on registered nurses'' (RNs) and healthcare assistants'' (HCAs) perceptions about education and training requirements in order to work with people with complex neurological disabilities. A service evaluation was undertaken to meet the study aim using a non-probability, convenience method of sampling 368 nurses (n =110 RNs, n =258 HCAs) employed between October and November 2008 at one specialist hospital in south-west London in the UK. The main results show that respondents were clear about the need to develop an education and training programme for RNs and HCAs working in this speciality area (91% of RNs and 94% of HCAs). A variety of topics were identified to be included within a work-based education and training programme, such as positively managing challenging behaviour, moving and handling, working with families. Adults with complex neurological needs have diverse needs and thus nurses working with this patient group require diverse education and training in order to deliver quality patient-focused nursing care.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this descriptive study was to evaluate the level of patient`s care complexity in a hospital unit belonging to a school hospital located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Data collection was carried out using the 'Patient Classification System: a proposal to complement the instrument', by Fugulin et al., during thirty consecutive days. The use of this instrument resulted in 1.080 observations obtained from 156 patients' records. The majority of the patients required high level of care dependency; there were differences among the patient`s wards regarding gender and age, type of treatment and patients' level of care complexity. We concluded that there was a need to evaluate the health care providers in the institution, as well as to make adjustments regarding demands for technological and materials resources.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To evaluate the effect of functional health literacy (FHL) on preferences for decision-making; and among those initially preferring a passive decision-making role, to explore how preferences change if their physician actively encourages their involvement.Methods: Consecutive older adults with cardiovascular disease receiving complex antithrombotic therapy completed a comprehensive assessment including measures of FHL and preferences for shared decision making.Results: Half of all participants had inadequate or marginal FHL. Those with inadequate FHL were more likely (P=0.01) to prefer passive rather than active decision making styles even after controlling for age, education, and numeracy. However, 40% of patients preferring passive styles had adequate FHL and these patients were significantly more likely to change their preference to more active styles (odds ratio=7.17, P&lt;.01) if their physician "was more supportive or encouraged participation".Conclusions: Screening FHL can provide insight into patients' preferences for active participation in decision making. Clinicians' encouragement of participation can increase engagement by patients with adequate FHL.Practice Implications: We propose an algorithm for screening FHL and preferences for participating in decisions about complex medication regimens.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: to estimate the extent to which a case-management intervention for persons newly discharged into the community following an acute stroke effected a change in stroke outcome in comparison with usual care.Design: a re-analysis of stratified, balanced, randomised clinical trial.Setting: five university-affiliated acute-care hospitals in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.Participants: a total of 190 persons (mean age 70 years) returning home directly from the acute-care hospital following a first or recurrent stroke with a need for health-care supervision post-discharge because of low function, co-morbidity or isolation.Intervention: for 6 weeks following discharge a nurse case manager delivered, depending on need, over 50 different nursing interventions (range 2–15 per person), which targeted physical, emotional and psychological impairments, role participation restrictions and health perception.Measurements: seven of the SF-36 subscales were used to measure the targeted constructs, at the post-intervention and 6 month evaluations. Seven binary response variables were created with a change of 10 points the criterion for individual response. Generalised estimating equations, equivalent to a logistic regression for multiple outcomes, were used.Results: the odds of responding to one or more outcomes was 41% greater in the intervention group than in the control group [odds ratio (OR): 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11–1.79].Conclusion: an analysis considering the complexity of the intervention and outcomes targeted indicated effectiveness of the nurse case-management post-stroke, whereas the traditional one outcome analysis did not.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the lack of knowledge and skills among the general nurses to care for older people with cancer and calls for better education of nurses in non-specialist settings. Also highlighted are the Care Quality Commission's latest report on dignity and nutrition and comments cited by Chief executive and registrar of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), Dickon Weir-Hughes and UK Oncology Nursing Society (UKONS) president elect Natalie Doyle.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To identify the percentage of the population over 18 years with high complexity or high dependency using the case management model. METHOD: Observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study. Community level. Simple random sampling. Sample size calculation: 551 individuals were needed, with a rate of replacement for losing participation of 40%. Variables: High complexity &gt;/= 4 of following criteria: age, comorbidity, high drug consumption, terminal disease, hospital admissions, visits to Emergency Departments, falls, functional dependency, mental deterioration, to live alone or with family with capacity for limited support; High dependency (Barthel ? 30 and/or Pfeiffer ? 8; social-demographic variables; health services use; chronic diseases; specific treatments and caregiver data. Analysis: Descriptive for all variables and associated factors (95% CI). Correlation between variables was studied using the Kappa index. RESULTS: A total of 327 patients were studied, with a mean age of 49 years (SD = 18), of whom 179 (54.7%) were women. Six individuals had high complexity (1.8%, 95% CI: 0.38%-3.29%), 4 women (67%), 5 &gt; 75 years old (83%) and 1 &lt; 65 years old, mean age = 79.5 years (SD = 12.6). Five women presented high dependency (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.49-3.53), 4 &gt; 75 years old (80%) and 1 &lt; 65 years old, mean age = 82 years (SD = 14.8). Seven individuals in total presented high complexity and/or high dependency criteria (2.14%, 95% CI: 0.86-4.3), 5 women (71.4%); 6 &gt; 75 years old and 1 &lt; 65 years old, mean age = 81.3 years (SD = 12.4). Prevalence &gt; 65 years (8.3%) and &lt; 65 (0.6%) (P = .001). Correlation Kappa Index between high complexity and high dependency variables was 0.723. DISCUSSION: The percentage of patients who had high complexity or high dependency compared to the general population is significant, although lower than expected. In the planning of future programs for case management those persons who have high dependency and aged less than 65 years should also be taken into account along with those who have high complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To explore the experience of patients living with complex wounds and the impact of undergoing negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) as part of their treatment.Method: Qualitative data were collected from eight patients, using semi-structured interviews. A purposive, stratified sampling approach was used to identify participants with a range of wound types, as well as age and gender. Participants were recruited from one primary care trust and were interviewed, following 10 days of treatment with NPWT. The matrix-based 'Framework' approach, from the National Centre for Social Research, was used to structure the analysis.Results: Of the eight participants recruited, five were female and three male, with an age range of 46-77 years. Five overarching categories, with their constituent themes, were identified from the data. The first, developing a wound through crisis, has three themes: a failing body, missed diagnosis and failed professional intervention. The second category, decreased control, has four related themes: poor communication; failed wound healing; poor discharge planning and failure to recover. The third category, increased control, has four themes: understanding what is happening; symptom control; positive professional relationships and returning to health. The fourth category, using NPWT, has two themes: information and understanding of NPWT and expectations and experience of NPWT. The final category sets out participant recommendations about the device and has two themes: device issues and improving professional practice.Conclusion: This study investigated the experience of patients undergoing NPWT for complex wounds in the home setting and reveals a number of the psychosocial effects of using this therapy in this environment. Participants saw NPWT as an active intervention, associated with improved wound healing and symptom control. The participant experience described in this study, and the recommendations they make, provide a valuable resource to inform service improvement programmes and wound research.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on a study which aims to evaluate a single centre experience with the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for securing split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) in the management of specifically lower extremity chronic wounds. The study uses a seven-year retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all the patients who underwent primary STSGs with immediate postoperative NPWT. It concludes that NPWT is a good method of STSG affixation.</ab>

        <ab>The concept of quality of life in healthcare, a complex definition. The assessment of quality of life occupies a central place in the field of healthcare. Extensive research was carried out into the subject during the 20th century. Ojectifying a subjective and multi-dimensional concept remains a difficult task. Several societal, economic and epistemological factors must be taken into account.</ab>

        <ab>This study aims to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for pressure ulcers in a hospital complex in São Paulo. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive and exploratory study. The study was conducted in an adult clinical hospital, and conducted within 3 months. The incidence of pressure ulcers was of 31.25%. Considering the hospitalized patients with risk factors for developing pressure ulcer, 56 (32.79%) had psychomotor agitation, 30 (17.54%) had urinary/fecal incontinence and 25 (14.61%) were on mechanical ventilation and under sedation. 71 patients(67.61%) who acquired pressure ulcers had a high risk for developing pressure ulcers. The incidence of UP in the hospital complex was of 31.25%. The risk factors were psychomotor agitation, urinary incontinence, sedation and mechanical ventilation.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between cutaneous vasodilatory function and nonlinear complexity of blood flow oscillations (BFO) in older people. A non-painful fast local heating protocol was applied to the sacral skin in 20 older subjects with various vasodilatory functions. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure skin blood oscillations. The complexity of the characteristic frequencies (i.e., metabolic (0.0095-0.02 Hz), neurogenic (0.02-0.05 Hz), myogenic (0.05-0.15 Hz), respiratory (0.15-0.4 Hz), and cardiac (0.4-2 Hz)) of BFO was quantified using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. Compared with the 65-75 years group, the complexity of metabolic BFO in the 75-85 years group was significantly lower at the baseline (P &lt; 0.05) and the second peak (P &lt; 0.001). Compared with baseline BFO, subjects in the 65-75 years group had a significant increase in the complexity of metabolic BFO (P &lt; 0.01) in response to local heating; while subjects in the 75-85 years group did not. Our findings support the use of multifractal analysis to assess aging-related microvascular dysfunction.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: A statute enacted in 2005 modified the legislative framework of the rights of terminally ill persons in France. Ten years after the EURONIC study, which described the self-reported practices of neonatal caregivers towards ethical decision-making, a new study was conducted to assess the impact of the new law in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and compare the results reported by EURONIC with current practices. SETTING AND DESIGN: The study was carried out in the same two NICU as in the EURONIC qualitative study. A third centre was added to increase the sample size. From February to October 2007, 19 physicians and 17 nurses participated in semistructured interviews very similar to those for EURONIC. Content analysis identified the recurring themes emerging from the interviews. RESULTS: Compared with the EURONIC results, the caregivers reported that they pay greater attention to the views of parents and provided respectful support to the neonates when life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn. Active termination of life has become exceptional. The possibility of withdrawal of treatment, the administration of sedatives to control pain even at the risk of hastening death, the emphasis on sparing parents the burden of decision, and the relative ignorance of the law were very similar to the EURONIC findings. CONCLUSION: Both the medical and the legal regulation of practices has allowed more dialogue with the parents and more humane care for dying newborns. A new European study is necessary to investigate the possible changes in practices and attitudes also in other countries.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate two counseling programs in general practice to help smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to quit smoking. METHODS: Cluster randomized controlled trial including 68 general practices (667 patients) using a randomly assigned intervention program with counseling and advice about nicotine replacement therapy (and additional bupropion-SR in one of the programs) or usual care. Usual care consisted of periodic regular check-ups and COPD information. The main outcome measure was biochemically verified point prevalence at 12months. RESULTS: The two intervention groups were treated as one in the analysis because they were equally effective. The intervention resulted in a significantly self-reported higher success rate (14.5%) compared to usual care (7.4%); odds ratio=2.1, 95% confidence interval=1.1-4.1. Biochemically verified quit rates were 7.5% (intervention) and 3.4% (usual care); odds ratio=2.3, 95% confidence interval=0.9-6.0. CONCLUSION: The program doubled the cessation rates (statistically nonsignificant). Too few participants used the additional bupropion-SR to prove its effectiveness. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The protocols can be used for COPD patients in general practice, but expectations should be modest. If quitting is unsuccessful, a stepped care approach should be considered.</ab>

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose. In this study, Outcomes are described for patients receiving 'slow stream' rehabilitation care (called low tolerance long duration rehabilitation in Ontario, Canada consisting of approximately 5 h of rehabilitation weekly) for patients recovering from stroke in Ontario complex continuing care (CCC) (chronic) healthcare settings. Method. In 2006-2007, 81 post-acute stroke patients recovering in six Ontario, Canada CCC settings were studied. Both primary and secondary data sources were used to calculate six clinical characteristics of study patients and three outcomes: patient satisfaction with care, discharge location, and length of CCC stay. In addition, descriptive statistics, tests of difference were employed to examine differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes for patients across facilities. Results. Mean patient age was 74 years, 59% were females, 51% were married, and 34.6% lived alone prior to hospitalization. Patient data on six clinical characteristics is described. Almost half of patients were discharged to independent or semi-independent living. Mean length of stay (LOS) was 112.8 days. Mean scores for patient-reported satisfaction with care were 71 (out of 100). There were statistically significant differences in all outcomes across facilities. Conclusions. Slower paced and less intensive rehabilitation was successful in transitioning the majority of patients to independent living or to a healthcare setting providing less intensive care. Opportunities exist to promote increased patient satisfaction with care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is used to prevent/treat thromboembolism. Major bleeding is common in patients on OAT; eg, warfarin increases intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) risk. Case: A 71-year-old male on warfarin (to reduce stroke risk) presented at Accident and Emergency Minor Injuries Unit with headache after reportedly sounding 'drunk'. On triage, the patient appeared lucid and well. However, International Normalized Ratio (INR) was 4.1. Head computed tomography (CT) indicated a large right-sided subdural hematoma. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC; Beriplex ® P/N, CSL Behring) with vitamin K normalized the INR within minutes of administration. The patient underwent neurosurgery without complications, and was discharged after 5 days, with no residual neurological symptoms. Conclusions: ICH patients can present with no neurological signs. In OAT patients with headache, INR must be established; if ≥3.0, normalization of INR and head CT are essential. PCC is the best option to rapidly reverse anticoagulation and correct INR pre-surgery.</ab>
