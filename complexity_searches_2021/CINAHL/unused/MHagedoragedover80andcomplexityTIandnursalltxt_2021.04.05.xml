        <ab>Background: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) rely heavily on caregivers for assistance with care. However, we know little about their psychosocial experiences and their needs for support in managing MCC. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of caregivers of older adults living in the community with MCC. Methods: This qualitative study was a secondary analysis of previously collected data from caregivers in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Participants included caregivers of older adults (65 years and older) with three or more chronic conditions. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using Thorne's interpretive description approach. Results: Most of the 47 caregiver participants were female (76.6%), aged 65 years of age or older (61.7%), married (87.2%) and were spouses to the care recipient (68.1%). Caregivers' experiences of caring for community-living older adults with MCC were complex and included: (a) dealing with the demands of caregiving; (b) prioritizing chronic conditions; (c) living with my own health limitations; (d) feeling socially isolated and constrained; (e) remaining committed to caring; and (f) reaping the rewards of caregiving. Conclusions: Healthcare providers can play key roles in supporting caregivers of older adults with MCC by providing education and support on managing MCC, actively engaging them in goal setting and care planning, and linking them to appropriate community health and social support services. Communities can create environments that support caregivers in areas such as social participation, social inclusion, and community support and health services.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Detecting infection in frail elderly is a challenge due to lack of specific signs and symptoms. We highlight the complex situation when an elderly woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system.Methods: A descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is explored in the discussion.Results: The latent content analysis of the daughter's story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women recovers quickly.Conclusion: The healthcare system should embrace the complexity in the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage "correctly" for later placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption of complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Triage functions to quickly prioritize care and sort patients by anticipated resource needs. Despite widespread use of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), there is still no universal standard for emergency department (ED) triage. Thus, it can be difficult to objectively assess national trends in ED acuity and resource requirements. We sought to derive an ESI from National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) survey items (NHAMCS-ESI) and to assess the performance of this index with respect to stratifying outcomes, including hospital admission, waiting times, and ED length of stay (LOS). Methods: We used data from the 2010-2015 NHAMCS, to create a measure of ED visit complexity based on variables within NHAMCS. We used NHAMCS data on chief complaint, vitals, resources used, interventions, and pain level to group ED visits into five levels of acuity using a stepwise algorithm that mirrored ESI. In addition, we examined associations of NHAMCS-ESI with typical indicators of acuity such as waiting time, LOS, and disposition. The NHAMCS-ESI categorization was also compared against the “immediacy” variable across all of these outcomes. Visit counts used weighted scores to estimate national levels of ED visits. Results: The NHAMCS ED visits represent an estimated 805,726,000 ED visits over this time period. NHAMCS-ESI categorized visits somewhat evenly, with most visits (42.5%) categorized as a level 3. The categorization pattern is distinct from that of the “immediacy” variable within NHAMCS. Of admitted patients, 89% were categorized as NHAMCS-ESI level 2-3. Median ED waiting times increased as NHAMCS-ESI levels decreased in acuity (from approximately 14 minutes to 25 minutes). Median LOS decreased as NHAMCS-ESI decreased from almost 200 minutes for level 1 patients to nearly 80 minutes for level 5 patients. Conclusion: We derived an objective tool to measure an ED visit’s complexity and resource use. This tool can be validated and used to compare complexity of ED visits across hospitals and regions, and over time.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Prolonged diagnosis intervals occur more often in rare cancers, such as sarcoma. Patients with a delayed diagnosis may require more radical surgery and have a reduced chance of survival. Previous research has focused on quantifying the time taken to achieve a diagnosis without exploring the reasons for potential delays. The aim of this study was to explore patients', carers', and health professionals' perceived barriers to timely diagnosis and referral for treatment for sarcoma.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with: health professionals working with sarcoma (n = 21); patients who have been diagnosed with sarcoma (n = 22); and carers of patients diagnosed with sarcoma (n = 17). Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Four overarching themes were identified: patient perception of symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, lack of experience, and availability of health services. Diagnosis was prolonged by the limited availability of health services, lack of prompt referrals to a sarcoma specialist centre, and diagnostic challenges. Intervals also occurred when patients underestimated the severity of their symptoms and did not seek prompt medical consultation.Conclusions: Patients with a potential sarcoma need to be promptly referred to a sarcoma specialist centre and additional diagnosis pathways need to be developed to reduce the rate of patients being referred to wrong specialists. Sarcoma education must be embedded in medical courses and professional development curricula. A public health approach should be taken to improve sarcoma knowledge and health seeking behaviours in the community.</ab>

        <ab>• A residual clinical instability and functional deficit is fully expected for patients discharge from ICU. • Patients at high risk for adverse events can be effectively identified before ICU discharge based on routinely collected data. • The level of acuity and nursing complexity can independently predict the risk of adverse events. • Using such information to support the discharge decision-making could prevent adverse events and improve patient's outcome. Patients discharged from intensive care units (ICUs) are at risk for adverse events (AEs). Establishing safe discharge criteria is challenging. No available criteria consider nursing complexity among risk factors. To investigate whether nursing complexity upon ICU discharge is an independent predictor for AEs. Prospective observational study. The Patient Acuity and Complexity Score (PACS) was developed to measure nursing complexity. Its predictive power for AEs was tested using multivariate regression analysis. The final regression model showed a very-good discrimination power (AUC 0.881; p &lt;0.001) for identifying patients who experienced AEs. Age, ICU admission reason, PACS, cough strength, PaCO 2 , serum creatinine and sodium, and transfer to Internal Medicine showed to be predictive of AEs. Exceeding the identified PACS threshold increased by 3.3 times the AEs risk. The level of nursing complexity independently predicts AEs risk and should be considered in establishing patient's eligibility for a safe ICU discharge.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine agreement between administrative and self-reported data on the number of and constituent chronic conditions (CCs) used to measure multimorbidity. Study Design and Setting: Cross-sectional self-reported survey data from four Canadian Community Health Survey waves were linked to administrative data for residents of Ontario, Canada. Agreement for each of 12 CCs was assessed using kappa (κ) statistics. For the overall number of CCs, perfect agreement was defined as agreement on both the number and constituent CCs. Jackknife methods were used to assess the impact of individual CCs on perfect agreement. Results: The level of chance-adjusted agreement between self-report and administrative data for individual CCs varied widely, from κ = 5.5% (inflammatory bowel disease) to κ = 77.5% (diabetes), and there was no clear pattern on whether using administrative data or self-reported data led to higher prevalence estimates. Only 26.9% of participants had perfect agreement on the number and constituent CCs; 10.6% agreed on the number but not constituent CCs. The impact of each CC on perfect agreement depended on both the level of agreement and the prevalence of the individual CC. Conclusion: Our results show that measuring agreement on multimorbidity is more complex than for individual CCs and that even small levels of individual condition disagreement can have a large impact on the agreement on the number of CCs.</ab>

        <ab>In the last 2-3 decades internists have confronted dramatic changes in the pattern of patients acutely admitted to hospital wards. Internists observed a shift from younger subjects affected by a single organ disease to more complex patients, usually older, with multiple chronic conditions, attended by different specialists, with poor integration and treated with multiple drugs. In this regard, the concept of complex patients is addressed daily in clinical practice even if there is no agreed definition of patient complexity. To try to evaluate clinical complexity different instruments have been proposed. Among these, the number of comorbidities (NoC) was considered a marker of clinical complexity. However, this instrument would not give information about the clinical relevance of each condition. On the contrary, cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) addresses the problem calculating both CIRS severity index (CIRS-SI) and CIRS comorbidity index (CIRS-CI). In light of this, 4714 patients from the RePoSI register were retrospectively analyzed to show if CIRS assessment of comorbidity burden is different from the simple count of comorbidities in predicting the length of hospital stay (LOS) and all-cause of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients and if NoC could be a valid tool to measure patient's complexity. CIRS-SI resulted the best predictor of all-cause in-hospital mortality [OR: 2.66 (1.88-3.77)] in comparison with NoC that did not result statistically significant (p = 0.551). CIRS-SI was also the best predictor of all-cause of post-discharge mortality corrected for age and sex [OR: 2.12 (1.53-2.95)]. CIRS-SI (coefficient ± standard error: 1.23 ± 0.59; p &lt; 0.0381) and CIRS-CI (coefficient ± standard error: 0.27 ± 0.10; p &lt; 0.011) were strong predictors of LOS in comparison with NoC that did not result statistically significant (coefficient ± standard error: 0.04 ± 0.06 p &lt; 0.0561). In conclusion, CIRS assessment of comorbidity burden is a better clinical tool in comparison with the simple count of comorbidities especially considering the length of hospital stay and all-cause mortality in hospitalized elderly patients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES The main objective of the study was to investigate annual changes in the sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, and functional status of new nursing home residents in Ontario, Canada, between 2000 and 2015. A secondary objective was to develop and assess the quality of an algorithm for ascertaining admissions into publicly funded nursing homes in Ontario using a combination of health administrative data sources that indirectly identifies the residential status of new nursing home residents. DESIGN Population‐based serial cross‐sectional study with an accompanying quality assessment study of algorithms. SETTING Publicly funded nursing care homes in Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS The reference standard for the assessment of algorithm performance was 21 544 newly admitted nursing home residents identified from the Resident Assessment Instrument‐Minimum Data Set in 2012. The selected algorithm was then used to identify serial cross‐sectional cohorts of newly admitted residents between 2000 and 2015 that ranged in size between 14 651 and 23 630 residents. MEASUREMENTS Sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, and functional status of new residents were determined upon admission to examine patterns in the cohorts' profiles. RESULTS: The proportion of residents aged 85 years and older increased from 45.1% to 53.8% over 16 years. The proportions of individuals with seven or more chronic conditions (from 14.1% to 22.1%) and with nine or more prescription medications (from 44.9% to 64.2%) have also increased in parallel over time. Hypertension, osteoarthritis, and dementia were the most prevalent conditions captured, with the proportion of incoming residents with dementia increasing from 42.3% to 54.1% between 2000 and 2015. Newly admitted residents were more likely to have extensive physical and cognitive impairments upon admission. CONCLUSION: Admission trends show that new residents were older and had greater multimorbidity and limitations in physical functioning over time. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1293–1300, 2020.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Clinical work in the operating room (OR) is considered challenging as it is complex, dynamic, and often time- and resource-constrained. Important characteristics for successful management of complexity include adaptations and adaptive coordination when managing expected and unexpected events. However, there is a lack of explorative research addressing what makes things go well and how OR staff describe they do when responding to challenges and compensating for constraints. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how complexity is managed as expressed by operating room nurses, registered nurse anesthetists, and surgeons, and how these professionals adapt to create safe care in the OR.Method: Data for this qualitative explorative study were collected via group interviews with three professional groups of the OR-team, including operating room nurses, registered nurse anesthetists and operating and assisting surgeons in four group interview sessions, one for each profession except for ORNs for which two separate interviews were performed. The audio-taped transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by inductive qualitative content analysis.Results: The findings revealed three generic categories covering ways of creating safe care in the OR: preconditions and resources, planning and preparing for the expected and unexpected, and adapting to the unexpected. In each generic category, one sub-category emerged that was common to all three professions: coordinating and reaffirming information, creating a plan for the patient and undergoing mental preparation, and prioritizing and solving upcoming problems, respectively.Conclusion: Creating safe care in the OR should be understood as a process of planning and preparing in order to manage challenging and complex work processes. OR staff need preconditions and resources such as having experience and coordinating and reaffirming information, to make sense of different situations. This requires a mental model, which is created through planning and preparing in different ways. Some situations are repetitive and easier to plan for but planning for the unexpected requires anticipation from experience. The main results strengthen that abilities described in the theory of resilience are used by OR staff as a strategy to manage complexity in the OR.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Over the past 3 decades there have been significant advances in the development of pharmaceutical and rehabilitative treatments for persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), such that life expectancy is continuing to increase. As a result of these advancements, there is a "graying" phenomenon within the global MS population and a demographic shift of the aging landscape. While these advancements are exciting, there also concerns and unknowns regarding what it is like to age with MS. Objectives: The objectives of this research were to explore the experiences of aging in conjunction with having MS, and the different ways persons older than 60 with MS interpreted this phenomenon. Methods: Semistructured interviews with 40 persons with MS older than 60 years were conducted. Thereafter data were subject to a pluralistic analysis approach utilizing phenomenological and narrative traditions. Results: This research highlighted the complexity of aging with MS and the various ways persons older than 60 with MS experience and interpret this phenomenon. Most participants experienced a continued progression of physical and cognitive deficits, however aging narratives and what is culturally expected as a person older than 60 allowed for positive interpretations of this stage of life. For example, participants diagnosed in early adulthood stated having health problems was "normal" over 60, resulting in a sense of belonging that they had not experienced since being diagnosed. Some participants also perceived they were aging more successfully than peers without MS as they had engaged in healthenhancing behaviors from an earlier age, while others believed they had "aged out" of MS and were experiencing a peak of health and wellness. Participants who were diagnosed in middle age, however, noted a sharp progression of age-related and MS symptoms, but stated "everyone has something" and perceived the diagnosis of MS was less impactful in older age with regards to what is expected at this life stage. Concerns remained, however, regarding whether a new physical or cognitive experience was aging or MS, what the future holds regarding losing independence, losing spouses and caregivers, and growing "too old" such that quality of life is completely diminished. Conclusions: This qualitative research has highlighted the complexity of aging with MS. All participants noted a continued progression of health, physical function, and cognitive ability but stated that they felt a sense of normality and were living a life that culturally aligned with aging narratives. Fears about the future do remain as participants were concerned about living too long for being able to thrive. More research must be done that focuses on maintaining quality of life among older person with MS as quantity of life continues to increase.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Informative System of Nursing Performance was developed to measure complexity of nursing care based on the actual interventions performed by nurses at the point of care. The association of this score with in-hospital mortality was not investigated before. Having this information is relevant to define evidence-based criteria that hospital administrators can use to allocate nursing workforce according to the real and current patients' need for nursing care. The aim of this study is to assess the association between complexity of nursing care and in-hospital mortality.Methods: Register-based cohort study on all patients admitted to acute medical wards of a middle-large hospital in the North of Italy between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015 and followed up to discharge. Out of all the eligible 7247 records identified in the Hospital Discharge Register, 6872 records from 5129 patients have been included. A multivariable frailty Cox model was adopted to estimate the association between the Informative System of Nursing Performance score, both as continuous variable and dichotomized as low (score &lt; 50) or high (score ≥ 50), and in-hospital mortality adjusting for several factors recorded at admission (age, gender, type of admission unit, type of access and Charlson Comorbidity Index).Results: The median age of the 5129 included patients was 76 [first-third quartiles 64-84] and 2657(52%) patients were males. Over the 6872 admissions, there were 395 in-hospital deaths among 2922 patients at high complexity of nursing care (13.5%) and 74/3950 (1.9%) among those at low complexity leading to a difference of 11.6% (95% CI: 10.3-13.0%). Adjusting by relevant confounders, the hazard rate of mortality in the first 10 days from admission resulted 6 times significantly higher in patients at high complexity of nursing care with respect to patients at low complexity (hazard ratio, HR 6.58, 95%CI: 4.50;9.62, p &lt; 0.001). The HR was lower after 10 days from admission but still significantly higher than 1. By considering the continuous score, the association was confirmed.Conclusion: Complexity of nursing care is strongly associated to in-hospital mortality of acute patients admitted to medical departments. It predicts in-hospital mortality better than widely used indicators, such as comorbidity.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether there has been a measurable change in the dependency and complexity of patients admitted to in-patient rehabilitation in Australia between 2007 and 2016. Methods: A retrospective cohort study design was used to examine in-patient rehabilitation data held in the Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre Registry Database for the period 2007–16. Epidemiological descriptive analysis was used to examine datasets for difference between four discrete years (2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016). Datasets included patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), comorbidities, complications and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM™). Results: Between 2007 and 2016, rehabilitation in-patients as a whole: (1) had a mean decrease in total admission FIM score; (2) became more complex, as evidenced by the increased proportion of particular comorbidities impacting on rehabilitation, namely cardiac and respiratory disease, dementia, diabetes and morbid obesity; and (3) had a mean decrease in total discharge FIM score. However, there was an increase in the proportion of patients discharged home from rehabilitation (from 86.5% to 92%) and decreases in onset and rehabilitation LOS of 2.2 and 2.5 days respectively. Conclusion: The dependency and complexity of patients admitted to in-patient rehabilitation in Australia has increased between 2007 and 2016. What is known about the topic?: Anecdotal reports suggest that rehabilitation patients in Australia have become more complex, necessitating increased active management of their presenting health condition and comorbid health conditions. However, to date, no systematic investigation has been undertaken to examine trends in rehabilitation in-patient dependency and complexity over time. What does this paper add?: This study provides measurable evidence of increased dependency and complexity in patients admitted to rehabilitation in Australia. Further, compared with 2007, rehabilitation in-patients as a whole had an increased burden of care on discharge from rehabilitation in 2016. What are the implications for practitioners?: The changes in patient dependency and complexity reported in this study have implications for rehabilitation service delivery. This is because the increased need for illness or injury and comorbidity management may result in increased potential for acute complications and health deterioration, and compensatory care for patients during rehabilitation. Clinicians may need to widen their skill set to include more acute and chronic illness management.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) rely heavily on caregivers for assistance with care. However, we know little about their psychosocial experiences and their needs for support in managing MCC. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of caregivers of older adults living in the community with MCC. Methods: This qualitative study was a secondary analysis of previously collected data from caregivers in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Participants included caregivers of older adults (65 years and older) with three or more chronic conditions. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using Thorne's interpretive description approach. Results: Most of the 47 caregiver participants were female (76.6%), aged 65 years of age or older (61.7%), married (87.2%) and were spouses to the care recipient (68.1%). Caregivers' experiences of caring for community-living older adults with MCC were complex and included: (a) dealing with the demands of caregiving; (b) prioritizing chronic conditions; (c) living with my own health limitations; (d) feeling socially isolated and constrained; (e) remaining committed to caring; and (f) reaping the rewards of caregiving. Conclusions: Healthcare providers can play key roles in supporting caregivers of older adults with MCC by providing education and support on managing MCC, actively engaging them in goal setting and care planning, and linking them to appropriate community health and social support services. Communities can create environments that support caregivers in areas such as social participation, social inclusion, and community support and health services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine agreement between administrative and self-reported data on the number of and constituent chronic conditions (CCs) used to measure multimorbidity. Study Design and Setting: Cross-sectional self-reported survey data from four Canadian Community Health Survey waves were linked to administrative data for residents of Ontario, Canada. Agreement for each of 12 CCs was assessed using kappa (κ) statistics. For the overall number of CCs, perfect agreement was defined as agreement on both the number and constituent CCs. Jackknife methods were used to assess the impact of individual CCs on perfect agreement. Results: The level of chance-adjusted agreement between self-report and administrative data for individual CCs varied widely, from κ = 5.5% (inflammatory bowel disease) to κ = 77.5% (diabetes), and there was no clear pattern on whether using administrative data or self-reported data led to higher prevalence estimates. Only 26.9% of participants had perfect agreement on the number and constituent CCs; 10.6% agreed on the number but not constituent CCs. The impact of each CC on perfect agreement depended on both the level of agreement and the prevalence of the individual CC. Conclusion: Our results show that measuring agreement on multimorbidity is more complex than for individual CCs and that even small levels of individual condition disagreement can have a large impact on the agreement on the number of CCs.</ab>

        <ab>As treatment for HIV improves, an ageing population is experiencing comorbidity which often leads to complex clinical presentations requiring an interdisciplinary care approach. This study sought to quantify clinician assessment of the level of clinical complexity, through the development of a rating scale for people living with HIV (PLHIV), to improve client care through an interdisciplinary care model. An existing alcohol and other drug complexity rating scale was selected and modified for use with PLHIV. HIV-specific items were included through consultation with an interdisciplinary team. A risk-prediction model was developed and validated using clinician ratings of clients attending The Albion Centre, a tertiary HIV clinic in Sydney, Australia, resulting in the development of the Clinical Complexity Rating Scale for HIV (CCRS-HIV). Multivariable logistic regression models identified eight characteristics based on clinician assessment of complexity in PLHIV: financial instability, social isolation, problematic crystal methamphetamine use, mental illness and/or other problematic substance use, cognitive/neurological impairment, polypharmacy, current hepatitis C infection and/or cancer, and other physical health comorbidity. A weighted risk-prediction model was developed and validated. The final model accurately predicted 85% of complex clients, with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 91%. This study developed an HIV-specific clinician-rated complexity scale. Further investigations are required to validate the CCRS-HIV with broader HIV populations. This simple complexity screening tool is a promising adjunct to clinical assessment to identify clients with complex physical and psychosocial needs who may benefit from interdisciplinary care interventions and allocation of resources.</ab>

        <ab>Clinical complexity (CC) represents one of the most relevant challenges of modern medicine, and its quantification is crucial both to stratify the clinical risk and for a fair hospital reimbursement policy.[1]-[3] CC is a multifaceted condition that encompasses biological (e.g., age, multimorbidity, frailty) and non-biological (e.g., socioeconomic, cultural, environmental, and behavioral) components.[4], [5] On this basis, a vectorial model of CC has been set up in which each vector expresses the dynamic changes over time of each component.[5] Although this model cannot but be an approximation of CC, it is able to take into account its determining factors all at once. The CC index studied has a high interobserver agreement among different healthcare professionals who were trained to administer this tool (observers #1 and #2). To conclude, the results of the present study support the feasibility of the use of the CC index in an internal medicine setting, and could provide background for its use in future studies.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the implementation and outcomes of evidence-based fall-risk-reduction processes when those processes are implemented using a multiteam system (MTS) structure.Data Sources/study Setting: Fall-risk-reduction process and outcome measures from 16 small rural hospitals participating in a research demonstration and dissemination study from August 2012 to July 2014. Previously, these hospitals lacked a fall-event reporting system to drive improvement.Study Design: A one-group pretest-posttest embedded in a participatory research framework. We required hospitals to implement MTSs, which we supported by conducting education, developing an online toolkit, and establishing a fall-event reporting system.Data Collection: Hospitals used gap analyses to assess the presence of fall-risk-reduction processes at study beginning and their frequency and effectiveness at study end; they reported fall-event data throughout the study.Principal Findings: The extent to which hospitals implemented 21 processes to coordinate the fall-risk-reduction program and trained staff specifically about the program predicted unassisted and injurious fall rates during the end-of-study period (January 2014-July 2014). Bedside fall-risk-reduction processes were not significant predictors of these outcomes.Conclusions: Multiteam systems that effectively coordinate fall-risk-reduction processes may improve the capacity of hospitals to manage the complex patient, environmental, and system factors that result in falls.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant.Methods: The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant.Discussion: The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03883425 , registered on March 20, 2019.</ab>

        <ab>Traditional quality assurance processes provide significant opportunities for positive disruption. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students are well positioned to apply program learning to largescale change in complex organizations. This article presents an innovative approach for creating a point-of-care interdisciplinary approach to address high fall risk frequencies in ambulatory oncology clinics using complexity leadership principles. Processes for nurse executives to consider for replication of this approach for other challenging clinical situations are suggested using the emerging competence of DNP educated nurses. Adults with cancer who are older than 65 years are at a higher risk for falls than older adults without cancer. Oncology providers and nurses are not routinely screening, documenting, and preventing falls. A fall injury in an older adult with cancer may not only delay or impact cancer treatment but also result in hospitalization, loss of function, and/or death. Increasing awareness of the impact of falls and implementing change within a large ambulatory health care organization requires an interdisciplinary team approach. Complexity theory supports nonlinear change initiated at the grassroots level to create a dynamic movement to bring forth emergence and adaptation. The use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) initiative will enable oncology professionals to screen, assess, and intervene by collaborating, communicating, and coordinating with other health care specialists to introduce a fall prevention quality improvement system process. Nurse executives need to know about STEADI.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of performing partial nephrectomy (PN) on patients with high nephrometry score tumors.Patients and Methods: We used a prospectively maintained multi-institutional kidney cancer database to identify 144 patients with R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score ≥10 who underwent PN for a cT1-cT2 renal mass. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, tumor characteristics, perioperative, and pathological outcomes were analyzed and reported. Trifecta achievement, defined by warm ischemia time &lt;25 minutes, no perioperative complications, and negative surgical margins, was the primary outcome. We assessed the relationship of baseline clinical and tumor characteristics data to trifecta achievement and perioperative complications.Results: Baseline median eGFR was 84.57 ml/min/1.73 m2, with 119 (84.39%) patients having normal baseline kidney function. The median clinical tumor size was 4.95 cm, with 74 (51.75%) being completely endophytic and 58 (41.73%) located on the hilum. The median ischemia time was 20 minutes. Median estimated blood loss was 150 ml. Twelve patients (8.33%) had intraoperative complications. No patient had a conversion to open surgery. Postoperative, perioperative, and major complication rate were 10.42%, 17.3%, and 2.34% respectively. Thirty-six patients (37.89%) developed postoperative acute kidney injury and 28 (20.90%) developed new-onset CKD at a median follow-up of 6 months. Eight patients (5.56%) had a positive surgical margin. Trifecta was achieved in 89 (61.81%) patients. There was no significant difference in baseline, clinical, and tumor characteristics between those that achieved trifecta and in those where trifecta was not. Pathologic tumor stage was the only factor significantly associated with trifecta achievement (P = 0.025).Conclusion: In treating complex renal tumors, PN should be performed when possible. Although this remains a challenging procedure, with experience and appropriate case selection, the trifecta outcome can be achieved in a significant number of patients with high renal score lesions.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation resolves recurrent Clostridium difficile infections in greater than 82% of patients. Highly screened, processed universal donor fecal material is available. We compared cost and scheduling efficiency of fecal microbiota transplantation by universal donors to patient-directed donors.Methods: Medical records from a prospectively maintained database of recurrent C. difficile patients who underwent fecal microbiota transplantation between 2012 and 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient-directed donor stool was prepared in our microbiology laboratory using protocol-based screening. We transitioned to purchasing and using universal donor fecal material in 2015. Clinical outcomes, adverse events, time between consult to infusion, consultation fees, and material costs were compared. This was a retrospective comparison of two historical cohorts.Results: A total of 111 fecal microbiota transplantations were performed on 105 patients (56 from patient-directed donors and 55 from universal donors). Median recipient age was 66 years (18-96) with male to female ratio of 1:2.7, equivalent in both cohorts. Total consultation fees were significantly lower in the universal donor group owing to fewer infectious disease consultations. Costs for donor screening and stool preparation were lower in the universal donor cohort ($485.0 vs. $1189.90 ± 541.4, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 559.9-849.9). Time from consultations to infusion was shorter in the universal donor cohort (18.9 ± 19.1 vs. 36.4 ± 23.3 days, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 9.521-25.591). Recurrences within 8 weeks after fecal microbiota transplantation were equivalent (p = 0.354). Adverse events were equivalent.Conclusions: Fecal microbiota transplantation using universal donors versus patient-directed donors for recurrent C. difficile showed comparable efficacy and short-term complications. The use of universal donors resulted in significant cost savings and scheduling efficiency.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Down syndrome (DS) is characterised by premature ageing that affects selected organ systems, and persons with this condition can present patterns of co‐morbidities and deficits often observed in the older population without DS. However, information on the characteristics of adult persons with DS is limited. The objective of the study is to describe characteristics of adults with DS collected with a standardised, comprehensive assessment instrument. Methods Cross‐sectional study. Four hundred thirty adults with DS (age range 18/75 years) from three countries (Italy, n = 95; USA, n = 175; and Canada, n = 160). A standardised assessment instrument (interRAI intellectual disability) was used to assess sample characteristics. Results: Mean age ranged from 35.2 (standard deviation 12.0) years in the US sample to 48.8 (standard deviation 9.0) years in the Canadian sample. Most participants in the Italian and US sample were living in private homes, while more than half of those in the Canadian sample were institutionalised. Prevalences of geriatric conditions, including cognitive deficits, disability in the common activities of daily living, symptoms of withdrawal or anhedonia, aggressive behaviour, communication problems, falls and hearing problems were high in the study sample. Gastrointestinal symptoms, skin and dental problems and obesity were also frequently observed. Conclusions: Adults with DS present with a high level of complexity, which may suggest the need for an approach based on a comprehensive assessment and management that can provide adequate care. Further research is needed to understand better the effectiveness of such an approach in the DS population.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: This first psychometric evaluation of the Patient Categorisation Tool examined its properties as an instrument to measure complexity of needs in a mixed population of patients presenting for specialist neurorehabilitation. Materials/methods: Analysis of a large multicentre cohort of patients (n = 5396) from the national clinical dataset representing 63 specialist rehabilitation services across England. Structural validity was examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Concurrent and criterion-validity were tested through a priori hypothesized relationships with other validated measures of resource requirements and dependency. Results: All but two items loaded strongly onto a single principal component with Cronbach's alpha 0.88. A total score of ≥30 identified patients with complex (category A) needs with sensitivity 76% and specificity 75%. However, confirmatory factor analysis provided a better fit when the scale was split into two subscales – a 'Cognitive/psychosocial' and a 'Physical' sub-scale (alpha 0.83 and 0.84, respectively). Moderate convergent and discriminant correlations were consistent with hypothesized relationships. Conclusions: The findings provide some overall support for the Patient Categorisation Tool as a unidimensional tool for measuring complexity of needs for neurorehabilitation, but the subscales may be more suitable for certain groups of patients. Further analysis is now required to evaluate its performance in different conditions. A psychometrically robust tool for measuring the complexity of rehabilitation needs has potential value, both at an individual level for treatment planning, and at a population level for planning and commissioning rehabilitation services. The Patient Categorisation Tool now forms part of the United Kingdom national clinical dataset mandated by the National Health Service in England This psychometric analysis from a large national multicentre cohort representing a diverse range of conditions, provides evidence for its validity as a means to identity patients with complex rehabilitation needs requiring specialist rehabilitation.</ab>

        <ab>Inpatients with hematologic cancer (HC), particularly in an aging population, often require levels of nursing care that feel very demanding. Therefore, it is important to assess nursing complexity in this care environment. The purpose of this study is to assess nursing complexity of inpatients with HC. A prospective observational study was carried out on 131 patients admitted to an adult hematologic center in northern Italy. The following variables were analyzed by means of the Index of Caring Complexity (ICA): age, sex, diagnostic category, purpose of admission, presence of transplant, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and length of stay. A total sample of 131 patients were enrolled. Patients older than 65 years, with a history of transplant, admitted for complications, and with a diagnosis of myeloma or myelodysplasia had higher ICA scores. Therefore, patients in these groups are more likely to exhibit a higher nursing complexity than other patients. The study results can help health-care professionals identify, at an early stage, patients who need higher levels of nursing care; promote a more efficient allocation of nursing staff to the patient needs based on their group; and qualify the need for higher levels of nursing care in order to improve nursing care quality and achieve higher standards of care in Italian hematologic centers.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The aim was to better understand how beliefs influence medication adherence in asthma.Methods: All participants were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid for a diagnosis of asthma. Each participant completed a survey consisting of: Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids was elicited using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Multiple linear regression with interaction effects was used to identify significant predictors of medication adherence and interactions between beliefs.Results: A total of 198 participants completed the survey. The mean(±SD) MARS score was 19.2(±4.5). A multivariable model (adjusted R2 = 0.39) predicted adherence using: age, asthma hospitalisation, timeline (B-IPQ) subscale, necessity and concern (BMQ) subscales, doctor (MHLCS) subscale and the two interaction effects (concerns [BMQ] moderated by chance [MHLCS] and treatment control [B-IPQ] moderated by understanding [B-IPQ]).Conclusion: The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the role of beliefs in medication adherence in asthma. Certain beliefs meaningfully interrelate and change the relationship they have with medication adherence.Practice Implications: If these beliefs are causally related to medication adherence and can be intervened upon, the findings are useful for providing targets to personalise adherence support.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Hospital-related factors associated with mortality and morbidity after hip fracture surgery are not completely understood. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest single-payer, networked healthcare system in the country serving a relatively homogenous patient population with facilities that vary in size and resource availability. These characteristics provide some degree of financial and patient-level controls to explore the association, if any, between surgical volume and facility resource availability and hospital performance regarding postoperative complications after hip fracture surgery.Questions/purposes: (1) Do VHA facilities with the highest complexity level designation (Level 1a) have a disproportionate number of better-than-expected performance outliers for major postoperative complications compared with lower-complexity level facilities? (2) Do VHA facilities with higher hip fracture surgical volume have a disproportionate number of better-than-expected performance outliers for major postoperative complications compared with lower-volume facilities?Methods: We explored the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Project (VASQIP) database from October 2001 to September 2012 for records of hip fracture surgery performed. Data reliability of the VASQIP database has been previously validated. We excluded nine of the 98 VHA facilities for contributing fewer than 30 records. The remaining 89 VHA facilities provided 23,029 records. The VHA designates a complexity level to each facility based on multiple criteria. We labeled facilities with a complexity Level 1a (38 facilities)-the highest achievable VHA designated complexity level-as high complexity; we labeled all other complexity level designations as low complexity (51 facilities). Facility volume was divided into tertiles: high (&gt; 277 hip fracture procedures during the sampling frame), medium (204 to 277 procedures), and low (&lt; 204 procedures). The patient population treated by low-complexity facilities was older, had a higher prevalence of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (26% versus 22%, p &lt; 0.001), and had a higher percentage of patients having surgery within 2 days of hospital admission (83% versus 76%, p &lt; 0.001). High-complexity facilities treated more patients with recent congestive heart failure exacerbation (4% versus 3%, p &lt; 0.001). We defined major postoperative complications as having at least one of the following: death within 30 days of surgery, cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, new q-wave myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, ventilator dependence for at least 48 hours after surgery, reintubation for respiratory or cardiac failure, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, progressive renal insufficiency with a rise in serum creatinine of at least 2 mg/dL from preoperative value, pneumonia, or surgical site infection. We used the observed-to-expected ratio (O/E ratio)-a risk-adjusted metric to classify facility performance-for major postoperative complications to assess the performance of VHA facilities. Outlier facilities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for O/E ratio completely less than 1.0 were labeled "exceed expectation;" those that were completely greater than 1.0 were labeled "below expectation." We compared differences in the distribution of outlier facilities between high and low-complexity facilities, and between high-, medium-, and low-volume facilities using Fisher's exact test.Results: We observed no association between facility complexity level and the distribution of outlier facilities (high-complexity: 5% exceeded expectation, 5% below expectation; low-complexity: 8% exceeded expectation, 2% below expectation; p = 0.742). Compared with high-complexity facilities, the adjusted odds ratio for major postoperative complications for low-complexity facilities was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.67-1.09; p = 0.108).We observed no association between facility volume and the distribution of outlier facilities: 3% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for high-volume; 10% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for medium-volume; and 7% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for low-volume; p = 0.890). The adjusted odds ratios for major postoperative complications were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.73-1.05) for low- versus high-volume facilities and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79-1.02] for medium- versus high-volume facilities (p = 0.155).Conclusions: These results do not support restricting facilities from treating hip fracture patients based on historical surgical volume or facility resource availability. Identification of consistent performance outliers may help health care organizations with multiple facilities determine allocation of services and identify characteristics and processes that determine outlier status in the interest of continued quality improvement.Level Of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic study.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Gaining glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) usually requires more complicated medication regimens. Increased medication regimen complexity (MRC) negatively impacts adherence and clinical outcomes.Objective: Compare MRC change in patients with uncontrolled T2D referred to a collaborative pharmacist-endocrinologist Diabetes Intense Medical Management (DIMM) clinic "tune up" model versus similar patients receiving usual primary care provider (PCP) care over 6 months.Methods: Retrospective, observational, comparative cohort study compared MRC of complex DIMM clinic patients to a similar group (adults with T2D, glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C] ≥8%), continuing to receive usual care from their PCPs. The MRC Index (MRCI) was used to quantify MRC.Results: Both DIMM (n=99) and PCP (n=56) groups were similar, with high baseline mean MRC scores as measured by number of medications and MRCI (12.0 [SD=5.7] vs 13.7 [SD = 5.6], and 32.7 [SD=17.0] vs 38 [SD=16.5]), respectively. Mean MRC change over 6 months was not significantly different between groups, although mean A1C reduction was significantly greater in the DIMM versus PCP group (-2.4% [SD=2.1] vs -0.8% [SD=1.7], P&lt;0.001, respectively).Conclusions and Relevance: Outcomes represent the first report demonstrating how treating patients with an innovative DIMM model can help complex T2D patients achieve glycemic control without increasing the MRC to more than a comparator group. With the growing prevalence of T2D and associated elevated treatment costs, identifying effective means for achieving glycemic control without increasing complexity is needed. Application of this model may be considered by other health systems to aid in achieving outcome measures.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of our study was to assess the incidence of pain flare and the effectiveness of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in pain management of patients with bone oligometastases. We evaluated 48 patients accounting for 54 treatments. The Edmonton Classification System for Cancer Pain (ECS‐CP) was applied to identify indicators of treatment‐resistant pain, in patients with active pain (NRS ≥ 2) at baseline. Statistical analysis was performed to identify predictors of pain flare and pain control. Pain flare occurred in 38% of treated patients (n = 18/48): No correlation was found between pain flare and patient‐ or treatment‐related variables. In the subset of patients with active pain at baseline (n = 23), pain control was obtained in 62% of patients at 1 year; median time to pain progression after SBRT was 29 months (CI95% 6–52 months). Presence of ≥2ECS‐CP features was correlated with earlier pain progression (4 vs. 30 months, p = 0.012). Pain flare occurred in 38% of cases irrespectively of steroid premedication and dose regimen. In patient with baseline active pain, durable pain control was obtained. Presence of ≥2 complexity indicators at the ECS‐CP assessment was correlated with impaired pain control and may deserve future investigation in prospective studies.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale: Despite multiple trials of interventions to improve end-of-life care of the critically ill, there is a persistent lack of understanding of factors associated with barriers to decision-making at the end of life. Objective: To apply the principles of complexity science in examining the extent to which transitions to end-of-life care can be predicted by physician, family, or patient characteristics; outcome expectations; and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Methods: A descriptive, longitudinal study was conducted in 3 adult intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred sixty-four family surrogates of patients lacking decisional capacity and the physicians caring for the patients were interviewed every 5 days until ICU discharge or patient death. Measurements: Characteristics of patients, physicians, and family members; values and preferences of physicians and family; and evaluation of treatment effectiveness, expectations for patient outcomes, and relative priorities in treatment (comfort vs survival). The primary outcome, focus of care, was categorized as (1) maintaining a survival orientation (no treatment limitations), (2) transitioning to a stronger palliative focus (eg, some treatment limitations), or (3) transitioning to an explicit end-of-life, comfort-oriented care plan. Main Results: Physician expectations for survival and future cognitive status were the only variables consistently and significantly related to the focus of care. Neither physician or family evaluations of treatment effectiveness nor what was most important to physicians or family members was influential. Conclusion: Lack of influence of family and physician views, in comparison to the consistent effect of survival probabilities, suggests barriers to incorporation of individual values in treatment decisions.</ab>

        <ab>INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of long-term health conditions (LTCs) continues to increase and it is normal for people to have several. Lifestyle is a core feature of the self-management support given to people with LTCs, yet it seems to fail to meet their needs. From a larger study exploring the experiences of this group, this paper reports on the role of food and mealtimes, and the effect of the nutritional advice on the lives of people with several LTCs. METHODS: The experiences of 16 people with several advanced LTCs were explored using multiple qualitative case studies. Over an 18-month period, contact with participants included monthly conversations, two longer, semi-structured interviews and one interview with their primary care clinicians. The data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There was profound social, psychological and cultural significance of food to the participants. These aspects of food were then described using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health. The approach to food and nutrition participants experienced in health care was closely associated with conventional weight management. They found this advice largely irrelevant and therefore ineffective. DISCUSSION: The pressure people with several LTCs experience during clinical encounters has perverse effects on wellbeing and reinforces an overall sense of failure. This research challenges the assumption that all people have the will, agency and income to follow the advice they receive about nutrition and exercise. Considering people's needs using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health offers clinicians a framework to re-conceptualise the core features of self-management support and provide realistic, compassionate care that will optimise the quality of life for people with multiple LTCs.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of RMMRs on medication regimen complexity, as assessed by a validated measure.Methods: Retrospective analysis of RMMRs pertaining to 285 aged care residents aged ≥ 65 years in Sydney, Australia. Medication regimen complexity was measured using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) at baseline, after pharmacists' recommendations (assuming that all of the pharmacists' recommendations were accepted by the General Practitioner (GP)), and after the actual uptake of pharmacists' recommendations by the GP. Differences in the regimen complexity was measured using the Wilcoxon sign rank test.Results: Pharmacists made 764 recommendations (average 2.7 recommendations per RMMR), of which 569 (74.5%) were accepted by GPs. The median MRCI at baseline in the sample was 25.5 (IQR = 19.0-32.5). No statistically significant differences were demonstrated in the MRCI scores after pharmacists' recommendations (p = 0.53) or after GPs' acceptance of these recommendations (p = 0.07) compared to the baseline.Conclusion: Our study revealed high acceptance of pharmacists' recommendations by GPs. This suggests that RMMRs are useful for identifying and resolving drug-related issues among residents of ACFs. However, our study failed to show a significant effect of RMMRs in reducing the medication regimen complexity, as measured by the MRCI. Further studies are needed to establish the association of medication regimen complexity and clinical outcomes in residents of ACFs.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To describe the relationship between nursing facility resident risk conditions and signs and symptoms at time of acute transfer and diagnosis of conditions associated with potentially avoidable acute transfers (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, dehydration, pressure sores). Design: As part of a demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospital transfers, Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project clinical staff collected data on residents who transferred to the emergency department (ED) or hospital. Cross‐tabulations were used to identify associations between risk conditions or symptoms and hospital diagnoses or death. Mixed‐effects logistic regression models were used to describe the significance of risk conditions, signs, or symptoms as predictors of potentially avoidable hospital diagnoses or death. Setting: Indiana nursing facilities (N=19). Participants: Long‐stay nursing facility residents (N=1,174), who experienced 1,931 acute transfers from November 2014 to July 2016. Measurements: Participant symptoms, transfers, risk factors, and hospital diagnoses. Results: We found that 44% of acute transfers were associated with 1 of 6 potentially avoidable diagnoses. Symptoms before transfer did not discriminate well among hospital diagnoses. Symptoms mapped into multiple diagnoses and most hospital diagnoses had multiple associated symptoms. For example, more than two‐thirds of acute transfers of residents with a history of CHF and COPD were for reasons other than exacerbations of those two conditions. Conclusion: Although it is widely recognized that many transfers of nursing facility residents are potentially avoidable, determining “avoidability” at time of transfer is complex. Symptoms and risk conditions were only weakly predictive of hospital diagnoses.</ab>

        <ab>Occam's razor proposes that the simplest solution is preferable; however, in the science of cancer and cancer symptoms, simple solutions have been elusive. Understanding individual symptoms continues to confound the science community, and symptom cluster science appears to be an incredibly complex schema of individual symptoms co-occurring and interacting with one another. The simplest explanation for symptom clusters would be a common underlying mechanism at the human genome level. Such a finding could greatly simplify and perhaps revolutionize symptom management.</ab>

        <ab>Older people living in residential aged care often experience complex persistent pain because of the presence of multiple comorbidities and geriatric syndrome. Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration needs to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population can be improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary suffering.</ab>

        <ab>Children with medical complexity receive care from many healthcare providers including home healthcare nurses. The objective of our study, based on a conceptual framework, was to describe the relationships between parents/ caregivers of children with medical complexity and home healthcare nurses caring for these children. We collected qualitative data in 20 semistructured in-depth interviews (15 English, 5 Spanish) with 26 primary caregivers of children with medical complexity, and 4 focus groups of 18 home healthcare nurses inquiring about their experiences about home healthcare nursing services for children with medical complexity. During an iterative analysis process, we identified recurrent themes related to caregiver-nurse relationships. Our study showed that: (1) caregiver-nurse relationships evolved over time and were determined by multiple factors; (2) communication and trust were essential to the establishment of caregiver-nurse relationships; (3) both caregivers and nurses described difficulties of navigating physical, professional, personal, and emotional boundaries, and identified strategies to maintain these boundaries; and (4) good caregiver-nurse relationships helped in the care of children with medical complexity, reduced caregiver burden, resulted in less stress for nurses, and was a factor in nurse retention. We conclude that trusted relationships between caregivers and nurses are important to the home care of children with medical complexity. Interventions to develop and maintain good caregiver-nurse relationships are necessary.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Adverse events during hospitalization are a major worry considering their frequency and their burden. Many could be avoided by immediate identification of at-risk patients at admission and adapted prevention. The complexity of a patient's medication regimen immediately available at admission is a good indicator of the complexity of the patient's condition. This study aims to determine whether the electronic Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) at admission is associated with complications during hospitalization.Design: We performed a multilevel logistic regression model, adjusted for age and sex.Setting: Premier Perspective™ database, a clinical and financial information system from 417 US hospitals.Participants: Adults hospitalized for more than 3 days in a medical ward and included in Premier's Perspective™ database for 2006.Intervention(s): Multilevel logistic regression.Main Outcome Measure: Association of the MRCI and complications during hospitalization, defined as in-hospital death, hospital-acquired infection, pressure ulcers; and need for highly technical healthcare, identified as the secondary introduction of catecholamines.Results: In total, 1 592 383 admissions were included. The median MRCI at admission was 13 [interquartile range: 9-19]. The higher the MRCI, the higher the adjusted odds ratio of the following: in-hospital mortality, hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers and the secondary introduction of catecholamines.Conclusions: Our results suggested that the MRCI at admission was correlated with patient complexity, independent of age. Considering that patients with complex conditions pose a heavier workload for staff, measuring MRCI at admission could be used to allocate resources in medical wards at an institutional level. The MRCI might be a useful tool to assess the management of care.</ab>

        <ab>Proposal: Model of early palliative care (PC) integrated in oncology is based on shared care from the diagnosis to the end of life and is mainly focused on patients with greater complexity. However, there is no definition or tools to evaluate PC complexity. The objectives of the study were to identify the factors influencing level determination of complexity, propose predictive models, and build a complexity scale of PC.Patients and Method: We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study in a cohort of advanced cancer patients with an estimated prognosis ≤ 6 months. An ad hoc structured evaluation including socio-demographic and clinical data, symptom burden, functional and cognitive status, psychosocial problems, and existential-ethic dilemmas was recorded systematically. According to this multidimensional evaluation, investigator classified patients as high, medium, or low palliative complexity, associated to need of basic or specialized PC. Logistic regression was used to identify the variables influencing determination of level of PC complexity and explore predictive models.Results: We included 324 patients; 41% were classified as having high PC complexity and 42.9% as medium, both levels being associated with specialized PC. Variables influencing determination of PC complexity were as follows: high symptom burden (OR 3.19 95%CI: 1.72-6.17), difficult pain (OR 2.81 95%CI:1.64-4.9), functional status (OR 0.99 95%CI:0.98-0.9), and social-ethical existential risk factors (OR 3.11 95%CI:1.73-5.77). Logistic analysis of variables allowed construct a complexity model and structured scales (PALCOM 1 and 2) with high predictive value (AUC ROC 76%).Conclusion: This study provides a new model and tools to assess complexity in palliative care, which may be very useful to manage referral to specialized PC services, and agree intensity of their intervention in a model of early-shared care integrated in oncology.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The practice of lead abandonment at the time of cardiac implantable electronic device upgrade remains a controversial topic but is affecting an increasing number of patients. Inherent risks include high-risk extractions of redundant leads when extraction is required at a later date.Objectives: We aimed to report our experience with transvenous lead extraction (TLE) at the time of device upgrade.Methods: All consecutive TLE procedures at the time of device upgrade at the Cleveland Clinic between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2012 were included (n = 503). Success and complications were defined according to the Heart Rhythm Society consensus document on TLE.Results: There were a total of 984 leads in place, and 719 were targeted with extraction (589 pacer and 130 defibrillator leads, 63 of them being dual-coil leads). In all patients, TLEs aimed to avoid abandoning leads. Concomitant lead management issues included lead malfunction (15%), previously abandoned leads (9%), vascular access occlusion (6%), or leads on advisory (3%). In most procedures (75.4%), special extraction tools were needed. The complete procedural and clinical success rates were 96.6% and 97.2%, respectively. During planned extractions, damage of coexisting leads occurred in 19 patients (3.8%), eventually requiring extraction. The major and minor complication rates were 1% and 1.4%, respectively.Conclusion: In a high-volume center, TLEs at the time of device upgrade were successful in the vast majority of patients with a low complication rate.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To describe the prevalence of nursing diagnoses on admission among inpatient units and medical diagnoses and to analyse the relationship of nursing diagnoses to patient characteristics and hospital outcomes. Background Nursing diagnoses classify patients according to nursing dependency and can be a measure of nursing complexity. Knowledge regarding the prevalence of nursing diagnoses on admission and their relationship with hospital outcomes is lacking. Design Prospective observational study. Methods Data were collected for 6 months in 2014 in four inpatient units of an Italian hospital using a nursing information system and the hospital discharge register. Nursing diagnoses with prevalence higher or equal to 20% were considered as 'high frequency.' Nursing diagnoses with statistically significant relationships with either higher mortality or length of stay were considered as 'high risk.' The high-frequency/high-risk category of nursing diagnoses was identified. Results The sample included 2283 patients. A mean of 4·5 nursing diagnoses per patient was identified; this number showed a statistically significant difference among inpatient units and medical diagnoses. Six nursing diagnoses were classified as high frequency/high risk. Nursing diagnoses were not correlated with patient gender and age. A statistically significant perfect linear association (Spearman's correlation coefficient) was observed between the number of nursing diagnoses and both the length of stay and the mortality rate. Conclusion Nursing complexity, as described by nursing diagnoses, was shown to be associated with length of stay and mortality. These results should be confirmed after considering other variables through multivariate analyses. The concept of high-frequency/high-risk nursing diagnoses should be expanded in further studies.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To systematically review clinical outcomes associated with medication regimen complexity in older people. Design Systematic review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane library. Setting Hospitals, home, and long-term care. Participants English-language peer-reviewed original research published before June 2016 was eligible if regimen complexity was quantified using a metric that considered number of medications and at least one other parameter, regimen complexity was calculated for participants' overall regimen, at least 80% of participants were aged 60 and older, and the study investigated a clinical outcome associated with regimen complexity. Measurements Quality assessment was conducted using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Results Sixteen observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Regimen complexity was associated with medication nonadherence (2/6 studies) and higher rates of hospitalization (2/4 studies). One study found that participants with less-complex medication administration were more likely to stop medications when feeling worse. One study each identified an association between regimen complexity and higher ability to administer medications as directed, medication self-administration errors, caregiver medication administration hassles, hospital discharge to non-home settings, postdischarge potential adverse drug events, all-cause mortality, and lower patient knowledge of their medication. Regimen complexity had no association with postdischarge medication modification, change in medication- and health-related problems, emergency department visits, or quality of life as rated by nursing staff. Conclusion Research into whether medication regimen complexity is associated with nonadherence and hospitalization has produced inconsistent results. Moderate-quality evidence from four studies (two each for nonadherence and hospitalization) suggests that medication regimen complexity is associated with nonadherence and higher rates of hospitalization.</ab>

        <ab>Aim and objectives To investigate staff perception of the changing complexity of mothers and infants admitted to two residential parenting services in New South Wales in the decade from 2005-2015. Background For many mothers with a young child, parenting is difficult and stressful. If parenting occurs within the context of anxiety, mental illness or abuse it often becomes a high-risk situation for the primary caregiver. Residential parenting services provide early nursing intervention before parenting problems escalate and require physical or mental health focused care. Design A qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured interview questions was used as phase three of a larger study. Data were gathered from 35 child and family health nurses and ten physicians during eight focus groups. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) dealing with complexity; (2) changing practice; and (3) appropriate knowledge and skills to handle greater complexity. Conclusions There was a mix of participant opinions about the increasing complexity of the mothers presenting at residential parenting services during the past decade. Some of the nurses and physicians confirmed an increase in complexity of the mothers while several participants proposed that it was linked to their increased psychosocial assessment knowledge and skill. All participants recognised their work had grown in complexity regardless of their perception about the increased complexity of the mothers. Relevance to clinical practice Australian residential parenting services have a significant role in supporting mothers and their families who are experiencing parenting difficulties. It frequently provides early intervention that helps minimise later emotional and physical problems. Nurses are well placed to work with and support mothers with complex histories. Acknowledgement is required that this work is stressful and nurses need to be adequately supported and educated to manage the complex presentations of many families.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to explore nurses' experiences working on a chronic ventilator-dependent unit with a predominance of elderly Orthodox Jewish patients at the end of life. Little is known about how cultural complexity creates differences between nurses' and family's expectations for patient care at the end of life. A qualitative study of 27 nurses was conducted using focus groups. Early interviews led to the expansion of the original question to include exploring nurses' moral distress. Content analysis revealed 3 categories of themes, one of which is highlighted in this article. The main finding was an incongruence of perspectives, described as depth-of-field dissimilarity, in which the focus and depth of perspective depend on the person doing the looking. This study suggests that depth-of-field dissimilarity can be used to develop educational strategies, clinical interventions, and research to address moral distress and cultural complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Movement changes in autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias are suggested to occur many years before clinical manifestation. Detecting and quantifying these changes in the preclinical phase offers a window for future treatment interventions and allows the clinician to decipher the earliest dysfunctions starting the evolution of spinocerebellar ataxia. We hypothesized that quantitative movement analysis of complex stance and gait tasks allows to (i) reveal movement changes already at early stages of the preclinical phase when clinical ataxia signs are still absent and to (ii) quantify motor progression in this phase.Methods: A total of 46 participants (14 preclinical spinocerebellar ataxia mutation carriers [spinocerebellar ataxias 1,2,3,6], 9 spinocerebellar ataxia patients at an early stage; 23 healthy controls) were assessed by quantitative movement analyses of increasingly complex stance and walking tasks in a cross-sectional design.Results: Body sway in stance and spatiotemporal variability in tandem walking differentiated between preclinical mutation carriers and healthy controls (P &lt; .01). Complex movement conditions allowed one to discriminate even those mutation carriers without any clinical signs in posture and gait (SARAposture&amp;gait  = 0; P &lt; .04). Multivariate regression analysis categorized preclinical mutation carriers on a single-subject level with 100% accuracy within a range of 10 years to the estimated onset. Movement features in stance and gait correlated significantly with genetically estimated time to onset, indicating a gradual increase of motor changes with increasing proximity to disease manifestation.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for subclinical motor changes in spinocerebellar ataxia, which allow to discriminate patients without clinical signs even on a single-subject basis and may help capture disease progression in the preclinical phase. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between polypharmacy with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and medication regimen complexity with HRQoL in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Methods: A cross-sectional study of 383 residents from six Australian RACFs was conducted. The primary exposures were polypharmacy (≥9 regular medications) and the validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). The outcome measure was staff informant rated quality of life assessed using the Quality of Life Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) scale. Covariates included age, sex, Charlson's comorbidity index, activities of daily living, and dementia severity. Logistic quantile regression was used to characterize the association between polypharmacy and QoL-AD (model 1) and MRCI and QoL-AD (model 2). Results: The median age of the 383 residents was 88 years and 297 (78 %) residents were female. In total, 63 % of residents were exposed to polypharmacy and the median MRCI score (range) was 43.5 (4-113). After adjusting for the covariates, polypharmacy was not associated with either higher or lower QoL-AD scores (estimate −0.02; 95 % confidence interval (CI) −0.165, 0.124; p = 0.78). Similarly, after adjusting for the covariates, MRCI was not associated with either higher or lower QoL-AD scores (estimate −0.0009, 95 % CI −0.005, 0.003; p = 0.63). Conclusions: These findings suggest that polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity are not associated with staff informant rated HRQoL. Further research is needed to investigate how specific medication classes may impact change in quality of life over time.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To describe the nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions for patients admitted to intensive care units and to assess their possible relation with classical outcomes like length of stay and mortality. Background The analysis of nursing diagnosis frequencies may help to estimate the patients' complexity and the need for nursing interventions and can predict hospital outcomes. Nonetheless, few studies were conducted on critical patients. Design Prospective cohort observational study. Methods Between 15 July-31 October 2013 we collected the above-described nursing parameters of 100 subjects throughout their stay in intensive care. We classified the parameters according to established taxonomies. The independent association between the number of nursing diagnoses and length of stay/mortality was investigated with multiple regressions. Results We found an average of 19 diagnoses, 24 outcomes and 60 interventions per patient. Most frequently, the plans of care involved support for self-care deficits or interrupted family processes. They also included strategies to prevent infection, disuse syndrome and impairment of skin integrity. Nineteen nursing diagnoses were significantly related with mortality or length of stay in bivariate analyses. In regression models, the number of such diagnoses explained 29·7% of the variance in length of stay and was an independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion In critically ill patients, the analysis of nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions confirmed an intense activity in response to a broad spectrum of patient needs. The number of nursing diagnoses allowed to predict patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale, aims and objectives To assess the outcomes of a clinical decision support ( CDS) intervention designed for home care patients with high medication regimen complexity ( MRC) and to examine correlates of CDS use. Method The CDS consisted of a computerized algorithm that identified high MRC patients, electronic alerts and a care management module. Nurses were randomized upon identification of an eligible patient. Full intention to treat and intervention group-only analyses were completed. Regression-adjusted outcomes were hospitalization, emergency department use and reduction in MRC. Results Five hundred nurses were randomized with 7919 of their patients. Approximately 20% of the intervention group was hospitalized versus 21% in the control group; 16.5% versus 16.7% had an emergency department visit; and 6% in each group dropped below the high MRC threshold. No statistically significant differences were found in the intention to treat analysis. Eighty-two percent of intervention nurses used the CDS but for only 42% of their patients. Among intervention patients, CDS use (vs. non-use) was associated with reduced MRC and hospitalization. CDS use was associated with various clinician and patient characteristics. Conclusion CDS use was limited, negating the impact of the intervention overall. Findings on correlates of CDS use and the relationship between CDS use and positive outcomes suggest that CDS use and outcomes could be enhanced by avoiding short patient lengths of stay, improving continuity of care, increasing reliance on salaried nurses and/or increasing per diem nurses' incentives to use CDS.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale, aims and objectives Case management is commonly used to provide health care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. However, the most effective form of team organization and the necessary support structures need to be identified. In this respect, patients' views could provide a valuable contribution to improving the design of these services. To analyse the experiences of patients with chronic diseases and of caregivers, in relation to health care services and mechanisms, and to identify means of modelling case management services. Methods The method used was a qualitative study based on life stories, and semi-structured interviews with 18 patients with complex chronic diseases and with their family caregivers, selected by purposeful sampling in primary health care centres in Andalusia (southern Spain) from 2009 to 2011. Results Three transition points were clearly identified: the onset and initial adaptation, the beginning of quality-of-life changes, and the final stage, in which the patients' lives are governed by the complexity of their condition. Health care providers have a low level of proactivity with respect to undertaking early measures for health promotion and self-care education. Care is fragmented into a multitude of providers and services, with treatments aimed at specific problems. Conclusions Many potentially valuable interventions in case management, such as information provision, self-care education and coordination between services and providers, are still not provided.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The aim of the present study was translation, cultural adaption and validation of the extended version 12 of the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale (RCS-E) in a sample of patients with stroke and total hip replacement.Method: The cross-cultural validation required RCS-E forward–backward translation, revision by an expert committee and its application in an Intensive Rehabilitation setting through a retrospective collection of data from clinical records. The evaluation of the psychometric properties was carried out by analyzing the correlations between RCS-E score and other measures (Functional Independence Measure, Braden, Morse, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale) and the assessment of reliability in terms of reproducibility (inter-observer agreement) and repeatability (intra-observer agreement).Results: The backward and forward processes of translation of the scale did not create problems of interpretation of terms. Some adaptation was required for the items nursing (N), medical care (M) and therapeutic intensity (TI) due to differences on the national health system structure. The Italian version of the scale proved to be valid, reliable with high reproducibility and repeatability.Conclusions: The Italian version RCS-E has been successfully validated, showing good psychometric properties, which partly reproduce the results obtained for the original version. However, some assumption was made for some items thus preventing possible comparison with other countries.Implications for RehabilitationAdmittance at an Intensive Rehabilitation care setting in Italy requires to evaluate the complexity of rehabilitation needs.The Rehabilitation Complexity Scale (RCS-E) has proved to be reliable for assessing clinical complexity and consequently for planning rehabilitation needs.The Italian version of RCS-E has been successfully validated, showing good psychometric properties, which reproduce the results obtained for the original version.The items included in the therapy intensity subscale do not fit the Italian health system rules for intensity of rehabilitation care and needs adaptation.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to describe the problem-situations and their degree of complexity in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome. Method: a descriptive study with a qualitative approach, performed in a public hospital from interviews and document analysis on records. Data analysis consisted of distributions of frequencies, calculating the average and standard deviation statistics. Results: there were 26 problem-situations described, sent to experts nurses for analysis and classification of degrees of complexity. Higher Complexity Problem-situations were the most, in relation to the Medium and Lower Complexity. Conclusion: the problemsituations and degrees of complexity directed to the evident and not evident problems that involve the patient, which are not related only to the signs and symptoms of the disease, but with the environment, the family, nursing care to which they are submitted and nurse-patient interaction during hospitalization were identified.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Modern chemotherapy regimens are growing increasingly complex, involving lengthy outpatient infusions, and additional visits for supportive care. The treatment of advanced-stage patients is uniquely one of unremitting therapy and varying complexity. The study's purpose was to describe and quantify the dimensions of treatment complexity in terms of chemotherapy (CT) and supportive care (SC) visits.Methods: Electronic medical records for 121 subjects with stages III and IV cancer were reviewed. Visits were classified as SC and CT types, and actual hours and visit numbers were calculated for a 3-month treatment period. Analysis included descriptive and generalized linear modeling statistics.Results: Subjects ≥65 years spent fewer total hours (M = 18.17 h, SD = 10.17 h, p = 0.04), but experienced more total visits (M = 10.96 visits, SD = 4.65 visits, p = 0.02) than younger subjects. More than 71% of younger patients spent two or more hours per chemotherapy visit, compared to 41.7% of older patients (p = 0.001). Older subjects were more likely to have a SC visit (p = 0.03), but did not differ from younger subjects in SC visit numbers (p = 0.3) or hours (p = 0.6). Females averaged 3.81 more total hours (M = 22. 61 h, SD = 11.06 h, p = 0.055) and had more total visits (M = 10.80 visits, SD = 3.71, p = 0.02) than males. By visit type, women spent twice the hours undergoing SC than males (M = 3.3 vs. 1.5 h, p = 0.051), but genders did not differ in CT visit hours or average length. By diagnosis, colon/esophageal subjects spent more hours in CT visits (M = 21.90 h, SD = 8.60 h, p &lt; 0.01), and lung subjects trended toward spending more hours in SC visits (M = 4.80 h, SD = 8.23 h, p &lt; 0.06).Conclusions: Advanced-stage cancer patients differed in visit types, hours, and treatment length undergoing CT and SC visits. Age, gender, and diagnosis explained the differences, and this study adds new understanding to the phenomenon of treatment complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) have impaired movement due to a brain injury near birth. Understanding how neuromuscular control is altered in CP can provide insight into pathological movement. We sought to determine if individuals with CP demonstrate reduced complexity of neuromuscular control during gait compared with unimpaired individuals and if changes in control are related to functional ability.Method: Muscle synergies during gait were retrospectively analyzed for 633 individuals (age range 3.9-70y): 549 with CP (hemiplegia, n=122; diplegia, n=266; triplegia, n=73; quadriplegia, n=88) and 84 unimpaired individuals. Synergies were calculated using non-negative matrix factorization from surface electromyography collected during previous clinical gait analyses. Synergy complexity during gait was compared with diagnosis subtype, functional ability, and clinical examination measures.Result: Fewer synergies were required to describe muscle activity during gait in individuals with CP compared with unimpaired individuals. Changes in synergies were related to functional impairment and clinical examination measures including selective motor control, strength, and spasticity.Interpretation: Individuals with CP use a simplified control strategy during gait compared with unimpaired individuals. These results were similar to synergies during walking among adult stroke survivors, suggesting similar neuromuscular control strategies between these clinical populations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The INTERMED was developed for the early identification of biological, psychological, social and health system factors considered interacting in health complexity. This is defined as the interference with the achievement of expected or desired health and service use outcomes when patients are exposed to standard care.Objective: The aim of this study was to test the INTERMED's ability to identify 'case' and 'care' complexity, identifying patients that would especially benefit from integrated care.Methods: Observational longitudinal study of Internal medicine in patients in two National Health System hospitals in Spain using the INTERMED (patients scoring ≥ 21 were considered to be 'complex'); the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), a severity of illness assessment; and standard clinical variables.Results: Six hundred and fifteen consecutives were included, and the prevalence of health complexity was 27.6%. The greatest differences between patients with and without health complexity were observed in the non-biological domains. Eighty-five per cent of patients with health complexity had non-biological items considered to require timely (immediately or soon) assistance or intervention compared to 30% of those without, nearly a threefold difference. Complex patients had a significantly higher number of medical diagnoses (p = 0.002) and number of psychiatric referrals (p = 0.041), but there were no differences in CIRS scores or lengths of stay.Conclusion: The INTERMED has the potential to identify a considerable subset of complex internal medicine inpatients for which timely corrective action related to non-biological risk factors not typically uncovered during standard medical evaluations would be considered beneficial.</ab>

        <ab>Pain is common in older people and its assessment is an important part of the nurse's role. Asking people about their pain is considered the most accurate and reliable assessment because of the subjective nature of pain. A number of simple and easy-to-administer self-rating scales are available to measure pain intensity. To rate their pain, however, people need to understand the request, as well as recall and interpret the painful signal. Observing specific behaviours associated with pain is advocated when communication and cognitive function are impaired, for example, in people with advanced dementia. A number of pain assessment tools have been developed that involve observation of some or all of the behaviours. The aim of this article is to highlight the importance of pain assessment, discuss the various pain assessment scales and tools available and identify some of the factors that can make comprehensive assessment of pain in older people and those with cognitive impairment complex.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The complexity of a medication regimen is related to the multiple characteristics of the prescribed regimen and can negatively influence the health outcomes of patients. Objective: To propose cut-off points in the complexity of pharmacotherapy to distinguish between patients with low and high complexities seen in a primary health care (PHC) setting to enable prioritization of patient management. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, which included 517 adult and elderly patients, analyzing different cut-off points to define the strata of low and high pharmacotherapy complexities based on percentiles of the population evaluated. Data collection began with the solicitation of prescriptions, followed by a questionnaire that was administered by an interviewer. The complexity of a medication regimen was estimated from the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). High complexity pharmacotherapy scores were analyzed from patient profiles, the use of health services, and pharmacotherapy. The criteria for subject inclusion in the sample population were as follows: inhabitant of the area covered by the municipality, 18 years or older, and being prescribed at least one drug during the collection period. Exclusion criteria at the time of collection were the use of any medication whose prescription was not available. All medications were accessed through the Primary Healthcare Service (PHS). Results: The median total pharmacotherapy complexity score was 8.5. High MRCI scores were correlated with age, medications taken with in the Brazilian PHS, having at least one potential drug-related problem, receiving up to eight years of schooling, number of medications and polypharmacy (five or more medicines), number of medical conditions, number of medical appointments, and number of cardiovascular diseases and endocrine metabolic diseases. We suggest different complexity tracks according to age (e.g., adult or elderly) that consider the pharmacotherapy and population coverage characteristics as high complexity limits. For the elderly patients, the tracks were as follows: MRCI≥25.4, MRCI≥20.9, MRCI≥17.5, MRCI≥15.7, MRCI≥14.0, and MRCI≥13.0. For adult patients, the limits of high complexity were MRCI≥25.1; MRCI ≥ 23.8; MRCI≥21.0; MRCI≥17.0; MRCI≥16.5; and MRCI≥15.5. Conclusion: The medication regimen complexity is associated with the patient's illness profile and problems with the use of drugs; therefore, the proposed scores can be useful in prioritizing patients for clinical care by pharmacists and other health professionals.</ab>
        <ab>Antecedentes: La complejidad de un régimen de medicación se relaciona con las múltiples características del régimen prescrito que pueden influenciar negativamente los resultados en salud de los pacientes. Objetivo: Proponer puntos de corte en la complejidad de la farmacoterapia para diferenciar entre pacientes de baja y alta complejidad que permita la priorización de la gestión de los pacientes entre los atendidos en un centro de cuidados primarios. Métodos: Este es un estudio transversal que incluyó 517 adultos y ancianos analizando diferentes puntos de corte para definir los estratos de alta y baja complejidad de la farmacoterapia basándose en los percentiles de la población evaluada. La recogida de datos comenzó con la solicitud de las prescripciones, seguida de un cuestionario administrado por un entrevistador. La complejidad de la medicación se estimó mediante el Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). En las farmacoterapias de alta complejidad se analizó los perfiles de los pacientes, el uso de servicios de salud, y la farmacoterapia. Los criterios para la inclusión de la muestra fueron: habitantes del área cubierta por el municipio, 18 años o más, y tener prescrito al menos un medicamento durante el periodo de recogida de datos. Los criterios de exclusión durante la recogida de datos fue el uso de algún medicamento que no estaba disponible. Todos los medicamentos eran del Servicio de Cuidados Primarios (PHS). Resultados: La mediana total de puntuación de complejidad de la farmacoterapia fue de 8,5. Las puntuaciones altas del MRCI se correlacionaban con la edad, medicamentos tomados del PHS, tener al menos una interacción potencial medicamento-medicamento, tener más de 8 años de escolaridad, numero de medicamentos, polimedicación (cinco o más medicamentos), número de problemas de salud, número de visitas al médico, y numero de enfermedades cardiovasculares o metabólicas. Sugerimos diferentes tramos de complejidad de acuerdo a la edad (e.g. adultos o ancianos) que tienen en cuenta las características de la población y la farmacoterapia como límites de alta complejidad. Para los ancianos los tramos eran: MRCI≥25,4, MRCI≥20,9, MRCI≥17,5, MRCI≥15,7, MRCI≥14,0, y MRCI≥13,0. Para los pacientes adultos los límites de complejidad eran: MRCI≥25,1; MRCI ≥ 23,8; MRCI≥21,0; MRCI≥17,0; MRCI≥16,5; y MRCI≥15,5. Conclusión: La complejidad del régimen de medicación se asocia con el perfil de enfermedad del paciente y sus problemas de uso de medicamentos; por tanto, los limites propuestos pueden ser útiles para priorizar pacientes en cuidados clínicos de los farmacéuticos u otros profesionales de la salud.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: There is a lack of population-based research about factors associated with medication regimen complexity. This study investigated factors associated with medication regimen complexity in older people, and whether factors associated with regimen complexity were similar to factors associated with number of medications. Methods: This cross-sectional population-based study included 3348 people aged ≥60 years. Medication regimen complexity was computed using the validated 65-item Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Multinomial logistic regression was used to compute unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with regimen complexity. Multivariable quantile regression was used to compare factors associated with regimen complexity and number of medications. Results: In adjusted analyses, participants in the highest MRCI quintile (MRCI &gt; 20) were older (OR = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.02;1.05), less likely to live at home (OR = 0.35, 95 % CI 0.15;0.86), had greater comorbidities (OR = 2.17, 95 % CI 1.89;2.49), had higher cognitive status (OR = 1.06, 95 % CI 1.01;1.11), a higher prevalence of self-reported pain (OR = 2.85, 95 % CI 2.16;3.76), had impaired dexterity (OR = 2.39, 95 % CI 1.77;3.24) and were more likely to receive help to sort their medications (OR = 4.43 95 % CI 2.39;8.56) than those with low regimen complexity (MRCI &gt;0-5.5). Similar factors were associated with both regimen complexity and number of medications. Conclusion: Older people with probable difficulties managing complex regimens, including those with impaired dexterity and living in institutional settings, had the most complex medication regimens even after adjusting for receipt of help to sort medications. The strong correlation between regimen complexity and number of medications suggests that clinicians could use a person's number of medications to target interventions to reduce complexity.</ab>

        <ab>People diagnosed with a multiple long-term conditions and those with profound and multiple learning disabilities are the most intensive users of health and social care. In addition, around 30% of patients with long-term physical conditions also have a mental health problem. The close relationship between mental and physical health is reflected in the high frequency with which illnesses of both kinds overlap in an age of multi-morbidity. This study demonstrates that those with comorbid mental health problems show poorer clinical outcomes, lower quality of life and reduced ability to manage physical symptoms effectively. This also affects their capacity to engage in treatment and make decisions, which affects not only their care and treatment but ultimately their quality of life. The NHS Call to Action demanded improvement in the service provided to support the needs of people with long-term conditions. The scale of the impact of comorbid mental health problems on costs and outcomes suggests that developing services that respond more effectively to these needs should be a priority.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE To define the term complexity of care. BACKGROUND The aging population and lack of gerontological preparation in pre-licensure nursing programs are pressing issues. The NLN Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACE.S) project developed a framework to facilitate faculty and student understanding of older adults' care needs. Integral to the framework is the concept of complexity of care. METHOD Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS The analysis identified three antecedents (focus on treatment and cure of disease, multiple comorbidities, and life experiences and culture), five attributes (polypharmacy, use of advanced technologies, novel care models, a fragmented health care system, and the relational nature of caregiving), and two consequences (impact on quality of life and impact on quality of care). CONCLUSION Defining the concept of complexity of care will facilitate student understanding of the unique health care needs of older adults</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the biopsychosocial aspects and aspects of the health system of hospitalized elderly and to classify their degree of care complexity. Methods: This was a quantitative study whose convenience sample consisted of 279 elderly. The Interdisciplinary Medicine Instrument (INTERMED) method was used, a tool that identified biopsychosocial aspects and conditions of the health system and classified the complexity of the patient. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis. Results: The prevailing profile was of elderly women, retired, white, with low educational levels, married and satisfied with their life conditions. The mean age was 72.3 years. The biological domain was the most compromised. As for the complexity of care, 34.8% of the patients required multiprofessional care. Conclusion: The elderly had high care complexity, with the biological and health system domains being the most compromised.</ab>
        <ab>Objetivos: Conhecer os aspectos biopsicossociais e as condições do sistema de saúde de idosos hospitalizados e classificar o grau de complexidade assistencial. Métodos: Trata-se de estudo quantitativo, cuja amostra por conveniência foi constituída por 279 idosos. Utilizou-se o método Interdisciplinary Medicine Instrument (INTERMED), ferramenta que identifica aspectos biopsicossociais e condições do sistema de saúde e classifica a complexidade do paciente. Os dados foram submetidos à análise descritiva. Resultados: Predominou idosos do gênero feminino, aposentados, de cor branca, baixa escolaridade, casados e satisfeitos com as condições de saúde. A média de idade foi 72,3 anos. O domínio biológico foi o mais comprometido. Quanto à complexidade assistencial, 34,8 % dos pacientes requerem assistência multiprofissional. Conclusão: Os idosos apresentaram elevada complexidade assistencial, com maior comprometimento nos domínios biológico e sistema de saúde.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older people often take multiple medications. It is a policy priority to facilitate older people to stay at home longer. Three-quarters of nursing home placements in the US are preceded by a hospitalization. Objective: To investigate the association between polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity with hospital discharge destination among older people. Methods: This prospective cohort study comprised patients aged ≥70 years consecutively admitted to the Geriatric Evaluation and Management unit at a tertiary hospital in Adelaide, Australia, between October 2010 and December 2011. Medication regimen complexity at discharge was calculated using the 65-item validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for medication-related factors associated with discharge directly to home versus non-community settings (rehabilitation, transition care, and residential aged care). Results: From 163 eligible patients, 87 were discharged directly to home (mean age 84.6 years, standard deviation [SD] 6.9; mean MRCI 26.1, SD 9.7), while 76 were discharged to non-community settings (mean age 85.8 years, SD 5.8; mean MRCI 29.9, SD 13.2). After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and activities of daily living, having a high medication regimen complexity (MRCI &gt;35) was inversely associated with discharge directly to home (RR 0.39; 95 % CI 0.20-0.73), whereas polypharmacy (≥9 medications) was not significantly associated with discharge directly to home (RR 0.97; 95 % CI 0.53-1.58). Conclusion: Having high medication regimen complexity was inversely associated with discharge directly to home, while polypharmacy was not associated with discharge destination.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Complex medication regimens may adversely affect compliance and treatment outcomes. Complexity can be assessed with the medication regimen complexity index (MRCI), which has proved to be a valid, reliable tool, with potential uses in both practice and research.Objective: To use the MRCI to assess medication regimen complexity in institutionalized elderly people.Setting: Five nursing homes in mainland Portugal.Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study of institutionalized elderly people (n = 415) was performed from March to June 2009, including all inpatients aged 65 and over taking at least one medication per day.Main Outcome Measure: Medication regimen complexity index.Results: The mean age of the sample was 83.9 years (±6.6 years), and 60.2 % were women. The elderly patients were taking a large number of drugs, with 76.6 % taking more than five medications per day. The average medication regimen complexity was 18.2 (±SD = 9.6), and was higher in the females (p &lt; 0.001). The most decisive factors contributing to the complexity were the number of drugs and dosage frequency. In regimens with the same number of medications, schedule was the most relevant factor in the final score (r = 0.922), followed by pharmaceutical forms (r = 0.768) and additional instructions (r = 0.742).Conclusion: Medication regimen complexity proved to be high. There is certainly potential for the pharmacist's intervention to reduce it as part as the medication review routine in all the patients.</ab>

        <ab>The use of complex syntax in the spoken discourse of young, middle-aged, and older adults was examined. The purpose of the study was to determine if syntactic complexity would show an age-related decline. Language samples were elicited from healthy adults in their 20 s, 40 s, and 60 s ( n = 20 per group) using a conversational (CON) task and a peer conflict resolution (PCT) task. Each sample was transcribed, segmented into utterances, and coded for main clauses and all types of finite and non-finite subordinate clauses. The results indicated that all groups produced greater syntactic complexity during the PCR task than the CON task as measured by mean length of utterance, clausal density, and the use of left-branching clauses. Additionally, the groups did not differ on any syntactic measures for either task. It is concluded that syntactic complexity in spoken discourse remains stable during the years that span early, middle, and later adulthood.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare online effects of syntactic complexity in written and spoken sentence comprehension in people with aphasia (PWA) and adults with no brain damage (NBD). Method: The participants in Experiment 1 were NBD older and younger adults (n = 20 per group). The participants in Experiment 2 were 10 PWA. In both experiments, the participants read and listened to sentences in self-paced reading and listening tasks. The experimental materials consisted of object cleft sentences (e.g., It was the girl who the boy hugged.) and subject cleft sentences (e.g., It was the boy who hugged the girl.). Results: The predicted effects of syntactic complexity were observed in both Experiments 1 and 2: Reading and listening times were longer for the verb in sentences with object compared to subject relative clauses. The NBD controls showed exaggerated effects of syntactic complexity in reading compared to listening. The PWA did not show different modality effects from the NBD participants. Conclusion: Although effects of syntactic complexity were somewhat exaggerated in reading compared with listening, both the PWA and the NBD controls showed similar effects in both modalities.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To compare the efficacy of chronic heart failure management programmes ( CHF- MPs) according to a scoring algorithm used to quantify the level of applied interventions-the Heart Failure Intervention Score ( HF- IS). Background The overall efficacy of heart failure programmes has been proven in several meta-analyses. However, the debate continues as to which components are essential in a heart failure programme to improve patient outcomes. Design Prospective cohort study of patients participating in heart failure programmes. Method Forty-eight of 62 (77%) programmes in Australia participating in a national register of CHF- MPs were evaluated using the HF- IS: derived from a summed and weighted score of each intervention applied by the CHF- MP (27 interventions overall). The CHF- MPs were prospectively categorised as relatively low ( HF- IS &lt; 190 - n = 39 programmes &amp; 407 patients) or high ( HF- IS ≥ 190 - n = 9 programmes &amp; 166 patients) in complexity. Six-month morbidity and mortality rates in 573 consecutively recruited patients with systolic dysfunction and in New York Heart Association Class II- IV were prospectively examined. Results Patients exposed to CHF- MPs with a high HF- IS had a lower rate of unplanned, all-cause hospitalisation ( n = 24, 14% vs. n = 102, 25%) compared with CHF- MPs with a low HF- IS within six months. On an adjusted basis, CHF- MPs with a high HF- IS were associated with a reduced risk of unplanned hospitalisation and/or death within six months and remained event-free longer. Conclusion High complexity CHF- MPs applying more evidence-based interventions are associated with a higher event-free survival over six months. Relevance to clinical practice The HF- IS is an easy-to-use evidence-based tool to assist programme coordinators to improve the quality of their heart failure programme which may also improve patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The purpose of this evidence-based management practice project was to analyse dimensions of the Getting my Work Done issue, the only one of seven issues of highest concern for which 907 nurse interviewees were unable to identify effective strategies, formulate a 'best management practice', integrate the practice into clinical settings and evaluate results. Method/process The evidence-based management practice process was used to identify the major impediment to Getting Work Done-assignment to multiple patients with simultaneous complex needs. Best management practice consisted of class presentation of a clinical-management problem scenario to 144 residents in nine Magnet hospitals, a private action commitment, class discussion and terminal action commitments. Results Responses indicated that this 'best management practice' was effective in helping newly licensed registered nurses manage and handle multiple patients with simultaneous complex needs. A major avenue of resolution was perception of professional practice responsibilities as a series of complex, interrelated, adaptive systems. Conclusions/implications for nursing management Perception and use of the principles of complexity science assists newly licensed registered nurses in mastering management dilemmas that inhibit professional practice. In many participating hospitals, plans are underway to expand this best practice to include input and perception exchange among experienced nurses, managers and physicians.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: A hospital stay is often accompanied by changes in medication therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a transfer across the interfaces on the complexity of therapeutic regimens and patient adherence as well as the attitudes of patients and general practitioners (GPs) towards pharmacotherapies. Methods: This was a prospective observational study that analysed the complexity of medication therapies and the adherence and attitudes of internal medicine and urology patients towards their medication(s) at three time points (hospital admission, discharge and 6 weeks after discharge). GPs of the patients recruited to the study were questioned about the follow-up medication therapy and their opinion on the medication prescribed in hospital. Results: At the time of hospital admission, 60.2 % of the study population were nonadherent. During hospitalization, the number decreased to 37.6 %, but increased to 61.2 % 6 weeks after discharge. Changes in the overall complexity of the therapy regimens were marginal and not statistically significant. Of the long-term medication regimens, 48.6 % were modified during hospital stay. The patients preferred regimens with a minimum of drug administrations. GPs stated to be willing to continue hospital prescriptions but were restricted by financial budgets. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that an increase in adherence during a hospital stay is only transient, underlining the need for interventions to ameliorate medication adherence. They also suggest that patients prefer simple regimens. Although GPs are willing to consider their patient's preferences on pharmacotherapy, they state limitations due to financial budgets. Further studies are needed that investigate the extent to which medication therapies can be simplified and the effect of simplification on adherence.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of the present article was to explore how old athletes relate to their bodies and health in the process of growing old. The findings suggest that the old male athletes controlled their bodies in order to gain physical capital, but that different ways of employing the body were valued in the contexts of aging, athletics and masculinity. On the whole the men displayed a contradictious way of relating to their bodies and health. However, they could to some extent reconcile the tensions between the different norms of body and health by emphasizing the need to preserve physical autonomy, an ideal that appeared to be valid in all three contexts.</ab>

        <ab>What is known and Objective: Older hospital inpatients are often prescribed complex multi-drug regimens; increased regimen complexity is associated with poorer medication adherence and treatment outcomes. There has been little research into methods for reducing regimen complexity. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of incorporating medication regimen simplification into routine clinical pharmacist care for older hospital inpatients and identify barriers to regimen simplification at a major teaching hospital. Methods: Following an educational intervention, clinical pharmacists were encouraged to minimize regimen complexity for their patients by identifying potential simplifications during routine medication regimen reviews (e.g. medication chart reviews, discharge prescription reviews) and discussing these changes with hospital doctors and patients. Pharmacists completed a data collection form for patients aged 60 years or above discharged from their wards during the study period ( n = 205; mean age, 81·3 years), indicating whether they had reviewed the patient's medication regimen complexity (and if not why), whether any changes to simplify the regimen were identified, and whether changes were successfully implemented (and if not why). Results and Discussion: Pharmacists reviewed medication regimen complexity for 173/205 (84·4%) patients and identified 149 potential changes to reduce regimen complexity for 79/173 (45·7%) reviewed patients. Ninety-four (63·1%) changes were successfully implemented in 54/205 (26·3%) patients. Regimens were simplified more often for patients discharged from subacute aged care (geriatric assessment and rehabilitation) wards compared with acute general medicine wards. The most commonly cited reason for not reviewing regimen complexity and not implementing identified simplification-related changes was 'lack of time'. Non-acceptance of pharmacist recommendations by patients or doctors were other common reasons for not implementing changes. What is new and Conclusion: This is the first study to explore pharmacist-led medication regimen simplification and barriers to regimen simplification in the hospital setting. It demonstrates that simplification of older inpatients' regimens is feasible when training in regimen simplification is provided. The main barrier to regimen simplification appears to be lack of pharmacist time.</ab>

        <ab>Care transitions, defined as hospital discharge or movement from one health care setting to another, are currently a major concern of health care providers and policy makers. Extensive empirical research has been conducted on care transitions, but the theoretical foundations are rarely made explicit. We propose that integrating concepts on complex adaptive systems from complexity science with classic theory on transitions in nursing provides a powerful new lens through which to study care transitions and improve transition outcomes. We summarize concepts from both theoretical approaches, propose an expanded model of transitions, and apply the model to the transition from hospital to home.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between cutaneous vasodilatory function and nonlinear complexity of blood flow oscillations (BFO) in older people. A non-painful fast local heating protocol was applied to the sacral skin in 20 older subjects with various vasodilatory functions. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure skin blood oscillations. The complexity of the characteristic frequencies (i.e., metabolic (0.0095-0.02 Hz), neurogenic (0.02-0.05 Hz), myogenic (0.05-0.15 Hz), respiratory (0.15-0.4 Hz), and cardiac (0.4-2 Hz)) of BFO was quantified using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. Compared with the 65-75 years group, the complexity of metabolic BFO in the 75-85 years group was significantly lower at the baseline (P &lt; 0.05) and the second peak (P &lt; 0.001). Compared with baseline BFO, subjects in the 65-75 years group had a significant increase in the complexity of metabolic BFO (P &lt; 0.01) in response to local heating; while subjects in the 75-85 years group did not. Our findings support the use of multifractal analysis to assess aging-related microvascular dysfunction.</ab>

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>
