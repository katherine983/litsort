        <ab>• We report the "hidden" characteristics that influence geriatric model implementation. • Leadership, planning, and champions are associated with successful implementation. • Staff turnover, lack of resources, and competing demands are implementation barriers. • Reported contextual and organizational attributes may guide future implementers. • Findings highlight complexities of geriatric model uptake, adaptation, and sustainability. Systems Addressing Frail Elders (SAFETM) Care is a geriatric model of care that identifies high-risk hospitalized older adults, and provides targeted interprofessional interventions for risk factors associated with frailty. This post, mixed methods study sought to evaluate SAFETM Care implementation retrospectively at one public academic medical center and describe practical "real-world" considerations for implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). In addition to barriers and facilitators, hidden characteristics to consider for implementation include initiating conditions, skills and experiences of implementers, interpersonal challenges, unique facilitators and barriers, surprising conditions, and threats to and requirements for sustainability. Implementation of SAFETM Care demonstrated effective adoption and implementation, but faced multiple threats that led to failed sustainability. The public sharing of these successes and failures will help implementers understand and make progress in adapting such important geriatric programs and quality improvement initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Why you should read this article: • To gain insight into the complexity of NHS continuing healthcare (CHC) assessments • To reflect on what skills and knowledge are required for the optimal assessment of an older person's eligibility for CHC • To understand the training and development needs of nurses involved in CHC-associated work Background: Nurses in England play a prominent role in NHS continuing healthcare (CHC) assessments, but there are no overview data on their knowledge and educational needs. Aim: An online survey was conducted to identify the educational status and development needs of nurses involved in CHC assessments. Method: The survey was informed by a literature review and focus group discussions, and distributed via email to the members of the Royal College of Nursing older people's forum. Descriptive data analysis was undertaken. Results: Overall, respondents were confident about their ability to undertake CHC-associated work and manage each aspect of the CHC process. However, respondents were less confident about how to determine whether a primary health need exists based on the four main criteria – nature, complexity, intensity and unpredictability – of a person's health and social care needs. This was one of the respondents' priorities for training and development. Conclusion: The survey demonstrates the importance of face-to-face and multidisciplinary CHC training delivered locally. It also confirms the need for a standardised approach and more consistency in the CHC assessment process. A CHC competency framework would contribute to standardise the process and benefit all involved.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To explore 'missed care' in relation to primary and community settings, including nursing homes, and to build an understanding of implications for patients, public, politicians and policymakers. Background: Missed care occurs when any aspect of required patient care is omitted or delayed. Little attention has examined missed care in primary, community and nursing home settings. Methods: Systematic review of the literature. Searches were conducted of PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar (July 2018). The quality of empirical studies was appraised using CASP and SURE tools. Results: The search identified 15 metrics papers (2004–2019) and eight empirical papers (2015–2018) (five studies). Empirical studies were rated as good quality. Missed care impacts on safety in community/primary care contexts and differs from acute care. Causes of missed care include acuity, complexity of cases, volume of care and organisational factors. Metrics have been adapted to community/nursing home settings but not in a standardised way. Tools are required to evaluate missed care within a culture of personal reflection and quality improvement. Conclusion: The prominence of missed acute care should not distract from its impact in primary, community and nursing home settings. Nurse leaders should consider causes for missed care, and how it is conceptualized and evaluated. Implications for Nursing Management: This review offers evidence for exploring, measuring and evaluating missed care locally.</ab>

        <ab>Despite efforts to incorporate information about older people in pre-licensure nursing programs, there are inconsistent results from studies examining student nurses' perceptions towards the aging population. There is research suggesting that healthcare settings and nursing practice is perpetuating negative perspectives towards older people. To gain an understanding of how social contexts are influencing student nurses' experiences when learning to work with older people. Descriptive case study guided by the theoretical framework of social learning theory. A university in Western Canada that offers a pre-licensure nursing program. 28 student nurses and 13 faculty in the nursing program. Participant interviews and focus groups were conducted with nursing faculty and students. Key findings from this study are that students' previous experiences with older people, through family or work experiences, and their first clinical experience in long- term care negatively influenced their perceptions about working with older people. Clinical nurses and faculty influenced students' perceptions about nursing practice with older people, sometimes in subtle ways, underscoring that students are learning from what they see and hear in practice. Students were ill-prepared for the complexity of the aging population, particularly those with cognitive impairment. Learning activities that engage students in active learning, such as simulation, providing students with a positive lexicon of how to describe older patients, and more overt attention to the perspectives students and faculty bring to the learning environment need to be carefully explored. Meaningful learning experiences with older people in multiple contexts are needed to thoughtfully plan how to disrupt negative perceptions that might emerge through the nursing education program.</ab>

        <ab>Pragmatic trials occur within the complexity of real-world care delivery, and when effective, contribute to more rapid translation into practice because of their greater generalizability. Research with older adults is complex when participants have chronic conditions and multiple comorbidities. Often pragmatic trials introduce a novel intervention and try to determine whether it offers a benefit beyond the usual or routine care provided.

        <ab>Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, p =.048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p =.016). A significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p =.002), and a significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p =.040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current practice model.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To explore nurse and nursing assistant reflections on the care of older patients with cognitive impairment who have experienced a fall. Background: While there are evidence‐based clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of falls and for the care of older people with cognitive impairment, the falls rates for older people with cognitive impairment are three times as high as those without. Design: Critical incident technique. Methods: Eleven registered and two enrolled nurses and four assistants in nursing working in one subacute and two acute wards within two hospitals of a tertiary level health service in south‐east Queensland. Individual semistructured interviews focused on two past events when a patient with cognitive impairment had fallen in hospital: one when there was minimal harm and the second when there was significant harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken. The COREQ checklist was followed. Results: Three themes emerged from 23 reflective accounts of fall events: "direct observation is confounded by multiple observers" and "knowing the person has cognitive impairment is not enough," and "want to rely on the guideline but unsure how to enact it." While participants were aware of the falls prevention policy and techniques available to prevent falls, the implementation of these was challenging due to the complexity of care required by the older person with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Falls prevention for older people with cognitive impairment is complex and belies the simple application of policy. Relevance to clinical practice: To reduce falls, nurses can involve the family to support "knowing the patient" to enable prediction of impulsive actions; shift the focus of in‐service from lectures to specific case presentations, with collaborative analysis on person‐focused strategies to prevent falls in older people with cognitive impairment; and reconsider the sitter role from simple observer to assistant, focused on ambulation and supporting independence in activities of daily living.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Healthy ageing is a multi-dimensional concept which appertains to all older adults. This study reviewed the intervention characteristics, intervention content and effectiveness of multi-dimensional healthy ageing interventions (MHAIs) addressing physical, mental and social health among independent community-dwelling older adults. A search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO for studies published from Jan 2007 to October 2016. 18 publications were included, accounting for 15 studies. The review reflected the complexity, variations and methodological considerations of developing a comprehensive MHAI. It demonstrated the possibility of integrating person-focused to environment-focused content topics in future MHAIs, beyond the physical, mental and social health dimensions. Among the reviewed studies, health education programs reported improvements in quality of life and life satisfaction while health assessment and education programs promoted positive health behaviors. Future MHAIs studies need to employ more robust research methods and greater contextual information reports to build stronger evidence base.</ab>

        <ab>Current international research suggests universities providing nursing education should focus on shifting students' attitudes towards valuing clinical learning derived from aged care settings, offering support and education for aged care facility staff supervising nursing students’ learning in the aged care setting, and encouraging nursing graduates to consider pursuing careers in gerontology nursing. Against this international backdrop, one Australian School of Nursing designed a structured clinical learning experience to offer final year nursing students an opportunity to further their knowledge and understanding of the complexities of the role of the gerontology registered nurse. Additionally, this clinical learning experience included provision for nursing academics to offer support and expertise to the aged care facility staff around the role of supervising and assessing final year nursing students’ clinical learning. The aim of this paper is to present fifteen final year nursing students' and nine registered nurse supervisors’ evaluations of the gerontology clinical learning experience and the success of the learning experience towards meeting the project aims. Mostly participants reported positive experiences and agreed the experience illuminated the role of the gerontology registered nurse. Participants in this study also provided suggestions about the benefits and barriers of the clinical learning experience.</ab>

        <ab>Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Caring for people with dementia and responsive behaviours is challenging; however, little is known of nurses' experiences of responsive behaviours., What does this paper add to existing knowledge? To demonstrate understanding nurses need to be aware of their own actions, thoughts, attitudes and reactions., Time, education and management support are essential in enabling a person-centred approach., A decision regarding the place of care is difficult to come to, and given the drive to a person-centred approach, there is a need to consider the views of people with dementia., What are the implications for practice? Nursing staff supporting people with dementia should engage more frequently in reflective practice, ongoing education and decision-making., Service providers/managers need to have an understanding of the complexities of caring for a person with dementia and responsive behaviours and provide their staff with relevant supports and education that is accessible to all staff., Abstract Introduction Caring for people with dementia and responsive behaviours can challenge nurses, and little is known of their experiences. Aims To explore nurses' views of supporting people with dementia and responsive behaviours in long-stay facilities. Methods A qualitative descriptive study utilizing in-depth audio-recorded interviews of nine nurses, recruited from private and public care facilities. Qualitative content analyses conducted involving iterative comparisons of transcripts, summaries and memos, where coding, key quotes and tables were developed to determine themes. Results Four themes emerged: recognizing and understanding responsive behaviour, resources and interventions to support people with dementia and responsive behaviour, the impact of education on nursing practice and the care environment. Discussion Availability of staff, adequate time and financial restraints hinder nurses' ability to provide care. Access to ongoing education and being able to provide one-to-one care was valued as dementia-specific education changed nursing practice. Implications for practice Place of care was seen as dependent on the type of responsive behaviour in question, the duration of the behaviour and the impact of the behaviour on the person, other residents and staff. Dementia education needs to be accessible to all staff, and a collaborative approach is necessary in order to develop management guidelines and support strategies.</ab>

        <ab>Evidence suggests that delivery of good nursing care in long-term care (LTC) facilities is reflected in nurses' descriptions of the factors and structures that affect their work. Understanding the contemporary nature of nursing work in aged care will influence policies for improving current work structures in this practice setting. The current review aims to present a contemporary perspective of RNs' work in LTC facilities. A comprehensive search and purposeful selection of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Nine studies were eligible for review. Common themes revealed that nursing work in aged care settings is characterized by RNs providing indirect care tasks--primarily care coordination, engaging in non-nursing activities, and having an expanded and overlapping role. As care providers, aged care RNs do not always provide direct care as part of their nursing work. The scope of RN work beyond its clinical nature or performance of non-nursing tasks adds complexity in clarifying RN work roles in aged care.</ab>

        <ab>Transitioning to long-term care environments presents a significant challenge for new nurses and their directors of nursing. The complexity of this environment, instability of the workforce, and the lack of support structures frequently affect a new nurse's decision not to apply to long-term care, but to look for positions in acute care hospitals. To address these issues, a long-term care new nurse residency program was developed, implemented, and evaluated in New Jersey through the work of the New Jersey Action Coalition. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the residency program on new nurses' confidence, competence, retention, job satisfaction, and perceptions of organizational safety.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To explore the meaning of home among older Hispanic immigrants who are 'aging out of place.' Background Emerging evidence supports the concept of older persons ageing in place. Nurse researchers have demonstrated that older person who age in place have better physical, psychological and cognitive outcomes. Less, however, is known about older persons who are 'aging out of place,' meaning out of their country of origin. With the growth of home health care, there is a need to understand the older immigrants' meaning of home when ageing out of their country of origin. Design and Method An inductive, qualitative descriptive research design was used. Seventeen Hispanic participants, ranging in age from 65 to 83 years were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol. Findings Two major finding of the study focused on participants' descriptions of home in their country of origin and in the USA. The majority of participants described their home in their native country as the community, countryside or town (pueblo) and in the U.S.A. as family. The level of social isolation and loneliness among participants was evident. Conclusions Older Hispanic immigrants who are 'aging out of place' integrate their past experiences of sense of place in their native country with their present experiences of home in the USA. The need to understand the role of the community and the family in the provision of nursing care in the home may be more important than the physical structure or setting in which it is delivered. Further intra- and cross-national studies are needed to provide a framework for understanding the issues of ageing and immigration globally. Implications for Practice Gerontological nurses need to recognise the complexity of family relationships for older Hispanic persons who are ageing out of place of origin and their risk of depression, social isolation, and loneliness.</ab>

        <ab>In 2012 an innovative graduate nurse program was implemented within the Australian aged care context. This program ran for two consecutive years in 2012 and 2013. This descriptive paper outlines a case study of the development and implementation of a Graduate Nurse Program focusing on advancing the specialty-nursing workforce in aged care. The disciplines of Gerontology and Geriatrics are relatively new but remain underrepresented in nursing curriculum and are frequently not valued in practice. The aim of the program itself was to allow graduate nurses to gain the knowledge and skills for competence to practice within the aged care environment. The complexities of this practice extended beyond the usual bedside nursing of most graduate programs within acute healthcare settings. Aged care graduates were required to also develop management and team leadership skills. This program, though developed for the Australian context, has relevance internationally with the growth of the ageing population and the concomitant increasing healthcare needs. The program and curriculum was developed closely with a steering committee composed of industry representatives and the academic education provider and used innovative pedagogies. The development of key areas of the curriculum and the underlying philosophy of the program are described. The practice changes to the aged care workplaces with the introduction of infrastructures to support the graduates are also discussed. With the international growth in the aged care population, education programs like this Graduate Program will be pivotal in the development of an appropriately trained and sustainable nursing workforce within aged care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Healthcare organisations are facing large demands in recruiting employees with adequate competency to care for the increasing numbers of elderly. High degrees of turnover and dissatisfaction with working conditions are common. The gendered notion of care work as 'women's work', in combination with low salaries and status, may contribute to negative work experiences. There is abundant information about the negative aspects of elderly care health services, but little is known about positive aspects of this work. The study aim was to investigate work satisfaction from a gender perspective among Swedish registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, focusing specifically on healthcare services for the elderly.Methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted in which we combined statistics and open-ended responses from a national survey with qualitative research interviews with healthcare professionals in elderly care organisations. The survey was administered to a random sample of 1578 registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. Qualitative interviews with 17 professionals were conducted in six elderly care facilities. Qualitative and quantitative content analyses, chi2 and constructivist grounded theory were used to analyse the data.Results: There was a statistically significant difference in overall work satisfaction between those who worked in elderly care and those who did not (64 and 74,4% respectively, p &lt;0.001). Nine themes were derived from open-ended responses in the questionnaire. The qualitative interviews revealed four prominent storylines: 'Team social cohesion', 'Career development and autonomy', 'Client-centeredness', and 'Invisible and ignored power structures'.Conclusions: The results show the complexity of elderly care work and describe several aspects that are important for work satisfaction among health professionals. The results reveal that work satisfaction is dependent on social interrelations and cohesion in the work team, in possibilities to use humour and to have fun together, and in the ability to work as professionals to provide client-centered elderly care. Power relations such as gendered hierarchies were less visible or even ignored aspects of work satisfaction. The storylines are clearly linked to the two central discourses of professionalism and gender equality.</ab>

        <ab>As life expectancy increases so people often develop a range of conditions and disabilities in the years before death. Multimorbidity represents the most common 'disease pattern' found among the elderly and is characterised by complex interactions of co-existing diseases where a medical approach focused on a single disease does not suffice. People with dementia who also have other comorbidities do not always have their comorbid conditions managed as those without dementia which often lead to a high number of hospital admissions with longer lengths of stay and greater treatment costs. This case study presents the case management approach taken by Admiral Nursing in managing the complexities where there is comorbidity of a long-term condition and a diagnosis of dementia. By empowering the person and their carer with information and choices and through good case management and communication, people can be supported to live well and avoid inappropriate hospital admissions.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives The focus of this study is to explore how nursing staff experience safety promotion and fall prevention in residential care settings for older adults. The article calls for attentiveness to fall prevention within a broader lifeworld context of well-being and health promotion. Background There is limited research on fall prevention and safety promotion where the lifeworld and well-being provide a direction for care. Design This interview study has a hermeneutic phenomenological design. Methods Fourteen interviews with nursing staff were carried out. The ethics of care and vulnerability within a lifeworld approach provide the theoretical framework and guide the interpretive process. Results The findings can indicate that there is a generalised understanding of the needs of older persons in residential care. The focus of the staff was more on protection and prevention than safety promotion and well-being. Conclusion Risk prevention is not enough. The residents need protection against falls but they also need to be protected from situations that can be detrimental to their well-being and compromise their dignity. Acknowledging the complexities of safety promotion amongst older persons living in assisted care settings can prevent fall accidents and ensure attentiveness to a more fundamental sense of security that can promote the older person's well-being and health. Relevance to clinical practice This study is relevant to clinical nursing practice as it shows that risk management in fall prevention is not enough. The findings show the need for educated nursing home staff that can incorporate contemplative and scientific knowledge into injury prevention practice.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To classify and identify the main characteristics of the tools used in practice to assess the impact of elderly caregiving on the informal carers' life.Methods: A systematic review of literature was performed searching in Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, IBECS, LILACS, SiiS, SSCI and Cochrane Library from 2009 to 2013 in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, and in reference lists of included papers.Results: The review included 79 studies, among them several in languages other than English. Their inclusion increased the variety of identified tools to measure this impact (n = 93) and allowed a wider analysis of their geographical use. While confirming their overlapping nature, instruments were classified according to the degree of integration of dimensions they evaluated and their specificity to the caregiving process: caregiver burden (n = 20), quality of life and well-being (n = 11), management and coping (n = 21), emotional and mental health (n = 29), psychosocial impact (n = 10), physical health and healthy habits (n = 2), and other measures. A high use in practice of tools not validated yet and not caregiver-specific was identified.Conclusions: The great variety and characteristics of instruments identified in this review confirm the complexity and multidimensionality of the effects of elderly caregiving on the informal carer's life and explain the difficulties to assess these effects in practice. According to the classification provided, caregiver burden and emotional and mental health are the most evaluated dimensions. However, further work is required to develop integrated and caregiving focused procedures that can appraise this complexity across different countries and cultures.</ab>

        <ab>Background. The increased incidence of health challenges with aging means that nurses are increasingly caring for older adults, often in hospital settings. Research about the complexity of nursing practice with this population remains limited. Objective. To seek an explanation of nursing practice with hospitalised older adults. Methods. Design. A grounded theory study guided by symbolic interactionism was used to explore nursing practice with hospitalised older adults from a nursing perspective. Glaserian grounded theory methods were used to develop a mid-range theory after analysis of 375 hours of participant observation, 35 interviews with 24 participants and review of selected documents. Results. The theory of orchestrating care was developed to explain how nurses are continuously trying to manage their work environments by understanding the status of the patients, their unit, mobilising the assistance of others and stretching available resources to resolve their problem of providing their older patients with what they perceived as 'good care' while sustaining themselves as 'good' nurses. They described their practice environments as hard and under-resourced. Orchestrating care is comprised of two subprocesses: building synergy and minimising strain. These two processes both facilitated and constrained each other and nurses' abilities to orchestrate care. Conclusions. Although system issues presented serious constraints to nursing practice, the ways in which nurses were making meaning of their work environment both aided them in managing their challenges and constrained their agency. Implications for practice. Nurses need to be encouraged to share their important perspective about older adult care. Administrators have a role to play in giving nurses voice in workplace committees and in forums. Further research is needed to better understand how multidisciplinary teams influence care of hospitalized older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mid ‐  to late ‐ stage dementia is often characterized by behavioural and psychological symptoms, including, but not limited to physical and verbal aggression. Introduction: Although there is a considerable research about the prevalence, aetiology, and management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, there is limited research about the experience of caring for people with such symptoms in long ‐ term aged care facilities. Aim: The aims of the study were to describe: (i) nurses' experiences of caring for people with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in long ‐ term aged care facilities, and (ii) strategies nurses used to deal with these symptoms. Methods: A qualitative exploratory and descriptive design, involving focus group interviews with 30 nurses from three long ‐ term aged care units in Australia. The transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results: The findings revealed five interrelated themes: (i) working under difficult conditions, (ii) behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: an everyday encounter, (iii) making sense of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, (iv) attempting to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and (v) feeling undervalued. Conclusion: This study highlighted the difficult conditions under which nurses worked and the complexity of caring for individuals who have behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Implications for nursing and health policy: Organizational efforts to enhance the quality of care for individuals with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in long ‐ term aged care facilities should extend beyond staff education to heed nurses' concerns about organizational barriers to interpersonal care.</ab>

        <ab>The aim is to describe nursing home nurses' perceptions around emergency transfers to hospital. Transfers are costly and traumatic for residents, and efforts are underway to avoid hospitalization. Nurses play a key role in transfers, yet their views are underreported. A systematic review of qualitative studies was undertaken, guided by Joanna Briggs Institute methods. From seven reviewed studies, it was clear nursing home nurses are challenged by the complexity of the transfer process and understand their need for appropriate clinical knowledge, skills and resources. Communication is important, yet nurses often use persuasive and targeted communication. Ambiguity, strained relationships and negative perceptions of residents' experiences around hospitalization contribute to conflict and uncertainty. Nurses are more confident when there is a plan. Transferring a resident is a complex process and special skills, knowledge and resources are required, but may be lacking. Efforts to formalize the transfer process and improve communication and collaboration amongst all stakeholders is needed and would be well received.</ab>

        <ab>In view of the likelihood that the complexity of care required by those admitted to nursing homes will continue to increase, an expert consensus study was conducted to reach consensus on the competencies which distinguish baccalaureate-educated registered nurses from other nursing staff working in nursing homes. Thirty-one international experts, identified through literature and our professional network, participated in a two-round web-based survey and an expert meeting. Experts reached consensus on 16 desirable competencies, including some not traditionally associated with nursing expertise e.g. being a team leader, role model and coach within the nursing team. These findings suggest that revision of current nursing curricula, nurse training programs and nursing home job profiles might be needed to meet the medically and psychologically complex needs of nursing home residents.</ab>

        <ab>Engaging nursing students in the complexities of care across community, acute, rehabilitation and residential aged care settings is challenging. Equally challenging is conceptualising and promoting diverse and comprehensive health assessments across care settings that reflect clinical reality, inform clinical decision making, traverse theory and practice, and transform clinical practice knowledge. This article describes the use of narrative and evolving case study as a teaching-learning tool utilised by the authors in a third year undergraduate gerontic nursing subject in a pre-service nursing degree at a rural university. Principles of transformative learning and strengths based nursing were drawn upon in the development of the case study. The aim of the approach was to draw on embedded knowledge and the experiences of students and academics from assorted practice settings to facilitate understanding of the lived experiences of an older community dwelling couple. Using social learning strategies students were encouraged to analyse and think critically and creatively about the situations they were presented with. They identified possible solutions that would be acceptable to the couple. Building on the older couple's strengths, achievements and personal social capital, the aim was to develop a positive paradigm for health and the way older people are viewed by nursing students.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pain is prevalent among older people, yet is often under-recognised and undertreated in people with dementia. The nurse has a central role in identifying and appropriately assessing pain in order to provide effective treatment. Research however suggests there are significant deficits in this area. Aim: To explore the evidence on nurses' knowledge and attitudes to pain assessment in older people with dementia. Design: A systematic narrative review of peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2014. Data sources: Seven electronic data bases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Wiley, Pubmed, ProQuest and OVID) were searched and articles focusing on nurses knowledge and attitudes on pain assessment towards people with dementia. Methods: Research participants within the studies reviewed were to include registered nurses involved in the assessment and management of pain in older adults with dementia from across all healthcare settings (e.g. dementia units, nursing homes, community and acute settings). Results: Data were systematically analysed from 1 1 papers. Using an inductive approach for thematic content analysis informed by the theory of planned behaviour, five themes were identified. These included: 1) Challenges in diagnosing pain in dementia 2) Inadequacies of pain assessment tools 3) Time constraints and workload pressures 4) Lack of interdisciplinary teamwork and communication 5) Training and education. Conclusion: Nurses play a key role in the effective management of pain through the use of pain assessment tools, behavioural observation, and analgesic choice. Pain assessment in dementia remains challenging for nurses due to the complexity and individualisation of pain behaviours. The accessibility of appropriate training, workforce stability and a standardised approach to pain assessment are key to the successful management of pain in older people with dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Summary Background The aging population is a globally recognized challenge for the health care service. The growing number of older people will probably lead to increased demands for nurses working in elderly care. Clinical practice has been shown to have an impact on how student nurses perceive a particular field of nursing. Objectives To compare perceptions of the clinical learning environment in nursing homes among students considering a career in aged care or not, and to examine the difference in age, gender and previous working experience as health care assistants in elderly care between the two groups. Design This was a cross-sectional study using the Swedish version of the Clinical Learning Environment and Nurse Teacher evaluation scale. Methods Consecutive sampling was performed over three semesters from September 2011 to December 2012. The survey was conducted with 183 student nurses. Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine differences in relation to two groups namely student nurses who did or did not consider to work in elderly care. A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the difference in age, gender and previous working experience between the two groups. Results The analysis leaned towards an overall positive evaluation of the clinical learning environment with more positive values for students considering a career. There were no significant differences between younger students (18–23) and older students (24–50) regarding willingness to work in elderly care or not. Neither was any significant difference displayed between students, based on gender nor for previous work experience. Conclusion Age, gender and previous work experiences as health care assistants did not impact on students' willingness to work in elderly care. Future studies need to acknowledge the complexity of why student nurses choose a particular pathway in nursing by longitudinal studies following cohorts of students during the course of the nursing programme.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE To define the term complexity of care. BACKGROUND The aging population and lack of gerontological preparation in pre-licensure nursing programs are pressing issues. The NLN Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACE.S) project developed a framework to facilitate faculty and student understanding of older adults' care needs. Integral to the framework is the concept of complexity of care. METHOD Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS The analysis identified three antecedents (focus on treatment and cure of disease, multiple comorbidities, and life experiences and culture), five attributes (polypharmacy, use of advanced technologies, novel care models, a fragmented health care system, and the relational nature of caregiving), and two consequences (impact on quality of life and impact on quality of care). CONCLUSION Defining the concept of complexity of care will facilitate student understanding of the unique health care needs of older adults</ab>

        <ab>Summary Background An undergraduate nurse's attitude toward older adults or their perception of working with older adults can influence the quality of care provided and their career choice, respectively. As such, it is important to conduct research that contributes to the evaluation of attitudes and perceptions. In the conduct of comprehensive and rigorous research, it is necessary to make the right choice of an instrument to measure outcomes. The identification of a valid and reliable instrument to suit a specific research question is a complex process. Objective In order to deal with this complexity, this paper reviews instruments that have been used to measure undergraduate nurse attitudes toward older adults and their perceptions of working with older adults. Data Sources Data were sourced from Medline, CINAHL, Healthsource/Academic Edition, PsycINFO and PubMed for the years 2008–2013. Results Eight readily available instruments were identified and their characteristics analyzed for their purpose, number of items, design, reliability and validity. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the instruments and recent use are also discussed. Conclusion The choice of a suitable instrument is likely to be critical to the testing of intervention strategies such as curriculum activities, which target attitude improvements to enhance the quality and effectiveness of nursing care provided to older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The experience of nurses who work in the residential elderly care setting regarding the seasonal influenza vaccine is often overlooked, with a paucity of published qualitative studies. The aim of this study is to present an insight into the issues concerning nurses with regard to the seasonal influenza vaccine. The study purposively sampled registered nurses (n=11) working in a large long-term care facility for older people (n=142) in Ireland. Using a broad qualitative research approach, data were collected through interviews, transcribed, analysed and grouped into the following themes: knowing: the seasonal influenza vaccine; mandatory vaccination: balancing autonomy and control; and meaningful education. This study reveals the complexity of issues and concerns for nurses when it comes to the seasonal influenza vaccine. These issues and concerns include influences such as family, friends, peers, the media and how nurses inform themselves. The position of nurses within the organisation and recommendations for meaningful nurse education are also discussed. The findings of this study provide an insight that could inform future influenza policy and education, which should be explored before the introduction of any mandatory influenza campaigns.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To present three converging myths that underlie the perception that nursing care for older persons in hospital is simple in comparison with its actual complexity. Background Literature provides strong evidence indicating that the myths we discuss inherently arise from ageism, the social value of older patients and the economic burden of being an older patient in hospital. These powerful social discourses promote harm to older patients. Harm emerges from both the omission of gerontological nursing knowledge and skill and the commission of acts that unintentionally harm. A corresponding ethical challenge results for acute care nurses. Design A discursive paper. Methods We illuminate gerontological issues by discussing three myths. In myth one, we detail four clusters of distinguishing characteristics in older hospitalised people. In the second myth, we challenge the idea that the role of the acute care hospital is to attend only to acute medical concerns. Finally, in the third myth, we address the issue of incorporating functional assessment into the acute care nursing assessment. We argue that functional assessment is poorly integrated and becomes acceptable only as long as the medical regimen is managed appropriately. Conclusion Safe quality care in hospital for older adults requires a hybrid practice that integrates acute care specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing knowledge and skill. Clinical reasoning that integrates this type of nursing knowledge can prevent harm. Relevance to clinical practice Integrating key elements of acute care nursing specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing principles aids to prevent the omission of care that is known to be harmful to older people. Conversely, the commission of gerontologically sensitive acute care can enhance safety and promote quality care in hospital.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a discussion of knowledge and awareness regarding prevention of functional decline in older hospitalized patients. Functional decline is experienced by 30-60% of the older hospitalized patients, resulting in decreased independence and other adverse health outcomes. One literature study and four cohort studies (total n = 1628) were conducted to develop and validate an instrument to identify older hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline. An evidence-based best practice was developed to improve the quality of care for older patients. This paper shows the relevance and the complexity of this problem and shows that patients at risk can be recognized by four simple questions. Due to their ability to observe and guide patients and their 24-h patient supervision, nurses should play a key role in strategies to prevent functional decline. Nurses should assess the geriatric needs in patients at risk and based on these initiate and coordinate multi-professional interventions. Given the growing number of older people in western society and the growing need for care, action to prevent functional decline cannot be withheld. Knowledge of the ageing process, implementation of an evidence-based programme and a multidisciplinary approach is a basic ingredient to prevent functional decline.</ab>

        <ab>In their practice, nurses make daily decisions that are ethically informed. An ethical decision is the result of a complex reasoning process based on knowledge and experience and driven by ethical values. Especially in acute elderly care and more specifically decisions concerning the use of physical restraint require a thoughtful deliberation of the different values at stake. Qualitative evidence concerning nurses' decision-making in cases of physical restraint provided important insights in the complexity of decision-making as a trajectory. However a nuanced and refined understanding of the reasoning process in terms of ethical values is still lacking. A qualitative interview design, inspired by the Grounded Theory approach, was carried out to explore nurses' reasoning process in terms of ethical values. We interviewed 21 acute geriatric nurses from 12 hospitals in different regions in Flanders, Belgium in the period October 2009-April 2011. The Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven was used to analyse interview data. Nurses' decision-making is characterized as an ethical deliberation process where different values are identified and where the process of balancing these values forms the essence of ethical deliberation. Ethical decision-making in cases of physical restraint implies that nurses have to choose which values receive priority in the process, which entails that not all values can be respected to the same degree. As a result, decision making can be experienced as difficult, even as a dilemma. Driven by the overwhelming goal of protecting physical integrity, nurses took into account the values of dignity and justice more implicitly and less dominantly.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: Qualitatively describe the use of team and group processes in intervention facilities participating in a study targeted to improve quality of care in nursing homes “in need of improvement.” Design/setting/participants: A randomized, two-group, repeated-measures design was used to test a 2-year intervention for improving quality of care and resident outcomes. Intervention group (n = 29) received an experimental multilevel intervention designed to help them: (1) use quality improvement methods, (2) use team and group process for direct-care decision-making, (3) focus on accomplishing the basics of care, and (4) maintain more consistent nursing and administrative leadership committed to communication and active participation of staff in decision-making. Results: The qualitative analysis revealed a subgroup of homes (“Full Adopters”) likely to continue quality improvement activities that were able to effectively use teams. “Full Adopters” had either the nursing home administrator or director of nursing who supported and were actively involved in the quality improvement work of the team. “Full Adopters” also selected care topics for the focus of their quality improvement team, instead of “communication” topics of the “Partial Adopters” or “Non-Adopters” in the study who were identified as unlikely to continue to continue quality improvement activities after the intervention. “Full Adopters” had evidence of the key elements of complexity science: information flow, cognitive diversity, and positive relationships among staff; this evidence was lacking in other subgroups. All subgroups were able to recruit interdisciplinary teams, but only those that involved leaders were likely to be effective and sustain team efforts at quality improvement of care delivery systems. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative analysis can help leaders and medical directors use the key elements and promote information flow among staff, residents, and families; be inclusive as discussions about care delivery, making sure diverse points of view are included; and help build positive relationships among all those living and working in the nursing home. Wide-spread adoption of the intervention in the randomized study is feasible and could be enabled by nursing home Medical Directors in collaborative practice with Advanced Practice Nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: Qualitatively describe the use of team and group processes in intervention facilities participating in a study targeted to improve quality of care in nursing homes “in need of improvement.” Design/setting/participants: A randomized, two-group, repeated-measures design was used to test a 2-year intervention for improving quality of care and resident outcomes. Intervention group (n = 29) received an experimental multilevel intervention designed to help them: (1) use quality improvement methods, (2) use team and group process for direct-care decision-making, (3) focus on accomplishing the basics of care, and (4) maintain more consistent nursing and administrative leadership committed to communication and active participation of staff in decision-making. Results: The qualitative analysis revealed a subgroup of homes (“Full Adopters”) likely to continue quality improvement activities that were able to effectively use teams. “Full Adopters” had either the nursing home administrator or director of nursing who supported and were actively involved in the quality improvement work of the team. “Full Adopters” also selected care topics for the focus of their quality improvement team, instead of “communication” topics of the “Partial Adopters” or “Non-Adopters” in the study who were identified as unlikely to continue to continue quality improvement activities after the intervention. “Full Adopters” had evidence of the key elements of complexity science: information flow, cognitive diversity, and positive relationships among staff; this evidence was lacking in other subgroups. All subgroups were able to recruit interdisciplinary teams, but only those that involved leaders were likely to be effective and sustain team efforts at quality improvement of care delivery systems. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative analysis can help leaders and medical directors use the key elements and promote information flow among staff, residents, and families; be inclusive as discussions about care delivery, making sure diverse points of view are included; and help build positive relationships among all those living and working in the nursing home. Wide-spread adoption of the intervention in the randomized study is feasible and could be enabled by nursing home Medical Directors in collaborative practice with Advanced Practice Nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Elder abuse remains a significant problem nationally and globally. Early definitions of abuse, however, oversimplified the phenomena and while the complexity of elder abuse, in nature and scale, has also been growing recently there remains some confusion conceptually and in practice in terms of what is meant by and can be identified as abusive practice. The lack of conceptual clarity is evident across professional and agency boundaries. The authors suggest that a potential way forward is through the development of interprofessional learning as an integral part of education and training in respect of safeguarding older adults. This article highlights a number of complexities in the context of safeguarding and raises areas for further reflection and possible debate.</ab>

        <ab>INTRODUCTION:  Nursing models and terminologies can contribute to research the nature of nursing care. AIM:  The aim of this study was to describe nursing diagnoses in acute- and long-term elderly care. METHODS:  A point prevalence survey was conducted on 240 patients. The International Classification for Nursing Practice was used to describe nursing diagnoses, and a conceptual model was used to categorize them in nursing needs. RESULTS:  A total of 2,673 diagnoses were detected. Mean was higher in nursing home than in hospital ( t test =−3.688; p = .0003). Prevalent diagnoses were significantly different. DISCUSSION:  High complexity, with different issues for nurses, was observed both in acute- and in long-term settings. CONCLUSION:  The results could help to comprehend the nature of older persons needs and could contribute to the development of an International Classification for Nursing Practice catalogue for elderly care. INTRODUZIONE:  Le terminologie infermieristiche possono contribuire a studiare la natura dell'assistenza infermieristica. SCOPO:  Lo scopo dello studio è quello di descrivere le necessità assistenziali infermieristiche dell'anziano nell'ospedale per acuti e in lungodegenza. METODI:  Uno studio di prevalenza di punto è stato condotto coinvolgendo 240 pazienti. L'ICNP è stato impiegato per identificare le necessità assistenziali infermieristiche (nursing diagnoses) ed un modello concettuale per raggrupparle in bisogni di assistenza infermieristica. RISULTATI:  Sono state identificate 2,673 necessità assistenziali. La media è stata maggiore in casa di riposo che in ospedale ( t test =−3.688; p = .0003). Le necessità prevalenti sono state significativamente differenti. DISCUSSIONE:  È stata osservata una elevata complessità dell'assistenza infermieristica, con differenti problematiche per gli infermieri, sia nel contesto acuto che di lungodegenza. CONCLUSIONI:  I risultati possono aiutare a comprendere i bisogni delle persone anziane e possono contribuire allo sviluppo di un ICNP Catalogue per l'assistenza in ambito geriatrico.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Pain continues to be a common problem for older hospitalised patients, but little is known about how the complexities of actual clinical practice affect pain assessment and management in these patients. Objective: To examine how pain was assessed and managed in older patients who were admitted to geriatric evaluation and management units. Design, setting and participants: A naturalistic observational research design was used involving observations of interactions between nurses and patients, and follow-up interviews with nurses. Three observation periods were conducted between midnight and midday, which commenced at 03:30, 07:30, and 10:30, and three observation periods were conducted between midday and midnight, which commenced at 15:30, 18:30, and 22:30. Between 12 and 13 observations were conducted for each observation period, each ranging from 2 to 3h. The study was undertaken in two units, each located in an Australian public teaching hospital. Participants included registered nurses employed in the units, and patients in their care. Results: Four major themes were identified: communication among nurses and between older patients and nurses; strategies for pain management; environmental and organisational aspects of care; and complexities in the nature of pain. Nurses tended to use simple questioning with patients about the pain experienced. Despite the availability of ‘as required’ opioid medication for breakthrough or incident pain, nurses often preferred to wait to determine if pain was relieved following administration of fixed-dose paracetamol. Time of day impacted on how pain was managed due to availability of nursing staff. It was unit policy for doctors to reduce medications prescribed, which often extended to analgesics, and nurses were left to deal with patient tensions in addressing analgesic needs. Complexities were associated with the nature of pain experienced, in terms of perceived level of tolerable pain, the simultaneous presence of chronic and acute pain, location of pain, and differentiation of pain from discomfort. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the intricacies associated with how analgesic needs are addressed in older patients, especially those with communication deficits, the complex nature of older patients’ painful experiences, and the precarious balance of attempting to treat pain effectively while avoiding adverse effects of analgesics.</ab>

        <ab>Historical and epistemological developments contribute to and reinforce the underlying framework that categorizes antiaging discourse and healthy aging discourse. This discourse creates the question 'Can we live longer or better?' and encompasses issues of quality versus quantity, dependency versus autonomy, and risk versus benefit. By positing this discourse as a dichotomous tension, the development can be traced through the examination of select examples of influential studies in the field of aging. For nursing, the risk of these continued oppositions is potential oversimplification that may limit discernment of the complexities of care of older adults. Through understanding of the evolution and imposition of this dichotomizing discourse, nursing can provide older adult care within the reality of the aging experience, and develop frameworks, theories, and multidisciplinary discursive practice to optimize nursing care in the real-world spaces that exist between antiaging and healthy aging boundaries.</ab>

        <ab>PROBLEM. The increasing numbers of people seeking care for chronic disease has placed unparalleled demands on nurses who journey with them as they grasp the meaning of their altered health status. The complexity of the newly diagnosed chronic disease can be overwhelming. Newly diagnosed elder patients need a refuge in which to explore the uncertainties and challenges in managing a chronic illness. Reactions to a new diagnosis are uniquely shaped by the elder person's culture, age, life circumstances, and previous coping strategies. Six dichotomous response pairs are posed: relief versus devastation, courage versus cowardice, disease obsession versus disease aversion, rational thinking versus intuition, reawakening versus stuck, and self-reliance versus dependence. Nurses can create a sanctuary for elderly patients with protected space, presence, partnership, past to future orientation, and perspective on life. Nurses who embrace this mission may find themselves returning to the reasons they sought a nursing career, to support and strengthen elderly people in the most vulnerable moments of their lives.</ab>

        <ab>Individualized nursing care, a form of person- centered care delivery, is accepted as best practice, yet its implementation into actual care is far from complete. Appropriate measures of this elusive concept are needed to better understand barriers to implementation. This study explored and tested the convergent validity and the reliability of 2 individualized nursing care measures. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data using the Individualized Care Scale and the Individualized Care Instrument (ICI) from a sample of nurses (n = 263, response rate 71%) working in older peoples' care settings in Finland, and the data were analyzed statistically. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the ICI scales (.63-.80) and ICS-A and B subscales (both a = .91) demonstrated only moderate correlation between the 2 instruments (r = -.39 to .50) and possibly the complexity of measuring "individualized care." The study acknowledges the latent influence of culture and care approach to the conceptualization of individuality. It concludes that the concept may best be measured at this point with the use of other factors in addition to instruments to capture its multiple domains.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Quality improvement (QI) programs focused on mastery of content by individual staff members are the current standard to improve resident outcomes in nursing homes. However, complexity science suggests that learning is a social process that occurs within the context of relationships and interactions among individuals. Thus, QI programs will not result in optimal changes in staff behavior unless the context for social learning is present. Accordingly, we developed CONNECT, an intervention to foster systematic use of management practices, which we propose will enhance effectiveness of a nursing home Falls QI program by strengthening the staff-to-staff interactions necessary for clinical problem-solving about complex problems such as falls. The study aims are to compare the impact of the CONNECT intervention, plus a falls reduction QI intervention (CONNECT + FALLS), to the falls reduction QI intervention alone (FALLS), on fall-related process measures, fall rates, and staff interaction measures.Methods/design: Sixteen nursing homes will be randomized to one of two study arms, CONNECT + FALLS or FALLS alone. Subjects (staff and residents) are clustered within nursing homes because the intervention addresses social processes and thus must be delivered within the social context, rather than to individuals. Nursing homes randomized to CONNECT + FALLS will receive three months of CONNECT first, followed by three months of FALLS. Nursing homes randomized to FALLS alone receive three months of FALLs QI and are offered CONNECT after data collection is completed. Complexity science measures, which reflect staff perceptions of communication, safety climate, and care quality, will be collected from staff at baseline, three months after, and six months after baseline to evaluate immediate and sustained impacts. FALLS measures including quality indicators (process measures) and fall rates will be collected for the six months prior to baseline and the six months after the end of the intervention. Analysis will use a three-level mixed model.Discussion: By focusing on improving local interactions, CONNECT is expected to maximize staff's ability to implement content learned in a falls QI program and integrate it into knowledge and action. Our previous pilot work shows that CONNECT is feasible, acceptable and appropriate.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00636675.</ab>

        <ab>Nursing faculty members are responsible for assuring competence and safety in the preparation of prelicensure students who are preparing to deliver care in diverse settings. The growing complexity of care and the rapid expansion of knowledge have challenged the adequacy of traditional educational approaches. Proposed solutions have encouraged closer integration of classroom and clinical teaching. This article describes an integrated instructional approach to developing clinical leadership competencies in a cohort of accelerated, second-degree, baccalaureate nursing students. Fifty-six students completed an intensive clinical experience in long-term care settings in which they used evidence on improving care for persons with heart failure to practice the principles of delegation and supervision with nursing staff. The pre- and postassessments indicated improvement in heart failure knowledge and increased readiness for delegation and supervision of certified nursing assistants. As one component of the learning experience, the students completed reflection journals. The entries in the students' journals revealed five themes: (a) low leadership self-efficacy, (b) managing the credibility gap, (c) flexibility in communication strategies, (d) RN accountability in delegation and supervision, and (e) knowledge dissemination with diverse nursing staff. Students and faculty judged the learning experience to be successful and supported the experience for future cohorts of students. This report is one example of how innovative learning experiences could be developed to increase the "real-world" aspects of clinical care within a multidisciplinary team context for the entry-level learner.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this article is to report a study exploring experiences of relatives who have been present immediately prior to and after the death (in the last 72 hours) of a next-of-kin in a nursing home. The purpose of the study was to acquire research-based knowledge to improve practice. Globally, a growing number of older people, often with increased morbidity and complexity of conditions, require specialised nursing care, particularly at the end of life. Several international studies describe end-of-life care in nursing homes as insufficient, mainly owing to shortage of qualified staff and other essential resources. There are few studies in this field in Norway; none of them focus on the final days and hours of a patient's life from the perspective of their relatives. A mixed methods design was used. Data were collected through structured interviews with 50 relatives during Spring 2006 and analysed by version 14 and theme-based analysis. With a few exceptions, the quality of nursing care was considered professional and good. Care was described as supportive, individualised and based on patients' needs - in a safe atmosphere and supported by good relations between patients and nursing staff. Information and communication between staff and relatives, however, were described as unsystematic and casual. That some patients died alone became a source of distress for their relatives. Information and communication between staff and relatives need to be improved. There is need for change to avoid the situation where patients die in solitude. End-of-life care is performed at a time when patients and their relatives are at their most vulnerable. Nurses and other health workers need information, as this study suggests, to provide high-quality care to ease this situation.</ab>

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The culture change (CC) movement aims to transform the traditional nursing home (NH) that is institutional in design with hierarchical management structure into a homelike environment that empowers residents and frontline staff. This study examines differences in adoption of CC practices according to a NH''s self-reported extent of CC implementation and its duration of CC adoption. Furthermore, it examines differences in adoption by whether a CC practice is considered less versus more complex, using complexity theory as the theoretical framework for this classification. Design and Methods: Using data from a 2007 Commonwealth-funded study, we analyzed a national sample of 291 US nursing homes that identified as being “for the most part” or “completely” CC facilities for “1 to 3 years” or “3+ years.” Also, using a complexity theory framework, we ranked 16 practices commonly associated with CC as low, moderately, or highly complex based on level of agreement needed to actuate the process (number of parties involved) and the certainty of intended outcomes. We then examined the prevalence of CC-associated practices in relation to their complexity and the extent and duration of a NH''s CC adoption. Results: We found practices ranked as less complex were implemented more frequently in NHs with both shorter and longer durations of CC adoption. However, more complex CC practices were more prevalent among NHs reporting “complete” adoption for 3+ years versus 1 to 3 years. This was not observed in NHs reporting having CC “for the most part.” Conclusions/Implications: Less complex practices may be more economical and easier to implement. These early successes may result in sufficient momentum so that more complex change can follow. A nursing home that more completely embraces the culture change movement may be more likely to attempt these complex changes.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this article is to explore the barriers that the uninsured elderly population encounter when accessing health care in the United States. These barriers include, but are not limited to lack of transportation, insurance, or family support; the daunting complexity of the health care system; poverty; culture; poor patient-health care provider communications; race/ethnicity; and lack of health care professionals such as nurses and doctors with adequate geriatric preparation, or generalists who are undereducated in geriatrics. The number of health care professionals currently available to treat elderly persons in the United States is inadequate. The Federal government should take steps to develop solutions to improve access to health care and decrease health disparities for older adults. As a nation, we should be proactive in addressing these concerns instead of waiting for new barriers to arise that further limit access to health care for elderly patients and their families. In this article, we provide an assessment of the barriers that limit access to health care in the uninsured elderly population and suggest recommendations and possible solutions to eliminate or reduce these barriers.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. The aim of this paper is to discuss the complexity of admission into a residential care facility from a psychological perspective for residents and their relatives and the resulting implications for nursing care. Background. Admission into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. Data sources. The background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into nursing homes and psychological transitions. Discussion. The concepts of transition from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. Implications for nursing. Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that occurs when an older person is admitted into care. Conclusion. Improving the psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a more positive experience.</ab>

        <ab>Determination of a patient's capacity for medical decision making can be simple or complex, depending on the issue being considered; likewise, the degree of capacity required to make decisions varies with the complexity of the situation. A capacity examination is a focused and impartial evaluation of mental status and medical, surgical, psychiatric, and psychosocial histories. The examination is composed of several basic steps, beginning with an assessment of the patient's ability to communicate, followed by determination of his or her understanding of the proposed care, followed by the patient's rationale for decisions about that care. When a patient is deemed to lack capacity, mechanisms should be in place to ensure the patient receives the care needed. This article provides an overview of the concept of capacity, how it is determined, and how to proceed when the patient is found to lack it. Copyright 2010, SLACK Incorporated.</ab>

        <ab>Given the rapidly escalating older adult population and the need to strengthen content on end-of-life care in nursing curricula, finding creative strategies to encourage student thinking about the dying process and personal choice in end-of-life care is a timely challenge for nurse educators. There is an evolving body of literature in a variety of disciplines on cinemeducation, or the use of films to promote learning and personal awareness. This article describes an innovative assignment incorporating feature films designed not only to enhance student knowledge of the stages and process of grief and the complexity of human reactions when facing end-of-life situations, but also to engage students in thinking about the importance of quality of life in palliative care. The assignment was given to students enrolled in a second-semester, junior-level advanced adult health nursing course. Faculty and student evaluations of the assignment are discussed, and suggestions for selecting films and structuring such an assignment are proposed.</ab>

        <ab>The aging population and the associated rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions suggest that the home health population is increasingly complex and challenging to manage. The purpose of this study was to use national administrative data (Outcome and Assessment Information Set assessments of persons discharged in 2004 and 2005) to examine the clinical complexity of older adults admitted to home healthcare. Our descriptive analyses confirm that multiple chronic conditions and cognitive impairment are common and result in longer lengths of stay. The findings support the need for geriatric home healthcare practices that effectively address multiple morbidities and cognitive function.</ab>

        <ab>Providing residential aged care is challenging because of the complexity of residents' health status, difficulties recruiting and retaining skilled staff, and financial and regulatory constraints. This paper discusses some of these challenges and describes an innovative model of care, termed 'T he Tri-focal model of care'. This model was developed based on the concepts of 'partnership-centred care', 'positive work environment' and the need for evidence-based practice to underpin all aspects of care. It is envisaged that the implementation of this model will provide a rich learning environment that advances the teaching-nursing home concept and the quality of residential aged care.</ab>

        <ab>This research describes the development and evaluation of a 2-hour program that taught geriatric nursing assistant students person-centered caregiving skills. The person centeredness of caregiving skills among students who completed the training, as well as those who did not, was evaluated by coding their videotaped interactions with a standardized long-term care resident. Residents reported more satisfaction with students who had completed the special training, although there was little difference between the actual behavior of students in the intervention and control conditions. Students' interpersonal cognitive complexity was associated with their ability to provide care in person-centered ways.</ab>

        <ab>Aims This paper discusses how health and social care can work together collaboratively to improve the quality of care for older people resident in care homes, using Essence of Care benchmarking as an example. Background There is an increasing interest in how care is provided in care homes, including its impact on quality-of-life and end-of-life care. Care standards and government policy have emphasized the need for primary care to work more closely with care home staff. Evaluation The available evidence on older people's health care needs, and how primary health care and nursing work in care homes was evaluated. Case studies and descriptive reports on Essence of Care benchmarking were also used to identify the facilitators and barriers to using it as a means to improve the quality of care for older people in care homes. Key issues The key issues relate to the differences in the working cultures of health and social care, and the complex health care needs of older people living in care homes that do not have onsite nursing support. Conclusions Structured tools such as benchmarking can potentially be used to improve the quality of care for older people in care homes, but care home staff need adequate support to adapt this approach to their working environment. Implications for nursing management Primary care nurses need to be more proactive in the way that they work with older people in care homes. Structured tools such as benchmarking can help them to recognize the range and complexity of resident's health needs, and work with care home staff in ways that acknowledge their expertise and improve the overall care of older people in these settings.</ab>

        <ab>Aims The aim of the co-operative enquiry undertaken was to explore how the leadership component of the Consultant Nurse for Older People role was reflected in day-to-day working. Background Leadership is one of the four key elements of the Consultant Nurse role and is the key mechanism for achieving and embedding transformation in practice. However, within the role of the Consultant Nurse this area has not been explored in detail. Methods A 6-month co-operative inquiry approach was used to develop insights into leadership strategies of Consultant Nurses for Older People and involved the five authors of the paper, four Consultant Nurses in Older People nursing and the lead author who was also an experienced Consultant Nurse and practice-based researcher from a different nursing specialism. Results Through the analysis of the stories shared by the co-authors/participants, two key themes emerged relating to complexity and pathway. These themes provided a major focus for the Consultant Nurses in their leadership role. The outcome of the study is a framework that describes the triggers and enabling factors that precede the use of leadership strategies at the clinical and organizational level and associated outcomes. Conclusions In defining how leadership is reflected by Consultant Nurses for Older People, a complex picture emerges that is multifaceted and multidimensional. Consultant Nurses need support to make visible the valuable contribution they make to enabling healthcare teams, organizations and work places. Consultant Nurses for Older People are key in ensuring the quality agenda within their organizations as they are well placed to provide leadership at both a strategic and clinical level, while providing influence to operational development. Implications for nursing management Within the context of the literature this area is under investigated. Understanding how leadership is reflected in the role of Consultant Nurses is complex as Consultant Nurses work across traditional interfaces and between different levels within organizations. Consultant Nurses have been 'challenged' to identify the 'difference' they are making; to do this it is important to understand how leadership (as one element) is reflected in a highly complex, multidimensional role and the links between leadership and enabling, quality person-centred ways of working with Older People within rapidly changing, pressurized healthcare settings.</ab>

        <ab>THE STUDY'S RATIONALE: Confusion is a common condition among older patients and often a fearful experience. Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.</ab>

        <ab>A study exploring older people's participation in their care in acute hospital settings reveals both consumers' and nurses' views of participation. Using a critical ethnographic design, data were collected through participant observation and interviews from consumers in acute care settings who were over 70 years old and nurses who were caring from them. Thematic analysis identified that older people equated participation with being independent. Importantly, consumers highlighted the complexity of the notion of participation when describing situations where they were unable to participate in their own care. The difficulties in communicating with health professionals and an inability to administer their own medications in inpatient settings were identified as barriers to participation. Understanding what consumers believe participation means provides a starting point for developing meaningful partnerships between health professionals and people receiving care.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives. To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated. Background. Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on health-care costs is also high. Results. Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described. Conclusion. These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. Relevance to clinical practice. Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives. The literature review was conducted to explore those factors which complicate pain management in older people to inform future research, education and nursing practice in this area. Background. Acute pain management in hospitalized older people is complex because of the physiological changes of ageing, pharmacological factors and under-representation of this patient group in reported research about assessing acute pain. Methods. A review of the literature was undertaken using electronic databases and specified search terms, some hand searching was also used and included the grey literature, textbooks and conference proceedings. A computerized literature search was carried out using CINAHL, Bandolier, Cochrane, Medline, the British Nursing Index and the International Association for the Study of Pain website for the period 1992-2004. The search terms were acute pain, older people, elder care, pain assessment and acute pain services. Thirty-seven research-based reviews and published studies and 17 policy documents were included. Conclusions. Managing acute pain well in older adults involves understanding the influence of a series of integrated factors: attitudes and beliefs, physiological ageing processes, pharmacological factors and the social construction of the older person in healthcare contexts. Relevance to clinical practice. This review offers new insight into those factors which, taken together, add complexity to managing acute pain in older people well. Moreover, nurses are the professional group mainly responsible for assessing pain, administering and now prescribing analgesia and evaluating the quality of pain relief in older people. On this basis, they are also the group most likely to effect improved patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>There are studies about the emotional and social aspects of loss and grief in continuing care environments such as care homes and hospital wards, but researchers have tended to focus on either the cultural aspect of the organisation or the emotional response of individuals [Holman, C., Meyer, J. &amp; Cotter, A. (2004) 'The complexity of loss in continuing care institutions for older people: a review of the literature', Illness, Crisis and Loss, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 38-51]. This splitting in the body of knowledge misses the opportunity to examine the link between the personal and the broader public domain [Williams, S. J. &amp; Bendelow, G. (1996) 'Emotions, health and illness: the 'missing link' in medical sociology?', in Health and the Sociology of Emotions, eds V. James &amp; J. Gabe, Blackwell Publications Ltd, Oxford]. This paper concerns the methodology and initial findings from a psychoanalytically informed research study. It was aimed deliberately at exploring the juncture between the psychological and social domains that care staff have to negotiate in order to provide care related to loss and grief in an NHS continuing care ward. The method draws heavily on the Tavistock approach to learning about emotions [Rustin, M. (2003) 'Learning about emotions: the Tavistock approach', European Journal of Psychotherapy, Counselling and Health, vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 187-208] but also adopts participant observation methods rooted in the ethnographic tradition [Fielding, N. (2001) 'Ethnography', in Researching Social Life, 2nd edn, ed. N. Gilbert, Sage Publications, London]. The study identifies the emotional demand of caring for people experiencing loss and grief in a continuing care unit and the development of a reflective group that supported practice developments in meeting these tasks. The paper will argue that research that develops an understanding of social practices underpinned by psychoanalytic perspectives can inform development in areas where staff are expected to cope with high levels of anxiety and stress.</ab>

        <ab>As the complexity of care increases for hospitalized older adults, the clinical nurse specialist is essential for ongoing development of nursing practice and care standards. This article describes the Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) model for interdisciplinary management of older adults and clinical specialist responsibilities within this interdisciplinary team. Within the model, clinical care specialists utilize clinical expertise and consultation skills reflecting three spheres of practice related to care of high-risk community-dwelling older adults admitted an acute medical unit. The goal for this patient group is to achieve medical stability while preserving maximum functioning. The Acute Care of the Elderly team members include primary nurses (staff nurses), physicians, clinical care specialists, therapies, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, and a discharge planner. Under the leadership of the primarily nurse, the team develops a comprehensive care and discharge plan, implemented across a care continuum. Using protocols and working together, the team delivers cost-effective, coordinated care that promotes process improvement resulting in practice that is in alignment with current standards of care.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing nurses to meet the care needs of an expanding aging population is a challenge for nursing. Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current vacancies. This article describes the integration of long-term care experiences into senior year community health practicums and reports on a qualitative analysis to evaluate the project's impact on student attitudes and intentions toward geriatric nursing roles.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the many complexities associated with providing competent care to older Australians, especially in the current aged care environment. It explores the ways in which quality of care is driven and maintained by the registered nurse. It focuses on a study in which five registered nurses shared their perspectives on working in aged care. These experienced nurses articulated many of the important but mostly positive aspects of caring for the older person. Their contributions illustrated how aged care nurses are the lynchpin in the provision of quality care in residential aged care facilities.Older people in residential aged care facilities look to the registered nurse to help them identify and prioritise their needs. Personal care workers now administer care and the registered nurse monitors the provision of this care. It is argued that supervision, while an important aspect of the registered nurse's role, is often one that registered nurses are ill prepared to perform. The paper alerts registered nurses working in the residential aged care arena of the potential to embrace and further develop the principles of primary health care. An outcome of the paper is the recognition for further development of the place of the registered nurse in residential aged care, and the benefits associated with research in this important practice arena.</ab>

        <ab>The Admiral Nursing Service supports individuals caring for people with dementia. As a response to the high demand for one team's service, a temporary closure to referrals was agreed. This provided the impetus to explore the influence of nurses' decision making at the point of referral on demand for the service. The research questions addressed were: How do Admiral Nurses make decisions regarding referrals and What factors influence this decision-making process? Sixteen case studies were retrospectively reviewed through the auspices of a semi-structured interview aimed at identifying which factors influenced the nurses' acceptance or rejection of these referrals. Results indicated that the Admiral Nurses had a clearly identified focus in supporting the carers of people with dementia, but that the complexity of the carers situation which included the person with dementia was significant. However, the desire to fulfil a case-management role while attempting to provide a service that is of a specialist nature and of limited capacity generated tensions. The decision to offer a service to carers was consequently influenced not only by perceived need but also upon the nurses feeling professionally responsible for perceived gaps in service provision.</ab>

        <ab>AIM: The aim of the study was to use the experiences of emergency nurses to illuminate what constitutes good nursing care for patients 75 years or older transferred to emergency departments. BACKGROUND: Emergency departments have a medical technical character and the number of visits there increases dramatically as people age. Older patients require increased healthcare services in terms of nursing care, interventions and hospitalizations due to an increased complexity of their problems. For these reasons it is important to study what good nursing care of the older patients consists of at an emergency department from the emergency nurses' point of view. METHOD: Ten emergency nurses from a university hospital emergency department in Sweden were interviewed. A thematic content analysis was performed. RESULTS: The study showed that it was necessary to be knowledgeable, to be understanding of the older patients' situation and to take responsibility for them in order to be able to provide good nursing care. The emergency nurses shifted focus from describing the central aspect of good nursing care to describing what hinders the provision of it. Their experience was that prioritizing medical procedures, everyday tasks and routines threatens good nursing care of older patients in emergency departments. The emergency nurses held that the older patient is often sent to an emergency department where the level of care is not appropriate to their needs. CONCLUSIONS: The result can be seen as a challenge for the organization and the nurses in the future; to prioritize differently, thereby maintaining a balance between good nursing and medical/technical tasks when treating older patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The present day healthcare system is not organized to appropriately meet the needs of the older patients. Nurses themselves hold they can better serve the older patient. By sharing their experiences, both can be accomplished.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: To describe how nurses interpreted health promotion related to older patients in a medical hospital ward and the presuppositions for this work. METHODS: The study had a descriptive and explorative design. Data were created through participant observation of five nurses and informal dialogues with four nurses working in an infection unit in a small hospital in Norway. The nurses where followed during a period of 6 months. The observations and dialogues were interpreted and transformed into text. This text was analysed with qualitative content analysis and interpreted hermeneutically on three levels: (1) reading the text to get an overview of the themes; (2) systematically separating central patterns; and (3) highlighting the patterns with examples. FINDINGS: The nurses' interpretation of health promotion was closely connected to their interpretation of health and holistic nursing. Two main aspects were uncovered in the informal dialogues: a biomedically oriented nursing view and a holistically oriented nursing view. The observations showed that presuppositions, such as waiting for something or somebody, constantly changing situations, complexity and diversity in patient cases, influenced the nurses' work in general and also their focus on health promotion. The nurses balanced between the biomedical and the holistic approach. It seemed to be important for the nurses to be the masters of walking on a tightrope and to have professional clinical competence. CONCLUSION: It was difficult to find a clear focus on health promotion. The most visible focus was on diagnosis and treatment, while the more complex and comprehensive situations related to health promotion of older patients seemed to be underprioritized. The phenomenon of 'waiting' may be an important issue for further research.</ab>

        <ab>At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.</ab>

        <ab>Pleural effusion is excess collection of fluid in the pleural cavity. It is a frequent complication of pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and carcinomas of the lung, breast, and ovaries. Regardless of the cause, pleural effusion produces significant effects on the respiratory system, especially when considering the normal age-related changes that compromise the respiratory system. Pleural effusion and the complexity of diagnosis and treatment make planning and delivering care challenging. The article describes the pathophysiology of pleural effusion, its management, and related nursing care priorities.</ab>

        <ab>Although considerable research and development work has been undertaken on the role of General Practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists in medication management, monitoring and referral, there is limited research into a role in medication management for community nurses. One hundred and thirteen older people living at home and receiving community nursing care were assessed for their knowledge of, and ability to manage their medication regimen. From these data, a nurse-initiated intervention was developed that included nursing interventions and referral pathways to GPs for people who might benefit from a GP and/or pharmacist medication review. A subgroup of 24 participants with diminished knowledge of medications or ability to manage their regime (considered to be at risk of drug-related problems) who were followed up, demonstrated an increase in knowledge, some alteration in compliance aids and with no statistically significant change in medication regime complexity. This paper details an approach to medication review and intervention suitable for community nurses that includes referral pathways within the medication team.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence is a widespread but often ignored problem among elderly women residing in nursing homes. Despite numerous research studies performed within this setting, few have been able to demonstrate lasting change in the care of and enduring outcomes in this population. However, neither the most commonly used definitions of incontinence nor current management approaches are meeting the needs of institutionalized frail elderly, particularly women, who are twice as likely as men to demonstrate symptoms of the condition. Costs in terms of quality of life and expense of care are staggering. Because many believe that a holistic approach may provide direction for management of urinary incontinence, and because nursing is a holistic profession, a solution to the challenges involved in treating incontinence among the elderly potentially lies in utilizing a nursing as opposed to medical framework for the analysis of factors and care. Specifically, the complexities of testing necessary to differentiate current diagnoses might be simplified by classifying incontinence in a different way, such as using nurse-identified levels of need as opposed to physiologically-based factors. The use of nursing theory to guide patient assessment and an evaluation of systems of care provides a fresh approach to this long-standing problem.</ab>

        <ab>This qualitative research project explored the complexities associated with providing competent care to older Australians, especially within the context of the current health care environment. The study used the perceptions of experienced Registered Nurses in a residential aged care facility to highlight the ways in which the quality of care in these facilities is both driven and maintained by the Registered Nurse. It is argued that Registered Nurses are the linchpins who act as providers and coordinators of care within residential aged care services. The paper, focuses on the potential for the development of the role of the gerontological nurse in residential aged care, and provides future direction for practice. A feature of the study was the way in which the five participants presented an overwhelming respect and value for the older person.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: An intervention project was conducted in three nursing home wards in Sweden. Most patients had severe dementia. The intervention consisted of supervision for individualized and documented nursing care, based on multidimensional assessment. AIM: To illuminate changes in carers' approach after the intervention. METHODS: Several data collections were conducted across the intervention and consisted of nursing documentation, patient life stories as told by carers, video recorded interactions, stimulated recall interviews and a questionnaire. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the analyses. FINDINGS: The findings from the different methods mirrored each other and added to the credibility of the intervention. Communicated knowledge about patients improved in nursing documentation and also as told by carers. Carers were differently skilled in managing the complexity of nursing care situations before as well as after the intervention, but the intervention contributed to developing carers in 'confirming nursing care'. They also improved in their ability to verbalize reflections about their everyday life with patients with dementia. CONCLUSION: Supervision made it possible for carers to share their lived experiences about their day-to-day life with patients, which could promote personal and professional development and thus improve care quality. It also appeared that a detailed assessment tool used as part of the nursing process contributed to seeing a patient as a real person behind a dementia surface.</ab>

        <ab>This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Currently, adults older than 50 account for approximately 15% of the total number of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases. As baby boomers age, the number of older adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is expected to rise. This expected increase is due, in part, to an increase in the number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV, and, in part, to improved efficacy of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications used to treat HIV/AIDS. Older individuals who are infected with HIV also are expected to seek treatment for common conditions associated with aging. Thus, a considerable risk for drug interactions between the medications used specifically for HIV treatment and those used for other conditions exists. This article is intended as a guide for gerontological nurses facing these complexities. It includes reviews of the goals of HAART therapy and of the mechanisms of drug interactions, as well as detailed discussions related to the effects of HAART and their potential interactions with medications used to treat conditions commonly found in aging populations.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND:increasing numbers of elderly patients are admitted to hospital. Ensuring that they are given appropriate and timely access to the range of hospital and community medical, rehabilitation and social care facilities has become more difficult due to the complexity of management options now available, and limited senior medical staff time. METHODS:we established a scheme in which specialist nurses made first assessments of all inter-departmental referrals to a hospital department of geriatric medicine. We evaluated the scheme prospectively using process and outcome data. RESULTS:2825 new patients were seen by two nurses in the first two years, an average of 5.4 per weekday (range 0-17). Mean time from admission to referral was 9 days. Most referrals were seen within 1 day. Mean total length of hospital stay was 43 days (range 1-351). Seven percent died on the referring ward, and 31% were discharged directly from the referring ward. Almost half were accepted for in-patient rehabilitation. Sixty percent of these were discharged home. Thirteen percent were transferred to an acute geriatric medical or stroke ward. One-quarter of these died. Senior medical review was requested in 8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:nurses could select patients suitable for rehabilitation, identify those requiring on-going acute in-patient care, and make arrangements for supported direct discharges where appropriate. This model facilitated access to a wide array of discharge and community support schemes, and supported the efficient use of consultant time.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to explore eating, feeding and nutrition among stroke patients in nursing homes as described by their nurses and by assessments. Registered Nurses were interviewed about an individual stroke patient's state of health, care needs and nursing care received and nursing records were reviewed. Information on eating, feeding and nutrition was extracted from the interviews and nursing records. A comprehensive instrument, the Resident Assessment Instrument, was also used to assess these patients' state of health. The domains of eating, feeding and nutrition were focused on in this study. Manifest content analysis was used. The results showed that more than 80% of the stroke patients in nursing homes were assessed as having some sort of dependence in eating. According to the Registered Nurses, 22 out of 40 patients demonstrated different eating disabilities. The number of eating disabilities in individual patients ranged from 1 to 7, which emphasized the complexity of eating disabilities in stroke patients. Dysphagia was reported in almost one-fourth of the patients and 30% were described and/or assessed as having a poor food intake or poor appetite. The Registered Nurses' descriptions of the eating disabilities, nutritional problems and their care were often vague and unspecific. Only six weights were documented in the nursing records and there were no nutritional records. The findings highlight the importance of making careful observations and assessments, and of maintaining documentation about eating and nutrition early after a patient's arrival in the nursing home to enable appropriate care and promotion of health.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the value of using the Critical Incident Technique to capture qualitative data relating to nurses' experiences in three diverse clinical contexts: (i) neonatal intensive care; (ii) palliative care; and (iii) care of the demented elderly. It is suggested that this technique enables the researcher to capture the reality of contemporary nursing practise, and nurses' experiences of that practise. It is also suggested that the versatility and flexibility of the Critical Incident Technique reveals the subtleties and complexities in nurses' experiences of practising nursing in diverse contexts, thereby promoting a deeper understanding of meanings underpinning this practise.</ab>

        <ab>The well-being of older adults is a major social and health concern in the United States. Of particular import is the mental health of the expanding older adult population. Older adults often receive inadequate or inappropriate mental health services. Provision of appropriate, efficacious care is a challenge because of the complexity of determining the differential diagnosis of health problems in elders. Mental health professionals require knowledge not only of the unique presentation of psychiatric disorders in older adults but also of normal aging, diseases and disabilities of aging, and the cultural diversity found between and among subgroups. For the purposes of this article, emphasis will be placed on geriatric mental health, including issues and barriers that have affected the diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems and psychiatric disorders in older adults. Areas of concern identified in the recent Surgeon General's reports on older adult suicide and mental health will be presented. A case example will be used to illustrate key issues in geriatric mental health care.</ab>

        <ab>Managing behavioral disorders such as delirium and agitation while simultaneously attending to the acute needs of elderly patients is a challenge that confronts orthopaedic nurses on a daily basis. This will only increase in frequency and complexity as the new century dawns. Delirium and agitation affect morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and costs--in short, outcomes. To manage and care for these patients, orthopaedic nurses must first update their knowledge of acute disorders that can disrupt mental status and behavior, and the effects of systemic events on brain function. With the knowledge of the pathophysiology of delirium and agitation, nurses then need to refine their assessment and intervention skills. This article describes the phenomena of agitation and delirium in the elderly acute orthopaedic patient, outlines current perceptions regarding pathophysiology, and offers guidelines for prevention and intervention. An algorithm has been developed that can assist with the identification of at-risk individuals, causes of delirium, and early assessments in the acute care setting.</ab>

        <ab>Findings from a research study investigating nurses' educational preparation for and practice of their role in educating patients about medication identified that the inclusion of patient education in clinical interactions has implications for the governance of clinical practice - an agenda now being implemented in UK health contexts. A review of patient education, concordance (compliance), health promotion and pharmacology literature was undertaken to illuminate the current status of the evidence for effective medication interactions. Observation (n = 48) and audio-recordings (n = 37) of nurse-patient interactions about medication were collected in seven different contexts focusing on adult and older-person, mental-health and community-nursing settings. Post-interaction interviews with nurse (n = 29) and patient (n = 39) participants were conducted to explore views on the observed interaction and to attempt to identify intended outcomes of the interactions. Issues highlighted by the research concern: the need for a pluralistic understanding of what might constitute the evidence base for practice; a requirement to recognise the complexities of professionals' and patients' perspectives on what constitutes quality; the need for caution in the application of generic `standards' to individualised care contexts, coupled with the problem of what counts as effective outcomes. The recognition of such concerns is posited as a critical ingredient in the process of clinical governance.</ab>

        <ab>Registered nurses working in nursing homes often care for stroke patients with impaired cognition and mood disorders. Understanding the behaviour of these patients often puts great demands on nurses. This study illuminates registered nurses' descriptions and experiences of stroke patients and the nursing care given in nursing homes, with a focus on cognition and mood. Registered nurses responsible for the care of stroke patients in nursing homes were asked to describe the individual patient's state of health and the nursing care given. Patients' cognition and mood have been selected for this article. A qualitative content analysis was used to group the text into categories. Registered nurses' descriptions showed great complexity and variation in patients' disabilities, as well as uncertainty about understanding these patients and the appropriate nursing care. Registered nurses described the need for further education in stroke care, and adequate resources for patient activity training, as well as meeting patients' psychosocial and communicative needs.</ab>

        <ab>The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method research.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this descriptive, correlational study was to investigate the relationship between continuing education and job satisfaction among RNs and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) employed in long-term care facilities. METHOD: Herzberg's Motivational-Hygiene Theory was used as a framework to guide the design of the study. The Professional Educational Activities Scale and the McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale were completed by 110 nurses employed in long-term care facilities. RESULTS: No difference was found between type of employment status (full-time versus part-time) on the level of professional educational activities. However, RNs participated in more continuing education activities than LPNs. Nurses who reported higher family incomes also had greater participation in educational activities. Registered nurses reported greater job satisfaction than LPNs. No significant difference was found between the degree of job satisfaction for Black and White nurses. The results of this study indicated nurses who participated in more continuing education activities scored higher on the job satisfaction scale. CONCLUSION: As the elderly population increases, a critical need exists for nurses to be knowledgeable about current research-based information, including the economic and psychosocial effects of illness in later life. To provide the most effective care for the elderly population, nurses in long-term care must be knowledgeable about the complexity and specific characteristics of chronic illnesses. Continuing education activities are an important way to access this information.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on a study which employed auto/biography as a research method to expose the marginalisation and discrimination experienced by Registered Nurses (RN) employed in the nursing home sector. By virtue of their area of practice, these nurses are frequently perceived by the wider nursing community and society at large to be deskilled and not competent. A critical incident from my story is recounted and thereafter discussed from a personal perspective and within a wider context of nursing and related literature. I argue that the complexity of clinical practice in a nursing home means that RNs are no less skilled or competent than RNs in other clinical settings. However, marginalisation and discrimination occur because nurses and nursing are not isolated from the values and beliefs of society. This is a society which under values caring and nurturing and places a higher value on complex technologies with an emphasis on cure being the dominant ideology. The style of reporting the research is congruent with an auto/biographical approach.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents the steps and results of the empirical testing of a theoretical longitudinal model, derived from Roy's nursing conceptual model, of the psychosocial determinants of adaptation in different target groups. The model was elaborated and empirically verified based on the integrated results of four longitudinal studies involving groups vulnerable to mental health problems. By means of structural equation analyses, the cross-sectional model was verified at two points in time. The results showed that the model was relatively stable over time. The model was also tested using longitudinal data. Results showed little consistency in the patterns of relationships across studies. The significant links that emerged from the analyses shed some fight on the complexity of the process of adaptation to different types of stressors. They underscore the importance for nursing practice to develop interventions aimed at certain variables: perceived stress, conflicts in the exchange of support, and passive and avoidance coping strategies. The results also highlight the importance of the relationship between perceived stress, passive/avoidance coping strategies and psychological distress.</ab>

        <ab>Multidimensional functional assessment is the basis of individualized care. It is especially important in the care of elderly, with the complexity of symptomatology and often with cognitive impairment present. An assessment instrument for elderly persons, used in this study, is the Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) and its incorporated MDS Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS). The purposes of the study were to demonstrate the cognitive performance in elderly persons in different levels of care by using the CPS and to elicit the views of staff on use of the RAI/MDS. Cognitive impairment was found in 1276 elderly persons in six levels of care studied, an important factor to consider when organizing care of elderly. An intervention study was carried out for 1 year in three nursing home wards, with training and supervision in implementation of the RAI/MDS including individualized and documented care. Part of a questionnaire was used to evaluate staff (n = 50) views on using the instrument. A majority of the staff thought that the RAI/MDS could contribute to the improvement of quality of care, documentation in nursing records, and in co-operation and engagement. Further research is necessary to elicit more knowledge on the usefulness and benefits of the instrument.</ab>

        <ab>Because of the complexity in assessing elders for depressive symptoms, we recommend that nurses use a differentiated approach as an adjunct to clinical judgment and other assessment strategies. Based on our research and clinical experience, we advocate the joint use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale, and propose a two-tiered assessment process. The first differentiation in this process is made by means of a cut-off score to determine whether or not depressive symptoms exist. If depressive symptoms are present, a second system of differentiation may be employed to identify discrete symptom factors. Application of this differentiated approach will enable the nurse to better understand and design interventions for each elder's specific presentation of depressive symptoms.

        <ab>The complexity of clients in today's health care environment requires a close, collaborative working relationship among disciplines. However, nurses, who are often key decision-makers in the planning, management, and movement of clients throughout the health care system, may not use the expertise of their best allies: nurses in other settings, institutions, and specialty areas. Many care problems-at home or in the hospital, nursing home, or rehabilitation center-can be effectively resolved by nurse-to-nurse consultation. The importance and benefit of nurses relying on their own profession to answer nursing care questions are illustrated with vignettes that apply a model of consultation to the practice of geriatric nursing.</ab>

        <ab>Much has been learned in the past decade, through quality medical and nursing research, regarding the pathophysiology and management of congestive heart failure. Primary care practitioners are challenged to apply the latest data to the clinical management of these patients when there is clear evidence of improvement in the control of symptoms and quality of life. Because of the complexities of the disease process, older adults with congestive heart failure require a comprehensive approach that is particularly well suited to the knowledge and skills of the advanced practice nurse.</ab>

        <ab>IN THIS STUDY, WE addressed the problem of whether residents with a diagnosis of dementia would become agitated if given verbal commands at a level of language complexity above their comprehension ability. The study used an A-B-A research design. The convenience sample of 15 subjects was comprised of 11 men and 4 women who resided in a long-term care institution. Their mean age was 86.6 years, and their average length of stay in the institution was 317.3 days. The results lent support to the hypothesis that exposing residents with dementia to language beyond their comprehension ability could result in agitated behavior. The predominant manifestations of agitation were general restlessness, strange noises, and negativism. An important implication for nursing practice is that the language used by caregivers should match the comprehension ability of residents. Caregiving can thereby facilitate communication and, potentially, prevent agitation.</ab>

        <ab>As society ages, a challenge is presented to health care providers. The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.</ab>

        <ab>In terms of NEST, aging can be understood as a process of formative change toward increasing disorder and order in form, pattern, or structure. The person moves toward greater complexity through self-organization processes. Over time, self-organization processes result in increasingly unique perceptions and behavior. As an older person becomes more unique, he or she becomes more different from other older persons. Self-organization processes are an appropriate focus of concern for nursing when NEST is used as a practice framework. The nurse tries to understand older persons' behaviors as outcomes of self-organization processes (attempts to bring order out of disorder).</ab>

        <ab>Today's psychiatric population presents with a higher acuity and complexity of problems. Concomitant medical diagnoses may add to the psychiatric nurse's uneasiness with medical-surgical skills and knowledge. A needs assessment survey of nurses' medical-surgical skills and knowledge was conducted at a private psychiatric facility. Of the 163 surveys distributed, 55 were returned (response rate=33.74 percent). The greatest number of skill requests (30.56 percent) were for assessment skills, mainly general physical assessment. To survive as a specialty, psychiatric nursing must include physical as well as psychologic assessments; psychiatric nurses must reintegrate a medical knowledge base while maintaining a balance with the psychodynamic aspects of care.</ab>

        <ab>The complexities and challenges of conducting nursing research with the frail elderly have been poorly identified in the nursing literature. This literature examines geriatric research issues but fails to examine issues involved in doing field research with any special population, including the frail elderly. In-depth consideration of the special problems associated with studying the elderly generally, or the frail elderly specifically, are omitted. These two groups differ based on extent of functional impairment. Due to market constraints, a specialized text on gerontological nursing research simply does not exist. Although some articles about doing nursing research with frail elders exist, the issues raised in these articles are limited. The most popular issues in the nursing literature about doing research with the elderly have related to ethics (e.g., Archbold, 1981; Davis, 1981; Wolanin, 1980, 1984). Although ethical issues are important, knowledge of ethics does not solve the complex, practical problems of formulating conceptualizations and designing measures and procedures for studying the frail elderly.</ab>

        <ab>Secondary data are increasingly incorporated into nursing research studies, as nurses seek to capture and address the complexity of patient care. There is, however, little discussion in methodological literature about this type of data; the meaning is taken for granted and the data are regarded as simple sources of information, which are convenient and cost-effective. This approach denies the social meaning of the data, and is likely to lead to misinterpretation of the content. This paper discusses these analytical issues with reference to a research study which used secondary data (nursing care plans) in an examination of the ways in which nurses assess their patients. Using this data led to an increased understanding of the social world in which assessment took place.</ab>

        <ab>The elderly are at particular risk for drug misuse and abuse, yet this problem is underdiagnosed. Drug misuse is the underuse, overuse, or erratic use of a drug. Drug abuse is the use of a drug for other than its intended purpose. A thorough nursing assessment is essential to detect and correct drug misuse and to diagnose drug abuse. In this paper methods to prevent and correct drug misuse and abuse are discussed. Case studies are used to illustrate the complexity of the problem.</ab>
