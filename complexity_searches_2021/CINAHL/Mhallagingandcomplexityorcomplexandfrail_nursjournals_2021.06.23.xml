        <ab>Background: Improved methods of communication are needed among professionals in related fields to address the increasing complexity of clinical situations and various levels of functioning experienced by older adults who live in nursing homes. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore function-focused clinical communication among nurses and providers based on the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) approach toward interdisciplinary collaboration to maintain function among nursing home residents and to identify the characteristics of SBAR flows in nursing homes. Methods: Detailed interviews with 28 interdisciplinary professionals working in four nursing homes were conducted. Directed qualitative content analysis was used to identify the internal attributes of SBAR-based communication. Case analysis was conducted to identify SBAR flows. Results: Four themes emerged as key factors for function-focused interdisciplinary staff communication in nursing homes. Effective nursing care to maintain function among nursing home residents requires accurate awareness of abnormal circumstances. Knowledge of assessment and resident background are needed to address situations requiring intervention and identify the problems underlying a resident's current state. The optimal therapeutic environment is created by sharing roles and tasks among practitioners through referrals. Twelve generalized situations requiring function-focused communication (i.e., dislocation of body line because of joint contracture, change in walking, difficulty of moving because of pain, difficulty in eating, fever, change in sleep pattern, change in excretion pattern, change in weight, change in condition, change in problematic behavior, decrease in cognitive function, and change in relationships) and the related nurse-centered SBAR pathways were identified. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: These results represent a first prototype for developing practical communication guidelines for nursing-home-specific function-focused care and provide new insights into the interdisciplinary approach.</ab>

        <ab>• The program enhanced wellness and healthcare access among medically complex, lower income, older adults living in subsidized apartment buildings. • Health care utilization among participating residents showed a reduction in emergency department visits and hospital admissions. • Positive changes in student perception of interprofessional practice occurred in two areas: teamwork and collaboration and person-centeredness Background/Purpose: An innovative care coordination program was developed to enhance wellness among low-income older adults living in subsidized apartment buildings and to provide rich interprofessional education experiences for health professions students. Program effectiveness for the residents was measured through an evaluation of participation, services used, and healthcare utilization. Educational effectiveness was measured through a change in health concepts and perceptions of interprofessional practice. Health care utilization among participating residents showed an 8.6% reduction in emergency department visits and 9.8% reduction in hospital admissions. Students demonstrated improved knowledge in motivational interviewing (p =.02); diabetes (p =.02); hypertension (p ≤.01); and frailty (p ≤.01). Changes in students perception of interprofessional practice were significant in two areas; Teamwork and Collaboration (p ≥.00); and Person Centeredness (p =.00). This care coordination model may be an effective approach to reduce care resource utilization among medically complex lower income older adults and provides a rich interprofessional learning experience for students.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: to analyze the spatial distribution of elder abuse in Ribeirão Preto-SP, according to victims' place of residence and event. Method: an ecological study that analyzed 1,153 elder abuse police reports (2009 to 2013). Local gross and empirical Bayesian rates and Local Moran's I were calculated. Results: there was a heterogeneous distribution of concentration of sectors with a high incidence rate surrounded by neighbors with also high rates, considering place of residence. In contrast, analysis by place of occurrence showed a greater concentration in the central areas of the municipality. More than 80% of cases of violence occurred at their own homes and with spatial dependence on distribution by occurrence up to a 5,000 m distance from their places of residence. Conclusion: data reinforce that violence is a complex phenomenon, affecting several social strata, including in central urban areas and in elderly people families' own context.</ab>

Método: estudio ecológico, que analizó 1.153 denuncias de violencia contra el adulto mayor (2009 a 2013). Se calcularon las tasas bayesianas crudas y empíricas locales y el índice de Moran local. Resultados: hubo una distribución heterogénea de la concentración de sectores con alta tasa de incidencia rodeados de vecinos con tasas también altas, considerando el lugar de residencia. En contraste, el análisis por lugar de ocurrencia mostró una mayor concentración en las áreas centrales del municipio. Más del 80% de los casos de violencia ocurrieron en el propio domicilio y con dependencia espacial de la distribución por ocurrencia hasta una distancia de 5.000 m del lugar de residencia. Conclusión: los datos refuerzan el hecho de que la violencia es un fenómeno complejo, que afecta a varios estratos sociales, incluso en las zonas urbanas centrales y en el propio contexto familiar de los adultos mayores.</ab>
        <ab>Objetivo: analisar a distribuição espacial da violência contra idosos em Ribeirão Preto -- SP, segundo local de residência da vítima e de ocorrência do evento. Método: estudo ecológico, que analisou 1.153 Boletins de Ocorrência de violência contra idosos (2009 a 2013). Foram calculadas taxas bruta e bayesiana empírica local e Índice Moran local. Resultados: evidenciouse uma distribuição heterogênea da concentração de setores com alta taxa de incidência circundados por vizinhos com taxas também elevadas, considerando o local de residência. Em contrapartida, a análise por local de ocorrência demonstrou maior concentração nas áreas centrais do município. Mais de 80% dos casos de violência ocorreram nos próprios domicílios e com dependência espacial da distribuição por ocorrência até uma distância de 5.000 m do local de residência. Conclusão: os dados reforçam o fato da violência ser fenômeno complexo, que acomete diversas camadas sociais, inclusive em áreas centrais urbanas e no próprio contexto familiar do idoso.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Increasing numbers of frail elderly people living at home but dependent on supportive care will face complex oral health challenges. Objectives: To investigate the associations of frailty status with oral cleaning habits and oral hygiene taking into account the effects of preventive oral health intervention among home care clients aged 75 or over. Methods: Data were gathered by interviews and clinical oral examinations at baseline and after a 6‐month follow‐up. Frailty status was evaluated at baseline using the abbreviated comprehensive geriatric assessment (aCGA) scale, which consists of 15 questions from three different domains: cognitive status, functional status and depression. A total of 231 home care clients completed the aCGA at baseline and the interview and clinical oral examination both at baseline and after the follow‐up. Results: Using the aCGA classification with at least one score in the ≥2 domain, 62% of clients were classified as frail at baseline. They had poorer oral cleaning habits and hygiene, and they had lost more teeth than nonfrail participants. Multivariate analysis showed that being frail at baseline was statistically significantly associated with a lower frequency of toothbrushing and denture cleaning (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1–0.9 and OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1–0.8) at baseline, but not after the follow‐up. Membership in the intervention group was associated with better oral cleaning at the follow‐up. However, among the frail participants, toothbrushing frequency was still significantly lower and oral hygiene poorer than among the nonfrail group. Conclusions: Oral cleaning habits of frail elderly people were slightly improved as a result of external support, which had a positive effect on oral hygiene. Individual preventive actions in the context of oral health and hygiene should be integrated into the daily care plan of home care clients with the first signs of frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Why you should read this article: • To recognise that identifying frailty is important to support older people living with complex needs • To be aware that a frailty screening and assessment tool should be used that is most appropriate for the clinician's service • To understand that collaborative working can improve care and reduce hospital admissions for older people living with frailty Identifying frailty is essential to support older people living with complex health and social care needs. This article discusses how a Florence Nightingale Foundation travel scholar used her scholarship to explore best practice in identifying frailty in acute and community settings in Scotland with the aim of developing services for people living with frailty locally and regionally in England. As the move to integrated care services develops in England, valuable insights from Scotland will assist in the proactive design of bespoke services around the needs of individuals in the community and, when acutely unwell, in the hospital setting.</ab>

        <ab>The number of older people living with complex health conditions is increasing, with the majority of these managed in primary and community settings. Many models of care have been developed to support them, however, there is mixed evidence on their value and they include multiple overlapping components. We aimed to synthesise the evidence to learn what works for managing complex conditions in older people in primary and community care. We carried out a state‐of‐the‐art review of systematic reviews. We searched three databases (January 2009 to July 2019) for models of primary and community care for long‐term conditions, frailty, multimorbidity and complex neurological conditions common to older people such as dementia. We narratively synthesised review findings to summarise the evidence for each model type and identify components which influenced effectiveness. Out of 2,129 unique titles and abstracts, 178 full texts were reviewed and 54 systematic reviews were included. We found that the models of care were more likely to improve depressive symptoms and mental health outcomes than physical health or service use outcomes. Interventions including self‐management, patient education, assessment with follow‐up care procedures, and structured care processes or pathways had greater evidence of effectiveness. The level of healthcare service integration appeared to be more important than inclusion of specific professional types within a team. However, more experienced and qualified nurses were associated with better outcomes. These conclusions are limited by the overlap between reviews, reliance on vote counting within some included reviews and the quality of study reports. In conclusion, primary and community care interventions for complex conditions in older people should include: (a) clear intervention targets; (b) explicit theoretical underpinnings; and (c) elements of self‐management and patient education, structured collaboration between healthcare professionals and professional support. Further work needs to determine the optimal intensity, length, team composition and role of technology in interventions.</ab>

        <ab>The U.S. population is aging, supported in part by continued development of life-prolonging medical therapies and technologies. These innovations, including kidney replacement therapies, have been effective in providing additional options to patients facing serious illness, but they have also introduced a new level of complexity in the provider assessment of treatment for these patients. Health care providers are being tasked to decide if medical care is appropriate for an aging and medically complex population, a decision complicated by a variety of factors. Patient-focused conversations surrounding goals of care, prognosis, medical futility, and quality of life need to become part of the routine practice pattern for nephrology care in the United States.</ab>

        <ab>This is the first article in a six-part series in Nursing Older People exploring the nursing care of people living with advanced dementia. This article discusses the changes that may occur as dementia progresses, from the perspective of the individual, their family and other carers. A person living with advanced dementia is likely to experience physical, cognitive and social changes that can be profound and debilitating. Healthcare needs intensify as new and co-existing issues result in increasing dependency on others for support with activities of daily living. These activities can include eating, drinking, mobility and personal care. Consequently, family carers may find their role has to develop and change to provide increasing support in response to these complex needs. These increasing needs can result in care transitions to hospitals or care homes. Careful and collaborative management of care is crucial to maintain quality of life for the person with dementia and family carers.</ab>

        <ab>Background With the increasing age and complex comorbidities of dialysis patients globally, there has been increased attention to planning for end of life care (EoLC) and advanced care directives. Objectives We sought to understand the thoughts and experiences of dialysis patients in relation to EoLC planning. Methods An eight-question closed-ended survey at two time points 12 months apart through our Renal Supportive Care Program. All people undergoing dialysis in the service were invited to participate. Results There were good response rates to the survey at both time points (T) (T1 n=224 T2 n=247) and, for the majority, planning for EoLC was considered to be very important (80%). However, only 23% reported having a conversation with their healthcare provider regarding advanced care directives and only 30% had documented their future care goals. At T2 there was an increased awareness of planning in this population which resulted in an improvement in advanced care directives (40%). This study suggests that there is a subgroup of patients who are aware of advanced care directives but do not have any in place. Conclusion There is an ongoing reluctance in dialysis units by patients to have a conversation with their healthcare providers regarding advance care directives despite this population being at heightened risk of deterioration. This is likely impacting on the delivery of complex and possibly unnecessary and unwanted invasive care in the last year/s of life.</ab>

        <ab>The ability to heal an acute traumatic wound or wounds is a complex matrix of overlapping biological processes impacted by intrinsic and extrinsic human factors. As we age, the body's physiological resilience is compromised and homeostasis becomes difficult to maintain. This scoping review examines the influence of biological ageing and the impact of age-related concerns on wound healing, including frailty, malnutrition, pre-existing medical conditions and clinician practices. Frailty rather than age was seen to have a greater physiological impact on outcome, resilience and healing. Clinician support, education and engagement were fundamental to achieve acute wound healing in the aged population. With an increasing ageing population, specialised knowledge, guidelines and structures to support geriatric care are recommended for best clinical practice.</ab>

        <ab>An introduction to the journal is presented that focuses on diabetes management, including key considerations involved in setting glycemic goals and making decisions on diabetes treatment approaches for older adults during hospitalizations, the complex interplay between the needs of older adults with diabetes living in nursing homes and barriers to their care posed by the realities of life in a long-term care facility, and palliative and end-of-life care for older people with diabetes.</ab>

        <ab>The prevalence of diabetes is increasing, especially in older people, mainly because of an increase in life expectancy. The number of comorbidities also increases with increasing age, leading to a unique diabetes phenotype in old age that includes vascular disease, physical and neuropathic complications, and mental dysfunction. These three categories of complications appear to have a synergistic effect that can lead to a vicious cycle of deterioration into disability. Early assessment and appropriate, timely interventions may delay adverse outcomes. However, this complex phenotype constitutes a great challenge for health care professionals. This article reviews the complex diabetes phenotype in old age and explores management strategies that are predominantly based on the overall functional status of patients within this heterogeneous age-group.</ab>

        <ab>Diabetes affects a large number of patients in the long-term care (LTC) setting, and their care is often complicated because of multimorbidity, diabetes-related complications, disability, dependency on caregivers, and geriatric syndromes, including frailty and cognitive impairment. This population includes patients receiving short-term rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities, those who are residents in LTC facilities, and those receiving palliative or end-of-life care. An individualized approach to care based on clinical complexity, diabetes trajectory, and patients' preferences and goals is required. Such patients may experience one or more transitions of care and decline in condition. They are also prone to adverse drug events, cardiovascular events, and hypoglycemia. Facility-related challenges include varying staff competencies and practitioner preferences, inconsistent interdisciplinary communication, overly complex medication regimens, and poorly implemented care transitions.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To conduct a screening, skin examination and risk assessment of patients with pressure ulcers (PUs) in one Swedish county (inpatient, primary and community care) with follow-up after six months to investigate ulcer healing, frequency of amputation and mortality rate linked to preventive measures. Method: The methodology recommended by the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel was used. Screening, risk assessment and skin examination were performed during March 2017. The modified Norton scale was used to assess PU risk, with a score of ≤20 indicating presence of risk. A research questionnaire was used to document prevention and treatment. Follow-up was performed after six months, during September 2017. The same research questionnaire was used to capture the current situation of the patients, including ulcer healing, frequency of amputation, and mortality rate. Results: Screening covered 464 patients: 303 hospitalised, 68 in community care, and 93 in primary care. A total of 110 patients—55 at risk of PU and 55 with PUs, the majority of which were category 2–4 PUs—were included in the study. At follow-up, 67% were treated in community care, 32% in primary care, and 1% in hospital. Mortality rate for patients with PUs was 44%. Of the remaining 31 patients, 17 had unhealed PUs, 10 had healed PUs, two had undergone amputation, and complete follow-up data was missing in the remaining two patients. Conclusion: These results reflect the complex situation of an aged and frail patient group, including a lack of preventive measures and follow-up routines in community and primary care.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults who experience challenges related to mental health are unlikely to seek professional help. The voices of older adults who have navigated through mental health issues and systems of care to arrive at psychological treatment are less well understood. We conducted individual interviews with 15 adults aged 61 to 86 who sought psychological treatment. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using narrative methods. We identified several main storylines that describe the meaning-making and treatment-seeking journeys of older adults: resistance to being labeled with mental health problems (telling stories of resistance, defining mental health issues in mysterious and uncontrollable terms, and experiencing internal role conflict); muddling through the help-seeking process (manifestations of chaos and system-level barriers); and emotional reactions to psychological treatment (hope, fear, and mistrust). Findings add to the literature base in the area of narrative gerontology, and highlight the complex experiences that older adults face when seeking psychological treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The primary health care services are becoming increasingly complex, which presents challenges for the municipal nursing services. In Norway, municipal in-patient acute care (MipAC) has been introduced in all municipalities, and the competence at the services has been questioned. Few studies have examined the nursing services in the units. This study aims to get an overview of the nursing competence in those units across geographical regions, and different groups of organisation and localisation. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, and an ad hoc questionnaire was distributed to first-line leaders in all the MipAC units in Norway. Data were collected in the period between 6 March 2019 to 6 June 2019. Measures to get an overview of the nursing competence were ratio of registered nurses (RNs) in staff, count of shifts with only one RN on duty and count of RNs with master's degrees/specialisation. Descriptive comparative statistics were used. Results: Of all 226 first-line leaders invited to participate, 207 (91.6%) responded to the questionnaire. Overall a considerable variance across the sample was revealed. The median ratio of RNs in staff was 56 (IQR = 40–70), the count of shifts with only one RN on duty median 28 (IQR = 5–49), and the count of RNs with a master's degree or specialisation median 3 (IQR = 0–5). The regions of Northern and Central Norway, MipACs located in nursing home and MipACs organised at long-term care units, showed significantly lower nursing competence in staff compared to the remaining institution and organisations. Conclusion: This study generates knowledge that can inform planning, priorities and interventions that may be initiated at all organisational and political levels concerning the MipAC services. An overall conclusion is that advanced nursing competence is lacking. The study also highlights the most urgent direction for improvements regarding nursing competence in the services. It seemed to be MipACs in Northern and Central Norway, and those located at nursing homes organised together with long-term care units, that needed improvements the most.</ab>

        <ab>• Frailty is closely associated with falls, and both with disability and death. • A proprioception training during one year in community older adults was carried out. • The mean number of falls in the frail and pre-frail individuals decreased. • The fear of falls and anthropometric parameters improved. • The participants improved their frail phenotype, decreasing frailty. Frailty and falls are closely associated with each other as well as with disability, hospitalization, and death. Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.</ab>

        <ab>Measuring the impact of care delivered at home for frail older people is a complex task given many confounding variables that may impact on the ability of service providers to identify the direct impact of their programs on their clients' well-being and quality of life. The recent publication of the 2018 Wellness and Reablement Report Outcomes indicated that organizations lack formal processes to measure the impact of their programs on service users. There are therefore limited data exits on measuring outcomes and the performance of the ACCOM tool in the real world. Knowledge of a strong causal relationship between services provided and outcomes enables confidence in assuming the care provided was largely responsible for the outcome achieved. This paper will reflect on the experiences of one service provider in Brisbane, in implementing the Australian Community Care Outcomes Measurement (ACCOM) tool to measure and demonstrate the impact of their programs.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the environmental landscape on the physical activity of older persons experiencing frailty. Background: This manuscript describes the second phase of an unpublished larger study in the northern province of Lampang, Thailand. Phase One revealed that 14% of 1,788 older persons surveyed were found to have experienced frailty according to Fried's frailty phenotypes, and low physical activity was associated with frailty. In the light of frailty, how older persons experience physical activity in their day‐to‐day living environments warrants in‐depth exploration. Design: This was a qualitative study guided by narrative inquiry. Methods: In‐depth interviews and observations were conducted with 13 older persons living with frailty. The method of analysis was thematic and performance analysis. Results: Two broad themes relating to the environmental landscapes were as follows: (a) limiting environmental landscapes and (b) engaging environmental landscapes. These landscapes, which change across time, refer to physical and social spaces, and beliefs of older persons and their family that have either positive or negative impacts on physical activity of frail older persons. Conclusion: Complex interactions between physical and social spaces and beliefs of older persons and family influence the physical activity behaviours of older persons living with frailty. Implications for practice: This study warrants education and policy aiming at creating optimal environmental landscapes to promote physical activity in frail older persons.</ab>

        <ab>Heart failure (HF) is a life‐limiting condition with a poor prognosis and unpredictable disease trajectory. HF brings physical and emotional challenges for patients and their carers. Predominantly the informal carer population consists of older females, however, caring is evolving as longevity increases and complex conditions are becoming more commonplace. Consequently, more men and younger people are contributing to daily care. The aim of this study was to explore the positive as well as negative dimensions of caring in HF across a range of carer characteristics. Fourteen semi‐structured interviews were conducted with informal carers of people with HF in the UK (median age 71; female 10). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed with the assistance of NVivo10 using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Findings from the study demonstrated that most participants considered caring as integral to their relationships. Dimensions facilitating positivity in caring included compassion, thoughtfulness and understanding. An ability to cope was influenced by a range of attributes including quality of relationships in the carer/patient dyad and with formal social care providers who offered access to tailored and timely information and support. The unpredictable HF disease trajectory influenced the carer experience and enhanced the challenges encountered. The information needs of carers were not always adequately met and younger adult carers expressed particular difficulties with appropriate information and support. Expectations of our informal carer population are increasing and evolving. Health and social care policy requires innovative proposals for the funding and delivery of health and social care that has the contribution made by informal carers at its core.</ab>

        <ab>Personal health budgets (PHBs) are being promoted in England as expanding the benefits of choice and control to individuals with healthcare needs. National Health Service (NHS) money is provided to eligible people to use as set out in approved care plans, including direct employment of personal assistants (PAs). The government plans to increase NHS‐funded PHBs and to further introduce integrated personal budgets (IPBs). This potentially creates more demand for directly employed or self‐employed PAs with health‐related skills. The objective of this paper is to report findings from interviews with PAs (n = 105) and key informants (n = 26) from across England, undertaken between October 2016 and August 2017, about the potential for the PA workforce to undertake 'health‐related' tasks as facilitated by the introduction of PHBs. PAs were purposefully recruited to ensure the sample included participants from different geographical locations. Key informants were purposefully selected based on their knowledge of policy and community services. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. This paper focuses on reporting qualitative findings, which are set within the theoretical framework of normalisation process theory to explore implementation challenges of PHBs. The majority (64%) of PAs confirmed that they saw their current roles as congruent with PHBs, were willing to engage with PHBs and undertake health‐related tasks. However, 74% of PAs said they would need additional training if enacting such roles. Key informant interviews appraised the development of PHBs as complex, noting incongruences arising from NHS and social care‐funded PAs carrying out similar roles within different organisational systems. We conclude the current PA workforce is willing to take on PHB work and is likely to interweave this with work funded by PBs and self‐funding care users. Implications include the need for careful consideration of training requirements and delivery for PHB‐funded PAs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Registered nurses are key figures in municipal home health care for older adults. Thus, registered nurses' leadership is crucial to a successful and preventive care process as well as a supportive organization in order to achieve safe care. However, there is limited research on what registered nurses' leadership implies close to older adults in municipal home health care. Thus, the aim is to compile and critically evaluate how international research results describe registered nurses' leadership close to older adults in municipal home health care. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with a qualitative research study. The main search was conducted on 20 April 2018. The review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines and is registered in the PROSPERO database (ID# CRD42019109206). Nine articles from PubMed and CINAHL meet the quality criteria. A synthesis of data was performed in four stages according to qualitative research synthesis. Results: Ten themes describe what registered nurses' leadership close to older adults in municipal home health care entails: trust and control; continuous learning; competence through knowledge and ability; nursing responsibility on an organizational level; application of skills; awareness of the individual's needs and wholeness; mutual support; mutual relationships; collaborating on organizational and interpersonal levels; and exposure to challenges. Conclusions: Registered nurses leading close to older adults in municipal home health care implies being multi-artists. Nursing education, including specialist education for registered nurses, should prepare individuals for their unique and complex leadership role as a multi-artist. Municipal employers require knowledge about what registered nurses' leadership implies in order to create adequate conditions for their leadership objectives to achieve safe care. Further research is warranted to explore registered nurses' leadership close to older adults in municipal home health care from different perspectives, such as older adults and next of kin.</ab>

        <ab>Researchers propose that the convoy of care model should be used to study care networks of frail, older individuals. Care convoys are defined as the evolving collection of individuals who may or may not have close personal connections to the recipient or to one another, but who provide care, including help with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), socio-emotional care, skilled health care, monitoring, and advocacy. This study reports on community-dwelling older adults' experiences of their care convoy, how care convoys change over time, and perceived (positive) outcomes. A qualitative analysis among 65 semi-structured interviews with frail, community-dwelling older adults demonstrates a great variety in the composition of care convoys. Participants were often actively involved in their care convoy and valued the social/relational aspect of care. Care and support covered a wide range of activities, with some activities being provided by specific types of caregivers. Participants expressed the adequacy of their care convoy in terms of satisfaction and sufficiency. Noteworthy, participants who were satisfied with their care convoy did not necessarily receive sufficient help. Policies and practice should recognize the relational aspect of care, the complex interplay between all actors, and the dynamic character of care convoys.</ab>

        <ab>Background: When the ageing population increases, the burden and responsibility of close family members will likely increase. Those closely related who assume a great responsibility can be significantly affected in health, well‐being and daily life. Aim: This study aims to describe the life situation when family caregivers are imposed responsibility for an older person with complex care needs in their own home. Methods: In this Swedish qualitative study, ten family caregivers were strategically selected in order to achieve variations in the life situation. A reflective lifeworld research design based on phenomenological philosophy was used throughout the data collection with the lifeworld interviews and the analytic process. Findings: In terms of extensive responsibility, the life situation is complex and involves emotions that are difficult to manage. In essence, a paradoxical life situation is described which is experienced as both voluntarily and nonchosen at the same time. The responsibility never rests. The essential meaning is further illustrated with three constituents: loss of freedom, contradictory feelings and affected relationships. Conclusion: A life situation with extensive responsibility for an older family member interferes with the whole life situation with an impact on health and relationships with other people. The findings are crucial for professional caregivers in order to capture the nature of family support in a way that enables a meaningful life for both the family caregiver and the older person being cared for. Knowledge of this will give professional caregivers an increased awareness of the life situation of family caregivers and provide a better understanding of the support they are longing for, and, in some countries, such as Sweden, also are entitled to by law.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many family care partners are involved in making help‐seeking choices. The aim of this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still maintaining their own dignity. Methods: Data were collected in 2009–2010 in open semi‐structured interviews and follow‐up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an in‐depth data analysis. Results: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the follow‐up of policy for older people.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: The lack of coordination of care for complex patients in the hematology setting has prompted nurse case managers (NCMs) to coordinate that care. OBJECTIVES: This article aimed to identify the frequency of NCM care coordination activities and quality and resource use outcomes in the complex care of patients in the hematology setting. METHODS: NCM aggregate data from complex outpatients with hematologic cancer were retrieved from electronic health records at a comprehensive cancer center in the midwestern United States. Total volume of activities and outcomes were calculated as frequency and percentage. FINDINGS: Care coordination activities included communicating; monitoring, following up, and responding to change; and creating a proactive plan of care. Quality outcomes included improving continuity of care and change in health behavior, and resource use outcomes most documented were patient healthcare cost savings.</ab>

        <ab>GENERAL PURPOSE: To provide information about changes associated with aging skin and the implications for wound care practitioners. TARGET AUDIENCE: This continuing education activity is intended for physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses with an interest in skin and wound care. LEARNING OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES: After participating in this educational activity, the participant should be better able to: 1. Describe proposed biologic theories of aging and the biology of aging skin. 2. Discuss the clinical consequences of aging skin and the implications for wound care practitioners. Aging is a complex phenomenon manifested by macromolecular damage, adverse changes to the genome, blunted immunologic function, alterations in body composition, and decreased adaptation to stress. Understanding the changes that skin undergoes with age is essential for wound care practitioners. Accordingly, this article will introduce the reader to theories of aging, the biologic changes associated with aging skin, and clinical considerations for the wound care practitioner, including the concepts of skin failure, Skin Changes At Life's End, and frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Terminally ill patients at their end-of-life (EOL) phase attending the emergency department (ED) may have complex and specialized care needs frequently overlooked by ED physicians. To tailor to the needs of this unique group, the ED in a tertiary hospital implemented an EOL pathway since 2014. The objective of our study is to describe the epidemiological characteristics, symptom burden and management of patients using a protocolized management care bundle. Methods: We conducted an observational study on the database of EOL patients over a 28-month period. Patients aged 21 years and above, who attended the ED and were managed according to these guidelines, were included. Clinical data were extracted from the hospital's electronic medical records system. Results: Two hundred five patients were managed under the EOL pathway, with a slight male predominance (106/205, 51.7%) and a median age of 78 (interquartile range 69-87) years. The majority were chronically frail (42.0%) or diagnosed with cancer or other terminal illnesses (32.7%). The 3 most commonly experienced symptoms were drowsiness (66.3%), dyspnea (61.5%), and fever (29.7%). Through the protocolized management care bundle, 74.1% of patients with dyspnea and/or pain received opiates while 59.5% with copious secretions received hyoscine butylbromide for symptomatic relief. Conclusion: The institution of a protocolized care bundle is feasible and provides ED physicians with a guide in managing EOL patients. Though still suboptimal, considerable advances in EOL care at the ED have been achieved and may be further improved through continual education and enhancements in the care bundle.</ab>

        <ab>Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Improving our understanding of the complex relationship between health and social care utilisation is vital as populations age. This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence on the relationship between older adults' use of social care and their healthcare utilisation. Ten databases were searched for international literature on social care (exposure), healthcare use (outcome) and older adults (population). Searches were carried out in October 2016, and updated May 2018. Studies were eligible if they were published after 2000 in a high income country, examined the relationship between use of social care and healthcare utilisation by older adults (aged ≥60 years), and controlled for an indicator of need. Study quality and bias were rated using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross‐Sectional Studies. Study data were extracted and a narrative synthesis was conducted. Data were not suitable for quantitative synthesis. Thirteen studies were identified from 12,065 citations. Overall, the quality and volume of evidence was low. There was limited evidence to suggest that longer lengths of stay in care homes were associated with a lower risk of inpatient admissions. Residents of care homes with onsite nursing had fewer than expected admissions to hospital, compared to people in care homes without nursing, and adjusting for need. Evidence for other healthcare use outcomes was even more limited and heterogeneous, with notable gaps in primary care. We conclude that older adults' use of care homes may moderate inpatient admissions. In particular, the presence of registered nurses in care homes may reduce the need to transfer residents to hospital. However, further evidence is needed to add weight to this conclusion. Future research should build on this evidence and address gaps regarding the influence of community based social care on older adults' healthcare use. A greater focus on primary care outcomes is imperative.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Few empirical studies have examined strengths and support of older people in circumstances of precarity. A better understanding of this problem has the potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery. Purpose: To investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana. Method: More than 300 hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for low‐income older persons and two senior citizen centres. Results: The findings demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home‐based healthcare services, (b) stress after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home‐based services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships and activities, and (i) grocery store and café contacts. Conclusion: Home‐based services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services. Implications for practice: This study adds to the literature about precarity among community‐based older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home‐based services are necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths and supportive resources of older people.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine effects of a multifactorial program for preventing the frailty of older adults and effects of a follow-up program applying a capacity building strategy. Methods: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used for the nonequivalent control group. The follow-up group (n=75) and non-follow-up group (n=68) received the same multifactorial program comprising muscle strength exercise, cognitive training, and psychosocial programs for 12 weeks. After completion of multifactorial program, the follow-up group took follow-up programs applying the capacity building strategy for following 12 weeks. The data of physical function, cognitive function, and psychological function, and self-rated health were collected from both groups three times: before intervention, after intervention, and 12 weeks after intervention. The data were analyzed using x2 test and t-test. Results: In comparison with the non-follow-up group, the scores of Timed Up &amp; Go Test, and physical activities energy expenditure were significantly improved in the follow-up group. Conclusion: These results indicate that a multifactorial program with follow-up adapting the strategies of capacity building for the older adults group is feasible to prevent the physical frailty in community.</ab>

        <ab>With the increasingly ageing population worldwide, more older people are living with diabetes. The conditions that often accompany older age, such as dementia, renal impairment, visual impairment and manual dexterity difficulties, can make diabetes management complex and self-care challenging. However, the status of older people varies considerably, and so choice of glucose-lowering agents and clinical targets should be individualised to maximise safety and ensure that the risks of treatments do not outweigh the benefits. For many patients, there will be an increasing dependence on others to manage their diabetes care, so an appropriate skill mix among healthcare professionals and carers, adequate training and regular competency assessment are crucial to support patients to remain safe and symptom free from diabetes.</ab>

        <ab>Understanding how informal care impacts formal care utilisation for home‐based end‐of‐life patients is an important policy‐ and practice‐relevant question. This paper aims to assess the relationship between informal and formal home care among home‐based end‐of‐life patients and how this relationship has changed over the last decade and over the end‐of‐life trajectory. We focus on informal care provided by family members or friends, and three types of home‐based formal care services: care by personal support workers, physician visits, and nurse visits. Using survey data collected in a home‐based end‐of‐life care programme in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2016, we build a two‐part utilisation model analysing both the propensity to use each type of formal care and the amount of formal care received by patients. The results suggest that informal care is a substitute for care by personal support workers, but a complement to physician visits and nurse visits. In the case of nurse visits, an increased complementary effect is observed in more recent years. For home‐based physician and nurse visits, the complementary effect grows with patient's proximity to death. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between informal and formal care among home‐based end‐of‐life patients. Decision‐makers need to take into account the relationship between informal care and different types of formal services when introducing future policies.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to describe how EL was eased, as narrated by frail older people. Background: Existential loneliness (EL) is an unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older people, the experience of EL can be reduced. Design: In this qualitative study, we used an exploratory and descriptive design. Methods: The study was based on 22 narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were receiving long‐term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis. Results: Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the rear‐view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract themselves. Conclusion: Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person‐centred care and create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherness. Implications for practice: If frail older people's ongoing processes of adjusting and accepting their situation are understood and confirmed by people in their environment, for example, by nurses, family and friends, the experience of living a meaningful life can be supported, which, in turn, can ease EL.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is an advance care planning tool designed for seriously ill patients. The discussions needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not occur in the outpatient setting. Objective: We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. Setting/Participants: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. Measurements: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items about the intervention. Results: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers agreed or strongly agreed that "Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about what I really want." Conclusions: The POLST facilitation can be successfully delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Integrated care is increasingly promoted as an effective and cost‐effective way to organise care for community‐dwelling frail older people with complex problems but the question remains whether high expectations are justified. Our study aims to systematically review the empirical evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for community‐dwelling frail older people and close attention is paid to the elements and levels of integration of the interventions. We searched nine databases for eligible studies until May 2016 with a comparison group and reporting at least one outcome regarding effectiveness or cost‐effectiveness. We identified 2,998 unique records and, after exclusions, selected 46 studies on 29 interventions. We assessed the quality of the included studies with the Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk‐of‐bias tool. The interventions were described following Rainbow Model of Integrated Care framework by Valentijn. Our systematic review reveals that the majority of the reported outcomes in the studies on preventive, integrated care show no effects. In terms of health outcomes, effectiveness is demonstrated most often for seldom‐reported outcomes such as well‐being. Outcomes regarding informal caregivers and professionals are rarely considered and negligible. Most promising are the care process outcomes that did improve for preventive, integrated care interventions as compared to usual care. Healthcare utilisation was the most reported outcome but we found mixed results. Evidence for cost‐effectiveness is limited. High expectations should be tempered given this limited and fragmented evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for frail older people. Future research should focus on unravelling the heterogeneity of frailty and on exploring what outcomes among frail older people may realistically be expected.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with frailty among the young‐old elderly (YOE) and old–old elderly (OOE). METHODS: This longitudinal study with a 3‐year follow‐up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS: Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3‐year period. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent frailty, we suggest weight‐loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower‐limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. Implications for Nursing Practice: The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Heart disease is the most significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in older adults. Care decisions are complex because patients may have multiple comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Additionally, older adults often have vague symptomology, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and a reported delay of treatment. Although multiple clinical guidelines are available, the applicability of guidelines to the older population needs to be evaluated based on a holistic, individualized basis. Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes and priorities, incorporating risk-benefit assessment, quality of life, functional assessment, and frailty assessment when making treatment decisions. Highlights • Older adults are a heterogeneous group who require complex care decisions for coronary heart disease. • There are gaps in recommendations for care in many evidence-based guidelines. • Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes, incorporating analysis of risk benefit and quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Wound care in older adults is complex. A logical, structured approach should be taken, using a nursing process such as assessing, planning, implementing and evaluating. This clinical focus paper outlines the nursing process to support wound care in this patient group. It recommends considering dressing selection as a cost-effective, prescribing decision because of the risks and comorbidities associated with these patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Despite the frequency of hospital readmissions, there is still a relatively incomplete understanding of the broader array of factors pertaining to readmission in older persons. Few studies have explored how older persons experience readmission and their perceptions of circumstances affecting the course of care. Research indicates that males experience poorer health outcomes and are at higher risk of readmission compared to women. Aim: To explore life conditions and critical incidents pertained to hospital readmission from the perspective of older males. Methods: The study used a qualitative explorative design using the Critical Incident Technique. A purposive sample of four males aged 65–75 were recruited from two internal medical wards. Data were collected through narrative double interviews. The study was registered by the North Denmark Region's joint notification of health research (ID 2008‐58‐0028). Findings: The analysis revealed four themes of life conditions: 'Ambiguity of ageing', 'Living with the burden of illness', 'Realisation of dependency' and 'Growing sense of vulnerability and mortality'. Critical incidents comprised four areas: 'Balancing demands and resources in everyday life', 'Back home again – a period of recovery', 'Care interaction' and 'Navigating within and between healthcare system(s)'. Conclusion: This study illustrated the interconnectedness, dynamics and complexity of life conditions and critical incidents that over time and across diverse healthcare sectors affected the course of care in older persons. Hospital readmissions seem related to a complex web of interacting life conditions and critical incidents rather than growing age or specific illnesses.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the development of an ambulatory community service that demonstrates multidisciplinary working to meet the diverse needs of frail older people and their carers. The service comprises advanced nurse practitioners, a pharmacist, a community navigator, consultants, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, a nurse, rehabilitation assistants, a healthcare assistant and an administrator. This multidisciplinary team (MDT) serves adults with complex medical and rehabilitation needs who are being discharged from hospital, staying in bedded rehabilitation units or living at home by offering assessments, investigations and rehabilitation, where appropriate closer to home. The aims of the service are to: keep people well, prevent unplanned hospital admissions, promote health and well-being, reduce the risk of falls, enable independent living and provide rehabilitation. Personalised care plans are developed with patients and their carers. Advanced nursing practice is demonstrated in assessment, investigation, diagnosis, management, referral and non-medical prescribing. Development of this MDT is required to support and promote integrated, evidence-based work. Such development leads to integrated care across communities, and bridges gaps between patients and carers, GPs, home, residential and hospital-based services, and the voluntary, statutory and non-statutory sectors.</ab>

        <ab>Therapeutic decision‐making for older patients with stage IV non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no identifiable activating mutation is complex. In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients ≥70 years of age were evaluated with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age was 76 (70–92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p &lt; 0.001) and GA group (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Care of older adults in the community is becoming increasingly complex. However, nursing staff often has insufficient knowledge and skills to adequately address the needs of frail older adults. There is therefore a need for nurses with advanced qualifications. To meet this need, advanced geriatric nursing has been introduced in Norway. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses with their new role as advanced geriatric nurses in care of older adults and to determine what strategies the nurses considered important in the development of their new role. Design: This study applied a descriptive, exploratory design. Methods: In‐depth interviews were conducted with 21 nurses who had undergone an educational programme to become advanced geriatric nurses in Norway in 2016. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The participants described a complex and extensive nursing role, which they related to a new understanding of the patients, relatives and the system in which they worked. This new gaze had developed based on a combination of their new knowledge, their skills, experiences and professional interests. The opportunities to use their role depended on their workplace conditions. They related to contextual challenges at their workplace in different ways to optimise the use of their new gaze. Conclusions: Common for all participants was a broader and deeper understanding of the patient's health and life situation, which guided participants' actions. The key issue in developing the new role was developing effective strategies to foster role integration. Implications for Practice: Advanced geriatric nurses should collaborate with their managers to create a role that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills, as well as collaborate with colleagues to enhance understanding of utilisation of their role.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Problems experienced by older people with complex needs to live at home have been reported in the literature. This qualitative study builds on previous research and investigates enduring issues older people face when interacting with healthcare services. Aim: To gain an in‐depth understanding of what is involved in providing good quality health care for older people who need support to live at home. Methodological design: We adopted an interpretive descriptive approach and conducted semi‐structured interviews with older people (n = 7), carers (n = 8) and key informants (n = 11). Initial and secondary analysis of qualitative data was completed. Findings: Major themes emerged about meanings of partnership in health care, and invisibility of the older person as a partner in health care. Partnership in health care was understood to mean being treated as an equal, being involved in decision‐making, and making contributions which impact on health care and health systems. The metaphorical concept of ‘invisibility’ related to the older person not being seen and heard as a partner in health care, as well as being a recipient of care. Conclusions: We concluded that older people who need support to live at home are not highly visible to health providers, policymakers and researchers as a central partner and consumer to be meaningfully engaged in shaping their health care. Opportunities to address persistent issues with quality of health care may in future be achieved through stronger partnerships between older people and health providers, to find new ways to improve the quality of care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Providing care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is associated with a high risk of them developing complications. Aim: To survey the most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. Method: A retrospective descriptive survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. Findings: The persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. Conclusion: Frail older persons with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end‐of‐life care, should be prevented from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making house calls.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Due to the high morbidity and disability level among diabetes patients in nursing homes, the conditions for caregivers are exceedingly complex and challenging. The patient safety culture in nursing homes should be evaluated in order to improve patient safety and the quality of care. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the perceptions of patient safety culture of nursing personnel in nursing homes, and its associations with the participants' (i) profession, (ii) education, (iii) specific knowledge related to their own residents with diabetes, and (iv) familiarity with clinical diabetes guidelines for older people. Methods: Cross-sectional survey design. The study included 89 nursing home personnel (38 registered nurses and 51 nurse aides), 25 (28%) with advanced education, at two nursing homes. We collected self-reported questionnaire data on age, profession, education and work experience, diabetes knowledge and familiarity with diabetes guidelines. In addition, we applied the Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture instrument, with 42 items and 12 dimensions. Results: In general, those with advanced education scored higher in all patient safety culture dimensions than those without, however statistically significant only for the dimensions "teamwork" (mean score 81.7 and 67.7, p = 0.042) and "overall perceptions of resident safety" (mean score 90.0 and 74.3, p = 0.016). Nursing personnel who were familiar with diabetes guidelines for older people had more positive perceptions in key areas of patient safety culture, than those without familiarity with the guidelines. Conclusions: The findings from this study show that advanced education and familiarity with current diabetes guidelines was related to adequate evaluations on essential areas of patient safety culture in nursing homes.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Problem: Residents of residential aged care facilities are at very high risk of developing complex oral diseases and dental problems. Key barriers exist in delivering oral health services to residential aged care facilities, particularly in regional and rural areas. Design: A quality improvement study incorporating pre‐ and post chart audits and pre‐ and post consultation with key stakeholders, including staff and residents, expert opinion on cost estimates and field notes were used. Setting: One regional and three rural residential aged care facilities situated in a non‐metropolitan hospital and health service in Queensland. Key measures for improvement: Number of appointments avoided at an oral health facility  Feedback on program experience by staff and residents  Compliance with oral health care plan implementation  Observations of costs involved to deliver new service. Strategies for change: The model developed incorporated a visit by an oral health therapist for screening, education, simple intervention and referral for a teledentistry session if required. Effects of change: Results showed an improvement in implementation of oral health care plans and a minimisation of need for residents to attend an oral health care facility. Potential financial and social cost savings for residents and the facilities were also noted. Lessons learnt: Screening via the oral health therapist and teledentistry appointment minimises the need for a visit to an oral health facility and subsequent disruption to residents in residential aged care facilities.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community‐dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Worldwide increases in the numbers of older people alongside an accompanying international policy incentive to support ageing‐in‐place have focussed the importance of home‐care services as an alternative to institutionalisation. Despite this, funding models that facilitate a responsive, flexible approach are lacking. Casemix provides one solution, but the transition from the well‐established hospital system to community has been problematic. This research seeks to develop a Casemix funding solution for home‐care services through meaningful client profile groups and supporting pathways. Unique assessments from 3,135 older people were collected from two health board regions in 2012. Of these, 1,009 arose from older people with non‐complex needs using the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐Contact Assessment (CA) and 2,126 from the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐Home‐Care (HC) from older people with complex needs. Home‐care service hours were collected for 3 months following each assessment and the mean weekly hours were calculated. Data were analysed using a decision tree analysis, whereby mean hours of weekly home‐care was the dependent variable with responses from the assessment tools, the independent variables. A total of three main groups were developed from the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐CA, each one further classified into “stable” or “flexible.” The classification explained 16% of formal home‐care service hour variability. Analysis of the &lt;italic&gt;inter&lt;/italic&gt;RAI‐HC generated 33 clusters, organised through eight disability “sub” groups and five “lead” groups. The groupings explained 24% of formal home‐care services hour variance. Adopting a Casemix system within home‐care services can facilitate a more appropriate response to the changing needs of older people.</ab>

        <ab>Older people living in residential aged care often experience complex persistent pain because of the presence of multiple comorbidities and geriatric syndrome. Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration needs to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population can be improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary suffering.</ab>

        <ab>Skin tears represent a relevant clinical consequence of age-associated skin vulnerability, and are extremely common among frail and older individuals. They are acute wounds with the potential to be closed by primary intention, however they are often mismanaged and misdiagnosed and transition to become chronic and complex wounds. Reported skin tear prevalence suggests they are a growing healthcare problem which have a profound impact on the health and wellbeing of affected individuals and a great financial burden to healthcare systems. With the aging global population, it can be assumed that the prevalence of skin tears will continue to increase proportionally with the aging population. In order to minimize the impact of skin tears clinicians must to be aware of what skin tears are, who is at risk, why and when they occur, and how to manage skin tears when they do occur. The purpose of this article is to assist clinicians with the prediction, prevention, assessment and management of skin tears among the aging population across healthcare sectors.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: To meet increasing demand for home care, the role of personal support workers (PSWs) is shifting from providing primarily personal and supportive care to include care activities previously provided by regulated health professionals (RHPs). Much of the research examining this shift focuses on specialty programmes, with few studies investigating the daily care being provided by PSWs, frequency of care activities being provided by PSWs, and characteristics of the population receiving more complex tasks. Between January and April 2015, a review of 517 home‐care service user charts was undertaken in Ontario, Canada, to: (1) describe the range of tasks being performed by PSWs in home care, (2) identify tasks transferred by RHPs to PSWs, and (3) examine characteristics of service users receiving transferred care. Findings indicate that normally, PSWs provide personal and supportive care commensurate with their training. However, in approximately one quarter of care plans reviewed, PSWs also completed more complex care activities transferred to them by RHPs. Service users receiving transferred care were older and had higher levels of cognitive and functional impairment. Although there is potential for the expansion of home‐care services through increased utilisation of PSWs, healthcare leadership must ensure that the right provider is being utilised at the right time and in the right place to ensure safe and effective quality care. Thus, several actions are recommended: PSW core competencies be clearly articulated, processes used to transfer care activities from RHPs to PSWs be standardised and a team‐based approach to the delivery of home‐care services be considered. Utilisation of a team‐based model can help establish positive relationships among home‐care providers, provide increased support for PSWs, allow for easier scheduling of initial training and ensure regular reassessments of PSW competence among PSWs providing added skills.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in their daily lives. Background: A better understanding of the personal experience of frailty in the context of fluctuating ill‐health has the potential to contribute to the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. Design: An ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a community matron service in a large city in the North of England. Methods: Up to six care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11 months. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4‐year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method. Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: &lt;italic&gt;Fluctuating ill‐health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living&lt;/italic&gt;. Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person‐centred care . Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.</ab>

        <ab>Providing health and social care to older persons is challenging, since older persons often have multiple diseases and a complex health situation. Hence many professions and organisations are involved. Lack of interprofessional and interorganisational collaboration leads to fragmented care. Care planning meetings before hospital discharge have long been used to overcome this fragmentation, but meetings conducted at the hospital have limitations in identifying long‐term needs at home. A new model for health and social care planning in collaboration (HSCPC) in older persons’ homes was introduced in two Swedish municipalities. The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the HSCPC‐meeting from the perspectives of older persons, family members, and professionals. Ten care planning meetings from two municipalities were consecutively included. Interviews in retrospect with ten older persons, eight family members, and ten groups of professionals who had attended the HSCPC‐meeting at home were analysed with a hermeneutic approach. Four themes emerged: unspoken agendas and unpreparedness, security and enhanced understanding, asymmetric relationships, and ambiguity about the mission and need for follow‐up. The comprehensive interpretation is that the professionals handled the HSCPC‐meeting mainly as a routine task, while the older persons and family members viewed it as part of their life course. Older persons are in an inferior institutional, cognitive and existential position. However, meeting together in the home partly reduced their inferior position. Findings from this study provide some general suggestions for how HSCPC‐meetings should be designed and developed: attention of power relations, the importance of meeting skills and follow‐up.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Medication management is the most challenging component of a successful transition from hospital to home, a challenge of growing complexity as the number of older persons living with chronic conditions grows, along with increasingly specialised and accelerated hospital treatment plans. Thus, many patients are discharged with complex medication regimen instructions, accentuating the risk of medication errors that may cause readmission, adverse drug events and a need for further health care. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore visiting nurses’ medication management in home health care after hospital discharge and to identify key elements in patient medication for improved patient safety. Method: Inspired by the ethnographic research cycle, participant observations and informal interviews were conducted at 12 initial visits by a nurse in a patient's home after hospital discharge. Data consisted of field notes and photographs from the patients’ homes, medication lists and medical records. Field notes were analysed in four steps. Findings: The analysis showed 12 stages in medication management in which nurses strove to adjust medication management to the patients’ actual health status by &lt;italic&gt;mediating&lt;/italic&gt; on knowledge of the patient, information to the patient and on rules and regulations and by &lt;italic&gt;establishing order&lt;/italic&gt; in medication lists and medications in the home. Conclusion: The nurse–patient relationship, the integration of care and the context of care challenged patient safety in visiting nurses’ medication management in patients’ homes after hospital discharge. The implications for practice were the following: to ensure nurses’ opportunities to continuously evolve their observation skills and skills in making sound clinical judgements; to establish interprofessional working processes which support the continuous assessment of patients’ needs and the adjustment of care and treatment; to clarify expectations to nurses’ responsibility and patients’ privacy.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant symptom burden; however, our understanding of the relationship between symptoms and physical frailty in HF is limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. Methods: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. Results: The mean age of the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 T 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P &lt; .001), 75% worse wake disturbances (P &lt; .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. Conclusions: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.</ab>

        <ab>The physical environment is of particular importance for supporting activities and interactions among older people living in residential care facilities ( RCFs) who spend most of their time inside the facility. More knowledge is needed regarding the complex relationships between older people and environmental aspects in long-term care. The present study aimed to explore how the physical environment influences resident activities and interactions at two RCFs by using a mixed-method approach. Environmental assessments were conducted via the Swedish version of the Sheffield Care Environment Assessment Matrix (S- SCEAM), and resident activities, interactions and locations were assessed through an adapted version of the Dementia Care Mapping ( DCM). The Observed Emotion Rating Scale ( OERS) was used to assess residents' affective states. Field notes and walk-along interviews were also used. Findings indicate that the design of the physical environment influenced the residents' activities and interactions. Private apartments and dining areas showed high environmental quality at both RCFs, whereas the overall layout had lower quality. Safety was highly supported. Despite high environmental quality in general, several factors restricted resident activities. To optimise care for older people, the design process must clearly focus on accessible environments that provide options for residents to use the facility independently.</ab>

        <ab>Despite growing numbers of patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy in outpatient settings and the corresponding increase in care demands on family and close friends, little is known about the experiences of those informal carers supporting people with cancer during their chemotherapy trajectories. Using an interpretivist theoretical framework, this study explored the experiences of primary support persons of chemotherapy outpatients through in-depth interviews with 17 participants nominated as their primary support persons by people receiving chemotherapy at a large tertiary hospital in Australia. The study demonstrates that primary support persons of chemotherapy outpatients face distinct challenges, being at the frontline of treatment and managing side effects with minimal support at home. This role involves sensitive provision of complex medical and social care in circumstances that profoundly challenge the everyday worlds of both patient and carer. From the moment of diagnosis, informal carers in this context face the 'double whammy' of needing to 'manage' the cancer diagnosis experience as well as the chemotherapy trajectory experience. This study points to the significant level of responsibility that primary support persons take on, and the extent to which patients and clinicians rely on their support and management skills. It also points, however, to the lack of recognition they receive for assuming this role, and their sense of frustration in the face of this invisibility. The conceptualisation of the informal carer role as a 'shadowing' role explicitly represents the protective, vigilant, but almost invisible, support role described by the participants in this study.</ab>

        <ab>Loneliness in later life is a common problem with poor health outcomes. However, interventions to prevent or ameliorate loneliness have a weak evidence base. The views of older people experiencing or at risk of loneliness in the community are important in identifying features of potential support, but have been little studied. Twenty-eight community dwelling people, aged 65 and over who reported being 'lonely much of the time' or identified as lonely from the de Jong Gierveld six-item loneliness scale in a larger study, participated in in-depth interviews, between June 2013 and May 2014. Views and experiences on seeking support from primary care and community based one-to-one and group based activities, including social and shared interest groups, were explored. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team, including older people. Using two different measures of loneliness enabled a spectrum of loneliness experience to be explored. Two-thirds of the participants were the 'younger old' and all were able to leave their homes independently. Older people with characteristics of loneliness were generally knowledgeable about local social and community resources but, for the majority, community and primary care based services for their loneliness were not considered desirable or helpful at this point in their lives. However, group based activities with a shared interest were thought preferable to one-to-one support (befriending) or groups with a social focus. Descriptions of support as being for loneliness and specific to older people discouraged engagement. Older people experiencing or at risk of loneliness did not consider that primary care has a role in alleviating loneliness because it is not an illness. They thought primary care practitioners lack understanding of non-physical problems and that a good relationship was necessary to discuss sensitive issues like loneliness. For many, loneliness was a complex and private matter that they wished to manage without external support.</ab>

        <ab>Background Ageing in place (AIP) is the ability to live in one's home and community independently, despite age, ability level or income. Aim To elicit knowledge and feelings about AIP from low-income older adults relocated to low-income housing. Method Nursing students, supervised by nursing faculty trained in research, conducted semi-structured interviews about AIP with volunteer residents living in a low-income apartment complex in the southern US. Findings Seven participants discussed common fears and worries as well as needs for AIP in low-income housing. Mental health issues were prominent. Conclusion Mental health warrants consideration along with physical, social and emotional well-being in beginning to identify and address the needs of older people ageing anywhere, perhaps especially in relocated low-income older adults. This information could inform future interventions to encourage AIP in the US and potentially in other countries.</ab>

        <ab>At the beginning of the 21st century, one in five of UK residents can expect to see their 100th birthday and one in four people are aged 60 years or older. The UK has an ageing population. With older age comes an increasing variety of comorbidities that have an impact not only on an individual’s quality of life but also on healthcare resources. Older people account for a rapidly rising cohort of individuals admitted to hospital, often with complex needs, and this can require achieving venous access. Venepuncture and cannulation are the most commonly performed invasive procedures in health care today. This article aims to increase awareness of vascular access challenges in older patients so the potential for complications relating to venepuncture, cannulation and infusion therapy can be minimised, thereby improving their overall quality of care. The article will look at the healthcare challenges facing the older population, and the importance of a holistic approach to assess their vascular access needs to deliver optimum care.</ab>

        <ab>As life expectancy increases so people often develop a range of conditions and disabilities in the years before death. Multimorbidity represents the most common 'disease pattern' found among the elderly and is characterised by complex interactions of co-existing diseases where a medical approach focused on a single disease does not suffice. People with dementia who also have other comorbidities do not always have their comorbid conditions managed as those without dementia which often lead to a high number of hospital admissions with longer lengths of stay and greater treatment costs. This case study presents the case management approach taken by Admiral Nursing in managing the complexities where there is comorbidity of a long-term condition and a diagnosis of dementia. By empowering the person and their carer with information and choices and through good case management and communication, people can be supported to live well and avoid inappropriate hospital admissions.</ab>

        <ab>Background Older persons with multimorbidity being cared for at home often have complex needs which cannot be met by one single caregiver. Interprofessional collaboration is therefore considered necessary if care is to be organised according to the needs of the older person. To achieve coherent health care, municipalities and county councils need to develop their collaboration. Aim The aim of this study was to illustrate how various professionals belonging to homemaker services, home care services in municipality and hospital-based home care services experience collaboration in caring for older persons with multimorbidity. Method A hermeneutic approach was used. Eleven informants participated in the study and were individually interviewed. Findings The findings show that collaboration between players comprises various types of experiences which influence not only the staff who are involved in collaboration but also the outcome of the collaboration itself. The informants' experience of collaboration was defined by distrust and trust and by insecurity and security. To focus on patients' needs and to develop the collaboration further, it was important for informants to take the relations into account and have a reflective and questioning approach. This attitude resulted in a feeling of trust and security, and a flexible and critical approach without boundary drawings between basic and specialised care. Conclusion and relevance of practice Complex situations cannot be solved with simple models. Instead, a flexible approach appears necessary with focus shifting from structures to interpersonal relations and interactions. Therefore, the different professionals have to work as a transprofessional team where close interactions, flexibility and improvisation are keys to success. The transprofessional team approach is suggested to have the potential to take the competence of all staff into account when high-quality home health care to older persons with multimorbidity is to be provided by multiple caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>Older people with intellectual disabilities often experience high levels of health needs and multiple morbidities but they may be supported by residential care staff with little or no previous experience of identifying and meeting health needs. Little is known regarding how they undertake this health-related role and this exploratory study seeks to address this gap. A purposive sample of 14 managers of supported living accommodation in Wales were interviewed in 2014 to determine their experiences of supporting tenants in relation to age-related health needs. The semi-structured interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed. Three of the emerging themes are reported in this paper: meeting health needs, the consequences of ageing and relationships. Findings indicate that residential care staff support older people with intellectual disabilities with complex and multiple health needs: they monitor health status, support access to healthcare, provide additional support arising from changing health needs and advocate for tenants in the context of healthcare. However, their role is often not understood by healthcare professionals. The importance of staff having a long-term relationship with those they support was identified as being important to identifying any health-related changes. The need to develop effective relationships with healthcare staff was also noted. It is concluded that there is a need for better understanding among health staff of the role of residential social care workers and for further research regarding health-related communication.</ab>

        <ab>Health and social care settings worldwide need to sustainably improve the quality of relationships across communities or 'whole systems'. This research informs the development of a relational framework based on stakeholder perspectives. It is grounded in an action research project with practitioners, and draws on a previous literature review, to present the underpinning elements of quality relationships as statements, organised under the headings of integrity, respect, fairness, compassion and trust. Using Q methodology, 27 participants, comprising a range of stakeholders (staff, residents, family and service providers), rank-ordered 48 statements based on perceptions of the importance of differing aspects of relationships. By-person factor analysis was used to create five factors or viewpoints by comparing and contrasting using the composite rankings alongside interview data collected for each participant. The first view 'Altogether now' prioritises compassionate engagement. Second, 'Respect is a two-way street' emphasises the need for reciprocal respect and recognition of history. The factor labelled 'Free spirits' posits the dominant view of freedom. The fourth view 'Families ... strengths and challenges' focuses on the necessary and complex involvement of families and finally, 'Helping hands' emphasises the role of relationships in increasing previously low expectations of social integration for previously isolated residents. The different views that exist on the composition of quality relationships can be used to help extra care communities to understand and utilise relationships as a powerful and effective resource.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To identify key elements of optimal treatment decision-making for surgeons and older patients with colorectal (CRC) or pancreatic cancer (PC).Methods: Six focus groups with different participants were performed: three with older CRC/PC patients and relatives, and three with physicians. Supplementary in-depth interviews were conducted in another seven patients. Framework analysis was used to identify key elements in decision-making.Results: 23 physicians, 22 patients and 14 relatives participated. Three interacting components were revealed: preconditions, content and facilitators of decision-making. To provide optimal information about treatments' impact on an older patient's daily life, physicians should obtain an overall picture and take into account patients' frailty. Depending on patients' preferences and capacities, dividing decision-making into more sessions will be helpful and simultaneously emphasize patients' own responsibility. GPs may have a valuable contribution because of their background knowledge and supportive role.Conclusion: Stakeholders identified several crucial elements in the complex surgical decision-making of older CRC/PC patients. Structured qualitative research may also be of great help in optimizing other treatment directed decision-making processes.Practice Implications: Surgeons should be trained in examining preconditions and useful facilitators in decision-making in older CRC/PC patients to optimize its content and to improve the quality of shared care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective To describe general practitioners' experiences of being the principal physician responsible for a nursing home. Method Fifteen general practitioners assigned to a nursing home participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Data were analysed using systematic text condensation. Result Medical assessment is the main duty of general practitioners. Advance care planning together with residents and family members facilitates future decisions on medical treatment and end-of-life care. Registered Nurses' continuity and competence are perceived as crucial to the quality of care, but inadequate staffing, lack of medical equipment and less-than-optimal IT systems for electronic healthcare records are impediments to patient safety. Conclusion The study highlights the importance of advance care planning together with residents and family members in facilitating future decisions on medical treatment and end-of-life care. To meet the increasing demands for more complex medical treatment at nursing homes and to provide high-quality palliative care, there would seem to be a need to increase Registered Nurses' staffing and acquire more advanced medical equipment, as well as to create better possibilities for Registered Nurses and general practitioners to access each other's healthcare record systems.</ab>

        <ab>Multimorbidity, a condition common among older adults, may be regarded as a failure of a complex system. The aim of this study was to describe the core components in health and social care management for older adults with multimorbidity. A cross-sectional design included two methods: individual interviews and group discussions. A total of 105 participants included older adults with multimorbidity and their relatives, care staff and healthcare policymakers. Data were analysed using content analysis. The results show that seven core components comprise a multiperspective view of health and social care management for older adults with multimorbidity: political steering, leadership, cooperation, competence, support for relatives, availability and continuity. Steps should be taken to ensure that every older adult with multimorbidity has a treatment plan according to a multiperspective view to prevent fragmentation of their health care. This study provides relevant evidence developing a multiperspective model of health and social care management for older adults with multimorbidity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are complex cardiogeriatric syndromes mediated by physical, psychological and social factors. Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these syndromes, particularly stroke. Purpose: This study sought to describe the clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors of adverse events. Methods: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding. Results: All-cause readmission to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. Self-reported self-care behaviour and 'not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Conclusion: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients and caregivers offers the potential to improve treatment knowledge, adherence and outcomes in this group of patients with complex care needs.</ab>

        <ab>The traditional discourse of caregiving focuses on burden, depression and anxiety. However, there is an emerging understanding of the complexities of the caregiving experience. This review paper highlights the complexity and often ambiguous reporting of variables associated with the caregiving experience and raises a number of research questions. The paper concludes that the identification of determinants that affect aspects of the caregiving experience, including anxiety and depression symptoms, is required to inform health care professionals of carer support needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patient participation is required by law in Norway and in several western countries. Current participation ideology is based on individualism, which may conflict with the older generation's commonly held values of solidarity and community. Hence, different values and ideologies may come in conflict when older patients receive treatment and rehabilitation in geriatric wards. Participation is a guiding principle in rehabilitation. Criteria for admission of older patients to geriatric wards are complex health problems, acute illness and/or acute physical and/or cognitive functional failure. The ideal is an active and engaged patient. The aim of the study was to describe the difficulties experienced by older patients on acute geriatric wards when involving themselves with their own treatment and care. Methods: In this qualitative study older patients were interviewed during hospitalization in geriatric wards and asked to tell about their experiences with participation. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. Results: The patients experienced difficulties in participating in decisions and care. They linked their difficulties to their own diminishing capabilities, and cited the ward's busy schedule as a reason for abstaining from participation. However, despite their reservations, they did participate in decisions in different ways. Their participatory practices appeared ambiguous and they employed various strategies to put themselves in a position of influence. The most important of these involved their relatives. The patients delegated to family the tasks of seeking, receiving and giving information to the nurses and the staff, and, to some extent, for the dialogues with hospital staff about their needs and plan of care. The family appeared to accept the responsibility willingly. Conclusions: The patients addressed their difficulties by authorizing family members to act and participate on their behalf. This underlines the family's important role in patient participation and the role that nurses and other staff must play in collaborating with the patient and their family to facilitate participation independently of the patients' performances of participation.</ab>

        <ab>This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Shared decision-making (SDM) is widely recommended as a way to support patients in making healthcare choices. Due to an ageing population, the number of older patients will increase. Existing models for SDM are not sufficient for this patient group, due to their multi-morbidity, the lack of guidelines and evidence applicable to the numerous combinations of diseases. The aim of this study was to gain consensus on a model for SDM in frail older patients with multiple morbidities.Methods: We used a three-round Delphi study to reach consensus on a model for SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities. The expert panel consisted of 16 patients (round 1), and 59 professionals (rounds 1-3). In round 1, the SDM model was introduced, rounds 2 and 3 were used to validate the importance and feasibility of the SDM model.Results: Consensus for the proposed SDM model as a whole was achieved for both importance (91% panel agreement) and feasibility (76% panel agreement).Conclusions: SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities is a dynamic process. It requires a continuous counselling dialogue between professional and patient or proxy decision maker.Practice Implications: The developed model for SDM in clinical practice may help professionals to apply SDM in the complex situation of the care for older patients.</ab>

        <ab>The majority of people with dementia live at home, and informal carers assume the role of key care providers, often supported by formal services. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess home-based care arrangements, to illustrate utilisation of formal services over time and to identify factors associated with perceived stability of the care situation from the informal carer's perspective. A self-administered questionnaire (D- IVA 'Instrument for Assessing Home-Based Care Arrangements for People with Dementia') was developed and distributed in a provincial-rural setting in Germany as a cross-sectional survey. Data analysis used descriptive statistics, unbiased conditional inference trees and thematic analysis for open-ended questions. In total, 84 care arrangements were assessed. The majority of participants were direct relatives of the care-dependent person [mostly adult children (48.8%) or spouses (27.4%)]. Formal services were already sought in the first year after onset of memory problems. The most frequently used formal services were home care nursing services (53.0%), day care (49.4%) and respite care (29.6%), whereas 15.5% did not use any type of formal support. Companion home visit, home care nursing service and day care were used over the longest periods of time. The recruitment strategy used in this study may have recruited persons who were relatively more dependent on their informal carers. In this small sample, carers' perceived stability of the care situation was high, and this was associated with the country of origin and sex of the person with dementia ( P = 0.004 and 0.023 respectively). Most care arrangements consisted of a mix of informal and formal services. However, informal carers assumed prime responsibility. The questionnaire D- IVA proved to be suitable. It remains a challenge to further examine factors associated with perceived stability and to explain the phenomenon in its whole complexity. Further research using the D- IVA should consider applying complementing quantitative measures as well as qualitative methods.</ab>

        <ab>It is acknowledged internationally that chronic disease management (CDM) for community-living older adults (CLOA) is an increasingly complex process. CDM for older adults, who are often living with multiple chronic conditions, requires coordination of various health and social services. Coordination is enabled through interprofessional collaboration (IPC) among individual providers, community organizations, and health sectors. Measuring IPC is complicated given there are multiple conceptualisations and measures of IPC. A literature review of several healthcare, psychological, and social science electronic databases was conducted to locate instruments that measure IPC at the team level and have published evidence of their reliability and validity. Five instruments met the criteria and were critically reviewed to determine their strengths and limitations as they relate to CDM for CLOA. A comparison of the characteristics, psychometric properties, and overall concordance of each instrument with salient attributes of IPC found the Collaborative Practice Assessment Tool to be the most appropriate instrument for measuring IPC for CDM in CLOA.</ab>

        <ab>As a treatment for depression, behavioural activation is as effective as cognitive behaviour therapy but less complex. Its simplicity and the absence of a cognitive component mean that it may be more suitable for older adults. However, existing reviews of the evidence are meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, which tend to exclude subjects who are medically frail, cognitively impaired or have comorbid mental health problems. Eleven studies were examined to determine whether behaviourally focused treatments are suitable for older adults, including members of these client groups. The evidence suggests that behavioural activation that is delivered by non-therapists who are trained in the intervention can reduce depressive symptoms in older adults with comorbid medical problems. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.</ab>

        <ab>Background Older people with cognitive impairment represent a large group of patients in acute care settings. Research show that these acute care environments can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them. Aim This study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff. Method A purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. Findings Caring for older, acutely ill cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed. Conclusion The comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' personal-professional integrity.</ab>

        <ab>Research is limited on end-of-life care decision-making for older adults with chronic conditions whose end-of-life trajectory is difficult to predict because of their complex and frail condition. Semistructured interviews were conducted with family members of 22 deceased older adults to explore their experiences with end-of-life decision-making with/for their loved ones. Participants did not identify a specific time they made an end-of-life care decision as they did not know the older adult was at the end of life, health care providers did not ask them to make a decision, or they had to make forced decisions, and subsequently they experienced regret about the end-of-life care their family member received. End-of-life care decisions were dependent on the awareness of approaching death by participants, their loved ones, and health care providers. Health care providers being aware of the possibility of approaching death and assisting family members to make decisions that would honor the older adult's preference by explaining possible care options and what each care options would mean to them are key to providing quality end-of-life care for these individuals.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To describe how the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) is uniquely suited to meet the needs of older adults throughout the continuum of cancer, to explore the progress that APNs have made in gero-oncology care, and make suggestions for future directions. Data Source Google Scholar, PubMed, and CINAHL. Search terms included: “gero-oncology,” “geriatric oncology,” “Advanced Practice Nurse,” “Nurse Practitioner,” “older adult,” “elderly,” and “cancer.” Conclusion Over the last decade, APNs have made advances in caring for older adults with cancer by playing a role in prevention, screening, and diagnosis; through evidence-based gero-oncology care during cancer treatment; and in designing tailored survivorship care models. APNs must combat ageism in treatment choice for older adults, standardize comprehensive geriatric assessments, and focus on providing person-centered care, specifically during care transitions. Implications for Nursing Practice APNs are well-positioned to help understand the complex relationship between risk factors, geriatric syndromes, and frailty and translate research into practice. Palliative care must expand beyond specialty providers and shift toward APNs with a focus on early advanced care planning. Finally, APNs should continue to establish multidisciplinary survivorship models across care settings, with a focus on primary care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment leave many old patients in a frail condition with a high risk of adverse outcomes if proper health care is not provided. Knowledge about available competence is necessary to evaluate whether we are able to offer equitable and balanced health care to older persons with acute and/or complex health care needs. This study investigates the sufficiency of nursing staff competence in Norwegian community elderly care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1016 nursing staff in nursing homes and home care services with the instrument "Nursing Older People -- Competence Evaluation Tool". Statistical analyses were ANOVA and multiple regression. Results: We found that nursing staff have competence in all areas measured, but that the level of competence was insufficient in the areas nursing measures, advanced procedures, and nursing documentation. Nursing staff in nursing homes scored higher than staff in home care services, and older nursing staff scored lower than younger nursing staff. Conclusions: A reason for the relatively low influence of education and training on competence could be the diffuse roles that nursing staff have in community elderly care, implying that they have poor standards against which to judge their own competence. Clearer role descriptions for all groups of nursing staff are recommended as well as general competence development in geriatric nursing care.</ab>

        <ab>We examined whether women who had regular jobs throughout life performed better cognitively than older adult housewives. Linear regression was used to compare global cognitive performance scores of housewives (G1) and women exposed to work of low (G2) and high (G3) complexity. The sample comprised 477 older adult Brazilian women, 430 (90.4%) of whom had performed lifelong jobs. In work with data, the G2 group's cognitive performance scores were 1.73 points higher (p =.03), and the G3 group scored 1.76 points (p =.02) higher, than the G1. In work with things and with people, the G3 scored, respectively, 2.04 (p &lt;.01) and 2.21 (p &lt;.01) cognitive test points higher than the G1. Based on our findings we suggest occupation of greater complexity is associated with better cognitive performance in women later in life.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The study aimed to describe end of life for patients treated with maintenance haemodialysis as narrated by their close relatives. Introduction: Many patients undergoing haemodialysis are older, have several comorbidities and underestimated symptoms and are in their last year of life. To improve care, we need to know more about their end-of-life situation. Design: Qualitative and descriptive. Methods: Qualitative retrospective interviews were conducted with 14 close relatives of deceased haemodialysis patients (3-13 months after death). Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The study is ethically approved. Findings: In the last months, a gradual deterioration in health with acute episodes necessitating hospital admissions was described. This involved diminishing living space and expressions of dejection, but also of joy. Three patterns emerged in the last weeks: uncertain anticipation of death as life fades away; awaiting death after haemodialysis withdrawal; and sudden but not unexpected death following intensive care. Findings show complexities of decisions on haemodialysis withdrawal. Conclusions: Different end-of-life patterns all involved increasingly complex care needs and existential issues. Findings show a need for earlier care planning. The identification of organisational factors to facilitate continuity and whole person care to meet these patients' specific care needs with their complex symptom burdens and comorbidities is needed. Findings indicate the need for integration of a palliative care approach in the treatment of patients in haemodialysis care.</ab>

        <ab>Le traitement du cancer du sein soulève des préoccupations précises qui sont uniques aux besoins des patientes plus âgées. Bien que le traitement du cancer du sein au stade précoce de la maladie ne varie que très peu avec l'âge, la prise en charge optimale des patientes plus âgées atteintes de cette maladie exige souvent des soins de soutien interdisciplinaires complexes en raison des multiples comorbidités. Le présent article fait le point sur la conduite thérapeutique optimale pour le cancer du sein chez les femmes de 65 ans et plus dans une perspective interdisciplinaire. Une recension des écrits concernant la prise en charge des patientes plus âgées atteintes d'un cancer du sein a été effectuée dans les bases de données MEDLINE et EMBASE. Le point de vue de plusieurs spécialités a été retenu : gériatrie, radio-oncologie, oncologie médicale, oncologie chirurgicale, psycho-oncologie, soins palliatifs, soins infirmiers et travail social. Ce groupe de patientes nécessite une collaboration interprofessionnelle dès le diagnostic puis pour toute la durée du traitement, jusqu'à la période de rétablissement. Par conséquent, nous recommandons un programme interdisciplinaire spécifique au traitement des patientes plus âgées atteintes d'un cancer du sein pour l'optimisation de leurs soins de santé.</ab>

        <ab>Few studies have investigated loneliness in relation to health care consumption among frail older people. The aim of this study was to examine loneliness, health-related quality of life ( HRQo L), and health complaints in relation to health care consumption of in- and outpatient care among frail older people living at home. The study, with a cross-sectional design, comprised a sample of 153 respondents aged from 65 years (mean age 81.5 years) or older, who lived at home and were frail. Data was collected utilising structured interviews in the respondent's home assessing demographic data, loneliness, HRQo L and health complaints. Patient administrative registers were used to collect data on health care consumption. Loneliness was the dependent variable in the majority of the analyses and dichotomised. For group comparisons Student′s t-test, Mann- Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used. The results showed that 60% of the respondents had experienced loneliness during the previous year, at least occasionally. The study identified that lonely respondents had a lower HRQo L (p = 0.022), with a higher total number of reported health complaints (p = 0.001), and used more outpatient services including more acute visits at the emergency department, compared to not lonely respondents (p = 0.026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a depressed mood was independently associated to total use of outpatient care ( B = 7.4, p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, it might not be loneliness, per se, that is the reason for seeking health care. However, reasons for using health care services are difficult to determine due to the complex situation for the frail older person. To avoid emergency department visits and to benefit the well-being of the frail older person, interventions targeting the complex health situation, including loneliness, are suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Given the growing number of vulnerable, older cardiac surgery patients, the preadmission PREvention Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery patients (PREDOCS) programme was developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with the acceptability, compliance and delivery. Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings. Methods: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI). Results: Twenty-one females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients. Conclusions: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.</ab>

        <ab>Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.</ab>

        <ab>The treatment of older people with high blood pressure (BP) is a challenge as under- and over-treatment can lead to poorer outcomes. There is strong evidence from epidemiological and trial data to show that older people with high BP should be treated at the same threshold and to the same target BP (BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) as younger patients, with the exception of the very elderly (those over the age of 80 years), in whom a less aggressive treatment target is recommended (BP &lt;150/90 mmHg). With anti-hypertensive therapy, older people can experience orthostatic hypotension, drug--drug interactions and adverse drug reactions; older people often have complex co-morbidities and may have barriers to adherence to therapy. Drug therapy should be tailored to achieve a satisfactory BP reduction with minimal adverse effects. Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease in older people should be identified and addressed. Particular consideration should be given to the use of statins.</ab>

        <ab>The term frailty is often used to describe a subset of the older population with complex health issues. It is associated with dependence, disability, increased health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Pressure injuries burden patients and healthcare organisations, with some preventative practices having little impact on prevalence reduction. Patient participation in care may be an effective pressure injury prevention strategy, yet patient preferences are unknown. The aim of this interpretive study was to describe patients' perceptions of their current and future role in pressure injury prevention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 adult inpatients recruited from four medical units, at two Australian metropolitan hospitals. Interview data were analysed using content analysis, with three categories emerging: 'experiencing pressure injuries'; 'participating in pressure injury prevention'; and 'resourcing pressure injury prevention and treatment'. These categories reflect the complex nature of participants' pressure injury experience. The findings suggest participants gather pressure injury knowledge from first-hand and vicarious experience; knowledge they bring to hospital. Most participants preferred a proactive pressure injury prevention role. Many identified barriers in the healthcare environment that impeded their participation and affected their experience of pressure injuries and pressure injury prevention. If patient participation as a pressure injury prevention strategy is to be considered, nurses and organisations need to view patients as partners.</ab>

        <ab>Consumer-directed care (CDC) is increasingly widespread among aged care service options in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. However, the evidence base regarding the programmatic and contextual factors that affect the outcome of CDC interventions is surprisingly small. This paper reports on a self-directed care approach for older Australians with complex care needs. A multimethods longitudinal comparative cohort study was employed comprising 4 survey tools and 56 semi-structured interviews. Participation rates were around 20%. A total of 185 (98 in the intervention and 87 in the control group) older people and carers were recruited at baseline. Eleven months later, 109 participants (59 in the intervention and 50 in the control group) completed the repeat measure. Attrition rates were around 40%. Data collection occurred between July 2010 and April 2012. The data suggest that intervention group participants were likely to be more satisfied with the way they were treated (P = 0.013), their care options (P = 0.014), the 'say' they had in their care (P &lt; 0.001), the information they received regarding their care (P = 0.012), what they were achieving in life (P = 0.031), that the services changed their view on what could be achieved in life (P = 0.020) and with their standard of living (P = 0.008). The evaluation suggests that while only a very small segment of older people is interested in a voucher or cash option, a substantially larger group would like to have greater say over and more direct access to their care, without, however, assuming administrative and financial responsibilities. The paper concludes that a stepped capacity-building approach to CDC may improve the acceptability of CDC to older people and generate synergies that improve older people's care outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the biopsychosocial aspects and aspects of the health system of hospitalized elderly and to classify their degree of care complexity. Methods: This was a quantitative study whose convenience sample consisted of 279 elderly. The Interdisciplinary Medicine Instrument (INTERMED) method was used, a tool that identified biopsychosocial aspects and conditions of the health system and classified the complexity of the patient. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis. Results: The prevailing profile was of elderly women, retired, white, with low educational levels, married and satisfied with their life conditions. The mean age was 72.3 years. The biological domain was the most compromised. As for the complexity of care, 34.8% of the patients required multiprofessional care. Conclusion: The elderly had high care complexity, with the biological and health system domains being the most compromised.</ab>

        <ab>With anticipated greater demand for formal care services globally, this article examines the sociodemographic and health characteristics of frail older people in receipt of community support. Data were collected from audits of case files of older people receiving care management at two time points during which two government policy initiatives were implemented to promote greater standardization in health and social care provision for older people in England. Findings at Time 2 revealed that there were higher levels of physical and mental impairment and more health care assessments undertaken. There was a slight decrease in home care receipt but a marginal increase of more intensive home care provision. Service users living with a carer were less likely to receive home care but more likely to receive respite care or day care than those living alone. The policy goal of widening access to specialist health and social care services for older people with mental health problems was achieved. Guidance that focused eligibility criteria on the identification of older people with complex needs required the availability of appropriate support and services. Irrespective of policy initiatives, the sociodemographic characteristics of older people and the availability of informal support are principal determinants of service provision.</ab>

        <ab>Despite efforts to promote tissue repair, many wounds heal slowly, do not heal or deteriorate. Management of these chronic wounds is a growing problem. Innovation and cost cutting is key to current health policy and therefore clinicians should be taking advantage of emerging technologies that can improve outcomes for patients while reducing costs. Accel-Heal is an innovative electroceutical device that uses a patented synapse sequence programmed to deliver a specific series of electric energy interactions through the skin to manipulate gene expression and modify specific physiological functions in dermal tissue, improving and accelerating healing. This article examines the use of Accel-Heal in three case studies.  INSET: Box 1. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI).</ab>

        <ab>Background: With an ageing population and changes to the UK process of commissioning health-care services, it is important that the role of the community palliative care clinical nurse specialist (CPC-CNS) is better understood. Aim: This study aimed to describe CPC-CNS activities during interactions with patients. Methods: Four CPC-CNSs were observed and audio-recorded during interactions with 34 patients. The data was assessed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Results: An enormous breadth of activities were observed, within a framework of assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation. Cross-cutting themes were real-time decision making, leadership, ability to respond to and coordinate complex and varied situations, and communication techniques. Data saturation was not achieved. Conclusion: CPC-CNSs provide multifaceted care, requiring wide-ranging knowledge to enable them to act as liaison points in a complex health service, respond independently to the fluctuating needs of patients, and provide effective advance care planning, particularly to those with advanced disease, multi-morbidity, and frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Purpose: Frailty is a significant challenge for health care. Therefore, it is important to identify frail individuals. Theoretical Framework: The Vulnerability/Risk/ Human Response/Care Model. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a measure to identify frail older adults. Methods: Instrument development encompassed the following: delineation of content domains, item generation, content validity, quantitative content validity analysis, and psychometric analysis. Results: Findings indicated the following: (a) Frailty is a complex concept, (b) the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE) is composed of 10 items, (c) FIFE was able to predict depression, and (d) FIFE was able to differentiate differences in demographic profiles by social support environment. Conclusions: FIFE is a valid instrument. FIFE can be used to study the relationships among frailty determinants, provide standardized measurement, and develop and measure interventional studies.</ab>

        <ab>Improving hospital care for frail older people requires expertise, leadership and resources as these patients have multiple complex needs. One innovative solution to providing the skilled care necessary is to train experienced nurses to become advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs). Such roles encompass activity previously undertaken by medical staff, together with leadership, teaching, research and service development. Skills specific to caring for older people, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, are also required. This article discusses the need for ANPs in this clinical area, a pilot that is under way in one acute trust to develop these roles, and the potential benefits and challenges that may accompany this development.</ab>

        <ab>Intermediate care services are usually intended for frail, older people and those with complex needs. Their aims are to avoid unnecessary hospital admission, help people regain independence after a hospital stay and prevent premature admission to long-term care. Services are time limited and delivered in patients' own homes, community hospitals and sometimes nursing homes. But, as Louise Hunt reports, the second national audit of intermediate care, published late last year, found capacity in England is just half of what is needed. There is also significant variation between localities in capacity outside hospital and in the balance of bed-based, home-based and re-enablement services. Two case studies are presented of intermediate care services where nurses play an important role in achieving positive outcomes for patients and saving the health service money.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To describe and compare the perceived social provision for a group reporting never feeling lonely with that of a group reporting feeling lonely and to explore the meaning of loneliness. Subjects Participants (N = 101) were recruited from geriatric wards. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 65 years or more, the absence of dementia, one or more chronic physical disorders and plans to be discharged from the hospital to their home. The mean age was 81.3 years (range: 65-96 years), 68% were women, and 66% lived alone. Measures Assessments of social provisions and loneliness were collected by a subjective report using the Social Provision Scale ( SPS), and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS) was used to assess depression. The participants were also asked whether they felt lonely and were then asked to describe the meaning of loneliness if they had indicated feeling lonely. Narratives were then condensed by the participants into short sentences. Results Seventy-five per cent of the participants reported feeling lonely, of these 54% were living alone, and 18% identified with depression. Three subscales of SPS scores were significantly lower in the lonely group: attachment (p &lt; 0.001), a sense of reliable alliance (p = 0.001) and the obtaining of guidance (p = 0.01). The overall view of the experience of loneliness was dominated by emptiness and negative emotions. The following themes were identified: Emotions were dominated by sadness, anxiety and restlessness, anger and guilt. Relationships were dominated by being left alone, being confined and feeling useless. Existential dimensions were characterised by emptiness, endless boredom, isolation and the potential for change. Conclusion The study shows that loneliness is prevalent among older people suffering from chronic physical illness and confirms the complexity of the concept. A mixed-methods design contributed to nuanced and detailed information about the meaning of loneliness.</ab>

        <ab>This study identifies factors that affect decisions people make regarding whether they want to receive life-sustaining treatment. It is an interpretive-descriptive study based on qualitative data from three focus groups (N = 23), representing a diverse population in central Pennsylvania. Study sites included a suburban senior center serving a primarily White, middle-class population; an urban senior center serving a frail, underserved, African American population; and a breast cancer support group. The most important factors affecting whether participants wished to receive life-sustaining medical treatment were prognosis, expected quality of life, burden to others, burden to oneself in terms of the medical condition and treatment, and effect on mental functioning and independence. Our findings contribute to the knowledge of the complex factors that influence how people make decisions about advance care planning and life-sustaining treatments. This understanding is critical if nurses are to translate the patient's goals, values, and preferences into an actionable medical plan.

        <ab>The author describes how a palliative approach to care addresses the complex issues that frail older people may face toward the end of their lives. She cites a report from the Care Quality Commission on the state of health care and adult social care in England which identified that end-of-life care for frail people needs improving. She discusses ways on how palliative nursing can make a positive contribution to the care of frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose - The purpose of this case study is to highlight the importance of empowering and meeting the 'higher needs' of the very old, which prolong a fulfilling life. Frailty in old age need not be feared and abhorred if society would accept that all of us need to live our lives as we wish until the end, and value those who assist us to do this. With the right attitudes to ageing and death and with the appropriate investment for a seamless care system that listens to, and functions well for those who need it, old age should be as enriching as any other time in life. Design/methodology/approach - Personal narrative of the author's parents ageing, this paper gives the background and personality of the frail older person and his wife, that contextualises the challenges they face in his very old age. The professional and personal experiences of the author as she tackles the obstacles to support them are drawn from her career in social care with memories from diaries written, as she accompanies her parents on their journey of physical and mental deterioration along with a quest for realising what they have and making the most of it. Findings - Given how challenging this journey is for an informed family, the implications are that in 2013 our 'civilised' society still misunderstands the special and complex needs of frail older people, devalues them, and writes them off with institutionalised, rigid attitudes and services instead of working creatively to improve their lives. The paper observes how deeply rooted this is in us all. Originality/value - The combination of the author's background in social work and expertise in health and care with living so close to relatively unusually long-lived parents, offers a unique insight into why it is so challenging to achieve quality of life for very older people needing care and should be of interest to CCGs, social services departments, older people's care providers and carer and user organisations.</ab>

        <ab>International studies on the death of elderly nursing home residents show the complexity in the understanding of the professionals who care for the dying. The aim of this study is to explore the discourses about professional caregivers caring for those dying in Denmark in the last decade. A discourse analysis inspired by Foucault was constructed. The material consists of different source documents: research articles, newspaper articles, theses, books, websites - 35 sources in total. There are constructed six positions of speech, five discourses and three themes: (1) 'the work of the professional caregivers - a complex low-status work'; (2) 'the education of the professionals - the way to ensure a good death or possessing the right qualifications' and (3) 'the vulnerable professionals'. The study concludes that an economical/political discourse is dominating and sets up the frames within which the professionals care for dying residents, although the medical, the social/critical and the religious discourses attempt to speak against it. All positions articulate that the professional caregivers' job has a low status and that it is not possible to provide an optimal care due to lack of time, resources and education. Psychical or mental demands make the professionals vulnerable. The meaning of optimal care varies according to the positions of speech.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated. Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design. Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands. Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded. Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions. Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. Methods The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. Findings Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. Conclusions Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice. Clinical Relevances The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.</ab>

        <ab>Wound healing is a complex process that follows a progressive three-step sequence; the inflammatory phase, proliferative phase and remodelling phase. It is possible that all of these phases will be active in the same wound at the same time (Thomas and Bishop, 2007) and the duration of each stage will be influenced, among other factors, by the nutritional status of the individual. This article focuses on the role of nutrition, and the benefits of protein supplementation, in the management of chronic wounds, with a focus on pressure ulcers.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is challenging for many older adults. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination and technology. Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. Setting: Older adults having difficulty in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. Methods: All participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. Discussion: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose/Objectives: To explore interactions among personal, cancer, aging, and symptom variables relative to physical function (PF) in older adult breast cancer survivors to better identify vulnerable subgroups.Design: Secondary analysis of the American Cancer Society Studies of Cancer Survivors II.Setting: U.S. population-based mail and telephone survey.Sample: 2,885 breast cancer survivors from 14 different state cancer registries stratified by cancer type and time since diagnosis. A total of 184 female breast cancer survivors, aged 70 years or older, had complete data on variables of interest and were, therefore, included in this analysis.Methods: Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analysis was used to examine variable interactions.Main Research Variables: PF, symptom bother, comorbidity, social support, length of survivorship, treatment, stage, body mass index, physical activity, emotional health, and personal characteristics.Findings: An interaction effect between symptom bother and comorbidity was found in 39% of older adult breast cancer survivors, and an interaction effect between symptom bother and marital status was found in 40%. The most vulnerable group (8%) had high symptom bother and more than four comorbid conditions.Conclusions: Symptom bother, comorbidity, and marital status were found to have significant interactions such that high comorbidity and high symptom bother were significantly related to lower PF. Married participants with lower symptom bother had significantly higher PF scores. Comorbidity may be the best predictor of PF for the extreme ends of the symptom bother continuum. Advancing age alone was not a sufficient predictor of PF in this analysis.Implications for Nursing: Specific attention to symptom reports, comorbidity, and marital status can guide identification of older adult cancer survivors in need of ongoing survivorship care. The findings support use of a comprehensive assessment and tailored approach to care based on factors other than age.Knowledge Translation: CHAID interaction analysis may be useful in exploring complex nursing problems, such as the needs of older adult cancer survivors, and help oncology nurses develop appropriate interventions and referrals.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose -- The authors aim to present findings from their research on the implementation of Unified Assessment (UA) policy and the work of care coordinators who oversee the delivery of support to older people with complex needs. Design/methodology/approach -- A mixed methods approach included staff interviews (n 95) and focus groups (n = 3). Findings -- The care coordinator role is controversial and the lack of common terminology across health and social care obscures its importance. It is seen as a social care responsibility. Limited ownership amongst healthcare professionals leads to tensions in practice. The challenges of breaking down silo thinking embedded in established professional practices are highlighted as are infrastructural and capacity deficits. Disparities between policy intentions and practice means that UA is failing to meet core objectives relating to the delivery of seamless support. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to develop and evaluate evidence-informed interventions that test solutions to the problems faced in practice and support the delivery of more effective arrangements. Practical implications -- Practice development may be supported by: guidelines that are more prescriptive and include a formal role definition; joint training to promote shared understanding of key concepts; investment in administrative and IT infrastructures; and more coordinated direction at strategic level. Originality/value -- Over a decade has elapsed since the publication of UA Policy Guidance; however, there is limited published evidence on the effectiveness of UA policy and its translation into practice.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that according to government nursing blueprint, nurses provide complex care to extensive frail older people. District nurses are involved in working with community matrons to provide palliative care and nutrition advice, and working with old patients to help them care for themselves. The number of district nurses is decreasing because of the long time required to care for old patients thus increasing the work load on community nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Background: After surgery for oesophageal or gastric cancer, patients suffer from a variety of problems that affect their physical and mental health. Most previous studies on quality of life after this type of surgery are based on quantitative methods, and no studies to date have focused on the patient's subjective experiences of their quality of life from a long-term perspective. Objective: To illuminate patients' experiences of their quality of life, and how they handle their new life situation, from a long-term perspective, after oesophagectomy or gastrectomy for cancer. Method: This study was carried out in accordance with a descriptive explorative design focusing on the patients' quality of life after surgery for oesophageal/gastric cancer. Data collection was carried out using semi-structured focus group interviews. A total of 17 participants divided into 4 focus groups were included (2-5 years after elective surgery) in the study. Data was analysed with qualitative content analysis. Results: The results show that the patients' lives are severely hampered by adverse symptoms long time after surgery. The patients experienced the recovery period as a struggle and the theme ''When moving on becomes a struggle'' was shown to capture the patients' experiences. The main problems that acts as barriers in the patients' new life situation are those connected with nutrition and diarrhea who was shown not only affecting the patients from a physical perspective but also on a social and emotional level. The feeling of losing control of life was shown as a prominent problem and resulted in anxiety and fear about the future. Conclusion: This study shows that the patients' quality of life is heavily influenced by the remaining symptoms for a long time after surgery. However the patients ability to handle their new life situation does not only depend on the remaining symptom but on their ability to take control of the new life situation and learn to live life whit the symptoms instead of letting the symptoms limit their life. The complex new life situation that the patients meet after surgery motivates the needs of a supportive care programme, focusing on the patients' physical, mental and social needs.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The elderly population in Sweden is increasing. This will lead to an increased need for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance personnel to understand and meet these patients’ care needs. Using a caring science approach, we apply the patient’s perspective, and the aim of this study is to identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the assessment category “general affected health condition”. Thus, we have analyzed the characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state of “general affected health condition”, as either illness or ill-health. This offers a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the concept of frailty ought to be included in “The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems” (ICD-10).</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Older adults are more susceptible to water imbalance and ensuring they drink sufficiently is a complex and challenging issue for nurses. The factors that promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older people from drinking are not well understood. Objective: This study aimed to understand the complexity of issues associated with the hydration and hydration care of older people. Design: A qualitative study using multiple methods. Settings: Two healthcare sites providing care for older people in the South West of England: a hospital ward in a major hospital and a care home providing personal and nursing care. Participants: Twenty-one older people aged 68–96 years, were recruited to the study from the hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older people to participate were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion criteria were being unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or distressed to take part in the study. The staff participants of nurses and health care assistants totalled 21. The inclusion criterion for staff was any nurse or health care assistant providing hydration care. Seven friends or relatives participated by making anonymous comments via a suggestion box available to all friends and relatives. Methods: Data were collected via interviews with older people, focus group discussions involving staff, suggestion box comments made by friends and relatives and twelve hours observation of hydration practice. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to promote drinking including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in older people''s hands and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their experience of drinking was diminished by a variety of factors including a limited aesthetic experience and a focus on fluid consumption rather than on drinking as a pleasurable and social experience. Conclusion: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with drinking were lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social interaction was underplayed in both settings. Hydration practice which supports the individual needs of older people is complex and goes beyond simply ensuring the consumption of adequate fluids.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: Pain continues to be a common problem for older hospitalised patients, but little is known about how the complexities of actual clinical practice affect pain assessment and management in these patients. Objective: To examine how pain was assessed and managed in older patients who were admitted to geriatric evaluation and management units. Design, setting and participants: A naturalistic observational research design was used involving observations of interactions between nurses and patients, and follow-up interviews with nurses. Three observation periods were conducted between midnight and midday, which commenced at 03:30, 07:30, and 10:30, and three observation periods were conducted between midday and midnight, which commenced at 15:30, 18:30, and 22:30. Between 12 and 13 observations were conducted for each observation period, each ranging from 2 to 3h. The study was undertaken in two units, each located in an Australian public teaching hospital. Participants included registered nurses employed in the units, and patients in their care. Results: Four major themes were identified: communication among nurses and between older patients and nurses; strategies for pain management; environmental and organisational aspects of care; and complexities in the nature of pain. Nurses tended to use simple questioning with patients about the pain experienced. Despite the availability of ‘as required’ opioid medication for breakthrough or incident pain, nurses often preferred to wait to determine if pain was relieved following administration of fixed-dose paracetamol. Time of day impacted on how pain was managed due to availability of nursing staff. It was unit policy for doctors to reduce medications prescribed, which often extended to analgesics, and nurses were left to deal with patient tensions in addressing analgesic needs. Complexities were associated with the nature of pain experienced, in terms of perceived level of tolerable pain, the simultaneous presence of chronic and acute pain, location of pain, and differentiation of pain from discomfort. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the intricacies associated with how analgesic needs are addressed in older patients, especially those with communication deficits, the complex nature of older patients’ painful experiences, and the precarious balance of attempting to treat pain effectively while avoiding adverse effects of analgesics.</ab>

        <ab>One aspect of universalism in Swedish eldercare services is that publicly financed and publicly provided services have been both affordable for the poor and attractive enough to be preferred by the middle class. This article identifies two trends in home care for older people in Sweden: a decline in the coverage of publicly funded services and their increasing marketisation. We explore the mechanisms behind these trends by reviewing policy documents and official reports, and discuss the distributional consequences of the changes by analysing two data sets from Statistics Sweden: the Swedish Level of Living surveys from 1988/1989 and 2004/2005 and a database on all users of tax deductions on household and care services in 2009. The analysis shows that the decline of tax-funded home care is not the result of changing eldercare legislation and was not intended by national policy-makers. Rather the decline was caused by a complex interplay of decision-making at central and local levels, resulting in stricter municipal targeting. The trend towards marketisation has been more clearly intended by national policy-makers. Legislative changes have opened up tax-funded services to private provision, and a customer-choice (voucher) model and a tax deduction for household- and care services have been introduced. As a result of declining tax-funded home-care services, older persons with lower education increasingly receive family care, while those with higher education are more likely to buy private services. The combination of income-related user fees, customer-choice models and the tax deduction has created an incentive for high-income older persons to turn to the market instead of using public home-care services. Thus, Swedish home care, as a universal welfare service, is now under threat and may become increasingly dominated by groups with less education and lower income which, in turn, could jeopardise the quality of care.</ab>

        <ab>At Leicester Royal Infirmary, the care of frail older people occupies a disproportionate amount of emergency department (ED) staff's time and resources. Too few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as possible. This article describes how the unit operates.</ab>

        <ab>With anticipated greater demand for formal care services globally, this article examines the sociodemographic and health characteristics of frail older people in receipt of community support. Data were collected from audits of case files of older people receiving care management at two time points during which two government policy initiatives were implemented to promote greater standardization in health and social care provision for older people in England. Findings at Time 2 revealed that there were higher levels of physical and mental impairment and more health care assessments undertaken. There was a slight decrease in home care receipt but a marginal increase of more intensive home care provision. Service users living with a carer were less likely to receive home care but more likely to receive respite care or day care than those living alone. The policy goal of widening access to specialist health and social care services for older people with mental health problems was achieved. Guidance that focused eligibility criteria on the identification of older people with complex needs required the availability of appropriate support and services. Irrespective of policy initiatives, the sociodemographic characteristics of older people and the availability of informal support are principal determinants of service provision.</ab>

        <ab>Heart failure is a complex syndrome with an increasing prevalence in the elderly. The presence of multiple comorbidities and associated frailty make management of an already complex disease process more challenging. A practical and pragmatic approach is presented in this paper with regards to pharmacological interventions, the role of heart failure specialist nurses in the context of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and end-of-life care issues.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Background: With life expectancy lengthening, the number of those who will require care in a nursing home will increase dramatically in the next 20 years. Nursing home residents are frail older adults with complex needs, dependent on advanced nursing care. Long-term residents in nursing homes have long-term relationships with the nurses, which require a unique approach to the interpersonal aspects of nursing care. Understanding what is experienced as care quality, including quality of interpersonal processes, requires insight into the residents’ perspectives for best value in care to be realized. Objective: Main objective was to describe the nursing home residents’ experience with direct nursing care, related to the interpersonal aspects of quality of care. Design: A descriptive, exploratory design was used. Settings: Four public municipal nursing homes in Norway with long-term residents were purposely selected for the study. Participants: Fifteen mentally lucid residents were included. The inclusion criteria were aged 65 and over, being a resident of the nursing home for one month or longer, and physical and mental capacity to participate in the interview. Method: In-depth interviews with the residents were performed. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using meaning categorizing. Results: The residents emphasized the importance of nurses acknowledging their individual needs, which included need for general and specialized care, health promotion and prevention of complications, and prioritizing the individuals. The challenging balance between self-determination and dependency, the altered role from homeowner to resident, and feelings of indignity and depreciation of social status were key issues in which the residents perceived that their integrity was at risk in the patient–nurse interaction and care. Psychosocial well-being was a major issue, and the residents expressed an important role of the nursing staff helping them to balance the need for social contact and to be alone, and preserving a social network. Conclusions: Quality nursing care in nursing home implies a balanced, individual approach to medical, physical and psychosocial care, including interpersonal aspects of care. The interpersonal relationship between resident and nurse implies long-term commitment, reciprocal relationship on a personal level and interpersonal competence of the nurses to understand each resident''s needs.</ab>

Long-term residents in nursing homes have long-term relationships with the nurses, which require a unique approach to the interpersonal aspects of nursing care. Understanding what is experienced as care quality, including quality of interpersonal processes, requires insight into the residents’ perspectives for best value in care to be realized. Objective: Main objective was to describe the nursing home residents’ experience with direct nursing care, related to the interpersonal aspects of quality of care. Design: A descriptive, exploratory design was used. Settings: Four public municipal nursing homes in Norway with long-term residents were purposely selected for the study. Participants: Fifteen mentally lucid residents were included. The inclusion criteria were aged 65 and over, being a resident of the nursing home for one month or longer, and physical and mental capacity to participate in the interview. Method: In-depth interviews with the residents were performed. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using meaning categorizing. Results: The residents emphasized the importance of nurses acknowledging their individual needs, which included need for general and specialized care, health promotion and prevention of complications, and prioritizing the individuals. The challenging balance between self-determination and dependency, the altered role from homeowner to resident, and feelings of indignity and depreciation of social status were key issues in which the residents perceived that their integrity was at risk in the patient–nurse interaction and care. Psychosocial well-being was a major issue, and the residents expressed an important role of the nursing staff helping them to balance the need for social contact and to be alone, and preserving a social network. Conclusions: Quality nursing care in nursing home implies a balanced, individual approach to medical, physical and psychosocial care, including interpersonal aspects of care. The interpersonal relationship between resident and nurse implies long-term commitment, reciprocal relationship on a personal level and interpersonal competence of the nurses to understand each resident''s needs.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To explore the experience of patients living with complex wounds and the impact of undergoing negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) as part of their treatment.Method: Qualitative data were collected from eight patients, using semi-structured interviews. A purposive, stratified sampling approach was used to identify participants with a range of wound types, as well as age and gender. Participants were recruited from one primary care trust and were interviewed, following 10 days of treatment with NPWT. The matrix-based 'Framework' approach, from the National Centre for Social Research, was used to structure the analysis.Results: Of the eight participants recruited, five were female and three male, with an age range of 46-77 years. Five overarching categories, with their constituent themes, were identified from the data. The first, developing a wound through crisis, has three themes: a failing body, missed diagnosis and failed professional intervention. The second category, decreased control, has four related themes: poor communication; failed wound healing; poor discharge planning and failure to recover. The third category, increased control, has four themes: understanding what is happening; symptom control; positive professional relationships and returning to health. The fourth category, using NPWT, has two themes: information and understanding of NPWT and expectations and experience of NPWT. The final category sets out participant recommendations about the device and has two themes: device issues and improving professional practice.Conclusion: This study investigated the experience of patients undergoing NPWT for complex wounds in the home setting and reveals a number of the psychosocial effects of using this therapy in this environment. Participants saw NPWT as an active intervention, associated with improved wound healing and symptom control. The participant experience described in this study, and the recommendations they make, provide a valuable resource to inform service improvement programmes and wound research.</ab>

        <ab>New models of interprofessional working are continuously being proposed to address the burgeoning health and social care needs of older people with complex and long-term health conditions. Evaluations of the effectiveness of these models tend to focus on process measures rather than outcomes for the older person. This discussion paper argues that the concept of frailty, and measures based on it, may provide a more user-centred tool for the evaluation of interprofessional services -- a tool that cuts across unidisciplinary preoccupations and definitions of effectiveness. Numerous frailty scales have been developed for case identification and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes. We suggest that they may also be particularly suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of interprofessional working with community-dwelling older people. Several exemplars of frailty scales that might serve this purpose are identified, and their potential contributions and limitations are discussed. Further work is required to establish which is the most suitable scales for this application. The development of an appropriate frailty scale could provide an opportunity for interprofessional debate about the forms of care and treatment that should be prioritised to improve the health and well-being of this population.</ab>

        <ab>Older people, particularly those who are frail, are vulnerable to dehydration. Management of dehydration in older people can be more complex than in younger adults because of the physical effects of ageing. As the population ages, nurses will increasingly care for older patients in every setting. This article provides an overview of the physiological changes that affect the ability of older people to maintain a normal fluid balance. Risk factors for dehydration are reviewed and strategies for the prevention, detection and management of dehydration are discussed. The article focuses on subcutaneous fluid replacement for the management of dehydration in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Older people, particularly those who are frail, are vulnerable to dehydration. Management of dehydration in older people can be more complex than in younger adults because of the physical effects of ageing. As the population ages, nurses will increasingly care for older patients in every setting. This article provides an overview of the physiological changes that affect the ability of older people to maintain a normal fluid balance. Risk factors for dehydration are reviewed and strategies for the prevention, detection and management of dehydration are discussed. The article focuses on subcutaneous fluid replacement for the management of dehydration in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Structured clinical data generated using standardized terminologies such as the Omaha System are available for evaluating healthcare quality and patient outcomes. New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is needed and the level of care that is provided. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        <ab>The age of the UK population is increasing, resulting in many people living with multiple long-term conditions, such as diabetes. Many older people who have complex health needs reside in care homes. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of the diabetes-related problems that exist for older people living in care homes, including the barriers to the delivery of high-quality diabetes care. The authors focus on the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines for Care Home Residents with Diabetes (Diabetes UK, 2010), which discusses the shortfalls in delivery of care, identifies possible barriers and their consequences and highlights the tools that can support change.</ab>

        <ab>Expression of sexuality is a lifelong need and a basic human right, yet little is known about how staff in aged care facilities approach and manage the sexuality needs of residents. Fifty-two staff members from the rest home component of aged care facilities in one District Health Board completed a survey anonymously. Findings indicated that while the majority believe residents have sexual needs that should be acknowledged and supported, expression of sexuality often created discomfort and the need was not regularly assessed, or managed by a team approach. Lack of privacy, negative staff and family attitudes plus the difficulty of managing risk make responding to sexuality a complex issue. The combination of individual and institutional barriers suggest that thoughtful and creative team strategies are required to address the sexuality related needs of the older person in residential care.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose/Objectives: To identify appropriate strategies for pharmacotherapeutic agents in the management of pain in older adults with cancer.Data Sources: PubMed literature searches, personal reference collection, and clinical experience.Data Synthesis: To make good decisions about pain management when developing treatment plans for older adults, healthcare providers should focus on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in the context of the physiologic changes that occur with aging.Conclusions: Unrelieved pain can have a detrimental effect on older adults; conversely, overmedicating can lead to an increased risk of adverse events. With advancing age, physiologic changes alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs by reducing their absorption, changing their distribution, and modifying their metabolism and elimination. Also, common comorbidities increase the risk of pharmacologic toxicity and narrow the therapeutic window. In addition, polypharmacy—an issue more common in older adults—increases the complexity of prescribing and risk of adverse events. Consequently, older adults require individualization of their pharmacotherapies. Healthcare providers should consider carefully the risks and benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjuvants before initiating an analgesic trial. The 2009 guidelines published by the American Geriatrics Society described several key principles for prescribing analgesics to older adults and offered specific recommendations and caveats for each drug class.Implications for Nursing: Current guidelines support appropriate management of cancer pain in older adults with specific recommendations for each class of analgesics as well as general prescribing principles.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on the development, delivery, content and student evaluation of a comprehensive elder abuse and self-neglect workshop for public health nursing and social work students. The workshop provided an interdisciplinary shared learning experience for the students to prepare them for their critical role in safeguarding vulnerable adults. The aim of the workshop was to increase knowledge, awareness and understanding of roles and responsibilities and critical practice problems in the prevention and management of elder abuse and self-neglect. The shared learning approach provided clarity on roles and responsibility, valuing and respecting the contribution of each team member. The importance of building communication and trust with team members and clients was seen as critical. Through case studies and group discussion, assessment and practice skills were developed and awareness heightened on the complexity of the critical practice problems and ethical issues.</ab>

        <ab>Comorbid depression and anxiety in late life present challenges for geriatric mental health care providers. These challenges include identifying the often complex diagnostic presentations both clinically and in a research context. This potent comorbidity can be conceived as double jeopardy in older adults, further diminishing their quality of life. Geriatric health care providers need to understand psychiatric comorbidity of this type for accurate diagnosis and early referral to specialists, and to coordinate interdisciplinary care. Researchers in the field also need to recognize potential multiple impacts of comorbidities with respect to assessment and treatment domains. This article describes the prevalence of late-life depression and anxiety disorders and reviews studies on this comorbidity in older adults. Risk factors and protective factors for anxiety and depression in later life are reviewed, and information is provided about comparative symptoms, the selection of assessment tools, and challenges to the provision of interdisciplinary, evidence-based care.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose To assess whether a multifaceted inter vention can reduce the incidence of cellulitis in patients receiving hypoder moclysis on a complex continuing care unit in a geriatric facility. Method The multifaceted intervention consisted of the following: in-services on the safety engineered devices for nurses and education to reinforce best practice techniques; implementation of checklist auditing tool to monitor procedure, frequency and duration of hypodermoclysis; updating Baycrest nursing skills package; upgrading from 0.5% to 2% chlorhexidine gluconate skin preparation solution; switching from V-adapter to a single-port system. The main outcome measure was the number of documented cellulitis cases on the unit post-i ntervention. Results From September 1 to November 30, 2008, 12 cases of cellulitis associated with hypodermoclysis were documented. Post-intervention, three case of hypodermoclysis-associated cellulitis were documented. The frequency of hypodermoclysis pre-intervention was 68.6 per 1000 patient days versus postintervention at 63.1. The hypodermoclysis-related cellulitis incidence on the unit decreased Significantly from 23.2 pre-intervention to 6.6 post-intervention per 1000 patient days (p &lt; 0.05, chisquare analysis). Conclusion A multifaceted intervention was successful in reducing the incidence of cellulitis associated with hypodermoclysis on a complex and continuing care unit in a geriatric facility.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence is commonly associated with chronic diseases. Strong associations exist between continence problems, impairments outside the lower urinary tract and activity limitations. These associations also occur in diseases that directly affect the neurological control mechanism for continence. The World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a paradigm for thinking about disease and its consequences, including urinary incontinence. This paper reviews the association between disease, impairment and activity limitation for some common chronic diseases and for older adults. The complexity of the relationships between different aspects of urinary incontinence has important implications for the assessment and management of urinary incontinence in chronic disease and for older adults.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the experiences of older people living with heart failure and their transitions from independence to dependence and for some death. New Zealand's ageing population is predicted to increase from 12% in 2001 to 25% by the year 2051, similar to the worldwide trend of ageing. A high proportion of these people will have one or more chronic illnesses. Associated with the increase in survival is a growing body of research examining the needs of the older person with heart failure and finding particular problems with end of life care. Older people face many challenges in living with their heart failure, in particular the transition to dependence. To study the transition a longitudinal qualitative study using General Inductive approach was used. Participants were interviewed every 3 months for a 12-month period during 2006-2008. A total of 79 interviews with 25 people were completed. Our findings showed that transition was not a simple linear process with the older person moving from one phase to another; instead their experiences illustrated the complexity of transitions they faced and what helped them to manage these. The older people in this study illustrated the importance of trust in health professionals and believed they would receive good care. Their fears revealed concerns about being a burden as they deteriorate and becoming more dependent. Understanding the complex issues related to transition to dependence can provide health professionals with a framework for assessment and approaches to providing the support required.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In the future, health care services will be challenged by an increasing number of older hospital patients. This prompts a need to focus on and implement a health promoting approach in older people's nursing. Aim: The aim of this exploratory study was to illuminate nurses' reflections about health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients. Method: The study had a qualitative descriptive design. The concepts of health, health promotion and empowerment were initially introduced to nurses before participating in multistage focus group interviews. Two groups of nurses participated in three focus group interviews that were conducted by a moderator and an assistant. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with qualitative content analysis. Findings: The nurses unfolded the theme «diversity and complexity marks health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients » as the latent content in the text. Two categories, «empowerment as balance of power - a twofold relation» and «focusing on the individual person», described the manifest content in the texts. The categories were further supported by sub-categories. Conclusion: The focus group interviews showed the ambiguity and complexity in the interpretation of the concepts -- health promotion and empowerment -- related to the older hospital patient. The findings also indicated that multistage focus group interviews may be a useful tool to develop nurses ' reflections about their clinical practice.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the work of an acute assessment and liaison service for older people, including the role of the older people's apecialist nurse in the service. The service screens all patients admitted who are over the age of 75 for problems specific to a frail population and to identify where ongoing specialist support referral or advice is indicated. Patients with complex problems undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The service has reduced length of stay and resulted in better care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement. BACKGROUND: Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations. DESIGN: This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. METHODS: The convenience sample (n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. CONCLUSIONS: Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.</ab>

        <ab>Discharging frail older people from acute hospital settings has been an issue of concern for over 40 years and recent studies suggest that enduring problems remain. This paper explores the experiences of discharge from three different units: an acute surgical ward, an acute medical ward and a specialist ward for older people. Based on extensive data from interviews with older people, their family carers and ward-based staff, a grounded theory of the discharge experience is presented. This suggests that the quality of discharge hinges largely on whether the focus of efforts is on 'pace' (the desire to discharge older people as rapidly as possible) or 'complexity' (where due account is taken of the complex interaction of medical and wider social issues). When pace is the focus, 'pushing' and 'fixing' are the main processes driving discharge. However, when attention is given to complexity, far more subtle processes of 'informing' and 'brokering' are in evidence. These latter processes are conceived of as forms of 'relational practice' and it is argued that such practices lie at the heart of high quality care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: Seventy percent of people over 65 years of age have hypertension, and one third of elders fall each year. These conditions frequently coexist, and each carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with hypertension. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication management accordingly. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article will assist the NP to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.</ab>

        <ab>Identification of the imminently dying patient can be a complex and difficult process, especially in a frail and elderly population with malignancy. The Liverpool Care Pathway utilizes a number of identification criteria for end-of-life care, but additional prognostic physical signs may be useful. This article describes specific skin changes not previously featured in the literature in four patients at end of life with malignancy, and discusses the potential use of this as a prognostic indicator.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives. To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Way-finding Effectiveness Scale (WES) for Korean persons with dementia (PWDs). Design. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey method was used. Methods. Data were collected with a non-probability sampling strategy using structured format face-to-face interviews. A convenience sample of 83 community-dwelling PWDs and their family caregivers were recruited. The participants were PWDs who were over 60 years of age, had been medically diagnosed with dementia or showed signs and symptoms of dementia, had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of less than 24 of 30 and were independent in walking. Results. Internal consistency for the 29-item KWES was 0·93 and exceeded 0·70 for the four subscales (complex way-finding goals, CWG; analytic strategy, AS; global strategy, GS; and simple way-finding goals, SWG). The intercorrelations for total KWES and subscales demonstrated a high to moderate relationship ranging from 0·84 (total and CWG) to 0·24 (AS and SWG). Pearson correlations between each subscale scores of the KWES and K-MMSE demonstrated significant, moderate relationships ranging from 0·41 (CWG and K-MSE) to 0·28 (AS and K-MMSE). Differences in current and prior behaviour of KWES were significant for the total (t = -21·00, p &lt; 0·001) and subscales (t = -28·33- -9·33, p &lt; 0·001). Conclusion. Acceptable reliabilities and validities support the conclusion that the KWES is a valid and reliable instrument for examining way-finding effectiveness for Korean PWDs. Relevance to clinical practice. The KWES will contribute to the development of understanding of way-finding ability for community-dwelling PWDs in both research and clinical practices.</ab>

        <ab>Prevention and management of delayed transfer of older people from hospital to community settings is an enduring issue in industrialised societies and is the subject of many recent policies in the United Kingdom. A deeper, evidence-based understanding of the complex organizational and interprofessional issues which contribute to delays in transfer has emerged in recent years. Despite this, and the relative success of recent policies, two recent reviews of the area highlight the lack of studies on patients' perspectives. We sought to address this deficit by using conversational interviews and a phenomenological approach to explore and interpret participants' perceptions of delayed transfer from hospital into the community. A purposive sampling strategy was employed to incorporate participants from different categories of delay identified on weekly Situation Reports. Participants aged 65 years and over (mean age 82 ± 5.4 years) and with a mean delay of 32 days (± 26) were recruited from three hospitals based in two NHS Trusts in the South of England. This paper focuses on their perceptions of the effects of delayed transfer into the community, their involvement in discharge planning and future community care needs. Our findings show that participants actively or passively relinquished their involvement in the processes of discharge planning because of the perceived expertise of others and also feelings of disempowerment secondary to poor health, low mood, dependency, lack of information and the intricacies of discharge planning processes for complex community care needs. Participants expressed a longing for continuity, emphasised the importance of social contact and sometimes appeared unrealistic about their future care needs. While current policies may have helped reduce overall numbers of delayed patients in the UK, our study suggests that there is scope for improvement in the involvement of delayed patients in planning their discharge into the community.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric failure to thrive (GFTT) poses a complex clinical issue in gerontological nursing practice. GFTT is not a normal part of aging, nor is it an outcome of chronic illness. Rather, GFTT describes a lack of vitality and diminished capacity for life and outlines a process of functional decline that is often difficult to explain. The purpose of this article is to review GFTT, examine the literature on GFTT, and suggest strategies for the identification, assessment, and creative management of this complex condition that affects millions of older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The aims of this study were to describe: (1) how the Homelessness Intervention Programme addressed the needs of elderly people who were homeless or at risk of homelessness; and (2) the factors that influenced the ability of the programme to address client needs. The programme was offered by a multi-service non-profit agency serving low-income families and individuals in an urban neighbourhood in Ontario, Canada. Using a case study approach, we conducted 10 individual interviews and three focus groups with programme clients, programme providers, other service providers and programme funders. Programme providers completed intake forms, monthly follow-up forms and exit/housing change forms for each of the 129 clients served by the programme over a 28-month period. Approximately equal proportions of clients were between 54 years old and 65 years old (47%) and over 65 years (53%). There were equal proportions of women and men. In addition to being homeless or marginally housed, clients lived with multiple and complex issues including chronic illness, mental illness and substance abuse. Through the facilitation of continuity of care, the programme was able to meet the needs of this vulnerable group of elderly people. Three types of continuity of care were facilitated: relational, informational and management continuity. The study confirmed the value of a continuous caring relationship with an identified provider and the delivery of a seamless service through coordination, integration and information sharing between different providers. Study findings also highlighted the broader systemic factors that acted as barriers to the programme and its ability to meet the needs of elderly people. These factors included limited housing options available; limited income supports; and lack of coordinated, accessible community health and support services. The central findings stress the importance of continuity of care as a guiding concept for intervention programmes for homeless and marginally housed elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Falls are the leading cause of serious injury and deaths among the elderly. A recent study found that psychotropic medication had the strongest relationship to a fall episode. Objectives: To examine the relationship of psychotropic medications to falls in an inpatient geriatric psychiatric setting, and utilize this knowledge to enhance fall prevention strategies in psychiatric settings. Design: One-year prospective, exploratory and descriptive study. Results: Patients age &gt;/=70 were slightly more than 5 times as likely to fall, and those on atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants were approximately 1/5th as likely to. Conclusions: Falls have multiple causes and prevention requires a multifaceted approach. Antipsychotics should be used with caution, especially among elderly with a high risk of falls. Each hospital fall should be examined in 'real' time, and evaluated regarding patients' symptoms, medications, and co-morbidities. There is a great need to continue to study and learn as much as possible about the complex array of factors that contribute to the phenomena of falls in an acute geriatric psychiatric hospital unit.</ab>

        <ab>The numbers of frail older persons using emergency departments are already considerable and will continue to increase over time. There are a number of issues related to the assessment and care of older patients that are significantly different to other patient groups. The traditional emergency department (ED) model focusing on rapid triage, treatment and throughput does not meet the needs of many older patients, who have complex presentations, and require comprehensive assessment and referral. In response to this, there are already a number of appropriate and innovative approaches to the care of the older patient demonstrated in the literature. Nurses have a crucial role in contributing to these approaches and in raising the profile of quality care of the older person. Some specific areas that ED nurses can focus on include a more comprehensive approach to assessment and discharge planning, improved communication with the patient and their personal carers, attention to basic nursing care, and making the physical environment safer and less stressful for the older patient. While developing collaborations with their aged care nursing colleagues is important, emergency nurses need to view care of the older person as a central part of their own core business.</ab>

        <ab>This qualitative study identified influences on participation in physical activity among seniors living in the community and in long-term care facilities. A total of 24 seniors participated in individual face-to-face interviews. Through thematic analysis, the overarching theme identified that past experiences, life transitions, and future concerns influence seniors' participation in physical activity. This overarching theme helps explain the complexity of physical activity participation in later life. The subthemes included intergenerational influences, establishment of early physical activity patterns, family transitions over the life course, changing health status over the life course, and future health concerns. A greater understanding of an individual's life history is paramount for nurses to help increase participation in physical activity among seniors.</ab>

        <ab>Objective The aim of this study was to determine if a process-oriented integrated care pathway (ICP) was effective in a rehabilitation setting and whether the improvement gained through the rehabilitation process was sustained post discharge. Design This study incorporated a quantitative analysis of the Barthel Index Score (BIS) for a retrospective convenience sample of patients who had been discharged from the rehabilitation unit. A longitudinal examination of this sample group was conducted and BIS results were compared between admission, upon discharge, and three months post discharge. Setting The study was conducted at a rehabilitation unit (the Unit) at a medium-sized general hospital in a rural centre northwest of Melbourne, Victoria Subjects The sample consisted of a convenience sample of thirty participants who were discharged from the Unit between December 2003 and January 2004. The mean age of participants was 75 years. Main outcome measures Health outcomes and improvements in functional and dependency status were determined using the Barthel Index Score (BIS). Results The introduction of the generic clinical pathway yielded positive results with the sample group maintaining functional status and independence post discharge. Conclusions Although this study is limited by sample size and homogeneity of sample; nevertheless it demonstrates that process-oriented integrated care pathways may be useful to effectively manage rehabilitation and aged-care units that contain patients with a wide range of complex presentations and diagnosis-related groups.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory study investigated caregiving and interdependencies in families of frail older case management clients who coreside with younger individuals in need of care. Analyses were based on interviews with 78 older adults recruited from a large urban case management program. To be eligible for the study, the older adult had to coreside with an individual under age 60 who had disabilities or chronic health problems and/or with minors. Results indicated that the majority of older adults were primary caregivers for at least one younger individual. In a substantial number of families, the older adult depended on a younger adult with disabilities for primary care. Older adults who lived with both younger adults with disabilities and minors experienced more negative affect than those who lived with only one of these two kinds of younger individuals. Positive affect among elders living with younger adults with disabilities was positively related to the number of formal services received by the younger adults. The implications of these findings for service delivery to families with complex needs for care are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Home-Based Primary Care is a program designed by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) to care for frail, medically complex, elderly veteran patients in their home setting. Unique to the VA, the program has similarities and differences in relation to typical Medicare/Medicaid home health and hospice programs. The VA has demonstrated success in maintaining the patients' independence and quality of life as well as exceptional management of chronic disease and prevention.</ab>

        <ab>Preventing injuries in older populations (aged 50-86 years) is more complex than in younger populations because of frailty, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and physical and cognitive functional limitations. To improve accessibility and delivery of comprehensive, focused injury prevention, we developed a model incorporating applicable features of our national children's program with additional elements to address challenges of older populations. The older adult injury prevention model addresses gaps in prevention by improving access to risk factor screening, safety devices, education, counseling, medical care, and referrals.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives.  The aim of the study was to investigate the quality of life and related factors among older people who are in pain and in need of help to manage daily living. Background.  To intervene against the low quality of life in nursing care knowledge about factors affecting it is needed and this is especially important for vulnerable people such as those who suffer from pain and who are in need of help to manage daily living. Methods.  Five hundred and twenty-six people, aged 75–102 years participated in this study. Results.  Those in pain reported a significantly higher degree of all complaints and lower quality of life in all measures compared with those not in pain. Overall quality of life was associated with mobility problems, sleeping problems and depressed mood, while health-related quality of life was associated with living in special accommodations, walking problems, mobility problems and fatigue. Conclusions.  Those in need of help to manage daily living and in pain seem to be at higher risk of lowered quality of life than those not in pain and the lower quality of life among those in pain is probably caused by the complex of complaints rather than pain per se. Relevance to clinical practice.  Daily nursing care should identify and treat the complex of complaints related to pain as well as pain itself, to improve everyday life and quality of life for older people in pain.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this research was to disclose the characteristics of quality of life as perceived by physically frail but lucid elderly people living in nursing homes to increase the understanding of the phenomenon of quality of life in this setting. Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what matters most in relation to their quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Caregiving has only recently been acknowledged by the nation as an important topic for millions of Americans. A psychological or sociological approach to care-giving services has been most often applied, with little attention to the population-based public health outcomes of caregivers. We conceptualize caregiving as an emerging public health issue involving complex and fluctuating roles. We contend that caregiving must be considered in the context of life span needs that vary according to the ages, developmental levels, mental health needs, and physical health demands of both caregivers and care recipients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To investigate health beliefs and behaviors among Old Order Amish. METHODS: 87 Old Order Amish adults. Open-ended questions and quantitative measures - Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), and Perceived Social Support (PSS) scales. Hermeneutic analysis of qualitative data. Comparison of means of quantitative measures across gender and generation using ANOVA. RESULTS: Support for multidimensional concept of health, 2) Dominance across generations of exercise/physical activity and nutrition as health-maintaining behavior, 3) Definition of health as ability to continue working to provide for family, 4) Work-related physical activity most frequent health-maintaining behavior; 5) Internal-HLOC consistently scored most highly; 6) Chance-HLOC scores were higher than powerful others-HLOC scores; 7) HPLP - nutrition ranked among highest and exercise ranked lowest; and 8) PSS family scores were higher than PSS friends scores. CONCLUSIONS: Strong Amish family support system makes family involvement in health maintenance essential, 2) Findings important for clinicians working with persons who prefer natural remedies to complex scientific options, 3) Evidence that health/illness of culturally-diverse rural persons may be unique, and 4) Need for further examination of cultural appropriateness of measures in research with diverse groups.</ab>

        <ab>Few studies shed light on what older people themselves consider a good or dignified death. This study is part of a larger project where interviews were used to follow 12 nursing home residents over time. The aim of the present study was to reach a deeper understanding of seven older people's thoughts, feelings and attitudes towards death. The participants were interviewed on four occasions across 18-24 months, and the interviews were analysed using a hermeneutic method. The findings revealed three main themes: 1. Zest for life, 2. Indifferent additude, 3. Longing for death. The themes mirror the complexity of what ageing and nearing the end of life can mean. A strong desire among the participants was to be more involved in their own personal care and in everyday life at the nursing home. Person-oriented care based on the philisophy of palliative care, and including conversation as a natural component, might promote the older person's possiblities to obtain a good death.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing nurses to meet the care needs of an expanding aging population is a challenge for nursing. Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current vacancies. This article describes the integration of long-term care experiences into senior year community health practicums and reports on a qualitative analysis to evaluate the project's impact on student attitudes and intentions toward geriatric nursing roles.</ab>

        <ab>Technological dependency is defined as a short or long-term reliance on machines and techniques to evaluate, satisfy or resolve health problems. In nursing technological dependency has been explored in the context of caring. Hitherto it has been maintained that technology and caring are contradictory, but a more prominent view is that technology and caring can and must be reconciled to provide high-quality care. This study describes patients' and families' experience of long-term home treatment with noninvasive ventilation during sleep with or without additional oxygen therapy. Considering the potential burden of undergoing this treatment the research question is: What is patients' and families' experience of being dependent on technical breathing assistance during sleep? The methodological approach draws from interpretive phenomenology and narrative analysis. Participants were six patients aged 45-70, five spouses and one daughter. Data, generated through two 1-hour semi-structured interviews with each pair of participants, were analysed into themes. Results are presented by the following narratives: (i) mixed blessing: life-saving treatment - meaningless exertion; (ii) compassion and understanding central amid use of complex machines; (iii) listening to the body; (iv) wanting to be seen as healthy; (v) dominance of technological thinking; and (vi) sustained work in maintaining the treatment. It is concluded that being dependent on technical breathing assistance during sleep, with or without oxygen, was a major life event for participants. The treatment was experienced as constraining and intrusive, particularly at the beginning, but concurrently it dramatically relieved difficulties for most participants. Regardless of its usefulness it provoked questions on purpose, indicating that the way to implement the treatment is crucial. Professionals need to pay close attention to how they introduce noninvasive ventilation technique, putting caring concern and respect for unique needs of patients and their families at the forefront.</ab>

        <ab>The numbers of patients with end-stage renal disease are growing, with a disproportionate increase among those who are elderly, dependent and with multiple co-morbidities. More of these patients are choosing to be managed conservatively, without dialysis. Palliative provision for these patients within UK renal services is limited, but the recent National Service Framework for Renal Services (Department of Health, 2005) has promoted service development. However, few models of service provision have been described. This article describes a retrospective review of a new service for conservatively-managed patients with end-stage renal disease. The range and complexity of the health needs of this population is demonstrated, and an example of service development described. A model of the stages of the conservative pathway and appropriate interventions was developed. The absence of research evidence prevented development of formal audit standards, and highlighted the urgent need for evaluation of models of care.</ab>

        <ab>Care giving to a dementia sufferer is complex (Parsons, 1997) and inherently stressful (Baldwin et a1 1989). It is suggested that the predominance of the care-giver stressor-burden research paradigm during the last thirty years has frequently been uni-dimensional, objectively oriented, generally equivocal, and unconvincing in its findings. Dillehay and Sandys (1990), suggest that preoccupation with such typically narrow approaches has delayed the much-needed development of a more accurate understanding of the lived experience (the phenomenology of are-giving). Researching the experience of care giving to a dementing relative requires a research strategy, which acknowledges the intricacies, complexities, subjectivity and humanness of that experience. That is the premise behind this paper. A multi-dimensional phenomenological PhD study is presented. The focus is on understanding care giving from the individual and collective perspectives of forty-six spouse caregivers. The methodological implications (including influences of Husserl and Heidegger) are outlined before the phenomenological research fmdings are presented and discussed. Ethical approval was given by the Bassetlaw Hospital and Community NHS Trust Ethics Committee (now part of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust).</ab>

        <ab>Deconditioning is a complex process of physiological change following a period of inactivity, bedrest or sedentary lifestyle. It results in functional losses in such areas as mental status, degree of continence and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. It is frequently associated with hospitalization in the elderly. The most predictable effects of deconditioning are seen in the musculoskeletal system and include diminished muscle mass, decreases of muscle strength by two to five per cent per day, muscle shortening, changes in periarticular and cartilaginous joint structure and marked loss of leg strength that seriously limit mobility. The decline in muscle mass and strength has been linked to falls, functional decline, increased frailty and immobility. The authors describe a three-pronged strategy to combat deconditioning that includes a model of care appropriate to the growing population of elderly clients, the creation of an 'elder-friendly' hospital environment and an exercise program.</ab>

        <ab>Rising nursing home (NH) costs and the poor quality of NH care make it important to recognize elders for whom NH care may be inappropriate. As a first step in developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer services than NHs.</ab>

        <ab>This paper provides a critical exploration of the assumptions and narratives underpinning the development of social policy initiatives targeting caring relationships based upon family ties. Using a narrative approach attention is drawn to the ways in which family identities are open to a far greater range of negotiation than is assumed by policy. Drawing on the United Kingdom as a case example, questions are posed about intergenerational relations and the nature of late life citizenship. The comparatively recent invention of narratives supporting 'informal care' and the link with neo-liberal and 'third way' notions of active citizenship are explored. As is the failure of policy developments to take into account the diversity of care giving styles and the complexity of caring relationships. It is argued that the uneven and locally specific ways in which policy develops enables the co-existence of a complex range of narratives about family, caring and ageing which address diverse aspects of the family life of older people in often contradictory ways.</ab>

        <ab>Policy on care in the community was founded on the premise that the care of frail elderly people with disabilities would be a joint responsibility for health and social care professionals, and family carers, supported by people within their social networks. The policy assumes that such social networks are common features of all communities in contemporary Britain, containing a reserve of people who can be called upon to provide support to carers. The present paper draws on material gathered for a qualitative study of the experiences carers in South Asian communities to examine the quality and quantity of informal support that was available in different types of households. Male and female carers were selected from the Punjabi Sikh, Gujarati Hindu, and Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities. A total of 105 carers participated in the project. Participants were caring for people in all age groups with physical and/or mental distress, and in some cases, with multiple and complex impairments. The analysis of carers' accounts suggested that, for a variety of reasons, the main carer, irrespective of gender, had limited support both in nuclear and extended households. In addition, societal attitudes towards disability and the fear of obligation prevented the seeking and accepting of help from wider social networks. The paper concludes that the evidence does not support the assumption about extended families, and their willingness and ability to support carers. Many issues highlighted in this paper have far-reaching implications for policy makers in many countries in the West where South Asian people have made their homes.</ab>

        <ab>Developments in primary and intermediate care services have enhanced interest in the notion of care management, the processes that it encompasses and the challenges that it poses to practitioners who are more used to working in a uni- or multidisciplinary manner. This article explores the way that a set of practitioners, new to care management, coped with the challenges of working within a newly created care-managed assessment and rehabilitation service for older people in one UK county. Data were gathered via non-participant observation, and group and individual interviews, as part of a wider action-research evaluation study. Three themes emerged from the data: the processes of 'learning' to become a care manager; 'doing' care management; and 'experiences' of the role. In order to 'learn' care management, staff needed to develop a range of new skills, establish supportive care-management processes, develop a new identity and work in an interdisciplinary way. 'Doing' care management involved working with a small group of patients with complex needs and precarious levels of homeostasis. Problem solving and crisis management were key activities and often required a creative approach to practice. Although care managers derived great satisfaction from their role, their 'experiences' were characterized by stress and anxiety. The practitioners from healthcare backgrounds needed more preparation to adapt to their new levels of responsibility and client risk. Successful management of the transition to care manager requires support from the key stakeholders and strong leadership within care manager teams. In-house competency-based training and induction programmes, and mentorship, can also play an important role, together with innovative forms of postqualifying education and training, for example, via job exchanges or an apprenticeship model.</ab>

        <ab>The U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 demographic trends indicate that a rapidly increasing elderly population is living well beyond younger, more functional ages into the 'old-old' stage (&gt;/= age 75), when debility is more common (Hetzel &amp; Smith, 2000). Increasingly, family members and friends are being called on to provide complex levels of care for older loved ones, which lends to both psychological and physiological stressors for the caregivers (Donelan et al., 2002). A variety of interventions have been implemented to help caregivers cope with the stresses associated with this demanding role. This article describes a demonstration project that evaluated the effects of writing support group for caregivers of frail older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Family carers are a major source of help and assistance to the persons they provide care for. They are also major contributors to the welfare system, balancing the national health care expenditure. Increasing attention, in research as well as government policy, is being paid to their role as informal caregivers. Support to family carers seems to be a new 'buzzword' in Swedish Government policy. However, supporting family carers may prove to be a more complex endeavour than one initially might be led to believe. Support could here be understood as any services, assistances, education, information, attitudes, and lay or professional person's provision for the benefit of the family carer. The aim of this systematic review was to identify modes of, and scientific evidence on, support for family carers of cohabiting elderly persons. The method followed a seven-step model: a focused research question was formulated creating a base for deriving search words and inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies. Systematic database searches identified several studies some of which were retrieved, critically appraised and classified by two independent reviewers. A total of 26 articles were finally included, revealing that family carers fear social isolation and wish to network in groups with peers, either for social or for learning needs purposes. Family carers also desire respite care. However, it is unclear whether they actually benefit from any of the above or how service provision should be attempted.</ab>

        <ab>This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Parts I and II of this article examine the impact of a falls prevention program on the fall incidents among the residents in a nursing home. It was hypothesized that a diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and postponing problems resulting from inactivity. Part I discusses the background and process of a falls program and factors contributing to the occurrence of falls. Part II will examine the interdisciplinary team approach to assessment, method, and implementing strategies for an effective fall prevention program. Tools used for prevention, monitoring, and investigation of falls will be detailed in Part II.</ab>

        <ab>AIM: The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy in identifying and describing older adults as frail. BACKGROUND: Despite the dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. METHOD: The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. CONCLUSION: The review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the contribution of both individual and environmental factors.</ab>

        <ab>Aspects of acute confusion (AC) including risk factors, behavior patterns, and outcomes are not well documented in long-term care (LTC) residents. The purpose of this prospective study was to describe the clinical profile of AC in LTC including risk factors, behavior patterns, etiologies, and 3-month outcomes. Seventy-four elderly LTC residents were assessed for AC, depression, and global cognitive impairment. Risk factors associated with AC included hearing deficits, depression, pulmonary disorders, and abnormal serum sodium or potassium levels. Behavior patterns of acutely confused residents included hyperactive (n = 9, 31%), hypoactive (n = 8, 28%), and mixed (n = 7, 24%). In the majority of the AC cases, the etiology was multIfactorial infections and dehydration were the most common causes. Residents with AC had very poor 3-month outcomes. Thirty-four percent (n = 10) of the residents with AC died within 3 months of the evaluation. This study highlights the complexity and serious nature of AC in this frail population.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Clinicians need easy methods of screening for cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure. If correlates of cognitive impairment could be identified, more patients with early cognitive impairment could be treated before the problem interfered with adherence to treatment. OBJECTIVES: To describe cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure, to explore the usefulness of 4 measures of cognitive impairment, and to assess correlates of cognitive impairment. METHODS: A descriptive, correlational design was used. Four screening measures of cognition were assessed in 42 patients with heart failure: Commands subtest and Complex Ideational Material subtest of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Draw-a-Clock Test. Cognitive impairment was defined as performance less than the standardized (T-score) cutoff point on at least 1 of the 4 measures. Possible correlates of cognitive impairment included age, education, hypotension, fluid overload (serum osmolality &lt; 269 mOsm/kg), and dehydration (serum osmolality &gt; or = 295 mOsm/kg). RESULTS: Cognitive impairment was detected in 12 (28.6%) of 42 participants. The 4 screening tests varied in effectiveness, but the Draw-a-Clock Test indicated impairment in 50% of the 12 impaired patients. A summed standardized score for the 4 measures was not significantly associated with age, education, hypotension, fluid overload, or dehydration in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is relatively common in patients with heart failure. The Draw-a-Clock Test was most useful in detecting cognitive impairment, although it cannot be used to detect problems with verbal learning or delayed recall and should not be used as the sole screening method for patients with heart failure. Correlates of cognitive impairment require further study.</ab>

        <ab>Care in the community has been constructed on the basis of professional support for carers who, as a result of community care policy that has released highly dependant people from residential care and long-stay wards, are carrying out a wide range of tasks, including complex health care activities. The present paper examines the health care activities currently undertaken by family carers and the way in which they work with, and are supported by, professional nurses in the home. It compares and contrasts the approaches of both groups to care-giving for this client group. The authors conclude by making some suggestions for improving the way in which family carers and nurses work together in the home.</ab>

        <ab>Clinical nursing documentation, written, verbal or supported by technology, is being affected by both the worldwide 'information explosion' and budgetary constraints. In Australia, the necessity of documenting complex care needs and treatment plans in older adult care settings has become more imperative because funding levels and sources are frequently tied to these documents. As a consequence, the statutory requirements for documentation have become a significant driving force in shaping nursing practice. Although the value of quality documentation is or should be recognized, the seemingly vast amounts of time required inevitably distracts nurses from what they see as their primary purpose-the provision of direct patient care. Older adults who are frail are among the most complex clients requiring services in what is traditionally a poorly resourced sector. Under-funding frequently impacts on the staff skill mix, resulting in low levels of senior, highly qualified, and skilled staff. These factors impact the quality of the documentation and possibly the usage of the information itself. This article will provide an overview of the issues related to documentation of clinical information in older adult care settings with particular reference to some of the 'unique' inefficiencies inherent in the Australian system.</ab>

        <ab>This article reinforces the importance of pain management in the older adult population. It is important to first understand the complexity of pain in older adults as well as the myths health care providers may believe, which could lead to undertreatment of their pain. The older adult patient experiences many types of pain; in some cases, these individuals may have combined types of pain. Many medications can be given safely to older patients; nonopioids, opioids, and adjuvant medications can be tried for pain relief. Copyright © 2002 by Aspen Publishers, Inc.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. AIMS OF THE PAPER: This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of research related to ethical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of frail older people to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older people to research while protecting their right to refuse.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the reasons why in contemporary Britain many single homeless people with severe physical and mental health problems and welfare needs do not receive the treatment, care and financial support that they manifestly need, and in particular considers the interaction between their personal characteristics and the organisation and the obligations of services. Homelessness is a complex concept associated with problems of housing, health, social care and income. The greatest weaknesses of the service system are that no single agency has a statutory responsibility to ensure that vulnerable homeless people are served, and none of the generalist welfare agencies have a duty to seek out those who do not present. As a result, single homeless people fall between the housing, health and social services and amass exceptional unmet needs. The paper appraises the approaches to single homeless people's problems that have recently been introduced by the Rough Sleepers' Unit (RSU), and discusses the ways in which current reforms of the welfare services may impact on the situation of homeless people. With the possibility that the RSU's prime responsibility for commissioning single homeless people's services will transfer to local authorities in 2002, the paper concludes by specifying the implications for voluntary and statutory providers and makes recommendations about the attribution of the responsibility to care for this vulnerable group.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reviews evidence about the relationships between NHS services and nursing and residential homes in England and Wales. Since the transfer in 1993 of responsibility for funding nursing and residential home care for less affluent older people to local authority social services departments, nursing and residential care has been widely assumed to constitute part of 'social care' services. 'This obscures the fact that residents of nursing and residential care homes frequently have substantial and complex healthcare needs. While some of these healthcare needs may be met through the care provided within homes themselves, most will require substantial contributions from NHS medical, nursing, pharmaceutical and other services. The National Service Framework for Older People (Department of Health, 2001) prioritises reinvestment in intermediate care services, building on the expectation in The NHS Plan (Department of Health, 2000a) that residential and nursing homes will play a major role in the development of these services. This expectation has been further reinforced by the Concordat with the private and voluntary healthcare provider sector (Department of Health, 20001)). However there is little evidence about the NHS services which are currently provided to nursing and residential homes, nor about the capacity of mainstream NIPS services to meet the projected development of intermediate care services within the independent institutional sector. This paper reviews the evidence which is available and highlights some of the priorities which primary care groups in England (local health groups in Wales) will need to consider if they are to develop integrated and good quality services for frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>The ethics of dealing with the provision of nutritional therapies has been complicated by technological advances that have affected all of medical science. As a result, nurses are increasingly confronted with decisions regarding the provision of invasive treatments. Indeed, enormous faith is invested in the ability and wisdom of healthcare professionals to alleviate suffering and accomplish cure through the application of invasive therapeutic interventions such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Such decisions are often complex, present a moral dilemma, and are further complicated by prevailing politico-economic, social, and cultural influences. The insertion of tubes for artificial nutritional support in those patients who can be defined as 'vulnerable' is no exception. This article explores both the clinical and ethical realities of PEG tube placement and use thereafter in vulnerable patients. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice are discussed within the context of PEG placement and feeding and recommendations are given for nurses practicing in the area of gastroenterology.</ab>

        <ab>Heart failure is an increasingly common, complex disease that has far-reaching consequences for patients, families, and the health care industry. An innovative care delivery model was developed and implemented with a group of elderly persons with heart failure. The Partners-in-Care Model included a patient monitoring protocol used in conjunction with ongoing care provided by a nurse case manager for the purpose of improving health outcomes for the elderly with heart failure. This delivery model was no more expensive than usual care and while no statistically significant differences in other outcomes were found, positive trends, including improved quality of elder life were identified.</ab>

        <ab>While much is known about the risk factors or predictors of nursing home placement for the frail elderly, much less is known about the process of how caregivers make the decision to seek nursing home care for their elderly loved ones.This exploratory study used qualitative research methods to interview family caregivers of elderly family members with dementia about the decision-making process of whether or not to place their family member in a nursing home.The study found a number of factors influencing placement related decision-making, including independence, perceived presence of others, fear of loneliness, negative nursing home attitudes, sense of existential self, and guilt.The study suggests that the decision to place a family member in a nursing home is a complex one, and nurses may need to address deeper issues with clients who are unable to make a decision about nursing home care.</ab>

        <ab>Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in monitoring some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer perceptions and experiences of services and involvement of users/carers in assessment and review. Using data from the study Evaluating Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales receiving community care services, this investigation examines three crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction. This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need to be aware of both the potential and pitfalls associated with using them as a means of assessing the quality of social services for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Individualized seating requires identifying an individual's body contours, range of motion, and orientation in space, and implementing a seating system that positions and supports the individual for comfort and function.Care providers and family members of frail older adults need to be aware that individualized seating can improve comfort and function.The 'one size fits all' approach to wheelchairs for frail elderly adults is being replaced with new knowledge and products that fit a wheelchair to the unique needs of the individual.Positive outcomes for individualized seating can include improved comfort and wheelchair tolerance, prevention of skin breakdown, improved self-care, better use of limited endurance, improved quality of life, and easing of caregiver burden.Until changes are made to third party payers' practices, obtaining funding for needed equipment can be a complex, slow, and uncertain process. Families and charitable organizations may need to be approached for individuals who lack resources to purchase needed equipment.</ab>

        <ab>Elderly patients with heart failure present a tremendous challenge to the current health care system. Decreased length of hospital stay for patients with increased numbers of comorbid conditions and complex medication regimens contribute to a revolving door of rehospitalizations. Using a transitional care model designed to decrease rehospitalizations, advanced practice nurses (APNs) in an ongoing clinical trial provide discharge planning in the acute care setting with home follow-up by the same APN for a 3-month period. This article reviews three case studies to provide a view of the complex and challenging situations in which elders with heart failure live and the care provided by APNs using the transitional care model to guide their practice. Social, economic, and emotional factors overlay the illness in each of these cases. The APNs, with advanced knowledge of cardiac disease and research-based management, help the patients and their caregivers to prioritize information and take the appropriate actions, while coping with the complexity of their conditions and the challenges they face. Keeping these patients from returning to the hospital provides evidence of the success of this transitional model of care. Copyright © 2000 by Aspen Publishers, Inc.</ab>

        <ab>Increasing reliance on family care of elderly people at home calls for a critical analysis of the relationship between formal and informal caregivers. Although much has been written about how health professionals and family caregivers should relate to one another, we know very little about the relationships that develop between them. Using data from a qualitative study, this article illustrates that relationships between community nurses and family members caring for frail elders are complex, dynamic, and multifaceted. Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient. Each type is described, and implications for nursing practice and research are discussed. Copyright © 2000 by Aspen Publishers, Inc.</ab>

        <ab>A theoretical model of clinical case management for psychogeriatric patients and their families is described. Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively with members of a multidisciplinary team. Copyright (c) 1998 by W.B.

        <ab>As people age, there is an increase in chronic illness and disability and thus a growing need for long-term care. Unfortunately, the concept of long-term care can be very complex and confusing. Elderly individuals and their family members frequently have many questions, such as the following: What is long-term care, and who needs it? What long-term care services are available? Who will provide the services? Where will the services be provided? How much will the services cost, and who will pay for the expenses? Indeed, the cost of providing long-term care, whether in an institution or in one's own home, may represent an enormous burden for individuals and their families. Nurses, especially community health nurses, are in a prime position to address these questions and concerns to ensure appropriate care and services for their clients. This article addresses the questions clients frequently ask by defining long-term care and discussing long-term care services, settings, and providers. In addition, 4 methods of financing long-term care will be presented.</ab>

        <ab>Demographic changes have created the need for psychiatric nurses to examine knowledge and practice in the area of geropsychiatry. Older adults present unique challenges. The interaction of biological and psychosocial problems are most evident in the oldest old and necessitate a holistic approach. This report addresses psychosocial causes and treatment of 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT) in the elderly. FTT is a label commonly used to describe a complex of nonspecific symptoms that often leads to increased disability and premature death. Psychiatric nurses are challenged to take a leadership role in case finding, as well as assessment and intervention.</ab>

        <ab>Rural dwelling, frail older adults are a vulnerable population owing to the complexity of health problems superimposed upon limited health care resources. Home care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A major theme identified was 'Circles of Care.' Grounded in rural culture, the circles assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.</ab>

        <ab>The complexities and challenges of conducting nursing research with the frail elderly have been poorly identified in the nursing literature. This literature examines geriatric research issues but fails to examine issues involved in doing field research with any special population, including the frail elderly. In-depth consideration of the special problems associated with studying the elderly generally, or the frail elderly specifically, are omitted. These two groups differ based on extent of functional impairment. Due to market constraints, a specialized text on gerontological nursing research simply does not exist. Although some articles about doing nursing research with frail elders exist, the issues raised in these articles are limited. The most popular issues in the nursing literature about doing research with the elderly have related to ethics (e.g., Archbold, 1981; Davis, 1981; Wolanin, 1980, 1984). Although ethical issues are important, knowledge of ethics does not solve the complex, practical problems of formulating conceptualizations and designing measures and procedures for studying the frail elderly.</ab>

        <ab>A complex and dangerous area of medical intervention with the elderly population is drug therapy. Although drugs have contributed to the well-being of many older persons, some elderly individuals are at risk due to polypharmacy and age-related factors. The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the medication-taking behaviors of two ethnic groups of noninstitutionalized frail elderly individuals. The findings indicate that these individuals may be at risk for harm due to their medication-taking practices. Healthcare professionals must evaluate drug use by the elderly and be aware of the risks of drug misuse by this vulnerable group.</ab>
