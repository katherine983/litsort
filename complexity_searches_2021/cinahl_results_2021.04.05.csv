273,274,Are Case Volume And Facility Complexity Level Associated With Postoperative Complications After Hip Fracture Surgery In The Veterans Affairs Healthcare System?,"wong,jimmy.k","Background: Hospital-related factors associated with mortality and morbidity after hip fracture surgery are not completely understood. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest single-payer, networked healthcare system in the country serving a relatively homogenous patient population with facilities that vary in size and resource availability. These characteristics provide some degree of financial and patient-level controls to explore the association, if any, between surgical volume and facility resource availability and hospital performance regarding postoperative complications after hip fracture surgery.Questions/purposes: (1) Do VHA facilities with the highest complexity level designation (Level 1a) have a disproportionate number of better-than-expected performance outliers for major postoperative complications compared with lower-complexity level facilities? (2) Do VHA facilities with higher hip fracture surgical volume have a disproportionate number of better-than-expected performance outliers for major postoperative complications compared with lower-volume facilities?Methods: We explored the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Project (VASQIP) database from October 2001 to September 2012 for records of hip fracture surgery performed. Data reliability of the VASQIP database has been previously validated. We excluded nine of the 98 VHA facilities for contributing fewer than 30 records. The remaining 89 VHA facilities provided 23,029 records. The VHA designates a complexity level to each facility based on multiple criteria. We labeled facilities with a complexity Level 1a (38 facilities)-the highest achievable VHA designated complexity level-as high complexity; we labeled all other complexity level designations as low complexity (51 facilities). Facility volume was divided into tertiles: high (> 277 hip fracture procedures during the sampling frame), medium (204 to 277 procedures), and low (< 204 procedures). The patient population treated by low-complexity facilities was older, had a higher prevalence of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (26% versus 22%, p < 0.001), and had a higher percentage of patients having surgery within 2 days of hospital admission (83% versus 76%, p < 0.001). High-complexity facilities treated more patients with recent congestive heart failure exacerbation (4% versus 3%, p < 0.001). We defined major postoperative complications as having at least one of the following: death within 30 days of surgery, cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, new q-wave myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, ventilator dependence for at least 48 hours after surgery, reintubation for respiratory or cardiac failure, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, progressive renal insufficiency with a rise in serum creatinine of at least 2 mg/dL from preoperative value, pneumonia, or surgical site infection. We used the observed-to-expected ratio (O/E ratio)-a risk-adjusted metric to classify facility performance-for major postoperative complications to assess the performance of VHA facilities. Outlier facilities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for O/E ratio completely less than 1.0 were labeled ""exceed expectation;"" those that were completely greater than 1.0 were labeled ""below expectation."" We compared differences in the distribution of outlier facilities between high and low-complexity facilities, and between high-, medium-, and low-volume facilities using Fisher's exact test.Results: We observed no association between facility complexity level and the distribution of outlier facilities (high-complexity: 5% exceeded expectation, 5% below expectation; low-complexity: 8% exceeded expectation, 2% below expectation; p = 0.742). Compared with high-complexity facilities, the adjusted odds ratio for major postoperative complications for low-complexity facilities was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.67-1.09; p = 0.108).We observed no association between facility volume and the distribution of outlier facilities: 3% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for high-volume; 10% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for medium-volume; and 7% exceeded expectation and 3% below expectation for low-volume; p = 0.890). The adjusted odds ratios for major postoperative complications were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.73-1.05) for low- versus high-volume facilities and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79-1.02] for medium- versus high-volume facilities (p = 0.155).Conclusions: These results do not support restricting facilities from treating hip fracture patients based on historical surgical volume or facility resource availability. Identification of consistent performance outliers may help health care organizations with multiple facilities determine allocation of services and identify characteristics and processes that determine outlier status in the interest of continued quality improvement.Level Of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic study.",2019,1,16,10.1097/CORR.0000000000000460,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=135558306&site=ehost-live
303,305,Factors Associated With Medication Regimen Complexity In Older People: A Cross-Sectional Population-Based Study.,"wimmer,barbara","Purpose: There is a lack of population-based research about factors associated with medication regimen complexity. This study investigated factors associated with medication regimen complexity in older people, and whether factors associated with regimen complexity were similar to factors associated with number of medications. Methods: This cross-sectional population-based study included 3348 people aged ≥60 years. Medication regimen complexity was computed using the validated 65-item Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Multinomial logistic regression was used to compute unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with regimen complexity. Multivariable quantile regression was used to compare factors associated with regimen complexity and number of medications. Results: In adjusted analyses, participants in the highest MRCI quintile (MRCI > 20) were older (OR = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.02;1.05), less likely to live at home (OR = 0.35, 95 % CI 0.15;0.86), had greater comorbidities (OR = 2.17, 95 % CI 1.89;2.49), had higher cognitive status (OR = 1.06, 95 % CI 1.01;1.11), a higher prevalence of self-reported pain (OR = 2.85, 95 % CI 2.16;3.76), had impaired dexterity (OR = 2.39, 95 % CI 1.77;3.24) and were more likely to receive help to sort their medications (OR = 4.43 95 % CI 2.39;8.56) than those with low regimen complexity (MRCI >0-5.5). Similar factors were associated with both regimen complexity and number of medications. Conclusion: Older people with probable difficulties managing complex regimens, including those with impaired dexterity and living in institutional settings, had the most complex medication regimens even after adjusting for receipt of help to sort medications. The strong correlation between regimen complexity and number of medications suggests that clinicians could use a person's number of medications to target interventions to reduce complexity.",2015,1,13,10.1007/s00228-015-1883-2,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=108841033&site=ehost-live
302,304,Medication Regimen Complexity In Adults And The Elderly In A Primary Healthcare Setting: Determination Of High And Low Complexities.,"ferreira,juliana.m","Background: The complexity of a medication regimen is related to the multiple characteristics of the prescribed regimen and can negatively influence the health outcomes of patients. Objective: To propose cut-off points in the complexity of pharmacotherapy to distinguish between patients with low and high complexities seen in a primary health care (PHC) setting to enable prioritization of patient management. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, which included 517 adult and elderly patients, analyzing different cut-off points to define the strata of low and high pharmacotherapy complexities based on percentiles of the population evaluated. Data collection began with the solicitation of prescriptions, followed by a questionnaire that was administered by an interviewer. The complexity of a medication regimen was estimated from the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). High complexity pharmacotherapy scores were analyzed from patient profiles, the use of health services, and pharmacotherapy. The criteria for subject inclusion in the sample population were as follows: inhabitant of the area covered by the municipality, 18 years or older, and being prescribed at least one drug during the collection period. Exclusion criteria at the time of collection were the use of any medication whose prescription was not available. All medications were accessed through the Primary Healthcare Service (PHS). Results: The median total pharmacotherapy complexity score was 8.5. High MRCI scores were correlated with age, medications taken with in the Brazilian PHS, having at least one potential drug-related problem, receiving up to eight years of schooling, number of medications and polypharmacy (five or more medicines), number of medical conditions, number of medical appointments, and number of cardiovascular diseases and endocrine metabolic diseases. We suggest different complexity tracks according to age (e.g., adult or elderly) that consider the pharmacotherapy and population coverage characteristics as high complexity limits. For the elderly patients, the tracks were as follows: MRCI≥25.4, MRCI≥20.9, MRCI≥17.5, MRCI≥15.7, MRCI≥14.0, and MRCI≥13.0. For adult patients, the limits of high complexity were MRCI≥25.1; MRCI ≥ 23.8; MRCI≥21.0; MRCI≥17.0; MRCI≥16.5; and MRCI≥15.5. Conclusion: The medication regimen complexity is associated with the patient's illness profile and problems with the use of drugs; therefore, the proposed scores can be useful in prioritizing patients for clinical care by pharmacists and other health professionals.",2015,2,12,10.18549/PharmPract.2015.04.659,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=112189598&site=ehost-live
284,286,Predictive Model Of Complexity In Early Palliative Care: A Cohort Of Advanced Cancer Patients (Palcom Study).,"tuca,albert","Proposal: Model of early palliative care (PC) integrated in oncology is based on shared care from the diagnosis to the end of life and is mainly focused on patients with greater complexity. However, there is no definition or tools to evaluate PC complexity. The objectives of the study were to identify the factors influencing level determination of complexity, propose predictive models, and build a complexity scale of PC.Patients and Method: We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study in a cohort of advanced cancer patients with an estimated prognosis ≤ 6 months. An ad hoc structured evaluation including socio-demographic and clinical data, symptom burden, functional and cognitive status, psychosocial problems, and existential-ethic dilemmas was recorded systematically. According to this multidimensional evaluation, investigator classified patients as high, medium, or low palliative complexity, associated to need of basic or specialized PC. Logistic regression was used to identify the variables influencing determination of level of PC complexity and explore predictive models.Results: We included 324 patients; 41% were classified as having high PC complexity and 42.9% as medium, both levels being associated with specialized PC. Variables influencing determination of PC complexity were as follows: high symptom burden (OR 3.19 95%CI: 1.72-6.17), difficult pain (OR 2.81 95%CI:1.64-4.9), functional status (OR 0.99 95%CI:0.98-0.9), and social-ethical existential risk factors (OR 3.11 95%CI:1.73-5.77). Logistic analysis of variables allowed construct a complexity model and structured scales (PALCOM 1 and 2) with high predictive value (AUC ROC 76%).Conclusion: This study provides a new model and tools to assess complexity in palliative care, which may be very useful to manage referral to specialized PC services, and agree intensity of their intervention in a model of early-shared care integrated in oncology.",2018,1,10,10.1007/s00520-017-3840-3,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=126418030&site=ehost-live
287,289,Clinical Outcomes Associated With Medication Regimen Complexity In Older People: A Systematic Review.,"wimmer,barbara.c","Objectives To systematically review clinical outcomes associated with medication regimen complexity in older people. Design Systematic review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane library. Setting Hospitals, home, and long-term care. Participants English-language peer-reviewed original research published before June 2016 was eligible if regimen complexity was quantified using a metric that considered number of medications and at least one other parameter, regimen complexity was calculated for participants' overall regimen, at least 80% of participants were aged 60 and older, and the study investigated a clinical outcome associated with regimen complexity. Measurements Quality assessment was conducted using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Results Sixteen observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Regimen complexity was associated with medication nonadherence (2/6 studies) and higher rates of hospitalization (2/4 studies). One study found that participants with less-complex medication administration were more likely to stop medications when feeling worse. One study each identified an association between regimen complexity and higher ability to administer medications as directed, medication self-administration errors, caregiver medication administration hassles, hospital discharge to non-home settings, postdischarge potential adverse drug events, all-cause mortality, and lower patient knowledge of their medication. Regimen complexity had no association with postdischarge medication modification, change in medication- and health-related problems, emergency department visits, or quality of life as rated by nursing staff. Conclusion Research into whether medication regimen complexity is associated with nonadherence and hospitalization has produced inconsistent results. Moderate-quality evidence from four studies (two each for nonadherence and hospitalization) suggests that medication regimen complexity is associated with nonadherence and higher rates of hospitalization.",2017,1,10,10.1111/jgs.14682,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=122576454&site=ehost-live
44,45,The Complexity Of Implementing Culture Change Practices In Nursing Homes.,"sterns,s","Purpose: The culture change (CC) movement aims to transform the traditional nursing home (NH) that is institutional in design with hierarchical management structure into a homelike environment that empowers residents and frontline staff. This study examines differences in adoption of CC practices according to a NH''s self-reported extent of CC implementation and its duration of CC adoption. Furthermore, it examines differences in adoption by whether a CC practice is considered less versus more complex, using complexity theory as the theoretical framework for this classification. Design and Methods: Using data from a 2007 Commonwealth-funded study, we analyzed a national sample of 291 US nursing homes that identified as being “for the most part” or “completely” CC facilities for “1 to 3 years” or “3+ years.” Also, using a complexity theory framework, we ranked 16 practices commonly associated with CC as low, moderately, or highly complex based on level of agreement needed to actuate the process (number of parties involved) and the certainty of intended outcomes. We then examined the prevalence of CC-associated practices in relation to their complexity and the extent and duration of a NH''s CC adoption. Results: We found practices ranked as less complex were implemented more frequently in NHs with both shorter and longer durations of CC adoption. However, more complex CC practices were more prevalent among NHs reporting “complete” adoption for 3+ years versus 1 to 3 years. This was not observed in NHs reporting having CC “for the most part.” Conclusions/Implications: Less complex practices may be more economical and easier to implement. These early successes may result in sufficient momentum so that more complex change can follow. A nursing home that more completely embraces the culture change movement may be more likely to attempt these complex changes.",2010,1,10,10.1016/j.jamda.2009.11.002,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104921468&site=ehost-live
232,233,Frailty And The Degradation Of Complex Balance Dynamics During A Dual-Task Protocol.,"kang,hg","Background: Balance during quiet stance involves the complex interactions of multiple postural control systems, which may degrade with frailty. The complexity of center of pressure (COP) dynamics, as quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE), during quiet standing is lower in older adults, especially those with falls. We hypothesized that COP dynamics from frail elderly individuals demonstrate less complexity than those from nonfrail elderly controls; complexity decreases when performing a dual task; and postural complexity during quiet standing is independent of other conventional correlates of balance control, such as age and vision.Methods: We analyzed data from a population-based study of community-dwelling older adults. Frailty phenotype (nonfrail, prefrail, or frail) was determined for 550 participants (age 77.9 +/- 5.5 years). COP excursions were quantified for 10 trials of 30 seconds each. Participants concurrently performed a serial subtraction task in half of the trials. Complexity of balance dynamics was quantified using MSE. Root-mean-square sway amplitude was also computed.Results: Of the 550, 38% were prefrail and 9% were frail. Complexity of the COP dynamics in the anteroposterior direction was lower in prefrail (8.78 +/- 1.91 [mean +/- SD]) and frail (8.38 +/- 2.13) versus nonfrail (9.20 +/- 1.74) groups (p < .001). Complexity reduced by a comparable amount in all three groups while performing the subtraction task (p < .001). Quiet standing complexity was independently associated with frailty after adjusting for covariates related to balance while sway amplitude was not.Conclusion: Cognitive distractions during standing may further compromise balance control in frail individuals, leading to an increased risk of falls.",2009,1,9,10.1093/gerona/glp113,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105238517&site=ehost-live
288,290,"Working With Complexity: Experiences Of Caring For Mothers Seeking Residential Parenting Services In New South Wales, Australia.","fowler,cathrine","Aim and objectives To investigate staff perception of the changing complexity of mothers and infants admitted to two residential parenting services in New South Wales in the decade from 2005-2015. Background For many mothers with a young child, parenting is difficult and stressful. If parenting occurs within the context of anxiety, mental illness or abuse it often becomes a high-risk situation for the primary caregiver. Residential parenting services provide early nursing intervention before parenting problems escalate and require physical or mental health focused care. Design A qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured interview questions was used as phase three of a larger study. Data were gathered from 35 child and family health nurses and ten physicians during eight focus groups. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) dealing with complexity; (2) changing practice; and (3) appropriate knowledge and skills to handle greater complexity. Conclusions There was a mix of participant opinions about the increasing complexity of the mothers presenting at residential parenting services during the past decade. Some of the nurses and physicians confirmed an increase in complexity of the mothers while several participants proposed that it was linked to their increased psychosocial assessment knowledge and skill. All participants recognised their work had grown in complexity regardless of their perception about the increased complexity of the mothers. Relevance to clinical practice Australian residential parenting services have a significant role in supporting mothers and their families who are experiencing parenting difficulties. It frequently provides early intervention that helps minimise later emotional and physical problems. Nurses are well placed to work with and support mothers with complex histories. Acknowledgement is required that this work is stressful and nurses need to be adequately supported and educated to manage the complex presentations of many families.",2017,1,9,10.1111/jocn.13478,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=121000285&site=ehost-live
263,264,The Development Of An Hiv-Specific Complexity Rating Scale.,"bulsara,sm","As treatment for HIV improves, an ageing population is experiencing comorbidity which often leads to complex clinical presentations requiring an interdisciplinary care approach. This study sought to quantify clinician assessment of the level of clinical complexity, through the development of a rating scale for people living with HIV (PLHIV), to improve client care through an interdisciplinary care model. An existing alcohol and other drug complexity rating scale was selected and modified for use with PLHIV. HIV-specific items were included through consultation with an interdisciplinary team. A risk-prediction model was developed and validated using clinician ratings of clients attending The Albion Centre, a tertiary HIV clinic in Sydney, Australia, resulting in the development of the Clinical Complexity Rating Scale for HIV (CCRS-HIV). Multivariable logistic regression models identified eight characteristics based on clinician assessment of complexity in PLHIV: financial instability, social isolation, problematic crystal methamphetamine use, mental illness and/or other problematic substance use, cognitive/neurological impairment, polypharmacy, current hepatitis C infection and/or cancer, and other physical health comorbidity. A weighted risk-prediction model was developed and validated. The final model accurately predicted 85% of complex clients, with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 91%. This study developed an HIV-specific clinician-rated complexity scale. Further investigations are required to validate the CCRS-HIV with broader HIV populations. This simple complexity screening tool is a promising adjunct to clinical assessment to identify clients with complex physical and psychosocial needs who may benefit from interdisciplinary care interventions and allocation of resources.",2019,1,9,10.1177/0956462419868359,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=139924079&site=ehost-live
192,193,Protocol Of A Case-Control Longitudinal Study (Fraxity) Assessing Frailty And Complexity Among Swiss Home Service Recipients Using Interrai-Hc Assessments.,"ludwig,catherine","Background: The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant.Methods: The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant.Discussion: The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03883425 , registered on March 20, 2019.",2019,1,8,10.1186/s12877-019-1230-z,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=137907458&site=ehost-live

This is defined as the interference with the achievement of expected or desired health and service use outcomes when patients are exposed to standard care.Objective: The aim of this study was to test the INTERMED's ability to identify 'case' and 'care' complexity, identifying patients that would especially benefit from integrated care.Methods: Observational longitudinal study of Internal medicine in patients in two National Health System hospitals in Spain using the INTERMED (patients scoring ≥ 21 were considered to be 'complex'); the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), a severity of illness assessment; and standard clinical variables.Results: Six hundred and fifteen consecutives were included, and the prevalence of health complexity was 27.6%. The greatest differences between patients with and without health complexity were observed in the non-biological domains. Eighty-five per cent of patients with health complexity had non-biological items considered to require timely (immediately or soon) assistance or intervention compared to 30% of those without, nearly a threefold difference. Complex patients had a significantly higher number of medical diagnoses (p = 0.002) and number of psychiatric referrals (p = 0.041), but there were no differences in CIRS scores or lengths of stay.Conclusion: The INTERMED has the potential to identify a considerable subset of complex internal medicine inpatients for which timely corrective action related to non-biological risk factors not typically uncovered during standard medical evaluations would be considered beneficial.",2015,1,8,10.1111/ijcp.12721,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=110546826&site=ehost-live

The elderly patients were taking a large number of drugs, with 76.6 % taking more than five medications per day. The average medication regimen complexity was 18.2 (±SD = 9.6), and was higher in the females (p < 0.001). The most decisive factors contributing to the complexity were the number of drugs and dosage frequency. In regimens with the same number of medications, schedule was the most relevant factor in the final score (r = 0.922), followed by pharmaceutical forms (r = 0.768) and additional instructions (r = 0.742).Conclusion: Medication regimen complexity proved to be high.

243,244,Case And Care Complexity In The Medically Ill.,"de,jonge.p","The authors have argued that complexity in general health care is increasingly prevalent because of the increase in patients who have multimorbid conditions, and the increased professional and technical possibilities of medicine. In the increasingly complex care systems, it is necessary-specifically when treating patients in need of integrated care by several providers-that an optimal match between case and care complexity be found in order to prevent poor outcomes in this vulnerable group. The authors discussed several approaches to case complexity that can be identified in the literature. Most of them seem unsuitable for adjusting case and care complexity, and inadequate for designing multidisciplinary care. Theoretic approaches to case complexity may be of interest, but did not result in clinically meaningful information. The INTERMED, which can be considered the first empirically based instrument to link case and care complexity, is an attempt to improve care delivery and outcomes for the complex medically ill.

316,323,Reducing Medication Regimen Complexity For Older Patients Prior To Discharge From Hospital: Feasibility And Barriers.,"elliott,r.a","What is known and Objective: Older hospital inpatients are often prescribed complex multi-drug regimens; increased regimen complexity is associated with poorer medication adherence and treatment outcomes. There has been little research into methods for reducing regimen complexity. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of incorporating medication regimen simplification into routine clinical pharmacist care for older hospital inpatients and identify barriers to regimen simplification at a major teaching hospital. Methods: Following an educational intervention, clinical pharmacists were encouraged to minimize regimen complexity for their patients by identifying potential simplifications during routine medication regimen reviews (e.g. medication chart reviews, discharge prescription reviews) and discussing these changes with hospital doctors and patients. Pharmacists completed a data collection form for patients aged 60 years or above discharged from their wards during the study period ( n = 205; mean age, 81·3 years), indicating whether they had reviewed the patient's medication regimen complexity (and if not why), whether any changes to simplify the regimen were identified, and whether changes were successfully implemented (and if not why). Results and Discussion: Pharmacists reviewed medication regimen complexity for 173/205 (84·4%) patients and identified 149 potential changes to reduce regimen complexity for 79/173 (45·7%) reviewed patients. Ninety-four (63·1%) changes were successfully implemented in 54/205 (26·3%) patients. Regimens were simplified more often for patients discharged from subacute aged care (geriatric assessment and rehabilitation) wards compared with acute general medicine wards. The most commonly cited reason for not reviewing regimen complexity and not implementing identified simplification-related changes was 'lack of time'. Non-acceptance of pharmacist recommendations by patients or doctors were other common reasons for not implementing changes. What is new and Conclusion: This is the first study to explore pharmacist-led medication regimen simplification and barriers to regimen simplification in the hospital setting. It demonstrates that simplification of older inpatients' regimens is feasible when training in regimen simplification is provided. The main barrier to regimen simplification appears to be lack of pharmacist time.",2012,1,8,10.1111/j.1365-2710.2012.01356.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104430877&site=ehost-live

Epidemiological descriptive analysis was used to examine datasets for difference between four discrete years (2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016). Datasets included patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), comorbidities, complications and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM™). Results: Between 2007 and 2016, rehabilitation in-patients as a whole: (1) had a mean decrease in total admission FIM score; (2) became more complex, as evidenced by the increased proportion of particular comorbidities impacting on rehabilitation, namely cardiac and respiratory disease, dementia, diabetes and morbid obesity; and (3) had a mean decrease in total discharge FIM score. However, there was an increase in the proportion of patients discharged home from rehabilitation (from 86.5% to 92%) and decreases in onset and rehabilitation LOS of 2.2 and 2.5 days respectively. Conclusion: The dependency and complexity of patients admitted to in-patient rehabilitation in Australia has increased between 2007 and 2016. What is known about the topic?: Anecdotal reports suggest that rehabilitation patients in Australia have become more complex, necessitating increased active management of their presenting health condition and comorbid health conditions. However, to date, no systematic investigation has been undertaken to examine trends in rehabilitation in-patient dependency and complexity over time. What does this paper add?: This study provides measurable evidence of increased dependency and complexity in patients admitted to rehabilitation in Australia. Further, compared with 2007, rehabilitation in-patients as a whole had an increased burden of care on discharge from rehabilitation in 2016. What are the implications for practitioners?: The changes in patient dependency and complexity reported in this study have implications for rehabilitation service delivery. This is because the increased need for illness or injury and comorbidity management may result in increased potential for acute complications and health deterioration, and compensatory care for patients during rehabilitation. Clinicians may need to widen their skill set to include more acute and chronic illness management.",2020,1,7,10.1071/AH18073,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141533291&site=ehost-live
260,261,Complexity Of Nursing Care At 24 H From Admission Predicts In-Hospital Mortality In Medical Units: A Cohort Study.,"ausili,davide","Background: The Informative System of Nursing Performance was developed to measure complexity of nursing care based on the actual interventions performed by nurses at the point of care. The association of this score with in-hospital mortality was not investigated before. Having this information is relevant to define evidence-based criteria that hospital administrators can use to allocate nursing workforce according to the real and current patients' need for nursing care. The aim of this study is to assess the association between complexity of nursing care and in-hospital mortality.Methods: Register-based cohort study on all patients admitted to acute medical wards of a middle-large hospital in the North of Italy between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015 and followed up to discharge. Out of all the eligible 7247 records identified in the Hospital Discharge Register, 6872 records from 5129 patients have been included. A multivariable frailty Cox model was adopted to estimate the association between the Informative System of Nursing Performance score, both as continuous variable and dichotomized as low (score < 50) or high (score ≥ 50), and in-hospital mortality adjusting for several factors recorded at admission (age, gender, type of admission unit, type of access and Charlson Comorbidity Index).Results: The median age of the 5129 included patients was 76 [first-third quartiles 64-84] and 2657(52%) patients were males. Over the 6872 admissions, there were 395 in-hospital deaths among 2922 patients at high complexity of nursing care (13.5%) and 74/3950 (1.9%) among those at low complexity leading to a difference of 11.6% (95% CI: 10.3-13.0%). Adjusting by relevant confounders, the hazard rate of mortality in the first 10 days from admission resulted 6 times significantly higher in patients at high complexity of nursing care with respect to patients at low complexity (hazard ratio, HR 6.58, 95%CI: 4.50;9.62, p < 0.001). The HR was lower after 10 days from admission but still significantly higher than 1. By considering the continuous score, the association was confirmed.Conclusion: Complexity of nursing care is strongly associated to in-hospital mortality of acute patients admitted to medical departments. It predicts in-hospital mortality better than widely used indicators, such as comorbidity.",2020,1,7,10.1186/s12913-020-5038-5,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=142104447&site=ehost-live
251,252,Complicated Versus Complexity: When An Old Woman And Her Daughter Meet The Health Care System.,"sund,levander.märta","Background: Detecting infection in frail elderly is a challenge due to lack of specific signs and symptoms. We highlight the complex situation when an elderly woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system.Methods: A descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is explored in the discussion.Results: The latent content analysis of the daughter's story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women recovers quickly.Conclusion: The healthcare system should embrace the complexity in the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage ""correctly"" for later placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption of complexity.",2020,1,7,10.1186/s12905-020-01092-5,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=146390292&site=ehost-live
43,44,Unravelling The Differences Between Complexity And Frailty In Old Age: Findings From A Constructivist Grounded Theory Study.,"mcgeorge,s.j","UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.",2011,1,7,10.1111/j.1365-2850.2010.01630.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=57220072&site=ehost-live
282,284,Establishing Relationships And Navigating Boundaries When Caring For Children With Medical Complexity At Home.,"nageswaran,savithri","Children with medical complexity receive care from many healthcare providers including home healthcare nurses. The objective of our study, based on a conceptual framework, was to describe the relationships between parents/ caregivers of children with medical complexity and home healthcare nurses caring for these children. We collected qualitative data in 20 semistructured in-depth interviews (15 English, 5 Spanish) with 26 primary caregivers of children with medical complexity, and 4 focus groups of 18 home healthcare nurses inquiring about their experiences about home healthcare nursing services for children with medical complexity. During an iterative analysis process, we identified recurrent themes related to caregiver-nurse relationships. Our study showed that: (1) caregiver-nurse relationships evolved over time and were determined by multiple factors; (2) communication and trust were essential to the establishment of caregiver-nurse relationships; (3) both caregivers and nurses described difficulties of navigating physical, professional, personal, and emotional boundaries, and identified strategies to maintain these boundaries; and (4) good caregiver-nurse relationships helped in the care of children with medical complexity, reduced caregiver burden, resulted in less stress for nurses, and was a factor in nurse retention. We conclude that trusted relationships between caregivers and nurses are important to the home care of children with medical complexity. Interventions to develop and maintain good caregiver-nurse relationships are necessary.",2018,1,6,10.1097/NHH.0000000000000636,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=128458140&site=ehost-live
278,280,The Impact Of Residential Medication Management Reviews (Rmmrs) On Medication Regimen Complexity.,"pouranayatihosseinabad,mahsa","Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of RMMRs on medication regimen complexity, as assessed by a validated measure.Methods: Retrospective analysis of RMMRs pertaining to 285 aged care residents aged ≥ 65 years in Sydney, Australia. Medication regimen complexity was measured using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) at baseline, after pharmacists' recommendations (assuming that all of the pharmacists' recommendations were accepted by the General Practitioner (GP)), and after the actual uptake of pharmacists' recommendations by the GP. Differences in the regimen complexity was measured using the Wilcoxon sign rank test.Results: Pharmacists made 764 recommendations (average 2.7 recommendations per RMMR), of which 569 (74.5%) were accepted by GPs. The median MRCI at baseline in the sample was 25.5 (IQR = 19.0-32.5). No statistically significant differences were demonstrated in the MRCI scores after pharmacists' recommendations (p = 0.53) or after GPs' acceptance of these recommendations (p = 0.07) compared to the baseline.Conclusion: Our study revealed high acceptance of pharmacists' recommendations by GPs. This suggests that RMMRs are useful for identifying and resolving drug-related issues among residents of ACFs. However, our study failed to show a significant effect of RMMRs in reducing the medication regimen complexity, as measured by the MRCI.

210,211,Assessing Health Care Reform.,"gettens,john","The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded eligibility for subsidized health insurance, and this has the potential to substantially increase health insurance coverage among persons with disabilities. The increase will depend, at least in part, on the complexity of the application process. To facilitate access, the ACA streamlined the application process for subsidized coverage; however, this did not include disability-based coverage. This article analyzes and describes the application process, identifies complexities, and defines steps to reduce complexities. The following application complexities were identified: (a) the need for applicants to apply separately for cash assistance and subsidized coverage, (b) the need for applicants to determine whether to pursue a disability-based Medicaid determination, and (c) the absence of a way for persons to self-identify their disability on the streamlined paper application form. The analysis indicates that the application process for subsidized coverage is complex and may hinder access among persons with disabilities.

256,257,Comorbidity Does Not Mean Clinical Complexity: Evidence From The Reposi Register.,"corrao,salvatore","In the last 2-3 decades internists have confronted dramatic changes in the pattern of patients acutely admitted to hospital wards. Internists observed a shift from younger subjects affected by a single organ disease to more complex patients, usually older, with multiple chronic conditions, attended by different specialists, with poor integration and treated with multiple drugs. In this regard, the concept of complex patients is addressed daily in clinical practice even if there is no agreed definition of patient complexity. To try to evaluate clinical complexity different instruments have been proposed. Among these, the number of comorbidities (NoC) was considered a marker of clinical complexity. However, this instrument would not give information about the clinical relevance of each condition. On the contrary, cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) addresses the problem calculating both CIRS severity index (CIRS-SI) and CIRS comorbidity index (CIRS-CI). In light of this, 4714 patients from the RePoSI register were retrospectively analyzed to show if CIRS assessment of comorbidity burden is different from the simple count of comorbidities in predicting the length of hospital stay (LOS) and all-cause of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients and if NoC could be a valid tool to measure patient's complexity. CIRS-SI resulted the best predictor of all-cause in-hospital mortality [OR: 2.66 (1.88-3.77)] in comparison with NoC that did not result statistically significant (p = 0.551). CIRS-SI was also the best predictor of all-cause of post-discharge mortality corrected for age and sex [OR: 2.12 (1.53-2.95)]. CIRS-SI (coefficient ± standard error: 1.23 ± 0.59; p < 0.0381) and CIRS-CI (coefficient ± standard error: 0.27 ± 0.10; p < 0.011) were strong predictors of LOS in comparison with NoC that did not result statistically significant (coefficient ± standard error: 0.04 ± 0.06 p < 0.0561). In conclusion, CIRS assessment of comorbidity burden is a better clinical tool in comparison with the simple count of comorbidities especially considering the length of hospital stay and all-cause mortality in hospitalized elderly patients.",2020,1,6,10.1007/s11739-019-02211-3,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=143724773&site=ehost-live
254,255,Is My Patient Ready For A Safe Transfer To A Lower-Intensity Care Setting? Nursing Complexity As An Independent Predictor Of Adverse Events Risk After Icu Discharge.,"sanson,gianfranco","• A residual clinical instability and functional deficit is fully expected for patients discharge from ICU. • Patients at high risk for adverse events can be effectively identified before ICU discharge based on routinely collected data. • The level of acuity and nursing complexity can independently predict the risk of adverse events. • Using such information to support the discharge decision-making could prevent adverse events and improve patient's outcome. Patients discharged from intensive care units (ICUs) are at risk for adverse events (AEs). Establishing safe discharge criteria is challenging. No available criteria consider nursing complexity among risk factors. To investigate whether nursing complexity upon ICU discharge is an independent predictor for AEs. Prospective observational study. The Patient Acuity and Complexity Score (PACS) was developed to measure nursing complexity. Its predictive power for AEs was tested using multivariate regression analysis. The final regression model showed a very-good discrimination power (AUC 0.881; p <0.001) for identifying patients who experienced AEs. Age, ICU admission reason, PACS, cough strength, PaCO 2 , serum creatinine and sodium, and transfer to Internal Medicine showed to be predictive of AEs. Exceeding the identified PACS threshold increased by 3.3 times the AEs risk. The level of nursing complexity independently predicts AEs risk and should be considered in establishing patient's eligibility for a safe ICU discharge.",2020,1,6,10.1016/j.hrtlng.2020.02.003,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=143778785&site=ehost-live

Design: A pretest-posttest study with assessments at baseline and after 12 months. Settin g: Community. Participants: Older adults aged 75 years and older (N= 136) who are frail (n = 56) or who have complex care needs (n = 80). Intervention : Participants received care and support by Embrace, a person-centered and integrated care service for community-living older adults supporting them to age in place. A multidisciplinary team provided care and support, with intensity depending on the older adults' risk profile. Main Outcome Measure: Health-related problems as perceived by older adults and measured with the Geriatric International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core Set. Results: Health-related problems were related to 6 coherent clusters: (1) Mental Functions; (2) Physical Health; (3) Mobility; (4) Personal Care; (5) Nutrition; and (6) Support. The most prevalent and most severe problems at baseline were related to Mental Functions and Mobility. Changes in the prevalence of problems after 12 months varied. Severity scores decreased or remained stable, except for Mobility items which showed a varying changing pattern in participants with complex care needs. Prevalence and severity of problems for those with a problem at baseline decreased after 12 months. Frail participants with a problem had higher baseline severity scores than those with complex care needs experiencing a problem, but differences in changes between individuals who are frail and those with complex care needs were small.

306,310,Polypharmacy And Medication Regimen Complexity As Factors Associated With Hospital Discharge Destination Among Older People: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"wimmer,barbara","Background: Older people often take multiple medications. It is a policy priority to facilitate older people to stay at home longer. Three-quarters of nursing home placements in the US are preceded by a hospitalization. Objective: To investigate the association between polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity with hospital discharge destination among older people. Methods: This prospective cohort study comprised patients aged ≥70 years consecutively admitted to the Geriatric Evaluation and Management unit at a tertiary hospital in Adelaide, Australia, between October 2010 and December 2011. Medication regimen complexity at discharge was calculated using the 65-item validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for medication-related factors associated with discharge directly to home versus non-community settings (rehabilitation, transition care, and residential aged care). Results: From 163 eligible patients, 87 were discharged directly to home (mean age 84.6 years, standard deviation [SD] 6.9; mean MRCI 26.1, SD 9.7), while 76 were discharged to non-community settings (mean age 85.8 years, SD 5.8; mean MRCI 29.9, SD 13.2). After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and activities of daily living, having a high medication regimen complexity (MRCI >35) was inversely associated with discharge directly to home (RR 0.39; 95 % CI 0.20-0.73), whereas polypharmacy (≥9 medications) was not significantly associated with discharge directly to home (RR 0.97; 95 % CI 0.53-1.58).

258,259,Managing Complexity In The Operating Room: A Group Interview Study.,"göras,camilla","Background: Clinical work in the operating room (OR) is considered challenging as it is complex, dynamic, and often time- and resource-constrained. Important characteristics for successful management of complexity include adaptations and adaptive coordination when managing expected and unexpected events. However, there is a lack of explorative research addressing what makes things go well and how OR staff describe they do when responding to challenges and compensating for constraints. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how complexity is managed as expressed by operating room nurses, registered nurse anesthetists, and surgeons, and how these professionals adapt to create safe care in the OR.Method: Data for this qualitative explorative study were collected via group interviews with three professional groups of the OR-team, including operating room nurses, registered nurse anesthetists and operating and assisting surgeons in four group interview sessions, one for each profession except for ORNs for which two separate interviews were performed. The audio-taped transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by inductive qualitative content analysis.Results: The findings revealed three generic categories covering ways of creating safe care in the OR: preconditions and resources, planning and preparing for the expected and unexpected, and adapting to the unexpected. In each generic category, one sub-category emerged that was common to all three professions: coordinating and reaffirming information, creating a plan for the patient and undergoing mental preparation, and prioritizing and solving upcoming problems, respectively.Conclusion: Creating safe care in the OR should be understood as a process of planning and preparing in order to manage challenging and complex work processes. OR staff need preconditions and resources such as having experience and coordinating and reaffirming information, to make sense of different situations. This requires a mental model, which is created through planning and preparing in different ways. Some situations are repetitive and easier to plan for but planning for the unexpected requires anticipation from experience. The main results strengthen that abilities described in the theory of resilience are used by OR staff as a strategy to manage complexity in the OR.",2020,1,5,10.1186/s12913-020-05192-8,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=143327899&site=ehost-live

Materials/methods: Analysis of a large multicentre cohort of patients (n = 5396) from the national clinical dataset representing 63 specialist rehabilitation services across England. Structural validity was examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Concurrent and criterion-validity were tested through a priori hypothesized relationships with other validated measures of resource requirements and dependency. Results: All but two items loaded strongly onto a single principal component with Cronbach's alpha 0.88. A total score of ≥30 identified patients with complex (category A) needs with sensitivity 76% and specificity 75%. However, confirmatory factor analysis provided a better fit when the scale was split into two subscales – a 'Cognitive/psychosocial' and a 'Physical' sub-scale (alpha 0.83 and 0.84, respectively). Moderate convergent and discriminant correlations were consistent with hypothesized relationships. Conclusions: The findings provide some overall support for the Patient Categorisation Tool as a unidimensional tool for measuring complexity of needs for neurorehabilitation, but the subscales may be more suitable for certain groups of patients. Further analysis is now required to evaluate its performance in different conditions. A psychometrically robust tool for measuring the complexity of rehabilitation needs has potential value, both at an individual level for treatment planning, and at a population level for planning and commissioning rehabilitation services.

Many could be avoided by immediate identification of at-risk patients at admission and adapted prevention. The complexity of a patient's medication regimen immediately available at admission is a good indicator of the complexity of the patient's condition. This study aims to determine whether the electronic Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) at admission is associated with complications during hospitalization.Design: We performed a multilevel logistic regression model, adjusted for age and sex.Setting: Premier Perspective™ database, a clinical and financial information system from 417 US hospitals.Participants: Adults hospitalized for more than 3 days in a medical ward and included in Premier's Perspective™ database for 2006.Intervention(s): Multilevel logistic regression.Main Outcome Measure: Association of the MRCI and complications during hospitalization, defined as in-hospital death, hospital-acquired infection, pressure ulcers; and need for highly technical healthcare, identified as the secondary introduction of catecholamines.Results: In total, 1 592 383 admissions were included. The median MRCI at admission was 13 [interquartile range: 9-19]. The higher the MRCI, the higher the adjusted odds ratio of the following: in-hospital mortality, hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers and the secondary introduction of catecholamines.Conclusions: Our results suggested that the MRCI at admission was correlated with patient complexity, independent of age. Considering that patients with complex conditions pose a heavier workload for staff, measuring MRCI at admission could be used to allocate resources in medical wards at an institutional level. The MRCI might be a useful tool to assess the management of care.",2018,1,5,10.1093/intqhc/mzx168,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=128133998&site=ehost-live
130,131,Understanding Complex Care For Older Adults Within Canadian Home Care: A Systematic Literature Review.,"johnson,shanthi","In the context of an aging population, both the need for home care services and its complexity of care have increased in many high-income countries.

This systematic review examined the conceptual definition of complex care within the home care environment using several social and health science databases for research published from 2000 to 2017. Of the 25 articles and reports identified, only 16 addressed complex care specifically and included older adults, aging, and/or home care. The results showed that complex care for older adults is primarily defined from a biomedical approach focusing on chronic disease and management and less commonly from the perspective of the social determinants of health. Future studies should consider the importance of the continuum of care needs from both the biomedical and the social determinants to adequately plan and provide care for older adults.",2018,1,5,10.1080/01621424.2018.1456996,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=130602541&site=ehost-live
156,157,Managing Older Patients With Coexistent Asthma And Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"mcdonald,vanessa.m","Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common obstructive airway diseases, especially among older people. These conditions are associated with a significant and increasing disease burden. The diagnosis and management of asthma and COPD in older populations are complex, and consequently clinicians are faced with many therapeutic and diagnostic challenges. Both aging and obstructive airway diseases are associated with complex co-morbidities and these coexisting illnesses confound management. Moreover, the age-related physiological changes that occur in the lungs may lead to airflow limitation, and this may be difficult to distinguish from an active disease state. In practice, management of asthma and COPD is informed by disease-specific clinical practice guidelines; however, most older people with these conditions are excluded from clinical trials that are designed to inform practice, creating major evidence gaps. Furthermore, seldom do clinical practice guidelines consider the complexities of management in older populations. The problems experienced by older people are complex and multifactorial and our approach to management must reflect these challenges. Opportunities exist to improve the management and outcomes for older people with obstructive airway disease and there is an urgent need for clinical trials to test management approaches in this population; current research must consider the challenges and evidence gaps that exist.",2013,0,4,10.1007/s40266-012-0042-z,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104255208&site=ehost-live
36,37,Complexities Of Pain Assessment And Management In Hospitalised Older People: A Qualitative Observation And Interview Study.,"manias,elizabeth","Abstract: Background: Pain continues to be a common problem for older hospitalised patients, but little is known about how the complexities of actual clinical practice affect pain assessment and management in these patients. Objective: To examine how pain was assessed and managed in older patients who were admitted to geriatric evaluation and management units. Design, setting and participants: A naturalistic observational research design was used involving observations of interactions between nurses and patients, and follow-up interviews with nurses. Three observation periods were conducted between midnight and midday, which commenced at 03:30, 07:30, and 10:30, and three observation periods were conducted between midday and midnight, which commenced at 15:30, 18:30, and 22:30. Between 12 and 13 observations were conducted for each observation period, each ranging from 2 to 3h. The study was undertaken in two units, each located in an Australian public teaching hospital. Participants included registered nurses employed in the units, and patients in their care. Results: Four major themes were identified: communication among nurses and between older patients and nurses; strategies for pain management; environmental and organisational aspects of care; and complexities in the nature of pain. Nurses tended to use simple questioning with patients about the pain experienced. Despite the availability of ‘as required’ opioid medication for breakthrough or incident pain, nurses often preferred to wait to determine if pain was relieved following administration of fixed-dose paracetamol. Time of day impacted on how pain was managed due to availability of nursing staff. It was unit policy for doctors to reduce medications prescribed, which often extended to analgesics, and nurses were left to deal with patient tensions in addressing analgesic needs. Complexities were associated with the nature of pain experienced, in terms of perceived level of tolerable pain, the simultaneous presence of chronic and acute pain, location of pain, and differentiation of pain from discomfort. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the intricacies associated with how analgesic needs are addressed in older patients, especially those with communication deficits, the complex nature of older patients’ painful experiences, and the precarious balance of attempting to treat pain effectively while avoiding adverse effects of analgesics.",2012,1,4,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.05.002,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104420916&site=ehost-live
271,272,Ica-Ema: A Tool For Assessing Nursing Complexity Of Patients With Oncohematologic Disease In An Italian Center.,"iovino,paolo","Inpatients with hematologic cancer (HC), particularly in an aging population, often require levels of nursing care that feel very demanding. Therefore, it is important to assess nursing complexity in this care environment. The purpose of this study is to assess nursing complexity of inpatients with HC. A prospective observational study was carried out on 131 patients admitted to an adult hematologic center in northern Italy. The following variables were analyzed by means of the Index of Caring Complexity (ICA): age, sex, diagnostic category, purpose of admission, presence of transplant, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and length of stay. A total sample of 131 patients were enrolled. Patients older than 65 years, with a history of transplant, admitted for complications, and with a diagnosis of myeloma or myelodysplasia had higher ICA scores. Therefore, patients in these groups are more likely to exhibit a higher nursing complexity than other patients. The study results can help health-care professionals identify, at an early stage, patients who need higher levels of nursing care; promote a more efficient allocation of nursing staff to the patient needs based on their group; and qualify the need for higher levels of nursing care in order to improve nursing care quality and achieve higher standards of care in Italian hematologic centers.",2019,1,4,10.1891/1078-4535.25.2.157,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=136422619&site=ehost-live
318,327,Multifractal Analysis Of Nonlinear Complexity Of Sacral Skin Blood Flow Oscillations In Older Adults.,"liao,f","The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between cutaneous vasodilatory function and nonlinear complexity of blood flow oscillations (BFO) in older people. A non-painful fast local heating protocol was applied to the sacral skin in 20 older subjects with various vasodilatory functions. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure skin blood oscillations. The complexity of the characteristic frequencies (i.e., metabolic (0.0095-0.02 Hz), neurogenic (0.02-0.05 Hz), myogenic (0.05-0.15 Hz), respiratory (0.15-0.4 Hz), and cardiac (0.4-2 Hz)) of BFO was quantified using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. Compared with the 65-75 years group, the complexity of metabolic BFO in the 75-85 years group was significantly lower at the baseline (P < 0.05) and the second peak (P < 0.001). Compared with baseline BFO, subjects in the 65-75 years group had a significant increase in the complexity of metabolic BFO (P < 0.01) in response to local heating; while subjects in the 75-85 years group did not.

Increased medication regimen complexity (MRC) negatively impacts adherence and clinical outcomes.Objective: Compare MRC change in patients with uncontrolled T2D referred to a collaborative pharmacist-endocrinologist Diabetes Intense Medical Management (DIMM) clinic ""tune up"" model versus similar patients receiving usual primary care provider (PCP) care over 6 months.Methods: Retrospective, observational, comparative cohort study compared MRC of complex DIMM clinic patients to a similar group (adults with T2D, glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C] ≥8%), continuing to receive usual care from their PCPs. The MRC Index (MRCI) was used to quantify MRC.Results: Both DIMM (n=99) and PCP (n=56) groups were similar, with high baseline mean MRC scores as measured by number of medications and MRCI (12.0 [SD=5.7] vs 13.7 [SD = 5.6], and 32.7 [SD=17.0] vs 38 [SD=16.5]), respectively. Mean MRC change over 6 months was not significantly different between groups, although mean A1C reduction was significantly greater in the DIMM versus PCP group (-2.4% [SD=2.1] vs -0.8% [SD=1.7], P<0.001, respectively).Conclusions and Relevance: Outcomes represent the first report demonstrating how treating patients with an innovative DIMM model can help complex T2D patients achieve glycemic control without increasing the MRC to more than a comparator group. With the growing prevalence of T2D and associated elevated treatment costs, identifying effective means for achieving glycemic control without increasing complexity is needed.

The evaluation of the psychometric properties was carried out by analyzing the correlations between RCS-E score and other measures (Functional Independence Measure, Braden, Morse, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale) and the assessment of reliability in terms of reproducibility (inter-observer agreement) and repeatability (intra-observer agreement).Results: The backward and forward processes of translation of the scale did not create problems of interpretation of terms. Some adaptation was required for the items nursing (N), medical care (M) and therapeutic intensity (TI) due to differences on the national health system structure. The Italian version of the scale proved to be valid, reliable with high reproducibility and repeatability.Conclusions: The Italian version RCS-E has been successfully validated, showing good psychometric properties, which partly reproduce the results obtained for the original version.

Method/process The evidence-based management practice process was used to identify the major impediment to Getting Work Done-assignment to multiple patients with simultaneous complex needs. Best management practice consisted of class presentation of a clinical-management problem scenario to 144 residents in nine Magnet hospitals, a private action commitment, class discussion and terminal action commitments. Results Responses indicated that this 'best management practice' was effective in helping newly licensed registered nurses manage and handle multiple patients with simultaneous complex needs. A major avenue of resolution was perception of professional practice responsibilities as a series of complex, interrelated, adaptive systems.

Method: The participants in Experiment 1 were NBD older and younger adults (n = 20 per group). The participants in Experiment 2 were 10 PWA. In both experiments, the participants read and listened to sentences in self-paced reading and listening tasks. The experimental materials consisted of object cleft sentences (e.g., It was the girl who the boy hugged.) and subject cleft sentences (e.g., It was the boy who hugged the girl.). Results: The predicted effects of syntactic complexity were observed in both Experiments 1 and 2: Reading and listening times were longer for the verb in sentences with object compared to subject relative clauses. The NBD controls showed exaggerated effects of syntactic complexity in reading compared to listening. The PWA did not show different modality effects from the NBD participants.

298,300,Treatment Complexity: A Description Of Chemotherapy And Supportive Care Treatment Visits In Patients With Advanced-Stage Cancer Diagnoses.,"sumpio,catherine","Purpose: Modern chemotherapy regimens are growing increasingly complex, involving lengthy outpatient infusions, and additional visits for supportive care. The treatment of advanced-stage patients is uniquely one of unremitting therapy and varying complexity. The study's purpose was to describe and quantify the dimensions of treatment complexity in terms of chemotherapy (CT) and supportive care (SC) visits.Methods: Electronic medical records for 121 subjects with stages III and IV cancer were reviewed. Visits were classified as SC and CT types, and actual hours and visit numbers were calculated for a 3-month treatment period. Analysis included descriptive and generalized linear modeling statistics.Results: Subjects ≥65 years spent fewer total hours (M = 18.17 h, SD = 10.17 h, p = 0.04), but experienced more total visits (M = 10.96 visits, SD = 4.65 visits, p = 0.02) than younger subjects. More than 71% of younger patients spent two or more hours per chemotherapy visit, compared to 41.7% of older patients (p = 0.001). Older subjects were more likely to have a SC visit (p = 0.03), but did not differ from younger subjects in SC visit numbers (p = 0.3) or hours (p = 0.6). Females averaged 3.81 more total hours (M = 22. 61 h, SD = 11.06 h, p = 0.055) and had more total visits (M = 10.80 visits, SD = 3.71, p = 0.02) than males. By visit type, women spent twice the hours undergoing SC than males (M = 3.3 vs. 1.5 h, p = 0.051), but genders did not differ in CT visit hours or average length. By diagnosis, colon/esophageal subjects spent more hours in CT visits (M = 21.90 h, SD = 8.60 h, p < 0.01), and lung subjects trended toward spending more hours in SC visits (M = 4.80 h, SD = 8.23 h, p < 0.06).Conclusions: Advanced-stage cancer patients differed in visit types, hours, and treatment length undergoing CT and SC visits.

Language samples were elicited from healthy adults in their 20 s, 40 s, and 60 s ( n = 20 per group) using a conversational (CON) task and a peer conflict resolution (PCT) task. Each sample was transcribed, segmented into utterances, and coded for main clauses and all types of finite and non-finite subordinate clauses. The results indicated that all groups produced greater syntactic complexity during the PCR task than the CON task as measured by mean length of utterance, clausal density, and the use of left-branching clauses. Additionally, the groups did not differ on any syntactic measures for either task.

191,192,Use Of Emergency Departments By Frail Elderly Patients: Temporal Patterns And Case Complexity.,"rauch,jens","Emergency department (ED) care for frail elderly patients is associated with an increased use of resources due to their complex medical needs and frequently difficult psycho-social situation. To better target their needs with specially trained staff, it is vital to determine the times during which these particular patients present to the ED. Recent research was inconclusive regarding this question and the applied methods were limited to coarse time windows. Moreover, there is little research on time variation of frail ED patients' case complexity. This study examines differences in arrival rates for frail vs. non-frail patients in detail and compares case complexity in frail patients within vs. outside of regular GP working hours. Arrival times and case variables (admission rate, ED length of stay [LOS], triage level and comorbidities) were extracted from the EHR of an ED in an urban German teaching hospital. We employed Poisson time series regression to determine patterns in hourly arrival rates over the week. Frail elderly patients presented more likely to the ED during already high frequented hours, especially at midday and in the afternoon. Case complexity for frail patients was significantly higher compared to non-frail patients, but varied marginally in time only with respect to triage level and ED LOS. The results suggest that frailtyattuned emergency care should be available in EDs during the busiest hours.

Given the documented detrimental effects of such discrepancies on employee strain, the present study investigated whether job complexity mitigates the relation between emotion-rule dissonance and employee burnout using data from a two-wave panel study of eldercare workers (N = 583, 16-month time lag). Structural equation modelling revealed that emotion-rule dissonance at Time 1 preceded emotional exhaustion and depersonalization at Time 2. Beyond that, employees whose work offered job complexity were found to suffer less from emotional exhaustion and depersonalization when encountering discrepancies between felt and stipulated emotions compared to employees who conducted noncomplex work. Thus, designing complex tasks appears to be a crucial starting point for alleviating employee burnout in jobs that provoke emotion-rule dissonance.",2015,1,4,10.1080/02678373.2015.1074954,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=110839145&site=ehost-live

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting VA and non- VA hospitals. Participants VA beneficiaries aged 67 and older with diabetes mellitus and enrolled in Medicare (N = 364,972). Measurements Instrumental variables regression models were used to estimate the effect of HBPC enrollment on hospitalization for ACSCs (defined according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators) overall and in subgroups stratified according to medical complexity. Models were also estimated for each ACSC to determine which conditions were most sensitive to HBPC. Distance from the veteran's residence to the nearest HBPC site was used as the instrumental variable. Results HBPC was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations (odds ratio ( OR) = 0.35 per person-month, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.30-0.42). For veterans in the highest quartile of medical complexity, HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.93), whereas for those in the lowest quartile, HBPC was associated with more ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 33.2, 95% CI = 4.6-240.1). HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs. Conclusion HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs in veterans with diabetes mellitus but only in the most medically complex individuals. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate targeting and suggests that the effect of HBPC is attributable to its comprehensive approach rather than condition-specific interventions.",2017,0,4,10.1111/jgs.14843,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=124623509&site=ehost-live
54,55,Leadership Role Of Consultant Nurses Working With Older People: A Co-Operative Inquiry.,"manley,k","Aims The aim of the co-operative enquiry undertaken was to explore how the leadership component of the Consultant Nurse for Older People role was reflected in day-to-day working. Background Leadership is one of the four key elements of the Consultant Nurse role and is the key mechanism for achieving and embedding transformation in practice. However, within the role of the Consultant Nurse this area has not been explored in detail. Methods A 6-month co-operative inquiry approach was used to develop insights into leadership strategies of Consultant Nurses for Older People and involved the five authors of the paper, four Consultant Nurses in Older People nursing and the lead author who was also an experienced Consultant Nurse and practice-based researcher from a different nursing specialism. Results Through the analysis of the stories shared by the co-authors/participants, two key themes emerged relating to complexity and pathway. These themes provided a major focus for the Consultant Nurses in their leadership role. The outcome of the study is a framework that describes the triggers and enabling factors that precede the use of leadership strategies at the clinical and organizational level and associated outcomes. Conclusions In defining how leadership is reflected by Consultant Nurses for Older People, a complex picture emerges that is multifaceted and multidimensional. Consultant Nurses need support to make visible the valuable contribution they make to enabling healthcare teams, organizations and work places. Consultant Nurses for Older People are key in ensuring the quality agenda within their organizations as they are well placed to provide leadership at both a strategic and clinical level, while providing influence to operational development. Implications for nursing management Within the context of the literature this area is under investigated. Understanding how leadership is reflected in the role of Consultant Nurses is complex as Consultant Nurses work across traditional interfaces and between different levels within organizations. Consultant Nurses have been 'challenged' to identify the 'difference' they are making; to do this it is important to understand how leadership (as one element) is reflected in a highly complex, multidimensional role and the links between leadership and enabling, quality person-centred ways of working with Older People within rapidly changing, pressurized healthcare settings.",2008,0,4,10.1111/j.1365-2834.2007.00843.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105732523&site=ehost-live

235,236,Relational Practice As The Key To Ensuring Quality Care For Frail Older People: Discharge Planning As A Case Example.,"williams,s","Discharging frail older people from acute hospital settings has been an issue of concern for over 40 years and recent studies suggest that enduring problems remain. This paper explores the experiences of discharge from three different units: an acute surgical ward, an acute medical ward and a specialist ward for older people. Based on extensive data from interviews with older people, their family carers and ward-based staff, a grounded theory of the discharge experience is presented. This suggests that the quality of discharge hinges largely on whether the focus of efforts is on 'pace' (the desire to discharge older people as rapidly as possible) or 'complexity' (where due account is taken of the complex interaction of medical and wider social issues). When pace is the focus, 'pushing' and 'fixing' are the main processes driving discharge. However, when attention is given to complexity, far more subtle processes of 'informing' and 'brokering' are in evidence. These latter processes are conceived of as forms of 'relational practice' and it is argued that such practices lie at the heart of high quality care for older people.",2009,0,3,10.1108/14717794200900024,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105322109&site=ehost-live
230,231,Frailty Defined By Deficit Accumulation And Geriatric Medicine Defined By Frailty.,"rockwood,k","As nonreplicative cells age, they commonly accumulate subcellular deficits that can compromise function. As people age, they too experience problems that can accumulate. As deficits (symptoms, signs, illnesses, disabilities) accumulate, people become more susceptible to adverse health outcomes, including worse health and even death. This state of increased risk of adverse health outcomes is indistinguishable from the idea of frailty, so deficit accumulation represents another way to define frailty. Counting deficits not only allows grades of frailty to be discerned but also provides insights into the complex problems of older adults. This process is potentially useful to geriatricians who need to be experts in managing complexity. A key to managing complexity is through instruments such as a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which can serve as the basis for routine clinical estimation of an individual's degree of frailty.

Complexity Theory: A Long-Term Care Specialty Practice Exemplar For The Education Of Advanced Practice Nurses.,"mcconnell,es","This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems.

140,141,Polypharmacy And Medication Regimen Complexity As Risk Factors For Hospitalization Among Residents Of Long-Term Care Facilities: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"lalic,samanta","Objectives To investigate the association between polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity with time to first hospitalization, number of hospitalizations, and number of hospital days over a 12-month period. Design A 12-month prospective cohort study. Participants and Setting A total of 383 residents of 6 Australian long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Measurements The primary exposures were polypharmacy (≥9 regular medications) and the 65-item Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between polypharmacy and MRCI with time to first hospitalization. Poisson regression was used to compute incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs for the association between polypharmacy and MRCI with number of hospitalizations and number of hospital days. Models were adjusted for age, sex, length of stay in LTCF, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and dementia severity. Results There were 0.56 (95% CI 0.49–0.65) hospitalizations per person-year and 4.52 (95% CI 4.31–4.76) hospital days per person-year. In adjusted analyses, polypharmacy was associated with time to first hospitalization (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.21–2.79), number of hospitalizations (IRR 1.51; 95% CI 1.09–2.10), and hospital days per person-year (IRR 1.39; 95% CI 1.24–1.56). Similarly, in adjusted analyses a 10-unit increase in MRCI was associated with time to first hospitalization (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.06–1.29), number of hospitalizations (IRR 1.15; 95% CI 1.06–1.24), and hospital days per person-year (IRR 1.19; 95% CI 1.16–1.23). Conclusions Polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity are associated with hospitalizations from LTCFs. This highlights the importance of regular medication review for residents of LTCFs and the need for further research into the risk-to-benefit ratio of prescribing in this setting.",2016,1,3,10.1016/j.jamda.2016.08.019,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=119003420&site=ehost-live

This article presents outcomes of a program, delivered to 140 participants from five community aged care providers in Australia, designed to enhance knowledge, skills, and confidence of community aged care SWs, building their practical skills in understanding, recognizing, and responding to complexity. Evaluation training modules on communication, complexity, behavior change, and chronic condition self-management support involved pre/post surveys with SWs and their supervisors. SWs reported greater awareness, skills, and confidence in working with complexity, reinforcing the value of their existing practices and skills. Coordinators reported greater appreciation of SWs’ skills, and greater awareness of gaps in SWs’ support and supervision needs.

181,182,Preoperative Assessment And Optimization Of Cognitive Dysfunction And Frailty In The Ambulatory Surgical Patient.,"charipova,karina","Purpose Of Review: The number and the complexity of procedures taking place at ambulatory surgery centers is steadily increasing. The rate at which medically complex patients, including those with baseline neurocognitive disorders, are undergoing ambulatory procedures is seeing a concurrent rise. Given the significant physical and psychological stress associated with surgery even in the ambulatory setting, it is essential to evaluate the ability of a patient to acclimate to stressful triggers in order to assess risk of subpar medical outcomes and increased mortality. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the assessment of both cognition and frailty and describe the implementation of these tools in the ambulatory surgery setting.Recent Findings: Recent Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) recommendations for evaluating at-risk patients focus on a two-pronged approach that encompasses screening for both impaired cognition and frailty. Screening should ideally occur as early as possible, but tools such as the Mini-Cog examination and FRAIL Questionnaire are efficient and effective even when used the day of surgery in high-risk patients.Summary: The recognition of at-risk patients using standardized screening and the use of this assessment to guide perioperative monitoring and interventions is essential for optimizing outcomes for the complex ambulatory surgery patient.",2020,0,3,10.1097/ACO.0000000000000901,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=147059425&site=ehost-live

The limited ability to accurately detect and quantify complex behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD) patterns has hampered the development and refinement of tailored interventions. This study's purpose was to characterize complex patterns of BSD and examine the association among different BSD patterns and cortisol profiles. Two groups of nursing home residents were analyzed (N = 28,N = 27) using THEME™. Behavioral and cortisol data were collected for four consecutive days. Random effects model was used to characterize BSD trajectories over time. There was a significant difference in BSD between the two groups from late afternoon to early evening. The groups differed significantly in age, comorbidities, antianxiety medication, and the number and complexity of patterns of vocalization and restlessness.

237,238,Physiological Complexity Underlying Heart Rate Dynamics And Frailty Status In Community-Dwelling Older Women.,"chaves,phm","OBJECTIVES: To assess whether less physiological complexity underlying regulation of heart rate dynamics, as indicated by lower approximate entropy for heart rate (ApEn(HR)), is associated with frailty. For supporting validity, relationships between frailty and traditional linear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were also assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, a community-based observational study, 1992 to 1995. PARTICIPANTS: Subset of 389 community-dwelling women aged years and older with moderate to severe disability with ApEn(HR) data (convenience sampling). MEASUREMENTS: Electrocardiographic Holter recordings obtained over 2- to 3-hour periods were processed for ApEn(HR) and HRV measures. ApEn(HR) is a nonlinear statistic that quantifies the regularity of heart rate fluctuations over time. Lower ApEn(HR) is characteristic of heart rate time series containing a high proportion of repetitive patterns. Frailty was defined according to validated phenotype criteria. RESULTS: Median ApEn(HR) was lower in frail than in nonfrail subjects (P=.02). Lower ApEn(HR) (top quartile) was associated with lower likelihood of frailty than higher ApEn(HR) (bottom three quartiles) (odds ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.26-0.86), even after adjustment for major confounders. Frailty was consistently associated with lower HRV as assessed using time- and frequency-domain indices. CONCLUSION: This study supports the notion that less physiological complexity marks frailty and provides an empirical basis to the concept of frailty as a syndrome of homeostatic impairment. Future research will determine whether noninvasive measures of physiological complexity underlying heart rate dynamics might be useful for screening and monitoring of clinical vulnerability in older adults.",2008,1,3,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01858.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105696028&site=ehost-live
40,41,Connect For Quality: Protocol Of A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial To Improve Fall Prevention In Nursing Homes.,"anderson,ruth.a","Background: Quality improvement (QI) programs focused on mastery of content by individual staff members are the current standard to improve resident outcomes in nursing homes. However, complexity science suggests that learning is a social process that occurs within the context of relationships and interactions among individuals. Thus, QI programs will not result in optimal changes in staff behavior unless the context for social learning is present. Accordingly, we developed CONNECT, an intervention to foster systematic use of management practices, which we propose will enhance effectiveness of a nursing home Falls QI program by strengthening the staff-to-staff interactions necessary for clinical problem-solving about complex problems such as falls. The study aims are to compare the impact of the CONNECT intervention, plus a falls reduction QI intervention (CONNECT + FALLS), to the falls reduction QI intervention alone (FALLS), on fall-related process measures, fall rates, and staff interaction measures.Methods/design: Sixteen nursing homes will be randomized to one of two study arms, CONNECT + FALLS or FALLS alone. Subjects (staff and residents) are clustered within nursing homes because the intervention addresses social processes and thus must be delivered within the social context, rather than to individuals. Nursing homes randomized to CONNECT + FALLS will receive three months of CONNECT first, followed by three months of FALLS. Nursing homes randomized to FALLS alone receive three months of FALLs QI and are offered CONNECT after data collection is completed. Complexity science measures, which reflect staff perceptions of communication, safety climate, and care quality, will be collected from staff at baseline, three months after, and six months after baseline to evaluate immediate and sustained impacts. FALLS measures including quality indicators (process measures) and fall rates will be collected for the six months prior to baseline and the six months after the end of the intervention. Analysis will use a three-level mixed model.Discussion: By focusing on improving local interactions, CONNECT is expected to maximize staff's ability to implement content learned in a falls QI program and integrate it into knowledge and action. Our previous pilot work shows that CONNECT is feasible, acceptable and appropriate.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00636675.",2012,0,3,10.1186/1748-5908-7-11,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104492543&site=ehost-live
290,292,Individual Changes In Preclinical Spinocerebellar Ataxia Identified Via Increased Motor Complexity.,"ilg,winfried","Background: Movement changes in autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias are suggested to occur many years before clinical manifestation. Detecting and quantifying these changes in the preclinical phase offers a window for future treatment interventions and allows the clinician to decipher the earliest dysfunctions starting the evolution of spinocerebellar ataxia. We hypothesized that quantitative movement analysis of complex stance and gait tasks allows to (i) reveal movement changes already at early stages of the preclinical phase when clinical ataxia signs are still absent and to (ii) quantify motor progression in this phase.Methods: A total of 46 participants (14 preclinical spinocerebellar ataxia mutation carriers [spinocerebellar ataxias 1,2,3,6], 9 spinocerebellar ataxia patients at an early stage; 23 healthy controls) were assessed by quantitative movement analyses of increasingly complex stance and walking tasks in a cross-sectional design.Results: Body sway in stance and spatiotemporal variability in tandem walking differentiated between preclinical mutation carriers and healthy controls (P < .01). Complex movement conditions allowed one to discriminate even those mutation carriers without any clinical signs in posture and gait (SARAposture&gait  = 0; P < .04). Multivariate regression analysis categorized preclinical mutation carriers on a single-subject level with 100% accuracy within a range of 10 years to the estimated onset. Movement features in stance and gait correlated significantly with genetically estimated time to onset, indicating a gradual increase of motor changes with increasing proximity to disease manifestation.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for subclinical motor changes in spinocerebellar ataxia, which allow to discriminate patients without clinical signs even on a single-subject basis and may help capture disease progression in the preclinical phase. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",2016,1,3,10.1002/mds.26835,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=120127986&site=ehost-live
266,267,Addressing Falls Among Older Oncology Patients Through Complexity Science.,"shelby,melissa","Traditional quality assurance processes provide significant opportunities for positive disruption. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students are well positioned to apply program learning to largescale change in complex organizations. This article presents an innovative approach for creating a point-of-care interdisciplinary approach to address high fall risk frequencies in ambulatory oncology clinics using complexity leadership principles. Processes for nurse executives to consider for replication of this approach for other challenging clinical situations are suggested using the emerging competence of DNP educated nurses. Adults with cancer who are older than 65 years are at a higher risk for falls than older adults without cancer. Oncology providers and nurses are not routinely screening, documenting, and preventing falls. A fall injury in an older adult with cancer may not only delay or impact cancer treatment but also result in hospitalization, loss of function, and/or death. Increasing awareness of the impact of falls and implementing change within a large ambulatory health care organization requires an interdisciplinary team approach. Complexity theory supports nonlinear change initiated at the grassroots level to create a dynamic movement to bring forth emergence and adaptation. The use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) initiative will enable oncology professionals to screen, assess, and intervene by collaborating, communicating, and coordinating with other health care specialists to introduce a fall prevention quality improvement system process.

314,320,"Medication Complexity, Prescription Behaviour And Patient Adherence At The Interface Between Ambulatory And Stationary Medical Care.","stange,dorit","Purpose: A hospital stay is often accompanied by changes in medication therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a transfer across the interfaces on the complexity of therapeutic regimens and patient adherence as well as the attitudes of patients and general practitioners (GPs) towards pharmacotherapies. Methods: This was a prospective observational study that analysed the complexity of medication therapies and the adherence and attitudes of internal medicine and urology patients towards their medication(s) at three time points (hospital admission, discharge and 6 weeks after discharge). GPs of the patients recruited to the study were questioned about the follow-up medication therapy and their opinion on the medication prescribed in hospital. Results: At the time of hospital admission, 60.2 % of the study population were nonadherent. During hospitalization, the number decreased to 37.6 %, but increased to 61.2 % 6 weeks after discharge. Changes in the overall complexity of the therapy regimens were marginal and not statistically significant. Of the long-term medication regimens, 48.6 % were modified during hospital stay. The patients preferred regimens with a minimum of drug administrations. GPs stated to be willing to continue hospital prescriptions but were restricted by financial budgets. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that an increase in adherence during a hospital stay is only transient, underlining the need for interventions to ameliorate medication adherence. They also suggest that patients prefer simple regimens. Although GPs are willing to consider their patient's preferences on pharmacotherapy, they state limitations due to financial budgets.

Methods: A cross-sectional study of 383 residents from six Australian RACFs was conducted. The primary exposures were polypharmacy (≥9 regular medications) and the validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). The outcome measure was staff informant rated quality of life assessed using the Quality of Life Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) scale. Covariates included age, sex, Charlson's comorbidity index, activities of daily living, and dementia severity. Logistic quantile regression was used to characterize the association between polypharmacy and QoL-AD (model 1) and MRCI and QoL-AD (model 2). Results: The median age of the 383 residents was 88 years and 297 (78 %) residents were female. In total, 63 % of residents were exposed to polypharmacy and the median MRCI score (range) was 43.5 (4-113).

247,248,Dynamics Of Stability: The Physiologic Basis Of Functional Health And Frailty.,"lipsitz,lewis.a","Under basal resting conditions most healthy physiologic systems demonstrate highly irregular, complex dynamics that represent interacting regulatory processes operating over multiple time scales. These processes prime the organism for an adaptive response, making it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given set of boundary conditions, most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively short periods of time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response mode, which is denoted ""reactive tuning."" Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in resting dynamics and maladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline and frailty.

The factors that promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older people from drinking are not well understood. Objective: This study aimed to understand the complexity of issues associated with the hydration and hydration care of older people. Design: A qualitative study using multiple methods. Settings: Two healthcare sites providing care for older people in the South West of England: a hospital ward in a major hospital and a care home providing personal and nursing care. Participants: Twenty-one older people aged 68–96 years, were recruited to the study from the hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older people to participate were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion criteria were being unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or distressed to take part in the study. The staff participants of nurses and health care assistants totalled 21. The inclusion criterion for staff was any nurse or health care assistant providing hydration care. Seven friends or relatives participated by making anonymous comments via a suggestion box available to all friends and relatives. Methods: Data were collected via interviews with older people, focus group discussions involving staff, suggestion box comments made by friends and relatives and twelve hours observation of hydration practice. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to promote drinking including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in older people''s hands and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their experience of drinking was diminished by a variety of factors including a limited aesthetic experience and a focus on fluid consumption rather than on drinking as a pleasurable and social experience. Conclusion: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with drinking were lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social interaction was underplayed in both settings.

252,253,A Method For Grouping Emergency Department Visits By Severity And Complexity.,"theiling,b.jason","Introduction: Triage functions to quickly prioritize care and sort patients by anticipated resource needs. Despite widespread use of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), there is still no universal standard for emergency department (ED) triage. Thus, it can be difficult to objectively assess national trends in ED acuity and resource requirements. We sought to derive an ESI from National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) survey items (NHAMCS-ESI) and to assess the performance of this index with respect to stratifying outcomes, including hospital admission, waiting times, and ED length of stay (LOS). Methods: We used data from the 2010-2015 NHAMCS, to create a measure of ED visit complexity based on variables within NHAMCS. We used NHAMCS data on chief complaint, vitals, resources used, interventions, and pain level to group ED visits into five levels of acuity using a stepwise algorithm that mirrored ESI. In addition, we examined associations of NHAMCS-ESI with typical indicators of acuity such as waiting time, LOS, and disposition. The NHAMCS-ESI categorization was also compared against the “immediacy” variable across all of these outcomes. Visit counts used weighted scores to estimate national levels of ED visits. Results: The NHAMCS ED visits represent an estimated 805,726,000 ED visits over this time period. NHAMCS-ESI categorized visits somewhat evenly, with most visits (42.5%) categorized as a level 3. The categorization pattern is distinct from that of the “immediacy” variable within NHAMCS. Of admitted patients, 89% were categorized as NHAMCS-ESI level 2-3. Median ED waiting times increased as NHAMCS-ESI levels decreased in acuity (from approximately 14 minutes to 25 minutes). Median LOS decreased as NHAMCS-ESI decreased from almost 200 minutes for level 1 patients to nearly 80 minutes for level 5 patients. Conclusion: We derived an objective tool to measure an ED visit’s complexity and resource use. This tool can be validated and used to compare complexity of ED visits across hospitals and regions, and over time.",2020,1,3,10.5811/westjem.2020.6.44086,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=146108720&site=ehost-live

The purpose of this paper is to examine these changes from the perspectives of staff to identify factors influencing quality of residential aged care, and the role and influence of an aged care accreditation programme.Design/methodology/approach Focus groups were held with 66 aged care staff from 11 Australian aged care facilities. Data from semi-structured interviews were analysed to capture categories representing participant views.Findings Participants reported two factors stimulating change: developments in the aged care regulatory and policy framework, and rising consumer expectations. Four corresponding effects on service quality were identified: increasing complexity of resident care, renewed built environments of aged care facilities, growing focus on resident-centred care and the influence of accreditation on resident quality of life. The accreditation programme was viewed as maintaining minimum standards of quality throughout regulatory and social change, yet was considered to lack capacity of itself to explicitly promote or improve resident quality of life.Research limitations/implications For an increasingly complex aged care population, regulatory and societal change has led to a shift in service provision from institutional care models to one that is becoming more responsive to consumer expectations. The capacity of long-established and relatively static accreditation standards to better accommodate changing consumer needs comes into question.Originality/value This is the first study to examine the relationship between accreditation and residential aged care service quality from the perspectives of staff, and offers a nuanced view of “quality” in this setting.",2017,0,2,10.1108/QAOA-07-2016-0028,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=123135616&site=ehost-live

Holistic understanding of residents' health status is key to providing good care. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a valid assessment method which aims to embrace complexity. Here we aimed to study a CGA that has been modified for use in long-term care (the LTC-CGA) and to investigate its acceptability and usefulness to stakeholders and users. Methods This mixed methods study, conducted in 10 LTCFs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, reviewed 598 resident charts from pre- and post-implementation of the LTC-CGA. Qualitative methods explored stakeholder perspectives (physicians, nurses, paramedics, administrators, residents and families) though focus groups. Results The LTC-CGA was present in 78% of LTCF charts in the post -implementation, period though it did not appear in acute care charts of transferred residents, despite the intention that it accompany residents between care sites.

151,152,Factors Associated With Remaining In A Skilled Nursing Facility For Over 90 Days From Admission: Residents' Participation In Therapy And Desire To Return To The Community.,"yoo,ji.won","Abstract: Background: To identify the factors associated with stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) among new enrollees who did not fully participate in therapy sessions. Methods: Data (n = 36,133) were obtained from the Minimum Data Set version 2.0 in the state of Michigan in 2009. Study participants were new SNF enrollees (n = 699) who did not fully participate in therapy sessions despite their desire to return to the community. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify factors contributing to remaining in a nursing home for 91 days or longer. Results: New SNF enrollees were more likely to remain in nursing home when they were depressed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–2.08; P = .01), experiencing delirium (OR = 3.20; 95% CI, 1.48–5.92; P < .001), were not in pain (OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.60–0.95; P = .03), or in less complex care (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; P < .01). Conclusions: A higher number of new SNF enrollees than previously reported were likely to stay in nursing homes (28.0%). Depression and delirium were associated with stay in an SNF, while pain and higher complexity of care were associated with returning to the community.",2013,0,2,10.1016/j.jamda.2013.05.022,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104219381&site=ehost-live
150,151,Professional Caregivers' Work With The Dying In Nursing Homes - A Foucault-Inspired Analysis Of Discourses In The Last Decade In A Danish Context.,"nielsen,karen.t","International studies on the death of elderly nursing home residents show the complexity in the understanding of the professionals who care for the dying. The aim of this study is to explore the discourses about professional caregivers caring for those dying in Denmark in the last decade. A discourse analysis inspired by Foucault was constructed. The material consists of different source documents: research articles, newspaper articles, theses, books, websites - 35 sources in total. There are constructed six positions of speech, five discourses and three themes: (1) 'the work of the professional caregivers - a complex low-status work'; (2) 'the education of the professionals - the way to ensure a good death or possessing the right qualifications' and (3) 'the vulnerable professionals'. The study concludes that an economical/political discourse is dominating and sets up the frames within which the professionals care for dying residents, although the medical, the social/critical and the religious discourses attempt to speak against it. All positions articulate that the professional caregivers' job has a low status and that it is not possible to provide an optimal care due to lack of time, resources and education. Psychical or mental demands make the professionals vulnerable. The meaning of optimal care varies according to the positions of speech.",2013,0,2,10.1111/scs.12021,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104147763&site=ehost-live
149,150,2013: That Was The Year That Was.,"woo,jean","In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about.

110,111,Joining-The-Dots: Caring For Patients In Advanced Age.,"miskelly,philippa","Purpose: Managing patients in advanced age is complex, especially when it comes to multi-morbidities and polypharmacy. The purpose of this qualitative study is to investigate challenges, opportunities and potential solutions from a primary healthcare provider perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Fifty-seven participants joined in group discussions on challenges and opportunities of working with advanced age. Participants included general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, students and administration staff working in ten general practices. A thematic analysis was developed, supported by NVivo software. Findings: Poor lines of communication and fragmentation of services between differing levels of health care services available for older people were highlighted. This has implications for quality of care and equity of services. Participants also reported challenges in treatment and funding regimes. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size and regional nature of the study, along with the semi-structured nature of the group discussions and rigorous thematic analysis, indicate that this qualitative data is transferable, dependable, confirmable and credible. Comparing the views of tertiary and community services would be useful. Practical implications: A range of potential strategies and solutions to the current fragmented services was offered by GPs. For example, adequately funded and staffed community-based health hubs; IT platforms enabling timely flow of patient information between primary and tertiary health providers and creation of medical, nursing and allied health roles aimed at improving synergy between GP and tertiary services.

147,148,Managing Medications: The Role Of Informal Caregivers Of Older Adults And People Living With Dementia. A Review Of The Literature.,"gillespie,robyn","Aims and objectives To explore published literature that describes what is known about the role of informal caregivers as they manage medications for older adults and/or people living with dementia residing in the community. Background The number of informal caregivers of older adults, including people living with dementia, is growing worldwide. Good medication management by informal caregivers contributes to improved health outcomes and reduced institutionalisations for the care recipient; however, little is known about this domain of care. Design Narrative review. Methods A literature search was conducted to identify relevant research articles written in English between January 2000-April 2013, sourced from online database searches using multiple keywords, reviewing reference lists and citations of key articles and Internet searches. Articles were included if they described informal caregiver medication management for older adults and/or people living with dementia. Results Ten articles were found that described this role from the perspective of the informal caregiver. The evidence suggests that this role is complex and is often made more difficult because of increasing medication regimen complexities, aspects of the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient, healthcare system practices and a lack of information and/or training available to the informal caregiver, especially when caring for people living with dementia. Conclusion Responsibility for managing medications for older adults and/or people living with dementia in the community often falls to informal caregivers. More information resources are required for this role, which requires specific medication management skills and knowledge and is further complicated by the cognitive decline of the care recipient. Relevance to clinical practice Informal caregivers are often expected to manage medications in a safe and effective manner for their older care recipient, who may also have cognitive impairment. Nurses, who may be in frequent contact with community-living older adults/people living with dementia, can be an important source of information, training and support for informal caregivers.",2014,0,2,10.1111/jocn.12519,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=99471435&site=ehost-live
112,113,Making Health Care Responsive To The Needs Of Older People.,"bridges,jackie","This commentary highlights the importance of health system responsiveness to older people living with complex health needs. Age-related changes and associated morbidity can present barriers to identifying an individual's health needs, expectations, values and preferences, and so sufficient time, skill and resource is required to inform the development of a tailored plan for each individual. A focus on responsiveness moves thinking beyond the responsibilities of the individual clinician in the single encounter, and allows us to identify elements of the wider system that may constrain how well the clinician is able to respond. Setting the goal of responsive health care requires us to assess the suitability of wider health system features and processes for meeting the diverse needs of individual people throughout their journey, and the extent to which the system can adapt dynamically as needs change. Standardised approaches to care prescribed across organisations (such as time-based targets or routinised approaches to inpatient nursing care) are likely to result in low responsiveness as individual complexity grows, disadvantaging patients with needs that do not fit the prescribed approach. Responsiveness is high when individual practitioners and clinical teams have the resources, decentralised authority, flexibility and autonomy to provide the care required. Building a more responsive health system requires a greater understanding of how these conditions can be achieved.",2019,0,2,10.1093/ageing/afz085,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=140357968&site=ehost-live

A Cross-Sectional Study.","bakker,mieke.h","As the population ages, the risk of becoming malnourished increases. Research has shown that poor oral health can be a risk factor for malnutrition in institutionalized elderly. However, it remains unclear whether oral health problems, edentulousness and health-related quality of life also pose a risk for malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults. In this cross-sectional observational study, 1325 community-living elderly (≥75 years) were asked to complete questionnaires regarding nutritional status, oral status (edentulous, remaining teeth, or implant-supported overdentures), oral health problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, activities of daily living (ADL) and complexity of care needs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with nutritional status as dependent variable. Of the respondents, 51% (n = 521) were edentulous, 38.8% (n = 397) had remaining teeth and 10.2% (n = 104) had an implant-supported overdenture. Elderly with complex care needs were malnourished most frequently, followed by frail and robust elderly (10%, 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively). Malnourished elderly reported more frequent problems with chewing and speech when compared with well-nourished elderly (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analysis did not show an association between malnutrition and oral health problems and edentulousness, although HRQoL was associated with malnutrition (odds ratio (OR) 0.972, confidence interval (CI) 0.951–0.955). Based on the results of this cross-sectional study, it can be concluded that poor HRQoL is significantly associated with malnutrition; however, edentulousness and oral health problems are not.",2018,0,2,10.3390/nu10121965,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=133723020&site=ehost-live

There is no available data of the duration of stay in rehabilitation beds after approval of NHSS application and reasons for delay in transition to nursing home. Aims (1) To examine average length of stay in rehabilitation before multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision is made for nursing home care. (2) To examine average length of stay in rehabilitation bed from the time of NHSS approval to discharge into nursing home. (3) To examine reasons for delay in discharge to nursing home after NHSS approval. Methods A retrospective chart review of patients discharged into nursing homes between January to June, 2018 from geriatric rehabilitation units. Data collected include age, length of stay in rehabilitation unit before multidisciplinary decision was made in conjunction with patients/family to seek nursing home care (LOS1), Length of stay in rehabilitation bed following decision for nursing home care (LOS 2). Reasons for the delay in the transition from rehabilitation bed to nursing home bed were also documented. Results Seventeen patients were discharged into nursing homes, LOS1 of 43.12 days and LOS2 of 50 days. Complexity of application in terms of financial evaluation especially for patients who were deemed cognitively incapable of managing their finances, lack of suitable nursing homes for patients with complex needs/challenging behaviours, family dynamics with regards to choice of nursing homes and medical stability to facilitate such transfers were reasons for delay in transition to nursing home beds. Conclusion Transitional care beds, which are generally acknowledged to be more appropriate to these patients' care needs and are less expensive than rehabilitation beds, need to be utilized more.

116,117,Health Promotion For Mild Frailty Based On Behaviour Change: Perceptions Of Older People And Service Providers.,"avgerinou,christina","Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.",2019,0,2,10.1111/hsc.12781,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=138203873&site=ehost-live

136,137,Healthcare Assistants And Aged Residential Care: A Challenging Policy And Contractual Environment.,"burrow,marla","Healthcare assistants provide the majority of direct care to the residents living in aged residential care. In New Zealand, the delivery of care is under the supervision of the registered nurse. The purpose of this article is to examine the New Zealand policy landscape and care demands in aged residential care. Within the current care environments, registered nurses are challenged by the responsibility of ensuring quality care delivered under supervision by healthcare assistants in an increasingly complex and contract driven environment. The complexity and acuity of a client population requiring specialised care challenges the constraints of care contract expectations and creates significant difficulties for both registered nurses and healthcare assistants. Variability in role identification and scope is a significant barrier to understanding the healthcare assistant workforce as a whole. Individual employment contracts between the employers and healthcare assistants promote further variability with differing role and certification requirements for hourly rates of pay. National contracts used by District Health Boards do not address the acuity creep that is occurring at all levels in aged residential care and the workload increases that directly impact registered nurse supervision of care. The overall funding of aged residential care is caught between a client population predominately funded by the State and the sweeping economic reforms that depend on privatization. Registered nurses need to have an understanding of the socio-political, economic and educational factors that influence care delivery in aged residential care.",2017,0,2,10.36951/ngpxnz.2017.006,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=133009010&site=ehost-live
118,119,Patient‐Centred Care Training Needs Of Health Care Assistants Who Provide Care For People With Dementia.,"foster,susan","It is well documented that Health care assistants (HCAs) provide the most hands‐on care to residents in aged care facilities, and play a critical role in the provision of care to dementia residents. Over the last 25 years, a philosophy of person‐centred care has become the preferred approach to care and this has meant that HCAs are encouraged to get to know the resident very well. This paper reports the experiences of HCAs in caring for people at end‐of‐life, identifies the skills required for their work and examines the education provided against these skills. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted in 49 facilities (n = 34) across New Zealand and data analysed thematically, with the aim of critically examining the adequacy of education for health care assistants which meets their needs within a person‐centred environment. The results confirm that the skills include traditional tasks of care (showering, feeding, toileting, and dressing) but the increasingly important communication and de‐escalation skills, both verbal and non‐verbal, have become central to their care skills. Education provided has not sufficiently shifted focus to include these more complex skills. Provision of educations that acknowledges the increased complexities of their role needs to be provided.

119,120,Specialist And Family Physician Collaboration: Insights From Primary Care‐Based Memory Clinics.,"lee,linda","Given limited available geriatric specialists and complexity of dementia care, there is a need for greater collaboration between primary care and specialists to better meet the needs of persons with dementia. Meaningful family physician—specialist collaboration has the potential to improve health outcomes, timely access to care and more appropriate healthcare resource utilisation. Primary Care Collaborative Memory Clinics (PCCMCs), which include specialist support, provide a significant opportunity for studying the family physician–specialist interface. This study aimed to explore the nature of collaborative relationships between memory clinic family physicians and specialists caring for persons with memory concerns in PCCMCs across Ontario, Canada. Family physicians (N = 71) attending an education session and specialists (N = 21) completed a survey in the fall of 2017 that measured frequency and amount of collaboration, perceptions of their relationship and identified factors that enable and challenge collaboration. Descriptive statistics were generated for quantitative data and themes for responses to open‐ended questions were explored using descriptive qualitative content analysis. Specialists and memory clinic family physicians valued their collaboration particularly as related to capacity building for dementia care and desired more time devoted to collaboration. Identified enablers and barriers to collaboration have implications for further integration of specialist support to potentially support improved patient care and further build capacity in primary care to manage dementia care. Opportunities exist for expanding and more intentionally supporting how family physicians and specialists interact with the creation of more formalised processes to support optimal collaboration, including a clear delineation of roles, responsibilities and expectations, more formally planned and structured relationship building and monitoring, identifying and addressing unique barriers to collaboration and use of a variety of methods of communication. Study findings have implications for how specialists and family physicians communicate and collaborate in other programmes for complex chronic conditions.",2019,0,2,10.1111/hsc.12751,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=137037268&site=ehost-live

Cette étude exploratoire internationale visait à mieux comprendre les rôles des médecins, leurs responsabilités et leurs tâches, ainsi qu’à explorer les caractéristiques uniques de la pratique médicale dans les foyers de soins de longue durée. Des entrevues ont été menées avec 18 médecins. Ces médecins ont mentionné qu’ils contribuaient fortement à la qualité des soins pour les résidents, en clarifiant les objectifs des soins, en prenant des mesures pour réduire les hospitalisations et les prescriptions de médicaments non nécessaires, et en contribuant à la formation du personnel. Les pratiques en foyers de soins de longue durée impliquaient les médecins au centre de réseaux de relations qui assuraient non seulement une meilleure qualité des soins médicaux, mais aussi une satisfaction professionnelle chez les médecins. L’importance de ces relations est telle qu’elle permettait d’aller au-delà des démarcations traditionnelles entre le domaine médical et le domaine social, et mettait en évidence qu’une bonne pratique médicale implique de bonnes pratiques sociales. Considérant la nature exploratoire de l’étude, les auteurs recommandent que de futures recherches soient menées pour mieux comprendre les dimensions relationnelles associées à la pratique de la médecine en foyers de soins de longue durée. Despite the increasing complexity of nursing home care, the role of physicians caring for residents is largely unexplored. This international, exploratory study sought to learn about physicians’ roles, responsibilities, and tasks as well as investigate the unique qualities of medical practice in nursing homes. We conducted interviews with 18 physicians, who reported making important contributions to the quality of resident care, including clarifying the goals of care, working to reduce unnecessary medication and hospitalization, as well as contributing to staff education. Nursing home practice involved physicians in networks of relations that were instrumental to the quality of medical care and physicians’ job satisfaction. The importance of these relationships disrupts the oft-drawn boundary between the medical and the social, suggesting that good medical practice depends on good social practice. Reflecting the exploratory nature of the study, we recommend research to better understand and support the relational dimensions of nursing home medicine.",2018,0,2,10.1017/S0714980818000089,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=130854479&site=ehost-live

There were 10 subjects in each of the following groups: MTS 8-10 (non-demented), MTS 7 (borderline), MTS 6 (mild dementia), MTS 5 and MTS 4 (2 moderate dementia groups). The techniques were taught on one day and reassessed on the following day on consecutive days in ascending order of complexity. RESULTS: those with an MTS of 4 were unable to learn any of the techniques, while all the non-demented people could learn all three techniques. For the five-stage technique (standard metered dose inhaler) the 0% threshold (i.e. when none of the subjects was able to learn) was MTS 6, the 50% threshold (at least half but not all could learn) MTS 7 and the 100% threshold (all could learn) MTS 8. For the four-stage technique (inhaler with large spacer) the 0% threshold was MTS 5, the 50% threshold MTS 6 and the 100% threshold MTS 8. For the three-stage technique (inspiration-triggered inhaler) the 0% threshold was MTS 4, the 50% threshold MTS 5 and the 100% threshold MTS 7.

Aim: An online survey was conducted to identify the educational status and development needs of nurses involved in CHC assessments. Method: The survey was informed by a literature review and focus group discussions, and distributed via email to the members of the Royal College of Nursing older people's forum. Descriptive data analysis was undertaken. Results: Overall, respondents were confident about their ability to undertake CHC-associated work and manage each aspect of the CHC process. However, respondents were less confident about how to determine whether a primary health need exists based on the four main criteria – nature, complexity, intensity and unpredictability – of a person's health and social care needs. This was one of the respondents' priorities for training and development. Conclusion: The survey demonstrates the importance of face-to-face and multidisciplinary CHC training delivered locally. It also confirms the need for a standardised approach and more consistency in the CHC assessment process.

This paper is a report of a study identifying the care issues experienced by older people in the acute setting that could be improved through a collaborative approach to action. Background. Actively involving consumers in the governance of healthcare organizations is viewed positively, although there is less agreement on how to do this. Co-operative inquiry is a useful approach to involve consumers and clinicians in structured dialogue about understanding and changing care, whereas traditional quality improvement methodologies are often singular in their dimensions of change. Method. Using a co-operative inquiry approach, five workshops were facilitated over a 4-month period in 2008 with four volunteer older people, four clinicians and three facilitators (n = 11). All participants were actively involved in generating ideas and actions using a range of facilitation techniques and data collection methods. Findings. There was increased awareness, understanding and acceptance of clinicians' and consumers' experiences and expectations of care. The complexity behind changing so-called simple care (providing warm drinks, appetizing food), which were the key concerns for consumers, relied on the active management and broader transformation of the system, including teamwork, communication processes and organizational and individual values and beliefs. Conclusion. Consumers and clinicians put different emphasis on perspectives related to improving care of older people in the acute hospital setting. The disconnect between what consumers viewed as 'simple' organizational behaviours to change and what the clinicians viewed as complex, led to a recognition that the approach to organizational change needs to be reconceptualized.",2011,0,2,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05478.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=55742795&site=ehost-live

312,318,Complexity Of Management And Health Outcomes In A Prospective Cohort Study Of 573 Heart Failure Patients In Australia: Does More Equal Less?,"driscoll,andrea","Aims and objectives To compare the efficacy of chronic heart failure management programmes ( CHF- MPs) according to a scoring algorithm used to quantify the level of applied interventions-the Heart Failure Intervention Score ( HF- IS). Background The overall efficacy of heart failure programmes has been proven in several meta-analyses. However, the debate continues as to which components are essential in a heart failure programme to improve patient outcomes. Design Prospective cohort study of patients participating in heart failure programmes. Method Forty-eight of 62 (77%) programmes in Australia participating in a national register of CHF- MPs were evaluated using the HF- IS: derived from a summed and weighted score of each intervention applied by the CHF- MP (27 interventions overall). The CHF- MPs were prospectively categorised as relatively low ( HF- IS < 190 - n = 39 programmes & 407 patients) or high ( HF- IS ≥ 190 - n = 9 programmes & 166 patients) in complexity. Six-month morbidity and mortality rates in 573 consecutively recruited patients with systolic dysfunction and in New York Heart Association Class II- IV were prospectively examined. Results Patients exposed to CHF- MPs with a high HF- IS had a lower rate of unplanned, all-cause hospitalisation ( n = 24, 14% vs. n = 102, 25%) compared with CHF- MPs with a low HF- IS within six months. On an adjusted basis, CHF- MPs with a high HF- IS were associated with a reduced risk of unplanned hospitalisation and/or death within six months and remained event-free longer. Conclusion High complexity CHF- MPs applying more evidence-based interventions are associated with a higher event-free survival over six months. Relevance to clinical practice The HF- IS is an easy-to-use evidence-based tool to assist programme coordinators to improve the quality of their heart failure programme which may also improve patient outcomes.",2013,1,2,10.1111/jocn.12073,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=86864339&site=ehost-live
299,301,Muscle Synergies And Complexity Of Neuromuscular Control During Gait In Cerebral Palsy.,"steele,katherine.m","Aim: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) have impaired movement due to a brain injury near birth. Understanding how neuromuscular control is altered in CP can provide insight into pathological movement. We sought to determine if individuals with CP demonstrate reduced complexity of neuromuscular control during gait compared with unimpaired individuals and if changes in control are related to functional ability.Method: Muscle synergies during gait were retrospectively analyzed for 633 individuals (age range 3.9-70y): 549 with CP (hemiplegia, n=122; diplegia, n=266; triplegia, n=73; quadriplegia, n=88) and 84 unimpaired individuals. Synergies were calculated using non-negative matrix factorization from surface electromyography collected during previous clinical gait analyses. Synergy complexity during gait was compared with diagnosis subtype, functional ability, and clinical examination measures.Result: Fewer synergies were required to describe muscle activity during gait in individuals with CP compared with unimpaired individuals. Changes in synergies were related to functional impairment and clinical examination measures including selective motor control, strength, and spasticity.Interpretation: Individuals with CP use a simplified control strategy during gait compared with unimpaired individuals. These results were similar to synergies during walking among adult stroke survivors, suggesting similar neuromuscular control strategies between these clinical populations.",2015,1,2,10.1111/dmcn.12826,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111281580&site=ehost-live

Background Nursing diagnoses classify patients according to nursing dependency and can be a measure of nursing complexity. Knowledge regarding the prevalence of nursing diagnoses on admission and their relationship with hospital outcomes is lacking. Design Prospective observational study. Methods Data were collected for 6 months in 2014 in four inpatient units of an Italian hospital using a nursing information system and the hospital discharge register. Nursing diagnoses with prevalence higher or equal to 20% were considered as 'high frequency.' Nursing diagnoses with statistically significant relationships with either higher mortality or length of stay were considered as 'high risk.' The high-frequency/high-risk category of nursing diagnoses was identified. Results The sample included 2283 patients. A mean of 4·5 nursing diagnoses per patient was identified; this number showed a statistically significant difference among inpatient units and medical diagnoses. Six nursing diagnoses were classified as high frequency/high risk. Nursing diagnoses were not correlated with patient gender and age. A statistically significant perfect linear association (Spearman's correlation coefficient) was observed between the number of nursing diagnoses and both the length of stay and the mortality rate. Conclusion Nursing complexity, as described by nursing diagnoses, was shown to be associated with length of stay and mortality.

As a result of these advancements, there is a ""graying"" phenomenon within the global MS population and a demographic shift of the aging landscape. While these advancements are exciting, there also concerns and unknowns regarding what it is like to age with MS. Objectives: The objectives of this research were to explore the experiences of aging in conjunction with having MS, and the different ways persons older than 60 with MS interpreted this phenomenon. Methods: Semistructured interviews with 40 persons with MS older than 60 years were conducted. Thereafter data were subject to a pluralistic analysis approach utilizing phenomenological and narrative traditions. Results: This research highlighted the complexity of aging with MS and the various ways persons older than 60 with MS experience and interpret this phenomenon. Most participants experienced a continued progression of physical and cognitive deficits, however aging narratives and what is culturally expected as a person older than 60 allowed for positive interpretations of this stage of life. For example, participants diagnosed in early adulthood stated having health problems was ""normal"" over 60, resulting in a sense of belonging that they had not experienced since being diagnosed. Some participants also perceived they were aging more successfully than peers without MS as they had engaged in healthenhancing behaviors from an earlier age, while others believed they had ""aged out"" of MS and were experiencing a peak of health and wellness. Participants who were diagnosed in middle age, however, noted a sharp progression of age-related and MS symptoms, but stated ""everyone has something"" and perceived the diagnosis of MS was less impactful in older age with regards to what is expected at this life stage. Concerns remained, however, regarding whether a new physical or cognitive experience was aging or MS, what the future holds regarding losing independence, losing spouses and caregivers, and growing ""too old"" such that quality of life is completely diminished. Conclusions: This qualitative research has highlighted the complexity of aging with MS. All participants noted a continued progression of health, physical function, and cognitive ability but stated that they felt a sense of normality and were living a life that culturally aligned with aging narratives. Fears about the future do remain as participants were concerned about living too long for being able to thrive.

239,240,"Geriatric Syndromes: Clinical, Research, And Policy Implications Of A Core Geriatric Concept.","inouye,sk","Geriatricians have embraced the term 'geriatric syndrome,' using it extensively to highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors-older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility-were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.",2007,0,2,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01156.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106115914&site=ehost-live
236,237,Frailty And Impaired Cardiac Autonomic Control: New Insights From Principal Components Aggregation Of Traditional Heart Rate Variability Indices.,"varadhan,r","Background: Age-related deterioration in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms leads to decreased complexity in their output. For example, the degradation of cardiac autonomic control results in loss of complexity in the heart rate signal. Frailty is a state of critically impaired homeostasis that results in heightened vulnerability to stressors. We propose a new measure of heart rate variability (HRV) to capture the impairment in cardiac autonomic control associated with frailty.Methods: Traditional time and frequency domain indices of HRV were obtained from 2-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 276 women (65-101 years old) in the Women's Health and Aging Study-I. Principal components analysis was conducted on the correlation matrix of HRV indices. Frailty was defined using a validated instrument. Regression models were used to evaluate associations of HRV measures with age, frailty, and 5-year mortality.Results: The first two principal components (PCs), PC1 and PC2, explained 90% of the variance in HRV indices. PC1 is the mean of log-transformed HRV indices. PC2 is a linear combination of log-transformed indices, with positive weights for very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), and negative weights for high frequency (HF), root-mean-squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and proportion of all N-N intervals that are larger than 50 ms (pNN50). Decreases in SDNN, VLF, LF, and LF/HF were associated with an increased risk of frailty. PC2 was more strongly associated with age (beta = -.23, p < .001) and frailty (beta = -.73, p < 10(-5)) than were the individual HRV indices and LF/HF. PC2 was also the best predictor of 5-year mortality (beta = -.60, p < 10(-6)).Conclusions: Cardiac autonomic control, as reflected by HRV, is impaired in frailty. A new measure derived from PC aggregation of traditional HRV indices provides a compact summary of this impairment.",2009,0,2,10.1093/gerona/glp013,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105527073&site=ehost-live
234,235,Nonlinear Multisystem Physiological Dysregulation Associated With Frailty In Older Women: Implications For Etiology And Treatment.,"fried,lp","Background: Frailty in older adults, defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms, is associated with abnormal levels in individual physiological systems. We tested the hypothesis that it is the critical mass of physiological systems abnormal that is associated with frailty, over and above the status of each individual system, and that the relationship is nonlinear.Methods: Using data on women aged 70-79 years from the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and II, multiple analytic approaches assessed the cross-sectional association of frailty with eight physiological measures.Results: Abnormality in each system (anemia, inflammation, insulin-like growth factor-1, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, hemoglobin A1c, micronutrients, adiposity, and fine motor speed) was significantly associated with frailty status. However, adjusting for the level of each system measure, the mean number of systems impaired significantly and nonlinearly predicted frailty. Those with three or more systems impaired were most likely to be frail, with odds of frailty increasing with number of systems at abnormal level, from odds ratios (ORs) of 4.8 to 11 to 26 for those with one to two, three to four, and five or more systems abnormal (p < .05 for all). Finally, two subgroups were identified, one with isolated or no systems abnormal and a second (in 30%) with multiple systems abnormal. The latter group was independently associated with being frail (OR = 2.6, p < .05), adjusting for confounders and chronic diseases and then controlling for individual systems.Conclusions: Overall, these findings indicate that the likelihood of frailty increases nonlinearly in relationship to the number of physiological systems abnormal, and the number of abnormal systems is more predictive than the individual abnormal system. These findings support theories that aggregate loss of complexity, with aging, in physiological systems is an important cause of frailty. Implications are that a threshold loss of complexity, as indicated by number of systems abnormal, may undermine homeostatic adaptive capacity, leading to the development of frailty and its associated risk for subsequent adverse outcomes. It further suggests that replacement of any one deficient system may not be sufficient to prevent or ameliorate frailty.",2009,0,2,10.1093/gerona/glp076,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105423158&site=ehost-live
226,227,Considerations In The Surgical Management Of Ovarian Cancer In The Elderly.,"langstraat,c","Elderly patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer present a complex treatment dilemma. On the one hand, patients can be treated with primary debulking surgery to achieve the ideal oncologic outcomes but at the expense of risk of surgical morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, they can be treated with alternative, less morbid approaches, reducing toxicity, but sacrificing the survival benefits of low residual disease by surgical cytoreduction. Retrospective studies have attempted to identify risk factors for poor surgical outcome. Although there is no consensus to define ""elderly"" or ""frail,"" current evidence identifies age, performance status, nutritional status, and surgical complexity as major risk factors for surgical morbidity. Accepting the shortcomings of these retrospective data, candidates for primary debulking surgery can be assessed for risk of surgical morbidity. Age is likely a contributor to morbidity, particularly in the face of comorbid conditions. Clinicians should strive to treat elderly patients with a standard approach of primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy when healthy and in the absence of other risk factors. Elderly patients with the following are poor surgical candidates and an alternative treatment approach should be considered: poor nutritional status (characterized by serum albumin <3.0 g/dL), or poor performance status (ASA ≥3), and stage IV disease. Several of these factors are modifiable by treating the underlying cancer. These patients should be treated with two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and reassessed for surgical debulking. Patients with improvement in their nutritional or performance status can undergo interval debulking with the goal to resect all visible disease.",2013,0,2,10.1007/s11864-012-0216-2,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104312468&site=ehost-live

Existing definitional ambiguities of PF and sarcopenia, together with their complex underlying pathophysiology, also account for the absence of robust biomarkers that can be used for screening, diagnostic and/or prognostication purposes. This review provides an overview of currently available biological markers for PF and sarcopenia, as well as a critical appraisal of strengths and weaknesses of traditional procedures for biomarker development in the field. A novel approach for biomarker identification and validation, based on multivariate methodologies, is also discussed. This strategy relies on the multidimensional modeling of complementary biomarkers to cope with the phenotypical and pathophysiological complexity of PF and sarcopenia.

It is important to understand how this complexity affects acute outcomes for admission to hospital. We validated a frailty index using routine admission laboratory tests with outcomes after patients were admitted to hospital.Methods: In a prospective cohort of older adults admitted to a large tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom, we created a frailty index from routine admission laboratory investigations (FI-Laboratory) linked to data comprising hospital outcomes. We evaluated the association between the FI-Laboratory and total days spent in hospital, discharge to a higher level of care, readmission and mortality.Results: Of 2552 admissions among 1750 older adults, we were able to generate FI-Laboratory values for 2254 admissions (88.3% of the cohort). More than half of admitted patients were women (55.3%) and the mean age was 84.6 (SD 14.0) years. We found that the FI-Laboratory correlated weakly with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS; r2 = 0.09). An increase in the CFS and the equivalent of 3 additional abnormal laboratory test results in the FI-Laboratory, respectively, were associated with an increased proportion of inpatient days (rate ratios [RRs] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.52; and 1.47, 95% CI 1.41-1.54), discharge to a higher level of care (odd ratios [ORs] 1.39, 95% CI 1.27-1.52; and 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.47) and increased readmission rate (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.37; and 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.26). Increases in the CFS and FI-Laboratory were associated with increased mortality HRs of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28-1.51) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.37-1.54), respectively.Interpretation: We determined that FI-Laboratory, distinct from baseline frailty, could be used to predict risk of many adverse outcomes.

176,177,Predictors Of Elders' And Family Caregivers' Use Of Formal Home Services.,"houde,sc","OBJECTIVE: This study builds on previous research by constructing a model that tests many of the characteristics that have been found to be important predictors of formal service utilization in the past. Additional characteristics that have the potential to improve the model were tested, including care recipient characteristics, characteristics of the family caregiver, and the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient. DESIGN: Secondary analysis, logistic regression. SETTING: Survey. POPULATION: The sample used for this study was derived from the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey. This survey was the third round of a national sample of people over age 65 with functional impairments. The criterion for caregiver/care recipient dyads to be included in the sample was that the primary caregiver had to be a family member who was not paid for caregiving. The majority of the care recipients in the study were women, with ages ranging from 65 to 106 years. Seventy-two percent of the caregivers resided with the care recipient. INTERVENTIONS: The questionnaire for the survey included a screening section, a community survey, an institutional survey, and an informal caregivers questionnaire. Interviews were completed on 4,463 elders residing in the community, with 1,006 of their informal caregivers completing the informal caregivers survey portion of the interview. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of formal service utilization in the home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Eight care recipient variables were important predictors of formal care in the home. Limitations in ADLs, as expected, emerged as an important predictor, with elders having a 1.5 increased odds of utilizing formal services for each limitation in ADL. Living arrangement was an important predictor of formal care; elders who lived in elderly housing had a 3.5 times greater odds of utilizing formal services than those who did not. Other care recipient variables that had a significant positive effect on the utilization of formal services included increasing age, being female, and whether or not the elder had been hospitalized within the past year. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study help to define the complexity of predicting formal home service utilization by family caregivers and care recipients. Clearly, the most important characteristics to consider are those related to the care recipient, but characteristics of the caregiver also are important. It is interesting to note that medical diagnoses, physical impairments, and use of assistive devices had no effect on the use of formal care. Further research is needed to improve the model of formal service use presented. Despite changes that have occurred in the health care delivery system since these data were collected in 1989, the characteristics of caregivers and elder care recipients are not expected to have changed drastically since that time. Future efforts should be focused on identifying additional characteristics of the caregiver and care recipient, as well as descriptors that better capture the complexity of the family relationship, for the purpose of improving the model.

Patients were four elderly stomized people, three women and one man, interviewed at their homes. RESULTS: The importance of family support, friend/neighbor network, stomatherapy service with its workers/interns of other stomized people in the care for elderly stomized people became evident. Although the Basic Health Unit is the entry door for the Single Health System service, the subjects of this study sought care for their health needs in the hospital itself. CONCLUSION: The social network of support reveals itself through relationships and interactions inserted in the complex social system.

A Case Of Secondary Hypertension In A Very Old Patient.,"turco,r","The clinical approach toward elderly patients is often very complex and associated with an increased risk of medical errors. This case report is an example of how various objective (related to patient) and subjective (related to physicians) factors may influence the optimal diagnostic approach in elderly frail patients. We also discuss geriatric practice, which must be characterized by the intellectual honesty to refuse any sort of prejudices (such as ageism) and by the skill to navigate between the Scylla (ie, viewing clinical problems as unrelated to each other) and the Charibdy (ie, applying the Occam's razor principle) of the patient's complexity.",2009,1,2,10.1016/j.jamda.2009.01.005,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105354565&site=ehost-live
108,109,A Narrative Care Approach For Persons Living With Dementia In Institutional Care Settings.,"berendonk,charlotte","Aims and objectives: We will provide insights in the theoretical background and key concepts of a Narrative Care approach, such as narrative cultures, narrative curiosity, narrative co‐composition and narrative reflective practice. Background: Care understood as narrative practice underscores the importance of experiences and how these shape identities. Important to the quality of care in institutional care settings is the ability of care providers to cope with complexities and uncertainties in older adults' stories, which can be realised by attending to ways that foster and co‐compose evolving and forward‐looking narratives. Recognising these ongoing co‐compositions means that persons living in institutional care settings and care providers live, tell, retell and relive their experiences. A change in the current institutional culture is necessary to implement care as narrative practice. To support such a change, approaches are needed that foster a focus on experiences and relationships and make relational ethics central to care. Methods: The proposed Narrative Care approach is the result of an iterative development process involving a literature review, interviews with, and observations of, care providers, dialogues with an advisory committee, and consultation with experts. Main contributions: The proposed Narrative Care approach aims to help care providers (a) to recognise the importance of curiosity in a person's verbal and embodied narratives—especially for those living with dementia; (b) to take note of individual experiences in all of their complexity and uncertainty; (c) to respect these narratives; (d) to open up spaces to co‐compose new narratives; and (e) to allow care providers to engage in narrative reflective practices that shape who they are and are becoming. Conclusion: The introduced approach responds to the need of implementing strategies to think and work narratively in institutional care settings. Implications for practice: Narrative Care has the potential to reshape task‐oriented, technical notions of care. Concepts such as embodied narratives, relational ethics, narrative co‐composition and narrative reflective practice must be integrated in the education of all care providers.",2020,0,2,10.1111/opn.12278,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141629066&site=ehost-live
159,160,Measurement Properties Of The Groningen Frailty Indicator In Home-Dwelling And Institutionalized Elderly People,"peters,lilian.l","Abstract: Objectives: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (<4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.",2012,0,2,10.1016/j.jamda.2012.04.007,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=77453182&site=ehost-live
49,50,Complexity In Geriatric Home Healthcare.,"murtaugh,c",The aging population and the associated rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions suggest that the home health population is increasingly complex and challenging to manage. The purpose of this study was to use national administrative data (Outcome and Assessment Information Set assessments of persons discharged in 2004 and 2005) to examine the clinical complexity of older adults admitted to home healthcare. Our descriptive analyses confirm that multiple chronic conditions and cognitive impairment are common and result in longer lengths of stay. The findings support the need for geriatric home healthcare practices that effectively address multiple morbidities and cognitive function.,2009,1,2,10.1111/j.1945-1474.2009.00017.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105536778&site=ehost-live
65,66,A Holistic Approach To The Promotion Of Older Hospital Patients' Health.,"berg,gv","PURPOSE: To describe how nurses interpreted health promotion related to older patients in a medical hospital ward and the presuppositions for this work. METHODS: The study had a descriptive and explorative design. Data were created through participant observation of five nurses and informal dialogues with four nurses working in an infection unit in a small hospital in Norway. The nurses where followed during a period of 6 months. The observations and dialogues were interpreted and transformed into text. This text was analysed with qualitative content analysis and interpreted hermeneutically on three levels: (1) reading the text to get an overview of the themes; (2) systematically separating central patterns; and (3) highlighting the patterns with examples. FINDINGS: The nurses' interpretation of health promotion was closely connected to their interpretation of health and holistic nursing. Two main aspects were uncovered in the informal dialogues: a biomedically oriented nursing view and a holistically oriented nursing view. The observations showed that presuppositions, such as waiting for something or somebody, constantly changing situations, complexity and diversity in patient cases, influenced the nurses' work in general and also their focus on health promotion. The nurses balanced between the biomedical and the holistic approach. It seemed to be important for the nurses to be the masters of walking on a tightrope and to have professional clinical competence. CONCLUSION: It was difficult to find a clear focus on health promotion. The most visible focus was on diagnosis and treatment, while the more complex and comprehensive situations related to health promotion of older patients seemed to be underprioritized. The phenomenon of 'waiting' may be an important issue for further research.",2005,0,2,10.1111/j.1466-7657.2004.00264.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106634914&site=ehost-live
27,28,Undergraduate Nurse Attitudes Toward Older Adults And Perceptions Of Working With Older Adults: An Analysis Of Measurement Instruments.,"neville,christine","Summary Background An undergraduate nurse's attitude toward older adults or their perception of working with older adults can influence the quality of care provided and their career choice, respectively. As such, it is important to conduct research that contributes to the evaluation of attitudes and perceptions. In the conduct of comprehensive and rigorous research, it is necessary to make the right choice of an instrument to measure outcomes. The identification of a valid and reliable instrument to suit a specific research question is a complex process. Objective In order to deal with this complexity, this paper reviews instruments that have been used to measure undergraduate nurse attitudes toward older adults and their perceptions of working with older adults. Data Sources Data were sourced from Medline, CINAHL, Healthsource/Academic Edition, PsycINFO and PubMed for the years 2008–2013. Results Eight readily available instruments were identified and their characteristics analyzed for their purpose, number of items, design, reliability and validity. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the instruments and recent use are also discussed. Conclusion The choice of a suitable instrument is likely to be critical to the testing of intervention strategies such as curriculum activities, which target attitude improvements to enhance the quality and effectiveness of nursing care provided to older adults.",2015,0,2,10.1016/j.nedt.2014.09.001,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103859963&site=ehost-live
32,33,Nurses' Ethical Reasoning In Cases Of Physical Restraint In Acute Elderly Care: A Qualitative Study.,"goethals,sabine","In their practice, nurses make daily decisions that are ethically informed. An ethical decision is the result of a complex reasoning process based on knowledge and experience and driven by ethical values. Especially in acute elderly care and more specifically decisions concerning the use of physical restraint require a thoughtful deliberation of the different values at stake. Qualitative evidence concerning nurses' decision-making in cases of physical restraint provided important insights in the complexity of decision-making as a trajectory. However a nuanced and refined understanding of the reasoning process in terms of ethical values is still lacking. A qualitative interview design, inspired by the Grounded Theory approach, was carried out to explore nurses' reasoning process in terms of ethical values. We interviewed 21 acute geriatric nurses from 12 hospitals in different regions in Flanders, Belgium in the period October 2009-April 2011. The Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven was used to analyse interview data. Nurses' decision-making is characterized as an ethical deliberation process where different values are identified and where the process of balancing these values forms the essence of ethical deliberation. Ethical decision-making in cases of physical restraint implies that nurses have to choose which values receive priority in the process, which entails that not all values can be respected to the same degree. As a result, decision making can be experienced as difficult, even as a dilemma. Driven by the overwhelming goal of protecting physical integrity, nurses took into account the values of dignity and justice more implicitly and less dominantly.",2013,0,2,10.1007/s11019-012-9455-z,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103808504&site=ehost-live

Thirty-one international experts, identified through literature and our professional network, participated in a two-round web-based survey and an expert meeting. Experts reached consensus on 16 desirable competencies, including some not traditionally associated with nursing expertise e.g. being a team leader, role model and coach within the nursing team. These findings suggest that revision of current nursing curricula, nurse training programs and nursing home job profiles might be needed to meet the medically and psychologically complex needs of nursing home residents.",2015,0,2,10.1016/j.gerinurse.2015.06.012,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=112050766&site=ehost-live
21,22,Nursing Home Nurses' Perceptions Of Emergency Transfers From Nursing Homes To Hospital: A Review Of Qualitative Studies Using Systematic Methods.,"o'neill,barbara","The aim is to describe nursing home nurses' perceptions around emergency transfers to hospital. Transfers are costly and traumatic for residents, and efforts are underway to avoid hospitalization. Nurses play a key role in transfers, yet their views are underreported. A systematic review of qualitative studies was undertaken, guided by Joanna Briggs Institute methods. From seven reviewed studies, it was clear nursing home nurses are challenged by the complexity of the transfer process and understand their need for appropriate clinical knowledge, skills and resources. Communication is important, yet nurses often use persuasive and targeted communication. Ambiguity, strained relationships and negative perceptions of residents' experiences around hospitalization contribute to conflict and uncertainty. Nurses are more confident when there is a plan. Transferring a resident is a complex process and special skills, knowledge and resources are required, but may be lacking. Efforts to formalize the transfer process and improve communication and collaboration amongst all stakeholders is needed and would be well received.",2015,0,2,10.1016/j.gerinurse.2015.06.001,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=112050764&site=ehost-live
93,94,Challenges Of Nursing Research With The Frail Elderly.,"phillips,lr","The complexities and challenges of conducting nursing research with the frail elderly have been poorly identified in the nursing literature. This literature examines geriatric research issues but fails to examine issues involved in doing field research with any special population, including the frail elderly. In-depth consideration of the special problems associated with studying the elderly generally, or the frail elderly specifically, are omitted. These two groups differ based on extent of functional impairment. Due to market constraints, a specialized text on gerontological nursing research simply does not exist. Although some articles about doing nursing research with frail elders exist, the issues raised in these articles are limited. The most popular issues in the nursing literature about doing research with the elderly have related to ethics (e.g., Archbold, 1981; Davis, 1981; Wolanin, 1980, 1984). Although ethical issues are important, knowledge of ethics does not solve the complex, practical problems of formulating conceptualizations and designing measures and procedures for studying the frail elderly.",1992,0,2,10.1177/019394599201400604,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107459214&site=ehost-live

Early definitions of abuse, however, oversimplified the phenomena and while the complexity of elder abuse, in nature and scale, has also been growing recently there remains some confusion conceptually and in practice in terms of what is meant by and can be identified as abusive practice. The lack of conceptual clarity is evident across professional and agency boundaries. The authors suggest that a potential way forward is through the development of interprofessional learning as an integral part of education and training in respect of safeguarding older adults.

18,19,Measuring The Impact Of Informal Elderly Caregiving: A Systematic Review Of Tools.,"mosquera,isabel","Purpose: To classify and identify the main characteristics of the tools used in practice to assess the impact of elderly caregiving on the informal carers' life.Methods: A systematic review of literature was performed searching in Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, IBECS, LILACS, SiiS, SSCI and Cochrane Library from 2009 to 2013 in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, and in reference lists of included papers.Results: The review included 79 studies, among them several in languages other than English. Their inclusion increased the variety of identified tools to measure this impact (n = 93) and allowed a wider analysis of their geographical use. While confirming their overlapping nature, instruments were classified according to the degree of integration of dimensions they evaluated and their specificity to the caregiving process: caregiver burden (n = 20), quality of life and well-being (n = 11), management and coping (n = 21), emotional and mental health (n = 29), psychosocial impact (n = 10), physical health and healthy habits (n = 2), and other measures. A high use in practice of tools not validated yet and not caregiver-specific was identified.Conclusions: The great variety and characteristics of instruments identified in this review confirm the complexity and multidimensionality of the effects of elderly caregiving on the informal carer's life and explain the difficulties to assess these effects in practice. According to the classification provided, caregiver burden and emotional and mental health are the most evaluated dimensions. However, further work is required to develop integrated and caregiving focused procedures that can appraise this complexity across different countries and cultures.",2016,0,2,10.1007/s11136-015-1159-4,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=114713760&site=ehost-live
83,84,Breaking The Silence: Marginalisation Of Registered Nurses Employed In Nursing Homes.,"hall,mm","This paper reports on a study which employed auto/biography as a research method to expose the marginalisation and discrimination experienced by Registered Nurses (RN) employed in the nursing home sector. By virtue of their area of practice, these nurses are frequently perceived by the wider nursing community and society at large to be deskilled and not competent. A critical incident from my story is recounted and thereafter discussed from a personal perspective and within a wider context of nursing and related literature. I argue that the complexity of clinical practice in a nursing home means that RNs are no less skilled or competent than RNs in other clinical settings. However, marginalisation and discrimination occur because nurses and nursing are not isolated from the values and beliefs of society. This is a society which under values caring and nurturing and places a higher value on complex technologies with an emphasis on cure being the dominant ideology.

16,17,Management Of Long-Term Conditions And Dementia: The Role Of The Admiral Nurse.,"knight,cathy","As life expectancy increases so people often develop a range of conditions and disabilities in the years before death. Multimorbidity represents the most common 'disease pattern' found among the elderly and is characterised by complex interactions of co-existing diseases where a medical approach focused on a single disease does not suffice. People with dementia who also have other comorbidities do not always have their comorbid conditions managed as those without dementia which often lead to a high number of hospital admissions with longer lengths of stay and greater treatment costs. This case study presents the case management approach taken by Admiral Nursing in managing the complexities where there is comorbidity of a long-term condition and a diagnosis of dementia. By empowering the person and their carer with information and choices and through good case management and communication, people can be supported to live well and avoid inappropriate hospital admissions.",2017,0,2,10.12968/bjcn.2017.22.6.295,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=123429175&site=ehost-live
53,54,Supporting Quality Improvement In Care Homes For Older People: The Contribution Of Primary Care Nurses.,"davies,s","Aims This paper discusses how health and social care can work together collaboratively to improve the quality of care for older people resident in care homes, using Essence of Care benchmarking as an example. Background There is an increasing interest in how care is provided in care homes, including its impact on quality-of-life and end-of-life care. Care standards and government policy have emphasized the need for primary care to work more closely with care home staff. Evaluation The available evidence on older people's health care needs, and how primary health care and nursing work in care homes was evaluated. Case studies and descriptive reports on Essence of Care benchmarking were also used to identify the facilitators and barriers to using it as a means to improve the quality of care for older people in care homes. Key issues The key issues relate to the differences in the working cultures of health and social care, and the complex health care needs of older people living in care homes that do not have onsite nursing support. Conclusions Structured tools such as benchmarking can potentially be used to improve the quality of care for older people in care homes, but care home staff need adequate support to adapt this approach to their working environment. Implications for nursing management Primary care nurses need to be more proactive in the way that they work with older people in care homes. Structured tools such as benchmarking can help them to recognize the range and complexity of resident's health needs, and work with care home staff in ways that acknowledge their expertise and improve the overall care of older people in these settings.",2008,0,2,10.1111/j.1365-2834.2007.00838.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105732519&site=ehost-live
58,59,Postoperative Pain In Older People: A Review Of The Literature.,"prowse,m","Aims and objectives. The literature review was conducted to explore those factors which complicate pain management in older people to inform future research, education and nursing practice in this area. Background. Acute pain management in hospitalized older people is complex because of the physiological changes of ageing, pharmacological factors and under-representation of this patient group in reported research about assessing acute pain. Methods. A review of the literature was undertaken using electronic databases and specified search terms, some hand searching was also used and included the grey literature, textbooks and conference proceedings. A computerized literature search was carried out using CINAHL, Bandolier, Cochrane, Medline, the British Nursing Index and the International Association for the Study of Pain website for the period 1992-2004. The search terms were acute pain, older people, elder care, pain assessment and acute pain services. Thirty-seven research-based reviews and published studies and 17 policy documents were included. Conclusions. Managing acute pain well in older adults involves understanding the influence of a series of integrated factors: attitudes and beliefs, physiological ageing processes, pharmacological factors and the social construction of the older person in healthcare contexts. Relevance to clinical practice. This review offers new insight into those factors which, taken together, add complexity to managing acute pain in older people well. Moreover, nurses are the professional group mainly responsible for assessing pain, administering and now prescribing analgesia and evaluating the quality of pain relief in older people.

47,48,Assessment Of Capacity For Medical Decision Making.,"carroll,dw","Determination of a patient's capacity for medical decision making can be simple or complex, depending on the issue being considered; likewise, the degree of capacity required to make decisions varies with the complexity of the situation. A capacity examination is a focused and impartial evaluation of mental status and medical, surgical, psychiatric, and psychosocial histories. The examination is composed of several basic steps, beginning with an assessment of the patient's ability to communicate, followed by determination of his or her understanding of the proposed care, followed by the patient's rationale for decisions about that care. When a patient is deemed to lack capacity, mechanisms should be in place to ensure the patient receives the care needed.

The aim of this study was to describe emergent approaches to integrated care for older people with complex care needs and investigate the viability of measuring integrated care. Methods. A case study approach was used. Sites were recruited following discussion with senior staff in health and social care agencies. Service arrangements were categorised using a framework developed by the researchers. To investigate joint working within the sites, the development model for integrated care was adapted and administered to the manager of each service. Data were collected in 2018. Results. Six case study sites were recruited illustrating adult social care services partnerships in services for older people with home care providers, mental health and community nursing services. Most were established in 2018. Service arrangements were characterised by joint assessment and informal face-to-face discussions between staff. The development of an infrastructure to promote partnership working was evident between adult social care and each of the other services and most developed with home care providers. There was little evidence of a sequential approach to the development of integrated working practices. Conclusion. Components of partnerships promoting integrated care have been highlighted and understanding of the complexity of measuring integrated care enhanced.

100,101,Factors Influencing Management Of Agitation In Aged Care Facilities: A Qualitative Study Of Staff Perceptions.,"watson,karen","Background: Agitation in older people is commonly associated with cognitive decline, complex medical diagnoses and polypharmacy. Impaired communication and comprehension within a dementia trajectory adds complexity to assessment and management. Despite high prevalence, agitated behaviours remain challenging to manage in residential aged care settings. Aim: To explore staff perceptions of agitation in residents of aged care facilities, including the influence of dementia, when selecting management strategies to reduce agitated behaviour. Design: Qualitative descriptive. Methods: Semi‐structured interviews with 11 aged care staff were conducted at two aged care sites. Transcripts were examined using content analysis to identify common issues and categories. The study complied with COREQ guidelines (see. Appendix S1). Results: Participants reported managing resident agitation at least once per shift; most frequently manifesting as wandering, restlessness or aggression. Management strategies included distraction, providing space, knowing the resident, identifying causative factors, spending individual time and if necessary medication administration. Agitation management was more challenging for residents with dementia due to impaired communication or comprehension of instruction. Conclusions: While participants strived to deliver individualized person‐centred care, this was difficult given time and resource constraints. Contemporary management of agitation therefore remains variable in everyday practice, with resident preference used when causative factors were known. Conversely, for residents with impaired communication and/or comprehension, distraction and chemical restraint were commonly used. Nuanced education for assessment and management is recommended to better address this unmet need for some residents. Relevance to clinical practice: For optimal care, appropriate allocation of time and resources is necessary to identify causative and contextual factors for individual residents. Recommendations are for additional staff training in communication and attitude, and collaborating with frontline staff to develop a practical guide for management of agitation in aged care. These simple initiatives may help to improve consistency of care delivery and resident outcomes.",2021,0,2,10.1111/jocn.15530,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=148500701&site=ehost-live
7,8,Caring For The Older Person With Cognitive Impairment In Hospital: Qualitative Analysis Of Nursing Personnel Reflections On Fall Events.,"grealish,laurie","Aims and objectives: To explore nurse and nursing assistant reflections on the care of older patients with cognitive impairment who have experienced a fall. Background: While there are evidence‐based clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of falls and for the care of older people with cognitive impairment, the falls rates for older people with cognitive impairment are three times as high as those without. Design: Critical incident technique. Methods: Eleven registered and two enrolled nurses and four assistants in nursing working in one subacute and two acute wards within two hospitals of a tertiary level health service in south‐east Queensland. Individual semistructured interviews focused on two past events when a patient with cognitive impairment had fallen in hospital: one when there was minimal harm and the second when there was significant harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken. The COREQ checklist was followed. Results: Three themes emerged from 23 reflective accounts of fall events: ""direct observation is confounded by multiple observers"" and ""knowing the person has cognitive impairment is not enough,"" and ""want to rely on the guideline but unsure how to enact it."" While participants were aware of the falls prevention policy and techniques available to prevent falls, the implementation of these was challenging due to the complexity of care required by the older person with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Falls prevention for older people with cognitive impairment is complex and belies the simple application of policy. Relevance to clinical practice: To reduce falls, nurses can involve the family to support ""knowing the patient"" to enable prediction of impulsive actions; shift the focus of in‐service from lectures to specific case presentations, with collaborative analysis on person‐focused strategies to prevent falls in older people with cognitive impairment; and reconsider the sitter role from simple observer to assistant, focused on ambulation and supporting independence in activities of daily living.",2019,0,2,10.1111/jocn.14724,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=135199418&site=ehost-live
101,102,An Exploration Of Knowledge Of Students And Staff At Residential Aged Care Facilities And Implications For Nursing Education.,"parker,cn","Advances in healthcare have contributed to population longevity with many older adults living with complex comorbidities, including those in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Nursing staff require knowledge of gerontology, normal ageing processes and expected physiological, psychosocial, function and cognitive changes in addition to health promotion in order to provide individualised care. The complexity inherent in the medical, palliative and basic care needs of the residents makes RACFs excellent places for learning for undergraduate student nurses who undertake clinical placement as part of a Bachelor of Nursing course. Previous research has identified that knowledge of care staff is relatively poor. To explore the knowledge and misconceptions of ageing among first year undergraduate nursing students and aged care staff facilitating a placement during a clinical learning experience. Descriptive cross-sectional design. Three clinical RACFs in Australia. First year nursing students and staff of three different RACFs. Pre and post-test clinical placement surveys. Students and staff completed Palmore's Facts on Ageing Quiz, a 25-item tool to assess knowledge and attitudes of ageing, before commencing the clinical placement and on the last day of a two week placement. Physiological questions were answered correctly. A knowledge deficit was evident from a sociological perspective. Negative attitudes have been found to devalue care and can directly affect the quality of practice in an undesirable way, forming a barrier to effective and therapeutic relationships with older adults, potentially impacting on patient care. From an education provider perspective, the inclusion of activities to enrich the learning activities of nurses within RACF- inclusive of reflective activities and guidance from an expert clinical facilitator - may assist in dispelling negative attitudes and stereotypes of the older adult and increase recognition of the value of working with older adults. • Misconceptions of the older adult were related to sociological aspects of ageing. • Stereotyping older adults devalues care and affects the quality of practice. • Education should focus on learning strategies that promote a positive view of the older adult.",2021,0,2,10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104639,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=147202408&site=ehost-live
248,249,Satisfaction With The Care-Managed Support Of Older People: An Empirical Analysis.,"chesterman,j","Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in monitoring some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer perceptions and experiences of services and involvement of users/carers in assessment and review. Using data from the study Evaluating Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales receiving community care services, this investigation examines three crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction. This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need to be aware of both the potential and pitfalls associated with using them as a means of assessing the quality of social services for older people.",2001,0,1,10.1046/j.1365-2524.2001.00280.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107077303&site=ehost-live

Using a critical ethnographic design, data were collected through participant observation and interviews from consumers in acute care settings who were over 70 years old and nurses who were caring from them. Thematic analysis identified that older people equated participation with being independent. Importantly, consumers highlighted the complexity of the notion of participation when describing situations where they were unable to participate in their own care. The difficulties in communicating with health professionals and an inability to administer their own medications in inpatient settings were identified as barriers to participation.

57,58,A Systematic Review Of Predictors And Screening Instruments To Identify Older Hospitalized Patients At Risk For Functional Decline.,"hoogerduijn,jg","Aims and objectives. To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated. Background. Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on health-care costs is also high. Results. Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described. Conclusion. These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. Relevance to clinical practice. Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.",2007,0,1,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01579.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106247567&site=ehost-live

One woman had a massive tumor on her occipital scalp; the other was in renal failure. The obstacles and complexities of providing care to those with double jeopardy--being elderly and homeless--are described. There are enormous difficulties for placement into safe, supportive housing once people become homeless. The process is expensive and labor intensive. This can be complicated by the existence of mental illness. A New York agency that works with mentally ill homeless people is described. There are systemic obstacles as well: One woman loses her Medicaid when she moves from one state to another to be closer to her family.

"".","boockvar,ks","Frailty in older adults is increasingly a recognized syndrome of decline, sometimes subtle, in function and health that may be amenable to available approaches to care. Frailty manifests the following core clinical features: loss of strength, weight loss, low levels of activity, poor endurance or fatigue, and slowed performance. The presence of 3 or more of these features is associated with adverse outcomes including falls, new or worsened function impairment, hospitalization, and death. In this article, we use the case of Mrs K to describe the challenges of recognizing frailty in clinical practice, common problems and symptoms that frail older adults experience, and approaches to these issues that clinicians may incorporate into their practices. We discuss the importance of advance care planning, provider-patient communication, and appropriate palliative care and hospice referral for frail older adults. Frailty is associated with symptomatic long-term disease, decline in function, and abbreviated survival. Therefore, when frailty is severe, delivery of palliative care focused on relief of discomfort and enhancement of quality of life is highly appropriate. The application of multidisciplinary, team-based palliative approaches and of up-to-date geriatrics knowledge is beneficial for treating these patients because of the complexity of their coexisting social, psychological, and medical needs.",2006,0,1,10.1001/jama.296.18.2245,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106267283&site=ehost-live

However, we know little about their psychosocial experiences and their needs for support in managing MCC. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of caregivers of older adults living in the community with MCC. Methods: This qualitative study was a secondary analysis of previously collected data from caregivers in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Participants included caregivers of older adults (65 years and older) with three or more chronic conditions. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using Thorne's interpretive description approach. Results: Most of the 47 caregiver participants were female (76.6%), aged 65 years of age or older (61.7%), married (87.2%) and were spouses to the care recipient (68.1%). Caregivers' experiences of caring for community-living older adults with MCC were complex and included: (a) dealing with the demands of caregiving; (b) prioritizing chronic conditions; (c) living with my own health limitations; (d) feeling socially isolated and constrained; (e) remaining committed to caring; and (f) reaping the rewards of caregiving. Conclusions: Healthcare providers can play key roles in supporting caregivers of older adults with MCC by providing education and support on managing MCC, actively engaging them in goal setting and care planning, and linking them to appropriate community health and social support services. Communities can create environments that support caregivers in areas such as social participation, social inclusion, and community support and health services.",2020,1,1,10.1177/2235042X20981190,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=147625084&site=ehost-live

55,56,Encountering The Older Confused Patient: Professional Carers' Experiences.,"stenwall,e","THE STUDY'S RATIONALE: Confusion is a common condition among older patients and often a fearful experience. Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.",2007,0,1,10.1111/j.1471-6712.2007.00505.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106013528&site=ehost-live
59,60,Psychoanalytically Informed Research In An Nhs Continuing Care Unit For Older People: Exploring And Developing Staff'S Work With Complex Loss And Grief.,"holman,c","There are studies about the emotional and social aspects of loss and grief in continuing care environments such as care homes and hospital wards, but researchers have tended to focus on either the cultural aspect of the organisation or the emotional response of individuals [Holman, C., Meyer, J. & Cotter, A. (2004) 'The complexity of loss in continuing care institutions for older people: a review of the literature', Illness, Crisis and Loss, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 38-51]. This splitting in the body of knowledge misses the opportunity to examine the link between the personal and the broader public domain [Williams, S. J. & Bendelow, G.

This paper concerns the methodology and initial findings from a psychoanalytically informed research study. It was aimed deliberately at exploring the juncture between the psychological and social domains that care staff have to negotiate in order to provide care related to loss and grief in an NHS continuing care ward. The method draws heavily on the Tavistock approach to learning about emotions [Rustin, M. (2003) 'Learning about emotions: the Tavistock approach', European Journal of Psychotherapy, Counselling and Health, vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 187-208] but also adopts participant observation methods rooted in the ethnographic tradition [Fielding, N. (2001) 'Ethnography', in Researching Social Life, 2nd edn, ed. N. Gilbert, Sage Publications, London]. The study identifies the emotional demand of caring for people experiencing loss and grief in a continuing care unit and the development of a reflective group that supported practice developments in meeting these tasks. The paper will argue that research that develops an understanding of social practices underpinned by psychoanalytic perspectives can inform development in areas where staff are expected to cope with high levels of anxiety and stress.",2006,1,1,10.1080/02650530600931872,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106234159&site=ehost-live

DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. SETTING: Academic centers. PARTICIPANT:s Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. RESULTS: The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less.

In this study, the influences of clinical conditions, types of care processes, and sociodemographic characteristics on the quality of care received by vulnerable older people were evaluated. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Two senior managed care plans. Participants: Three hundred sixty-two community-dwelling patients aged 65 and older identified as vulnerable by the Vulnerable Elder Survey (VES-13). Measurements: Outcome variable: patients' observed-minus-expected overall quality score. Predictor variables: types of care processes, types and number of clinical conditions, sex, age, VES-13 score (composite score of function and self-rated health), income, education, mental health status, and number of quality indicators triggered. Results: Patients whose conditions required more history-taking, counseling, and medication-prescribing care processes and patients with diabetes mellitus received lower-than-expected quality of care. A greater number of comorbid conditions was associated with higher-than-expected quality of care. Age, sex, VES-13 score, and other sociodemographic variables were not associated with quality of care. Conclusion: Complexity, vulnerability, and age do not predispose older persons to receive poorer-quality care. In contrast, older patients whose care requires time-consuming processes such as history taking and counseling are at risk for worse quality of care and should be a target for intervention to improve care.",2005,0,1,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53520.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106374481&site=ehost-live

This scoping review identifies and synthesizes the literature into the detection of hearing and vision loss in the care home environment, and the management of these sensory losses once identified. Research Design and Methods A scoping review methodology was used to identify primary research of any design published from 1985 to September 2018. Six electronic databases were searched, and articles were also sourced from reference lists, relevant charity organizations and published experts. Results Six electronic databases and multiple gray literature sources identified 51 articles for inclusion. The evidence confirmed that lack of knowledge in care home staff, poor management of assistive aids, unsuitable environment, lack of connections with optometrists and audiologists, underuse of effective screening tools, and the added complexity of assisting those with dementia are all barriers to effective practice. Conversely, flexible training programs, availability of a variety of assistive aids, simple screening tools, and adaptions to the environment are effective facilitators. Discussion and Implication This review acknowledges that the barriers to identification and management of hearing and vision loss in care homes are multifaceted and that collaboration of multiple stakeholders is required to implement change and improve the residents' ear and eye care. Recommendations are offered to support more effective service provision tailored to meet the needs of people with sensory impairments living in care homes, and this could subsequently improve best practice.",2020,0,1,10.1093/geront/gnz087,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=142592832&site=ehost-live

213,214,Frailty And Geography: Should These Two Factors Be Added To The Abcde Contemporary Guide To Diabetes Therapy?,"maddaloni,ernesto","On the road towards personalized treatments for type 2 diabetes, we suggest here that two parameters could be added to the ABCDE algorithm, 'F' for frailty and 'G' for geography. Indeed, the progressive ageing of population is causing a simultaneous increase of frailty worldwide. The identification of the optimal therapeutic approach is often difficult in frail subjects because of the complexity of 'frailty syndrome'. Nevertheless, given the relevance of diabetes in the development and progression of frailty, a safe and effective cure of diabetes is extremely important to guarantee a good medical outcome. There are few data about diabetes treatment in this delicate category of patients, and the choice of the appropriate therapy mostly remains a challenge. Moreover, type 2 diabetes affects more than 382 million people of different countries, races and ethnicities. To face the lack of solid evidence-based medicine for the treatment of diabetes in different ethnic groups, it is extremely important to increase knowledge about the different pathophysiology of diabetes according to ethnicity. In this way, a tailored approach to treatment of various ethnic groups living in the same or different regions can eventually be developed.

214,215,Regulation Of Cardiac Autonomic Nervous System Control Across Frailty Statuses: A Systematic Review.,"parvaneh,saman","Background: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that leads to impairment in interrelated physiological systems and progressive homeostatic dysregulation in physiological systems.Objective: The focus of the present systematic review was to study the association between the activity of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) and frailty.Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov; the last search was performed in March 2015. Inclusion criteria were: (1) that the studied population was classified for frailty according to a standard definition, such as Fried's criteria; (2) that the study had a nonfrail control group, and (3) that heart rate (HR) and/or heart rate variability (HRV) were parameters of interest in the study.Results: Of the 1,544 articles screened, 54 were selected for full-text review and 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. Assessment of HRV using different standard time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear domain approaches confirmed the presence of an impaired cardiac ANS function in frail compared to nonfrail participants. Furthermore, HR changes while performing a clinical test (e.g., the seated step test or the lying-to-standing orthostatic test) were decreased in the frail group compared to the nonfrail group.Conclusions: The current systematic review provides evidence that the cardiac ANS is impaired in frail compared to nonfrail older adults, as indicated by a reduction in the complexity of HR dynamics, reduced HRV, and reduced HR changes in response to daily activities. Four out of 6 included articles recruited only female participants, and in the other 2 articles the effect of gender on impairment of cardiac ANS was insufficiently investigated. Therefore, further studies are required to study the association between cardiac ANS impairments and frailty in males. Furthermore, HRV was studied only during static postures such as sitting, or without considering the level of activity as a potential confounder. Accordingly, simultaneous measurement of both physiological (i.e., HRV) and kinematic (e.g., using wearable sensor technology) information may provide a better understanding of cardiac ANS impairments with frailty while controlling for activity.",2015,0,1,10.1159/000431285,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111505582&site=ehost-live
64,65,Caring For Older Patients At An Emergency Department -- Emergency Nurses' Reasoning.,"kihlgren,al","AIM: The aim of the study was to use the experiences of emergency nurses to illuminate what constitutes good nursing care for patients 75 years or older transferred to emergency departments. BACKGROUND: Emergency departments have a medical technical character and the number of visits there increases dramatically as people age. Older patients require increased healthcare services in terms of nursing care, interventions and hospitalizations due to an increased complexity of their problems. For these reasons it is important to study what good nursing care of the older patients consists of at an emergency department from the emergency nurses' point of view. METHOD: Ten emergency nurses from a university hospital emergency department in Sweden were interviewed. A thematic content analysis was performed. RESULTS: The study showed that it was necessary to be knowledgeable, to be understanding of the older patients' situation and to take responsibility for them in order to be able to provide good nursing care. The emergency nurses shifted focus from describing the central aspect of good nursing care to describing what hinders the provision of it. Their experience was that prioritizing medical procedures, everyday tasks and routines threatens good nursing care of older patients in emergency departments. The emergency nurses held that the older patient is often sent to an emergency department where the level of care is not appropriate to their needs. CONCLUSIONS: The result can be seen as a challenge for the organization and the nurses in the future; to prioritize differently, thereby maintaining a balance between good nursing and medical/technical tasks when treating older patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The present day healthcare system is not organized to appropriately meet the needs of the older patients. Nurses themselves hold they can better serve the older patient. By sharing their experiences, both can be accomplished.",2005,0,1,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2004.01104.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106504830&site=ehost-live

217,218,How Older People Cope With Frailty Within The Context Of Transition Care In Australia: Implications For Improving Service Delivery.,"walker,ruth","Transition care is increasingly common for older people, yet little is known about the subjective experience of the transition care 'journey' from the perspective of clients themselves. This study examines how older people cope with frailty within the context of a dedicated transition care programme and discusses implications for improving service delivery. Qualitative in-depth interviews were carried out during 2011 in the homes of 20 older people who had recently been discharged from a transition care programme operating in Adelaide, South Australia (average age 80 years, 65% female). Thematic analysis identified three key themes: 'a new definition of recovery', 'complexities of control' and 'the disempowering system'. Despite describing many positive aspects of the programme, including meeting personal milestones and a renewed sense of independence, participants recognised that they were unlikely to regain their previous level of functioning. For some, this was exacerbated by lacking control over the transition care process while adapting to their new level of frailty. Overall, this research highlighted that benefits associated with transition care can be undermined by fragmentation in service delivery, loss of control and uncertainties around future support.",2015,0,1,10.1111/hsc.12142,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103748438&site=ehost-live
218,219,Can Routine Preoperative Data Predict Adverse Outcomes In The Elderly? Development And Validation Of A Simple Risk Model Incorporating A Chart-Derived Frailty Score.,"amrock,levana.g","Background: Frailty has emerged as an important predictor of operative risk among elderly surgical patients. However, the complexity of prospective frailty scores has limited their widespread use. Our goal was to develop two frailty-based surgical risk models using only routine preoperative data. Our hypothesis was that these models could easily integrate into an electronic medical record to predict 30-day morbidity and mortality.Study Design: American College of Surgeons NSQIP Participant Use Data Files from 2005 to 2010 were reviewed, and patients 65 years and older who underwent elective lower gastrointestinal surgery were identified. Two multivariate logistic regression models were constructed and internally cross-validated. The first included simple functional data, a comorbidity index based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, demographics, BMI, and laboratory data (ie, albumin <3.4 g/dL, hematocrit <35%, and creatinine >2 mg/dL). The second model contained only parameters that can directly autopopulate from an electronic medical record (ie, demographics, laboratory data, BMI, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score). To assess diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed.Results: There were 76,106 patients who met criteria for inclusion. Thirty-day mortality was seen in 2,853 patients or 3.7% of the study population and 18,436 patients (24.2%) experienced a major complication. The c-statistic of the first expanded model was 0.813 for mortality and 0.629 for morbidity. The second simplified model had a c-statistic of 0.795 for mortality and 0.621 for morbidity. Both models were well calibrated per the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that routine preoperative data can approximate frailty and predict geriatric-specific surgical risk. The models' predicative powers were comparable with that of established prospective frailty scores. Our calculator could be used as a low-cost simple screen for high-risk individuals who might require additional evaluation or specialized services.",2014,0,1,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.04.018,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103894031&site=ehost-live

220,221,Obesity And Physical Frailty In Older Adults: A Scoping Review Of Lifestyle Intervention Trials.,"porter,starr.kathryn.n","Abstract: Many frail older adults are thin, weak, and undernourished; this component of frailty remains a critical concern in the geriatric field. However, there is also strong evidence that excessive adiposity contributes to frailty by reducing the ability of older adults to perform physical activities and increasing metabolic instability. Our scoping review explores the impact of being obese on physical frailty in older adults by summarizing the state of the science for both clinical markers of physical function and biomarkers for potential underlying causes of obesity-related decline. We used the 5-stage methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley to conduct a scoping review of randomized trials of weight loss and/or exercise interventions for obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) in older adults (aged >60 years), examining the outcomes of inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid accumulation in muscle, as well as direct measures of physical function. Our initial search yielded 212 articles; exclusion of cross-sectional and observational studies, cell culture and animal studies, disease-specific interventions, and articles published before 2001 led to a final result of 21 articles. Findings of these trials included the following major points. The literature consistently confirmed benefits of lifestyle interventions to physical function assessed at the clinical level. Generally speaking, weight loss alone produced a greater effect than exercise alone, and the best outcomes were achieved with a combination of weight loss and exercise, especially exercise programs that combined aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training. Weight loss interventions tended to reduce markers of inflammation and/or oxidative damage when more robust weight reduction was achieved and maintained over time, whereas exercise did not change markers of inflammation. However, participation in a chronic exercise program did reduce the oxidative stress induced by an acute bout of exercise. Weight loss interventions consistently reduced lipid accumulation in the muscle; however, in response to exercise, 3 studies showed an increase and 2 a decrease in muscle lipid infiltration. In summary, this scoping review identified strong clinical evidence that weight reduction and/or exercise interventions can improve physical function and biomarkers of physical dysfunction among overweight/obese older adults, supporting the suggestion that excessive adiposity contributes to physical frailty. However, the evidence also suggests a complexity of metabolic influences, both systemically and within muscle, which has not been elucidated to date. Considerable further study is needed to examine the mechanisms by which lifestyle interventions influence physical frailty before the net impact of such interventions can be fully understood.",2014,0,1,10.1016/j.jamda.2013.11.008,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104054845&site=ehost-live

Working in the patient narrative encompasses sharing conversation that allows exploration of the entire patient experience as it relates to health and illness. However, the complexity of engaging in end-of-life conversations, standing steady with conflict, remaining present, maintaining neutrality, and actively listening remain challenging concepts in practice even though they are integral to effectively doing so. Literature review has identified and defined key elements of interactions that can lead to significant opportunities to ""wander more fully"" in the patient narrative. Two case studies reviewed therein demonstrate ways in which palliative care encounters and end-of-life discussions afford the interdisciplinary team members purposeful engagement with patients. One case discusses taking risks to delve more deeply into patient's fears related to dying. This exploration lays the foundation for assuring goals of care are aligned with individual patient values. The other case demonstrates the use of symbols to share dialog related to an individual's tasks of dying. When directed, intentional facilitation occurs, the patient's unique holistic needs and values are identified, and goals of care can be clarified.

As a response to the high demand for one team's service, a temporary closure to referrals was agreed. This provided the impetus to explore the influence of nurses' decision making at the point of referral on demand for the service. The research questions addressed were: How do Admiral Nurses make decisions regarding referrals and What factors influence this decision-making process? Sixteen case studies were retrospectively reviewed through the auspices of a semi-structured interview aimed at identifying which factors influenced the nurses' acceptance or rejection of these referrals. Results indicated that the Admiral Nurses had a clearly identified focus in supporting the carers of people with dementia, but that the complexity of the carers situation which included the person with dementia was significant. However, the desire to fulfil a case-management role while attempting to provide a service that is of a specialist nature and of limited capacity generated tensions. The decision to offer a service to carers was consequently influenced not only by perceived need but also upon the nurses feeling professionally responsible for perceived gaps in service provision.",2005,0,1,10.1111/j.1365-2850.2005.00847.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106502500&site=ehost-live

However, it is an imprecise umbrella term encompassing heterogeneous models and little substantive knowledge exists on the basic mechanisms leading to positive outcomes. This study aims to address this gap by identifying the environmental conditions and the configurations of factors associated with service delivery success in integrated care initiatives. Design/methodology/approach DS On the basis of an extensive literature review, an analytical framework aimed at structuring and interpreting the relations between contextual, cultural and organizational factors and the outcomes of integrated care initiatives is proposed. The framework is applied to four successful cases of care integration in the USA, Canada, Italy and Switzerland. Findings DS The results suggest that positive outcomes mainly depend on the correct matching of macro-level factors with a balanced mix of operating means at the micro-level, rather than on the intense focus on any one element of the framework. Research limitations/implications DS The analysis infers, from a small-purposive sample, that successful initiatives are a matter of appropriate configuration of contextual, organizational and technical factors. Generalizability of results would benefit from additional international cases and using the framework on decentralized health systems.

The identification of biologically relevant pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically relevant pathways that contribute to frailty.Methods: Based on current understanding of the physiological basis of frailty, we hypothesize that variation in genes related to inflammation and muscle maintenance would associate with frailty. One thousand three hundred and fifty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped across 134 candidate genes using the Illumina Genotyping platform, and the rank order by strength of association between frailty and genotype was determined in a cross-sectional study.Results: Although no single-nucleotide polymorphism reached study-wide significance after controlling family-wise false-discovery rate at 0.05, single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), Caspase 8 (CASP8), CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), and beta-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) loci were among those strongly associated with frailty.Conclusions: The apoptosis- and transcription regulation-related pathways highlighted by this preliminary analysis were consistent with prior gene expression studies in a frail mouse model and provide useful etiological insights for future biological studies of frailty.",2011,0,1,10.1093/gerona/glr061,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104672236&site=ehost-live

Agreement for each of 12 CCs was assessed using kappa (κ) statistics. For the overall number of CCs, perfect agreement was defined as agreement on both the number and constituent CCs. Jackknife methods were used to assess the impact of individual CCs on perfect agreement. Results: The level of chance-adjusted agreement between self-report and administrative data for individual CCs varied widely, from κ = 5.5% (inflammatory bowel disease) to κ = 77.5% (diabetes), and there was no clear pattern on whether using administrative data or self-reported data led to higher prevalence estimates. Only 26.9% of participants had perfect agreement on the number and constituent CCs; 10.6% agreed on the number but not constituent CCs. The impact of each CC on perfect agreement depended on both the level of agreement and the prevalence of the individual CC. Conclusion: Our results show that measuring agreement on multimorbidity is more complex than for individual CCs and that even small levels of individual condition disagreement can have a large impact on the agreement on the number of CCs.",2020,1,1,10.1177/2235042X20931287,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=144278742&site=ehost-live

These experienced nurses articulated many of the important but mostly positive aspects of caring for the older person. Their contributions illustrated how aged care nurses are the lynchpin in the provision of quality care in residential aged care facilities.Older people in residential aged care facilities look to the registered nurse to help them identify and prioritise their needs. Personal care workers now administer care and the registered nurse monitors the provision of this care. It is argued that supervision, while an important aspect of the registered nurse's role, is often one that registered nurses are ill prepared to perform.

264,265,Reproducibility In The Assessment Of The Components Of A Clinical Complexity Index.,"lenti,marco.vincenzo","Clinical complexity (CC) represents one of the most relevant challenges of modern medicine, and its quantification is crucial both to stratify the clinical risk and for a fair hospital reimbursement policy.[1]-[3] CC is a multifaceted condition that encompasses biological (e.g., age, multimorbidity, frailty) and non-biological (e.g., socioeconomic, cultural, environmental, and behavioral) components.[4], [5] On this basis, a vectorial model of CC has been set up in which each vector expresses the dynamic changes over time of each component.[5] Although this model cannot but be an approximation of CC, it is able to take into account its determining factors all at once. The CC index studied has a high interobserver agreement among different healthcare professionals who were trained to administer this tool (observers #1 and #2). To conclude, the results of the present study support the feasibility of the use of the CC index in an internal medicine setting, and could provide background for its use in future studies.",2019,1,1,10.1007/s11606-019-05228-8,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=139599625&site=ehost-live

46,47,Psychological Transition Into A Residential Care Facility: Older People'S Experiences.,"ellis,jm","Aim. The aim of this paper is to discuss the complexity of admission into a residential care facility from a psychological perspective for residents and their relatives and the resulting implications for nursing care. Background. Admission into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. Data sources. The background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into nursing homes and psychological transitions. Discussion. The concepts of transition from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. Implications for nursing. Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that occurs when an older person is admitted into care. Conclusion. Improving the psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a more positive experience.",2010,0,1,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05280.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105168902&site=ehost-live

Background The analysis of nursing diagnosis frequencies may help to estimate the patients' complexity and the need for nursing interventions and can predict hospital outcomes. Nonetheless, few studies were conducted on critical patients. Design Prospective cohort observational study. Methods Between 15 July-31 October 2013 we collected the above-described nursing parameters of 100 subjects throughout their stay in intensive care. We classified the parameters according to established taxonomies. The independent association between the number of nursing diagnoses and length of stay/mortality was investigated with multiple regressions. Results We found an average of 19 diagnoses, 24 outcomes and 60 interventions per patient. Most frequently, the plans of care involved support for self-care deficits or interrupted family processes. They also included strategies to prevent infection, disuse syndrome and impairment of skin integrity. Nineteen nursing diagnoses were significantly related with mortality or length of stay in bivariate analyses. In regression models, the number of such diagnoses explained 29·7% of the variance in length of stay and was an independent predictor of mortality.

294,296,Outcomes Of Clinical Decision Support ( Cds) And Correlates Of Cds Use For Home Care Patients With High Medication Regimen Complexity: A Randomized Trial.,"mcdonald,margaret.v","Rationale, aims and objectives To assess the outcomes of a clinical decision support ( CDS) intervention designed for home care patients with high medication regimen complexity ( MRC) and to examine correlates of CDS use. Method The CDS consisted of a computerized algorithm that identified high MRC patients, electronic alerts and a care management module. Nurses were randomized upon identification of an eligible patient. Full intention to treat and intervention group-only analyses were completed. Regression-adjusted outcomes were hospitalization, emergency department use and reduction in MRC. Results Five hundred nurses were randomized with 7919 of their patients. Approximately 20% of the intervention group was hospitalized versus 21% in the control group; 16.5% versus 16.7% had an emergency department visit; and 6% in each group dropped below the high MRC threshold. No statistically significant differences were found in the intention to treat analysis. Eighty-two percent of intervention nurses used the CDS but for only 42% of their patients. Among intervention patients, CDS use (vs. non-use) was associated with reduced MRC and hospitalization. CDS use was associated with various clinician and patient characteristics. Conclusion CDS use was limited, negating the impact of the intervention overall. Findings on correlates of CDS use and the relationship between CDS use and positive outcomes suggest that CDS use and outcomes could be enhanced by avoiding short patient lengths of stay, improving continuity of care, increasing reliance on salaried nurses and/or increasing per diem nurses' incentives to use CDS.",2016,1,1,10.1111/jep.12383,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=113901816&site=ehost-live
20,21,Ongoing Challenges Responding To Behavioural And Psychological Symptoms Of Dementia.,"ostaszkiewicz,j","Background: Mid ‐  to late ‐ stage dementia is often characterized by behavioural and psychological symptoms, including, but not limited to physical and verbal aggression. Introduction: Although there is a considerable research about the prevalence, aetiology, and management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, there is limited research about the experience of caring for people with such symptoms in long ‐ term aged care facilities. Aim: The aims of the study were to describe: (i) nurses' experiences of caring for people with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in long ‐ term aged care facilities, and (ii) strategies nurses used to deal with these symptoms. Methods: A qualitative exploratory and descriptive design, involving focus group interviews with 30 nurses from three long ‐ term aged care units in Australia. The transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results: The findings revealed five interrelated themes: (i) working under difficult conditions, (ii) behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: an everyday encounter, (iii) making sense of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, (iv) attempting to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and (v) feeling undervalued. Conclusion: This study highlighted the difficult conditions under which nurses worked and the complexity of caring for individuals who have behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Implications for nursing and health policy: Organizational efforts to enhance the quality of care for individuals with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in long ‐ term aged care facilities should extend beyond staff education to heed nurses' concerns about organizational barriers to interpersonal care.",2015,0,1,10.1111/inr.12180,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111177574&site=ehost-live
19,20,Orchestrating Care: Nursing Practice With Hospitalised Older Adults.,"dahlke,sherry.ann","Background. The increased incidence of health challenges with aging means that nurses are increasingly caring for older adults, often in hospital settings. Research about the complexity of nursing practice with this population remains limited. Objective. To seek an explanation of nursing practice with hospitalised older adults. Methods. Design. A grounded theory study guided by symbolic interactionism was used to explore nursing practice with hospitalised older adults from a nursing perspective. Glaserian grounded theory methods were used to develop a mid-range theory after analysis of 375 hours of participant observation, 35 interviews with 24 participants and review of selected documents. Results. The theory of orchestrating care was developed to explain how nurses are continuously trying to manage their work environments by understanding the status of the patients, their unit, mobilising the assistance of others and stretching available resources to resolve their problem of providing their older patients with what they perceived as 'good care' while sustaining themselves as 'good' nurses. They described their practice environments as hard and under-resourced. Orchestrating care is comprised of two subprocesses: building synergy and minimising strain. These two processes both facilitated and constrained each other and nurses' abilities to orchestrate care. Conclusions. Although system issues presented serious constraints to nursing practice, the ways in which nurses were making meaning of their work environment both aided them in managing their challenges and constrained their agency. Implications for practice. Nurses need to be encouraged to share their important perspective about older adult care. Administrators have a role to play in giving nurses voice in workplace committees and in forums. Further research is needed to better understand how multidisciplinary teams influence care of hospitalized older adults.",2015,0,1,10.1111/opn.12075,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111007331&site=ehost-live
17,18,Nursing Staffs' Attentiveness To Older Adults Falling In Residential Care - An Interview Study.,"clancy,anne",Aims and objectives The focus of this study is to explore how nursing staff experience safety promotion and fall prevention in residential care settings for older adults. The article calls for attentiveness to fall prevention within a broader lifeworld context of well-being and health promotion. Background There is limited research on fall prevention and safety promotion where the lifeworld and well-being provide a direction for care. Design This interview study has a hermeneutic phenomenological design. Methods Fourteen interviews with nursing staff were carried out. The ethics of care and vulnerability within a lifeworld approach provide the theoretical framework and guide the interpretive process. Results The findings can indicate that there is a generalised understanding of the needs of older persons in residential care. The focus of the staff was more on protection and prevention than safety promotion and well-being. Conclusion Risk prevention is not enough. The residents need protection against falls but they also need to be protected from situations that can be detrimental to their well-being and compromise their dignity. Acknowledging the complexities of safety promotion amongst older persons living in assisted care settings can prevent fall accidents and ensure attentiveness to a more fundamental sense of security that can promote the older person's well-being and health. Relevance to clinical practice This study is relevant to clinical nursing practice as it shows that risk management in fall prevention is not enough. The findings show the need for educated nursing home staff that can incorporate contemplative and scientific knowledge into injury prevention practice.,2016,0,1,10.1111/jocn.13240,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=114538838&site=ehost-live
15,16,"Team Social Cohesion, Professionalism, And Patient-Centeredness: Gendered Care Work, With Special Reference To Elderly Care - A Mixed Methods Study.","öhman,ann","Background: Healthcare organisations are facing large demands in recruiting employees with adequate competency to care for the increasing numbers of elderly. High degrees of turnover and dissatisfaction with working conditions are common. The gendered notion of care work as 'women's work', in combination with low salaries and status, may contribute to negative work experiences. There is abundant information about the negative aspects of elderly care health services, but little is known about positive aspects of this work. The study aim was to investigate work satisfaction from a gender perspective among Swedish registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, focusing specifically on healthcare services for the elderly.Methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted in which we combined statistics and open-ended responses from a national survey with qualitative research interviews with healthcare professionals in elderly care organisations. The survey was administered to a random sample of 1578 registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. Qualitative interviews with 17 professionals were conducted in six elderly care facilities. Qualitative and quantitative content analyses, chi2 and constructivist grounded theory were used to analyse the data.Results: There was a statistically significant difference in overall work satisfaction between those who worked in elderly care and those who did not (64 and 74,4% respectively, p <0.001). Nine themes were derived from open-ended responses in the questionnaire. The qualitative interviews revealed four prominent storylines: 'Team social cohesion', 'Career development and autonomy', 'Client-centeredness', and 'Invisible and ignored power structures'.Conclusions: The results show the complexity of elderly care work and describe several aspects that are important for work satisfaction among health professionals. The results reveal that work satisfaction is dependent on social interrelations and cohesion in the work team, in possibilities to use humour and to have fun together, and in the ability to work as professionals to provide client-centered elderly care. Power relations such as gendered hierarchies were less visible or even ignored aspects of work satisfaction. The storylines are clearly linked to the two central discourses of professionalism and gender equality.",2017,0,1,10.1186/s12913-017-2326-9,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=123435552&site=ehost-live

Asking people about their pain is considered the most accurate and reliable assessment because of the subjective nature of pain. A number of simple and easy-to-administer self-rating scales are available to measure pain intensity. To rate their pain, however, people need to understand the request, as well as recall and interpret the painful signal. Observing specific behaviours associated with pain is advocated when communication and cognitive function are impaired, for example, in people with advanced dementia. A number of pain assessment tools have been developed that involve observation of some or all of the behaviours. The aim of this article is to highlight the importance of pain assessment, discuss the various pain assessment scales and tools available and identify some of the factors that can make comprehensive assessment of pain in older people and those with cognitive impairment complex.",2015,1,1,10.7748/nop.27.8.16.e738,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=109950413&site=ehost-live

This program ran for two consecutive years in 2012 and 2013. This descriptive paper outlines a case study of the development and implementation of a Graduate Nurse Program focusing on advancing the specialty-nursing workforce in aged care. The disciplines of Gerontology and Geriatrics are relatively new but remain underrepresented in nursing curriculum and are frequently not valued in practice. The aim of the program itself was to allow graduate nurses to gain the knowledge and skills for competence to practice within the aged care environment. The complexities of this practice extended beyond the usual bedside nursing of most graduate programs within acute healthcare settings. Aged care graduates were required to also develop management and team leadership skills. This program, though developed for the Australian context, has relevance internationally with the growth of the ageing population and the concomitant increasing healthcare needs. The program and curriculum was developed closely with a steering committee composed of industry representatives and the academic education provider and used innovative pedagogies. The development of key areas of the curriculum and the underlying philosophy of the program are described. The practice changes to the aged care workplaces with the introduction of infrastructures to support the graduates are also discussed. With the international growth in the aged care population, education programs like this Graduate Program will be pivotal in the development of an appropriately trained and sustainable nursing workforce within aged care.",2017,0,1,10.1016/j.colegn.2016.07.002,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=124212704&site=ehost-live
13,14,Ageing Out Of Place: The Meaning Of Home Among Hispanic Older Persons Living In The United States.,"curtin,alicia","Aim To explore the meaning of home among older Hispanic immigrants who are 'aging out of place.' Background Emerging evidence supports the concept of older persons ageing in place. Nurse researchers have demonstrated that older person who age in place have better physical, psychological and cognitive outcomes. Less, however, is known about older persons who are 'aging out of place,' meaning out of their country of origin. With the growth of home health care, there is a need to understand the older immigrants' meaning of home when ageing out of their country of origin. Design and Method An inductive, qualitative descriptive research design was used. Seventeen Hispanic participants, ranging in age from 65 to 83 years were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol. Findings Two major finding of the study focused on participants' descriptions of home in their country of origin and in the USA. The majority of participants described their home in their native country as the community, countryside or town (pueblo) and in the U.S.A. as family. The level of social isolation and loneliness among participants was evident. Conclusions Older Hispanic immigrants who are 'aging out of place' integrate their past experiences of sense of place in their native country with their present experiences of home in the USA. The need to understand the role of the community and the family in the provision of nursing care in the home may be more important than the physical structure or setting in which it is delivered. Further intra- and cross-national studies are needed to provide a framework for understanding the issues of ageing and immigration globally. Implications for Practice Gerontological nurses need to recognise the complexity of family relationships for older Hispanic persons who are ageing out of place of origin and their risk of depression, social isolation, and loneliness.",2017,0,1,10.1111/opn.12150,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=124659011&site=ehost-live

Caring for people with dementia and responsive behaviours is challenging; however, little is known of nurses' experiences of responsive behaviours., What does this paper add to existing knowledge? To demonstrate understanding nurses need to be aware of their own actions, thoughts, attitudes and reactions., Time, education and management support are essential in enabling a person-centred approach., A decision regarding the place of care is difficult to come to, and given the drive to a person-centred approach, there is a need to consider the views of people with dementia., What are the implications for practice? Nursing staff supporting people with dementia should engage more frequently in reflective practice, ongoing education and decision-making., Service providers/managers need to have an understanding of the complexities of caring for a person with dementia and responsive behaviours and provide their staff with relevant supports and education that is accessible to all staff., Abstract Introduction Caring for people with dementia and responsive behaviours can challenge nurses, and little is known of their experiences. Aims To explore nurses' views of supporting people with dementia and responsive behaviours in long-stay facilities. Methods A qualitative descriptive study utilizing in-depth audio-recorded interviews of nine nurses, recruited from private and public care facilities. Qualitative content analyses conducted involving iterative comparisons of transcripts, summaries and memos, where coding, key quotes and tables were developed to determine themes. Results Four themes emerged: recognizing and understanding responsive behaviour, resources and interventions to support people with dementia and responsive behaviour, the impact of education on nursing practice and the care environment. Discussion Availability of staff, adequate time and financial restraints hinder nurses' ability to provide care. Access to ongoing education and being able to provide one-to-one care was valued as dementia-specific education changed nursing practice. Implications for practice Place of care was seen as dependent on the type of responsive behaviour in question, the duration of the behaviour and the impact of the behaviour on the person, other residents and staff. Dementia education needs to be accessible to all staff, and a collaborative approach is necessary in order to develop management guidelines and support strategies.",2018,0,1,10.1111/jpm.12436,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=127191539&site=ehost-live

6,7,Nurse Practitioners' Role In Improving Service For Elderly Trauma Patients.,"bethea,audis","Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, p =.048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p =.016). A significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p =.002), and a significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p =.040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution.

3,4,Nursing Faculty And Students' Perspectives Of How Students Learn To Work With Older People.,"dahlke,sherry","Despite efforts to incorporate information about older people in pre-licensure nursing programs, there are inconsistent results from studies examining student nurses' perceptions towards the aging population. There is research suggesting that healthcare settings and nursing practice is perpetuating negative perspectives towards older people. To gain an understanding of how social contexts are influencing student nurses' experiences when learning to work with older people. Descriptive case study guided by the theoretical framework of social learning theory. A university in Western Canada that offers a pre-licensure nursing program. 28 student nurses and 13 faculty in the nursing program. Participant interviews and focus groups were conducted with nursing faculty and students. Key findings from this study are that students' previous experiences with older people, through family or work experiences, and their first clinical experience in long- term care negatively influenced their perceptions about working with older people. Clinical nurses and faculty influenced students' perceptions about nursing practice with older people, sometimes in subtle ways, underscoring that students are learning from what they see and hear in practice. Students were ill-prepared for the complexity of the aging population, particularly those with cognitive impairment. Learning activities that engage students in active learning, such as simulation, providing students with a positive lexicon of how to describe older patients, and more overt attention to the perspectives students and faculty bring to the learning environment need to be carefully explored. Meaningful learning experiences with older people in multiple contexts are needed to thoughtfully plan how to disrupt negative perceptions that might emerge through the nursing education program.",2020,0,1,10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104537,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=145211353&site=ehost-live
2,3,"A Systematic Review Of The Impact Of 'Missed Care' In Primary, Community And Nursing Home Settings.","sworn,katie","Aim: To explore 'missed care' in relation to primary and community settings, including nursing homes, and to build an understanding of implications for patients, public, politicians and policymakers. Background: Missed care occurs when any aspect of required patient care is omitted or delayed. Little attention has examined missed care in primary, community and nursing home settings. Methods: Systematic review of the literature. Searches were conducted of PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar (July 2018). The quality of empirical studies was appraised using CASP and SURE tools. Results: The search identified 15 metrics papers (2004–2019) and eight empirical papers (2015–2018) (five studies). Empirical studies were rated as good quality. Missed care impacts on safety in community/primary care contexts and differs from acute care. Causes of missed care include acuity, complexity of cases, volume of care and organisational factors. Metrics have been adapted to community/nursing home settings but not in a standardised way. Tools are required to evaluate missed care within a culture of personal reflection and quality improvement. Conclusion: The prominence of missed acute care should not distract from its impact in primary, community and nursing home settings. Nurse leaders should consider causes for missed care, and how it is conceptualized and evaluated.

23,24,Narrative Pedagogy With Evolving Case Study – A Transformative Approach To Gerontic Nursing Practice For Undergraduate Nursing Students.,"laver,shaorn","Engaging nursing students in the complexities of care across community, acute, rehabilitation and residential aged care settings is challenging. Equally challenging is conceptualising and promoting diverse and comprehensive health assessments across care settings that reflect clinical reality, inform clinical decision making, traverse theory and practice, and transform clinical practice knowledge. This article describes the use of narrative and evolving case study as a teaching-learning tool utilised by the authors in a third year undergraduate gerontic nursing subject in a pre-service nursing degree at a rural university. Principles of transformative learning and strengths based nursing were drawn upon in the development of the case study. The aim of the approach was to draw on embedded knowledge and the experiences of students and academics from assorted practice settings to facilitate understanding of the lived experiences of an older community dwelling couple. Using social learning strategies students were encouraged to analyse and think critically and creatively about the situations they were presented with. They identified possible solutions that would be acceptable to the couple. Building on the older couple's strengths, achievements and personal social capital, the aim was to develop a positive paradigm for health and the way older people are viewed by nursing students.",2015,0,1,10.1016/j.nepr.2015.04.002,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=109495977&site=ehost-live
24,25,Palliative Care In Dementia: Literature Review Of Nurses' Knowledge And Attitudes Towards Pain Assessment.,"burns,michelle","Background: Pain is prevalent among older people, yet is often under-recognised and undertreated in people with dementia. The nurse has a central role in identifying and appropriately assessing pain in order to provide effective treatment. Research however suggests there are significant deficits in this area. Aim: To explore the evidence on nurses' knowledge and attitudes to pain assessment in older people with dementia. Design: A systematic narrative review of peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2014. Data sources: Seven electronic data bases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Wiley, Pubmed, ProQuest and OVID) were searched and articles focusing on nurses knowledge and attitudes on pain assessment towards people with dementia. Methods: Research participants within the studies reviewed were to include registered nurses involved in the assessment and management of pain in older adults with dementia from across all healthcare settings (e.g. dementia units, nursing homes, community and acute settings). Results: Data were systematically analysed from 1 1 papers. Using an inductive approach for thematic content analysis informed by the theory of planned behaviour, five themes were identified. These included: 1) Challenges in diagnosing pain in dementia 2) Inadequacies of pain assessment tools 3) Time constraints and workload pressures 4) Lack of interdisciplinary teamwork and communication 5) Training and education. Conclusion: Nurses play a key role in the effective management of pain through the use of pain assessment tools, behavioural observation, and analgesic choice. Pain assessment in dementia remains challenging for nurses due to the complexity and individualisation of pain behaviours. The accessibility of appropriate training, workforce stability and a standardised approach to pain assessment are key to the successful management of pain in older people with dementia.",2015,0,1,10.12968/ijpn.2015.21.8.400,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=109836418&site=ehost-live
25,26,Who Wants To Work With Older People? Swedish Student Nurses' Willingness To Work In Elderly Care—A Questionnaire Study.,"carlson,elisabeth","Summary Background The aging population is a globally recognized challenge for the health care service. The growing number of older people will probably lead to increased demands for nurses working in elderly care. Clinical practice has been shown to have an impact on how student nurses perceive a particular field of nursing. Objectives To compare perceptions of the clinical learning environment in nursing homes among students considering a career in aged care or not, and to examine the difference in age, gender and previous working experience as health care assistants in elderly care between the two groups. Design This was a cross-sectional study using the Swedish version of the Clinical Learning Environment and Nurse Teacher evaluation scale. Methods Consecutive sampling was performed over three semesters from September 2011 to December 2012. The survey was conducted with 183 student nurses. Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine differences in relation to two groups namely student nurses who did or did not consider to work in elderly care. A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the difference in age, gender and previous working experience between the two groups. Results The analysis leaned towards an overall positive evaluation of the clinical learning environment with more positive values for students considering a career. There were no significant differences between younger students (18–23) and older students (24–50) regarding willingness to work in elderly care or not. Neither was any significant difference displayed between students, based on gender nor for previous work experience. Conclusion Age, gender and previous work experiences as health care assistants did not impact on students' willingness to work in elderly care. Future studies need to acknowledge the complexity of why student nurses choose a particular pathway in nursing by longitudinal studies following cohorts of students during the course of the nursing programme.",2015,0,1,10.1016/j.nedt.2015.03.002,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=102879043&site=ehost-live
37,38,The Discourse Of Aging.,"madden,connie.l","Historical and epistemological developments contribute to and reinforce the underlying framework that categorizes antiaging discourse and healthy aging discourse. This discourse creates the question 'Can we live longer or better?' and encompasses issues of quality versus quantity, dependency versus autonomy, and risk versus benefit. By positing this discourse as a dichotomous tension, the development can be traced through the examination of select examples of influential studies in the field of aging. For nursing, the risk of these continued oppositions is potential oversimplification that may limit discernment of the complexities of care of older adults. Through understanding of the evolution and imposition of this dichotomizing discourse, nursing can provide older adult care within the reality of the aging experience, and develop frameworks, theories, and multidisciplinary discursive practice to optimize nursing care in the real-world spaces that exist between antiaging and healthy aging boundaries.",2012,0,1,,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=108146613&site=ehost-live
45,46,Improving Access To Health Care For Uninsured Elderly Patients.,"horton,s","The purpose of this article is to explore the barriers that the uninsured elderly population encounter when accessing health care in the United States. These barriers include, but are not limited to lack of transportation, insurance, or family support; the daunting complexity of the health care system; poverty; culture; poor patient-health care provider communications; race/ethnicity; and lack of health care professionals such as nurses and doctors with adequate geriatric preparation, or generalists who are undereducated in geriatrics. The number of health care professionals currently available to treat elderly persons in the United States is inadequate. The Federal government should take steps to develop solutions to improve access to health care and decrease health disparities for older adults. As a nation, we should be proactive in addressing these concerns instead of waiting for new barriers to arise that further limit access to health care for elderly patients and their families. In this article, we provide an assessment of the barriers that limit access to health care in the uninsured elderly population and suggest recommendations and possible solutions to eliminate or reduce these barriers.",2010,0,1,10.1111/j.1525-1446.2010.00866.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105049209&site=ehost-live
42,43,End-Of-Life Care In Two Norwegian Nursing Homes: Family Perceptions.,"kaarbø,elsa","The aim of this article is to report a study exploring experiences of relatives who have been present immediately prior to and after the death (in the last 72 hours) of a next-of-kin in a nursing home. The purpose of the study was to acquire research-based knowledge to improve practice. Globally, a growing number of older people, often with increased morbidity and complexity of conditions, require specialised nursing care, particularly at the end of life. Several international studies describe end-of-life care in nursing homes as insufficient, mainly owing to shortage of qualified staff and other essential resources. There are few studies in this field in Norway; none of them focus on the final days and hours of a patient's life from the perspective of their relatives. A mixed methods design was used. Data were collected through structured interviews with 50 relatives during Spring 2006 and analysed by version 14 and theme-based analysis. With a few exceptions, the quality of nursing care was considered professional and good. Care was described as supportive, individualised and based on patients' needs - in a safe atmosphere and supported by good relations between patients and nursing staff. Information and communication between staff and relatives, however, were described as unsystematic and casual. That some patients died alone became a source of distress for their relatives. Information and communication between staff and relatives need to be improved. There is need for change to avoid the situation where patients die in solitude. End-of-life care is performed at a time when patients and their relatives are at their most vulnerable. Nurses and other health workers need information, as this study suggests, to provide high-quality care to ease this situation.",2011,0,1,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03171.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=59192127&site=ehost-live

The growing complexity of care and the rapid expansion of knowledge have challenged the adequacy of traditional educational approaches. Proposed solutions have encouraged closer integration of classroom and clinical teaching. This article describes an integrated instructional approach to developing clinical leadership competencies in a cohort of accelerated, second-degree, baccalaureate nursing students. Fifty-six students completed an intensive clinical experience in long-term care settings in which they used evidence on improving care for persons with heart failure to practice the principles of delegation and supervision with nursing staff. The pre- and postassessments indicated improvement in heart failure knowledge and increased readiness for delegation and supervision of certified nursing assistants. As one component of the learning experience, the students completed reflection journals. The entries in the students' journals revealed five themes: (a) low leadership self-efficacy, (b) managing the credibility gap, (c) flexibility in communication strategies, (d) RN accountability in delegation and supervision, and (e) knowledge dissemination with diverse nursing staff. Students and faculty judged the learning experience to be successful and supported the experience for future cohorts of students. This report is one example of how innovative learning experiences could be developed to increase the ""real-world"" aspects of clinical care within a multidisciplinary team context for the entry-level learner.",2011,0,1,10.1016/j.profnurs.2011.03.002,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=108256676&site=ehost-live

Appropriate measures of this elusive concept are needed to better understand barriers to implementation. This study explored and tested the convergent validity and the reliability of 2 individualized nursing care measures. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data using the Individualized Care Scale and the Individualized Care Instrument (ICI) from a sample of nurses (n = 263, response rate 71%) working in older peoples' care settings in Finland, and the data were analyzed statistically. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the ICI scales (.63-.80) and ICS-A and B subscales (both a = .91) demonstrated only moderate correlation between the 2 instruments (r = -.39 to .50) and possibly the complexity of measuring ""individualized care."" The study acknowledges the latent influence of culture and care approach to the conceptualization of individuality.

Previously, these hospitals lacked a fall-event reporting system to drive improvement.Study Design: A one-group pretest-posttest embedded in a participatory research framework. We required hospitals to implement MTSs, which we supported by conducting education, developing an online toolkit, and establishing a fall-event reporting system.Data Collection: Hospitals used gap analyses to assess the presence of fall-risk-reduction processes at study beginning and their frequency and effectiveness at study end; they reported fall-event data throughout the study.Principal Findings: The extent to which hospitals implemented 21 processes to coordinate the fall-risk-reduction program and trained staff specifically about the program predicted unassisted and injurious fall rates during the end-of-study period (January 2014-July 2014). Bedside fall-risk-reduction processes were not significant predictors of these outcomes.Conclusions: Multiteam systems that effectively coordinate fall-risk-reduction processes may improve the capacity of hospitals to manage the complex patient, environmental, and system factors that result in falls.",2019,1,1,10.1111/1475-6773.13186,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=138541116&site=ehost-live
38,39,Elders Adapting To A Chronic Diagnosis Within A Nursing Refuge.,"hegge,margaret","PROBLEM. The increasing numbers of people seeking care for chronic disease has placed unparalleled demands on nurses who journey with them as they grasp the meaning of their altered health status. The complexity of the newly diagnosed chronic disease can be overwhelming. Newly diagnosed elder patients need a refuge in which to explore the uncertainties and challenges in managing a chronic illness. Reactions to a new diagnosis are uniquely shaped by the elder person's culture, age, life circumstances, and previous coping strategies. Six dichotomous response pairs are posed: relief versus devastation, courage versus cowardice, disease obsession versus disease aversion, rational thinking versus intuition, reawakening versus stuck, and self-reliance versus dependence. Nurses can create a sanctuary for elderly patients with protected space, presence, partnership, past to future orientation, and perspective on life. Nurses who embrace this mission may find themselves returning to the reasons they sought a nursing career, to support and strengthen elderly people in the most vulnerable moments of their lives.",2012,0,1,10.1111/j.1744-6198.2011.00255.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104552658&site=ehost-live

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, tumor characteristics, perioperative, and pathological outcomes were analyzed and reported. Trifecta achievement, defined by warm ischemia time <25 minutes, no perioperative complications, and negative surgical margins, was the primary outcome. We assessed the relationship of baseline clinical and tumor characteristics data to trifecta achievement and perioperative complications.Results: Baseline median eGFR was 84.57 ml/min/1.73 m2, with 119 (84.39%) patients having normal baseline kidney function. The median clinical tumor size was 4.95 cm, with 74 (51.75%) being completely endophytic and 58 (41.73%) located on the hilum. The median ischemia time was 20 minutes. Median estimated blood loss was 150 ml. Twelve patients (8.33%) had intraoperative complications. No patient had a conversion to open surgery. Postoperative, perioperative, and major complication rate were 10.42%, 17.3%, and 2.34% respectively. Thirty-six patients (37.89%) developed postoperative acute kidney injury and 28 (20.90%) developed new-onset CKD at a median follow-up of 6 months. Eight patients (5.56%) had a positive surgical margin. Trifecta was achieved in 89 (61.81%) patients. There was no significant difference in baseline, clinical, and tumor characteristics between those that achieved trifecta and in those where trifecta was not. Pathologic tumor stage was the only factor significantly associated with trifecta achievement (P = 0.025).Conclusion: In treating complex renal tumors, PN should be performed when possible.

However, information on the characteristics of adult persons with DS is limited. The objective of the study is to describe characteristics of adults with DS collected with a standardised, comprehensive assessment instrument. Methods Cross‐sectional study. Four hundred thirty adults with DS (age range 18/75 years) from three countries (Italy, n = 95; USA, n = 175; and Canada, n = 160). A standardised assessment instrument (interRAI intellectual disability) was used to assess sample characteristics. Results: Mean age ranged from 35.2 (standard deviation 12.0) years in the US sample to 48.8 (standard deviation 9.0) years in the Canadian sample. Most participants in the Italian and US sample were living in private homes, while more than half of those in the Canadian sample were institutionalised. Prevalences of geriatric conditions, including cognitive deficits, disability in the common activities of daily living, symptoms of withdrawal or anhedonia, aggressive behaviour, communication problems, falls and hearing problems were high in the study sample. Gastrointestinal symptoms, skin and dental problems and obesity were also frequently observed. Conclusions: Adults with DS present with a high level of complexity, which may suggest the need for an approach based on a comprehensive assessment and management that can provide adequate care.

AIM:  The aim of this study was to describe nursing diagnoses in acute- and long-term elderly care. METHODS:  A point prevalence survey was conducted on 240 patients. The International Classification for Nursing Practice was used to describe nursing diagnoses, and a conceptual model was used to categorize them in nursing needs. RESULTS:  A total of 2,673 diagnoses were detected. Mean was higher in nursing home than in hospital ( t test =−3.688; p = .0003). Prevalent diagnoses were significantly different. DISCUSSION:  High complexity, with different issues for nurses, was observed both in acute- and in long-term settings. CONCLUSION:  The results could help to comprehend the nature of older persons needs and could contribute to the development of an International Classification for Nursing Practice catalogue for elderly care.

Using a broad qualitative research approach, data were collected through interviews, transcribed, analysed and grouped into the following themes: knowing: the seasonal influenza vaccine; mandatory vaccination: balancing autonomy and control; and meaningful education. This study reveals the complexity of issues and concerns for nurses when it comes to the seasonal influenza vaccine. These issues and concerns include influences such as family, friends, peers, the media and how nurses inform themselves.

Intervention group (n = 29) received an experimental multilevel intervention designed to help them: (1) use quality improvement methods, (2) use team and group process for direct-care decision-making, (3) focus on accomplishing the basics of care, and (4) maintain more consistent nursing and administrative leadership committed to communication and active participation of staff in decision-making. Results: The qualitative analysis revealed a subgroup of homes (“Full Adopters”) likely to continue quality improvement activities that were able to effectively use teams. “Full Adopters” had either the nursing home administrator or director of nursing who supported and were actively involved in the quality improvement work of the team. “Full Adopters” also selected care topics for the focus of their quality improvement team, instead of “communication” topics of the “Partial Adopters” or “Non-Adopters” in the study who were identified as unlikely to continue to continue quality improvement activities after the intervention. “Full Adopters” had evidence of the key elements of complexity science: information flow, cognitive diversity, and positive relationships among staff; this evidence was lacking in other subgroups. All subgroups were able to recruit interdisciplinary teams, but only those that involved leaders were likely to be effective and sustain team efforts at quality improvement of care delivery systems. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative analysis can help leaders and medical directors use the key elements and promote information flow among staff, residents, and families; be inclusive as discussions about care delivery, making sure diverse points of view are included; and help build positive relationships among all those living and working in the nursing home. Wide-spread adoption of the intervention in the randomized study is feasible and could be enabled by nursing home Medical Directors in collaborative practice with Advanced Practice Nurses.",2013,0,1,10.1016/j.jamda.2012.09.008,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=84575592&site=ehost-live

Statistical analysis was performed to identify predictors of pain flare and pain control. Pain flare occurred in 38% of treated patients (n = 18/48): No correlation was found between pain flare and patient‐ or treatment‐related variables. In the subset of patients with active pain at baseline (n = 23), pain control was obtained in 62% of patients at 1 year; median time to pain progression after SBRT was 29 months (CI95% 6–52 months). Presence of ≥2ECS‐CP features was correlated with earlier pain progression (4 vs. 30 months, p = 0.012). Pain flare occurred in 38% of cases irrespectively of steroid premedication and dose regimen. In patient with baseline active pain, durable pain control was obtained. Presence of ≥2 complexity indicators at the ECS‐CP assessment was correlated with impaired pain control and may deserve future investigation in prospective studies.",2018,1,1,10.1111/ecc.12915,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=133260600&site=ehost-live
276,278,Complexity Analysis Of Decision-Making In The Critically Ill.,"daly,barbara.j","Rationale: Despite multiple trials of interventions to improve end-of-life care of the critically ill, there is a persistent lack of understanding of factors associated with barriers to decision-making at the end of life. Objective: To apply the principles of complexity science in examining the extent to which transitions to end-of-life care can be predicted by physician, family, or patient characteristics; outcome expectations; and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Methods: A descriptive, longitudinal study was conducted in 3 adult intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred sixty-four family surrogates of patients lacking decisional capacity and the physicians caring for the patients were interviewed every 5 days until ICU discharge or patient death. Measurements: Characteristics of patients, physicians, and family members; values and preferences of physicians and family; and evaluation of treatment effectiveness, expectations for patient outcomes, and relative priorities in treatment (comfort vs survival). The primary outcome, focus of care, was categorized as (1) maintaining a survival orientation (no treatment limitations), (2) transitioning to a stronger palliative focus (eg, some treatment limitations), or (3) transitioning to an explicit end-of-life, comfort-oriented care plan. Main Results: Physician expectations for survival and future cognitive status were the only variables consistently and significantly related to the focus of care. Neither physician or family evaluations of treatment effectiveness nor what was most important to physicians or family members was influential. Conclusion: Lack of influence of family and physician views, in comparison to the consistent effect of survival probabilities, suggests barriers to incorporation of individual values in treatment decisions.",2018,1,1,10.1177/0885066616678394,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=131908084&site=ehost-live
279,281,The Complexity Of Determining Whether A Nursing Home Transfer Is Avoidable At Time Of Transfer.,"unroe,kathleen.t","Objectives: To describe the relationship between nursing facility resident risk conditions and signs and symptoms at time of acute transfer and diagnosis of conditions associated with potentially avoidable acute transfers (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, dehydration, pressure sores). Design: As part of a demonstration project to reduce potentially avoidable hospital transfers, Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project clinical staff collected data on residents who transferred to the emergency department (ED) or hospital. Cross‐tabulations were used to identify associations between risk conditions or symptoms and hospital diagnoses or death. Mixed‐effects logistic regression models were used to describe the significance of risk conditions, signs, or symptoms as predictors of potentially avoidable hospital diagnoses or death. Setting: Indiana nursing facilities (N=19). Participants: Long‐stay nursing facility residents (N=1,174), who experienced 1,931 acute transfers from November 2014 to July 2016. Measurements: Participant symptoms, transfers, risk factors, and hospital diagnoses. Results: We found that 44% of acute transfers were associated with 1 of 6 potentially avoidable diagnoses. Symptoms before transfer did not discriminate well among hospital diagnoses. Symptoms mapped into multiple diagnoses and most hospital diagnoses had multiple associated symptoms. For example, more than two‐thirds of acute transfers of residents with a history of CHF and COPD were for reasons other than exacerbations of those two conditions. Conclusion: Although it is widely recognized that many transfers of nursing facility residents are potentially avoidable, determining “avoidability” at time of transfer is complex. Symptoms and risk conditions were only weakly predictive of hospital diagnoses.",2018,1,1,10.1111/jgs.15286,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=129891490&site=ehost-live

31,32,Prevention Of Functional Decline In Older Hospitalized Patients: Nurses Should Play A Key Role In Safe And Adequate Care.,"hoogerduijn,jita.g","This paper presents a discussion of knowledge and awareness regarding prevention of functional decline in older hospitalized patients. Functional decline is experienced by 30-60% of the older hospitalized patients, resulting in decreased independence and other adverse health outcomes. One literature study and four cohort studies (total n = 1628) were conducted to develop and validate an instrument to identify older hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline. An evidence-based best practice was developed to improve the quality of care for older patients. This paper shows the relevance and the complexity of this problem and shows that patients at risk can be recognized by four simple questions. Due to their ability to observe and guide patients and their 24-h patient supervision, nurses should play a key role in strategies to prevent functional decline. Nurses should assess the geriatric needs in patients at risk and based on these initiate and coordinate multi-professional interventions. Given the growing number of older people in western society and the growing need for care, action to prevent functional decline cannot be withheld. Knowledge of the ageing process, implementation of an evidence-based programme and a multidisciplinary approach is a basic ingredient to prevent functional decline.",2014,0,1,10.1111/ijn.12134,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=94727426&site=ehost-live
30,31,The Care Of Older Adults In Hospital: If It'S Common Sense Why Isn'T It Common Practice?,"parke,belinda","Aims and objectives To present three converging myths that underlie the perception that nursing care for older persons in hospital is simple in comparison with its actual complexity. Background Literature provides strong evidence indicating that the myths we discuss inherently arise from ageism, the social value of older patients and the economic burden of being an older patient in hospital. These powerful social discourses promote harm to older patients. Harm emerges from both the omission of gerontological nursing knowledge and skill and the commission of acts that unintentionally harm. A corresponding ethical challenge results for acute care nurses. Design A discursive paper. Methods We illuminate gerontological issues by discussing three myths. In myth one, we detail four clusters of distinguishing characteristics in older hospitalised people. In the second myth, we challenge the idea that the role of the acute care hospital is to attend only to acute medical concerns. Finally, in the third myth, we address the issue of incorporating functional assessment into the acute care nursing assessment. We argue that functional assessment is poorly integrated and becomes acceptable only as long as the medical regimen is managed appropriately. Conclusion Safe quality care in hospital for older adults requires a hybrid practice that integrates acute care specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing knowledge and skill. Clinical reasoning that integrates this type of nursing knowledge can prevent harm. Relevance to clinical practice Integrating key elements of acute care nursing specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing principles aids to prevent the omission of care that is known to be harmful to older people. Conversely, the commission of gerontologically sensitive acute care can enhance safety and promote quality care in hospital.",2014,0,1,10.1111/jocn.12529,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=95750936&site=ehost-live

212,213,Provision Of Nhs Generalist And Specialist Services To Care Homes In England: Review Of Surveys.,"iliffe,steve","BackgroundThe number of beds in care homes (with and without nurses) in the United Kingdom is three times greater than the number of beds in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective.ObjectivesTo critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes.MethodsA review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose.ResultsFive surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient.ConclusionsHistorical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.",2016,0,1,10.1017/S1463423615000250,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=112475916&site=ehost-live

It represents a real clinical and socio-economic problem may be due to the lack of a diagnostic, therapeutic and care pathway (DTCP) tool for LUTS/BPH that considers elderly people population in its whole complexity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the proposed DTCP LUTS/BPH tool. Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 278 patients over 75 years old with non-neurogenic LUTS recruited from February to July 2014 by 10 general practitioners (GP) and two assisted sanitary residences (ASR). Only five GPs and one ASR were provided with the complete DTCP LUTS/BPH tool to create two different groups of patients: group A (138 patients) was treated without the aid of the DTCP; group B (140 patients) was treated according to the DTCP. Results: At 1 year of follow-up, the patients of Group B compared with Group A achieved a greater and significant mean reduction in the questionnaires score (International Prostate Symptom Score, Quick prostate test and QoL) linked to a higher increase in the flowmetry parameters (Qmax) and a lower postvoid residual. Furthermore, in Group B compared to Group A, a greater improvement of hydronephrosis, creatinine values and erectile dysfunction (ED) were obtained at 1 year of follow-up. Conclusion: The encouraging results obtained from this study are significant and support the use of this diagnostic, therapeutic and care tool (DTCP) as the ideal pathway management for elderly men with LUTS associated to BPH and ED. Further studies with greater number of elderly subjects and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm DTCP utility in the clinical management of LUTS/BPH and ED.",2016,0,1,10.1111/ijcp.12849,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=118056183&site=ehost-live
146,147,Shift Work To Balance Everyday Life - A Salutogenic Nursing Perspective In Home Help Service In Sweden.,"agosti,madelaine.törnquist","Background. Nurses in Sweden have a high absence due to illness and many retire before the age of sixty. Factors at work as well as in private life may contribute to health problems. To maintain a healthy work–force there is a need for actions on work-life balance in a salutogenic perspective. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of resources in everyday life to balance work and private life among nurses in home help service. Methods. Thirteen semi-structured individual interviews and two focus group interviews were conducted with home help service nurses in Sweden. A qualitative content analysis was used for the analyses. Result. In the analyses, six themes of perceptions of recourses in everyday life emerged; (i) Reflecting on life. (ii) Being healthy and taking care of yourself. (iii) Having a meaningful job and a supportive work climate. (iv) Working shifts and part time. (v) Having a family and a supporting network. (vi) Making your home your castle. Conclusions. The result points out the complexity of work-life balance and support that the need for nurses to balance everyday life differs during different phases and transitions in life. In this salutogenic study, the result differs from studies with a pathogenic approach. Shift work and part time work were seen as two resources that contributed to flexibility and a prerequisite to work-life balance. To have time and energy for both private life and work was seen as essential. To reflect on and discuss life gave inner strength to set boundaries and to prioritize both in private life and in work life. Managers in nursing contexts have a great challenge to maintain and strengthen resources which enhance the work-life balance and health of nurses. Salutogenic research is needed to gain an understanding of resources that enhance work-life balance and health in nursing contexts.",2015,0,1,10.1186/s12912-014-0054-6,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103759461&site=ehost-live

A higher than expected mortality was detected amongst these patients, prompting a change in the hip fracture pathway. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a change in orthogeriatric provision on hip fracture outcomes and care quality indicators. Patients and Methods: the hip fracture pathway was changed from a geriatric consultation service to a completely integrated service on a dedicated orthogeriatric ward. A total of 1,894 consecutive patients with hip fractures treated in the 2 years before and after this intervention were analysed. Results: despite an increase in case complexity, the intervention resulted in a significant reduction in mean length of stay from 27.5 to 21 days (P < 0.001), a significant reduction in mean time to surgery from 41.8 to 27.2 h (P < 0.001) and a significant 22% reduction in 30-day mortality (13.2-10.3%, P = 0.04). After controlling for the effects of age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Grade and abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), the effect of integrating orthogeriatric services into the hip fracture pathway significantly reduced the risk of mortality (odds ratio 0.68, P = 0.03).

Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. Results Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants.

Their mean age was 86.6 years, and their average length of stay in the institution was 317.3 days. The results lent support to the hypothesis that exposing residents with dementia to language beyond their comprehension ability could result in agitated behavior.

Background The older population is increasing worldwide. Currently, there is a shift in care for older people from institutional care to home care. Providing home care in a person's home involves several challenges, including the complexity of communication. Design A descriptive observational design with a qualitative approach was used. Methods The data consisted of audio recordings of real-life encounters during home care visits between nurse assistants and older persons, collected in 2014. A hermeneutic phenomenological analysis was conducted. Results Communicative challenges were identified: (a) in situations where the older persons had a different view than the nurse assistants on the care task and its content; and (b) when unexpected actions or turns occurred in the communication. Challenges included older person's existential issues, fragility and worries and concerns, which often appeared to be only vaguely expressed and difficult to verbally detect and tackle. This engendered a risk of misinterpretation or ignorance of these challenges. Conclusion The findings point to the importance of communication as the key to facilitate person-centred home care.

In 2015, AHRQ funded a technical brief to describe the state of the science related to safety in the NH setting to inform a research agenda. Thirty-six recent systematic reviews evaluated NH safety-related interventions to address these 4 adverse events and reported mostly mixed evidence about effective approaches to ameliorate them. Furthermore, these 4 events are likely inadequate to capture safety issues that are unique to the NH setting and encompass other domains related to residents' quality of care and quality of life. Future research needs include expanding our definition of safety in the NH setting, which differs considerably from that of hospitals, to include contributing factors to adverse events as well as more resident-centered care measures. Second, future research should reflect more rigorous implementation science to include objective measures of care processes related to adverse events, intervention fidelity, and staffing resources for intervention implementation to inform broader uptake of efficacious interventions. Weaknesses in implementation contribute to the current inconclusive and mixed evidence base as well as remaining questions about what outcomes are even achievable in the NH setting, given the complexity of most resident populations. Also related to implementation, future research should determine the effects of specific staffing models on care processes related to safety outcomes.

Based on our research and clinical experience, we advocate the joint use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale, and propose a two-tiered assessment process. The first differentiation in this process is made by means of a cut-off score to determine whether or not depressive symptoms exist. If depressive symptoms are present, a second system of differentiation may be employed to identify discrete symptom factors.

Design Retrospective study of hospitalizations. Setting Hospitalizations from nursing facilities ( NF) including Medicare and Medicaid-covered stays, and Medicaid Home and Community- Based Services ( HCBS) waiver programs. Participants Dually eligible individuals who received Medicare skilled nursing facility ( SNF) or Medicaid NF services or HCBS waiver services in 2005. Interventions None. Measurements Potentially avoidable hospitalizations were defined by an expert panel that identified conditions and associated Diagnostic Related Groups ( DRGs) which can often be prevented or safely and effectively managed without hospitalization. Results More than one-third of the population was hospitalized at least once, totaling almost 1 million hospitalizations. The admitting DRG for 382,846 (39%) admissions were identified as PAH. PAH rates varied considerably among states, and blacks had a higher rate and costs for PAH than whites. Five conditions (pneumonia, congestive heart failure, urinary tract infections, dehydration, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma) were responsible for 78% of the PAH. The total Medicare costs for these hospitalizations were $3 billion, but only $463 million for Medicaid. A sensitivity analysis, assuming that 20%-60% of these hospitalizations could be prevented, revealed that between 77,000 and 260,000 hospitalizations and between $625 million and $1.9 billion in expenditures could be avoided annually in this population. Conclusion Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are common and costly in the dually eligible population. New initiatives are needed to reduce PAH in this population as they are costly and can adversely affect function and quality of life.",2012,0,1,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.03920.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104568209&site=ehost-live
85,86,"Staff Views On The Resident Assessment Instrument, Rai/Mds, In Nursing Homes, And The Use Of The Cognitive Performance Scale, Cps, In Different Levels Of Care In Stockholm, Sweden.","hansebo,g","Multidimensional functional assessment is the basis of individualized care. It is especially important in the care of elderly, with the complexity of symptomatology and often with cognitive impairment present. An assessment instrument for elderly persons, used in this study, is the Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) and its incorporated MDS Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS). The purposes of the study were to demonstrate the cognitive performance in elderly persons in different levels of care by using the CPS and to elicit the views of staff on use of the RAI/MDS. Cognitive impairment was found in 1276 elderly persons in six levels of care studied, an important factor to consider when organizing care of elderly. An intervention study was carried out for 1 year in three nursing home wards, with training and supervision in implementation of the RAI/MDS including individualized and documented care. Part of a questionnaire was used to evaluate staff (n = 50) views on using the instrument. A majority of the staff thought that the RAI/MDS could contribute to the improvement of quality of care, documentation in nursing records, and in co-operation and engagement. Further research is necessary to elicit more knowledge on the usefulness and benefits of the instrument.",1998,0,1,10.1046/j.1365-2648.1998.00707.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107293860&site=ehost-live
84,85,Empirical Testing Of A Longitudinal Model Derived From The Roy Adaptation Model.,"ducharme,f","This article presents the steps and results of the empirical testing of a theoretical longitudinal model, derived from Roy's nursing conceptual model, of the psychosocial determinants of adaptation in different target groups. The model was elaborated and empirically verified based on the integrated results of four longitudinal studies involving groups vulnerable to mental health problems. By means of structural equation analyses, the cross-sectional model was verified at two points in time. The results showed that the model was relatively stable over time. The model was also tested using longitudinal data. Results showed little consistency in the patterns of relationships across studies. The significant links that emerged from the analyses shed some fight on the complexity of the process of adaptation to different types of stressors. They underscore the importance for nursing practice to develop interventions aimed at certain variables: perceived stress, conflicts in the exchange of support, and passive and avoidance coping strategies. The results also highlight the importance of the relationship between perceived stress, passive/avoidance coping strategies and psychological distress.",1998,0,1,,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107162181&site=ehost-live
82,83,Association Between Continuing Education And Job Satisfaction Of Nurses Employed In Long-Term Care Facilities.,"robertson,em","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this descriptive, correlational study was to investigate the relationship between continuing education and job satisfaction among RNs and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) employed in long-term care facilities. METHOD: Herzberg's Motivational-Hygiene Theory was used as a framework to guide the design of the study. The Professional Educational Activities Scale and the McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale were completed by 110 nurses employed in long-term care facilities. RESULTS: No difference was found between type of employment status (full-time versus part-time) on the level of professional educational activities. However, RNs participated in more continuing education activities than LPNs. Nurses who reported higher family incomes also had greater participation in educational activities. Registered nurses reported greater job satisfaction than LPNs. No significant difference was found between the degree of job satisfaction for Black and White nurses. The results of this study indicated nurses who participated in more continuing education activities scored higher on the job satisfaction scale. CONCLUSION: As the elderly population increases, a critical need exists for nurses to be knowledgeable about current research-based information, including the economic and psychosocial effects of illness in later life. To provide the most effective care for the elderly population, nurses in long-term care must be knowledgeable about the complexity and specific characteristics of chronic illnesses. Continuing education activities are an important way to access this information.",1999,0,1,,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107077388&site=ehost-live
152,153,Palliative Medicine Update: A Multidisciplinary Approach.,"vissers,kris.c.p","Palliative medicine is a young specialty that is officially recognized in relatively few countries. The World Health Organization published an adapted definition in 2002, describing palliative care as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. When the accent is shifting from curative to palliative, the goal of management is the maintenance or improvement of the patient's quality of life. The different dimensions of palliative care and the multitude of types of care to be provided require a multidisciplinary, well-functioning team, effective communication and a clear task division between primary and hospital care. Considering the complexity of care for incurable patients, a multidisciplinary approach is a prerequisite to balance curative and palliative intervention options. Optimal functioning of a team requires excellent training, communication and a description of the tasks and responsibilities of each team member. More and more advanced care planning is introduced in palliative care, focusing on an early identification of patients in a palliative trajectory and on the prevention of annoying symptoms, hoping that this approach results in an improved quality of life for the individual patient, less useless technical investigations and a better end-of-life care on the place the patient and his family desires.",2013,0,1,10.1111/papr.12025,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104218509&site=ehost-live

However, little is known about the relational aspects of care involving migrant care workers and older people. Given that the care relationship is closely linked to quality of care, and that the Irish and UK sectors are increasingly restricted by economic austerity measures, this lack of information is a concern for care practice and policy. Our paper explores the relationship between migrant care workers and older people in Ireland and the UK and draws on data collected in both countries, including focus groups with older people (N = 41), interviews with migrant care workers (N = 90) and data from a survey of and interviews with employers. The findings illustrate the complexity of the migrant care worker–older person relationship; the prevalence of need orientated, friendship and familial-like, reciprocal, and discriminatory interlinking themes; and the role of individual, structural and temporal factors in shaping these relationships.",2013,0,1,10.1017/S0144686X11001309,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104318251&site=ehost-live

The findings reveal the complexity of the carers’ ambivalence when facing a conflict of interest, weighing up between the older persons’ right to self-determination and external demands. The carers are alone in their ambivalence, and the conclusion is that they need help and support to be more present in the encounter. The implication for this study is to focus on care as a person-centered practice and to focus on people as interdependent on support carers to maintain older people’s right to self-determination in the relationship.",2013,0,1,10.1177/0969733012455566,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=85920117&site=ehost-live

It is at this juncture that they should be given the opportunity to participate in planning their future care. An advance care plan (ACP) is a means for people with capacity to document their preferences for their care and to enable providers to advocate on their behalf. Some people will have lost mental capacity before admission to a care facility, so it is essential for staff to be familiar with the complexities of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to support residents approaching the end of life.

This study illuminates registered nurses' descriptions and experiences of stroke patients and the nursing care given in nursing homes, with a focus on cognition and mood. Registered nurses responsible for the care of stroke patients in nursing homes were asked to describe the individual patient's state of health and the nursing care given. Patients' cognition and mood have been selected for this article. A qualitative content analysis was used to group the text into categories.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The NH residents participating in 2 studies: the U.L.I.S.S.E. study and the Umbria Region survey. Participants: A total of 2215 nursing home residents. Measurement: Each resident underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline by means of the RAI MDS 2.0. Dementia diagnosis was based on ICD-9 codes. Results: The prevalence of dementia diagnosis according to ICD-9 codes was 50.7% (n = 1123), whereas 312 subjects had cognitive impairment with a cognitive performance scale score ≥3 without a diagnosis of dementia. Only 56 NH residents were treated (5% of the sample) and the main drugs used were cholinesterase inhibitor, whereas only 1 subject was treated with memantine. Limiting our analysis to patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer''s disease, who are those reimbursed by the public health care system for receiving antidementia drugs, the percentage rose to 11.3%. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate a high rate of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of dementia in Italian NH residents. Potential explanations include the lack of systematic assessment of cognitive functions, the limitations to antidementia drug reimbursement, the complexity of the reimbursement procedure itself, and the high prevalence of patients with severe dementia. Older NH residents still lack proper access to state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment for a devastating condition such as dementia.",2012,0,1,10.1016/j.jamda.2012.05.015,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104422013&site=ehost-live

While there is a wide range of research on the perspectives of live-in caregivers (including domestic workers) in destination countries, few studies address the perspective of families who hire them. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, range and nature of international literature on the needs and experiences of employers/families and care recipients of live-in caregivers. We undertook a scoping review of the literature on this topic using Arksey and O'Malley's five stages. With the assistance of a health science librarian, a comprehensive search of nine databases was undertaken from April to July 2014. Two research assistants independently reviewed 2493 articles. The data were analysed through data charting, numerical summary and thematic analysis. Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria for the scoping review. Many of these studies ( n = 7) were conducted in Israel, and the majority ( n = 8) focus on elderly care recipients. The findings reveal the diverse roles live-in caregivers perform, including emotional and physical care; changes in family dynamics and roles upon hiring a live-in caregiver; the negative experiences, including abuse, of live-in caregivers and elderly care recipients; the positive outcomes for families with a live-in caregiver; and families' common perception that live-in caregivers are like kin, a part of the family.

133,134,Nursing Students' Preferences For Clinical Placements In The Residential Aged Care Setting.,"lea,emma","Aims and objectives To examine nursing student placement preferences submitted as online comments to a university's placement management system, to inform strategies for positive residential aged care experiences. Background There are predicted shortages of nurses to service an ageing population. Clinical placements undertaken by undergraduate nursing students help shape their attitudes and are a key determinant of career decision-making, yet there is little research about why students prefer particular placement areas. Design Analysis of qualitative data from a placement management system. Methods Of 6,610 comments received between 2007-2014, 607 related to aged care and were coded according to preferences for being placed in a residential aged care facility, with reasons for this preference thematically coded and quantified. Results Four hundred and one comments (66.1%) related to students requesting not to be allocated residential aged care for the upcoming placement, primarily due to previous experience in the sector; 104 (17.1%) referred to aged care in a neutral manner, focusing on conflict of interest; 102 (16.8%) related to a request for an aged care placement. Conclusions The student nurse comments characterise students as being focused on maximising their learning, while considering prior experience. In some cases, increased exposure to aged care is considered to offer limited learning opportunities, which is concerning and suggests that both the tertiary and aged care sectors have a joint responsibility to pursue recognition of aged care nursing as a specialised, highly skilled role. Relevance to clinical practice Nursing programme providers should ensure curriculum content and exposure to aged care placement clearly identify the complexities of care and provide genuine opportunities for knowledge acquisition and skill development based on multifaceted resident care needs.

Methods: Thirty-one staff from eight RACFs, five GPs and four RiR RNs participated in individual or group interviews. Results: Residential aged care facility staff and GPs valued and relied upon RiR to manage unwell residents.

We conducted interviews with 30 independent‐living men and women aged 67–93 in three municipalities in Sweden. The interviews explored how they cared for themselves and other older people who were not family. Interviews were conducted between December 2017 and May 2018 and later transcribed and analysed using grounded theory. Our paper presents one of the first studies on informal care practices among older people that looks beyond the definition of formal care to understand how such care complements formal care services. The findings show that older people participate in several care arrangements to care for themselves as well as for others. The arrangements feature different types of mutuality and include distant relations to other older people and larger more or less formalised groups. The findings highlight the importance of looking beyond conceptualisations of care based on understandings of formal care and specific relationships as a frame for understanding informal care. To promote older people's health by cultivating and supporting older people's care for themselves and others, research and healthcare practitioners need to explore and acknowledge the significance and complexity of older people's everyday care practices.",2020,0,1,10.1111/hsc.12897,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141527294&site=ehost-live
109,110,Being A Spectator In Ambiguity—Family Members' Perceptions Of Assisted Bodily Care In A Nursing Home.,"holmberg,bodil","Aim: The aim of this study was to explore family members' perceptions of assisted bodily care in a nursing home. Background: Many older people living in nursing homes need assisted bodily care, provided by assistant nurses. This means exposedness, as the assistance is often provided under stress, but also brings pleasure. Family members, who may wish to and often benefit from continuing to provide assisted bodily care, are perceived as visitors and are expected to relinquish the assisted bodily care to the assistant nurses. Design: This study has a qualitative design with a phenomenographic approach. Methods: Data were collected through semi‐structured interviews (n = 13) with family members of older people who were aged > 80, permanently living in a nursing home, suffering from multimorbidity, and in daily need of assisted bodily care. The data were analysed using a phenomenographic method. Results: Three categories of description presenting an increasing complexity were identified. The family members perceived that assisted bodily care is built upon a respect for the older person's self‐determination, practically supported by assistant nurses, and complemented by family members. Conclusions: In the family members' perceptions, assisted bodily care signifies ambiguity, as they find themselves balancing between the older persons' need for self‐determination and need for help, and, further, between their trust in the assistant nurses' skills and their own perceived inadequacies in intimate assisted bodily care. Implications for practice: Policies that address the family members' role in nursing homes are needed. Furthermore, time for collaboration is needed for assistant nurses to inform and explain care decisions, become aware of the family members' perceptions of their situation and learn from them.",2020,0,1,10.1111/opn.12289,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141629075&site=ehost-live

The aim of this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still maintaining their own dignity. Methods: Data were collected in 2009–2010 in open semi‐structured interviews and follow‐up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an in‐depth data analysis. Results: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the follow‐up of policy for older people.",2020,0,1,10.1111/scs.12708,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141997556&site=ehost-live
113,114,Assessment And Provision Of Continuing Healthcare: An Integrative Literature Review.,"lee,gerry","NHS continuing healthcare is a package of care that is arranged and funded solely by the NHS where an individual has been found to have a 'primary health need'. Individuals who may be eligible have a right to be assessed for NHS continuing healthcare, and this assessment is undertaken by healthcare professionals using a national framework. However, there is a lack of literature on continuing healthcare and its assessment process. The aim was to review the literature on undertaking and providing continuing healthcare in terms of workforce roles, education and training, and competencies. A literature search was undertaken to identify relevant literature on continuing healthcare. Primary searching of electronic internal databases and indices at the Royal College of Nursing and King's College London was used, alongside a further database search and hand searching. A narrative synthesis of the literature was used to synthesise the findings, and a thematic analysis was undertaken to identify themes from the literature. The literature search identified 100 articles, of which 84 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or provided insufficient details in the abstract. A total of 18 articles were included and examined in detail. Four themes were identified in the literature: complexity of care in transitioning care from hospital to home; different care models; importance of education of healthcare professionals; and role of continuing healthcare. Healthcare professionals – including nurses – should receive further training in caring for older people, especially in relation to continuing healthcare. Since there is an increasing ageing population, there is an increasing requirement for continuing healthcare, and thus further research examining all aspects of this care is required.",2019,0,1,10.7748/nop.2019.e1199,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=148703965&site=ehost-live

An existing service robot and a scenario were used as a concrete case, which was discussed and analyzed during focus group sessions with older adults (n = 38), informal caregivers (n = 24), and professional caregivers (n = 35) in the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom. A total of seven topics—privacy, task execution, environment, appearance, behavior, visitors, and communication—were explored. The results showed that some of the characteristics mentioned were unique to a user group, but several were cross-cutting. Overall, potential users expected the service robot to be customizable in order to match the users' needs and preferences. Also, high expectations concerning its functioning and behavior were expressed, which sometimes could even be compared to the qualities of a human being. This emphasizes the complexity of service robot development for older adults, and highlights the need for a personalized and flexible solution.

The next administration must create an adequately prepared workforce; strengthen the role of public health; remediate disparities and inequities; develop, evaluate, and implement new approaches to care delivery; allocate resources to achieve patient-centered care and outcomes, including palliative and end-of-life care; and redesign the structure and financing of long-term services and supports. If these priorities are addressed proactively, an infrastructure can be created that promotes better health and equitable, goal-directed care that recognizes the preferences and needs of older adults.",2021,0,1,10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01470,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=148446145&site=ehost-live
117,118,Use Of Prescription Drugs In The Older Adult Population—A Nationwide Pharmacoepidemiological Study.,"christensen,line.due","Purpose: Multi-morbidity and polypharmacy are common among older people. It is essential to provide a better understanding of the complexity of prescription drug use among older adults to optimise rational pharmacotherapy. Population-based utilisation data in this age group is limited. Using the Danish nationwide health registries, we aimed to characterise drug use among Danish individuals ≥ 60 years. Methods: This is a descriptive population-based study assessing drug prescription patterns in 2015 in the full Danish population aged ≥ 60 years. The use of specific therapeutic subgroups and chemical subgroups and its dependence on age were described using descriptive statistics. Profiles of drug combination patterns were evaluated using latent class analysis. Results: We included 1,424,775 residents (median age 70 years, 53% women). Of all the older adults, 89% filled at least one prescription during 2015. The median number of drug groups used was five per person. The most used single drug groups were paracetamol and analogues (34%), statins (33%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (24%). Eighteen drug profiles with different drug combination patterns were identified. One drug profile with expected use of zero drugs and 11 drug profiles expected to receive more than five different therapeutic subgroup drugs were identified. Conclusion: The use of drugs is extensive both at the population level and increasing with age at an individual level. Separating the population into different homogenous groups related to drug use resulted in 18 different drug profiles, of which 11 drug profiles received on average more than five different therapeutic subgroup drugs.",2019,0,1,10.1007/s00228-019-02669-2,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=137507144&site=ehost-live
98,99,"Cross-Sectional Study Of Prevalence And Correlates Of Urinary Incontinence In Older Home-Care Clients With Type 2 Diabetes In Ontario, Canada.","northwood,melissa","Urinary incontinence (UI) is a burdensome condition for older adults with diabetes receiving home-care services, yet little is known about the prevalence and correlates of UI in this population. The objective of this cross-sectional study, informed by a complexity model, was to determine the prevalence and correlates of UI in older adults with diabetes receiving home care in Ontario, Canada. In this study, we analyzed population-level data of the most recently completed Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care from 2011 to 2016 for older (≥65 years) home-care clients with diabetes. Older adults with daily or multiple daily episodes of UI were compared with adults who were continent or had less than daily UI on sociodemographic, functional, psychosocial and clinical variables. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine correlates of UI in this population. Of 118,519 older adults with diabetes, 39,945 (33.7%) had daily or multiple daily episodes of UI. Correlates of UI included: impaired function in activities of daily living (odds ratio [OR], 5.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.14‒5.50), cognitive impairment (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 2.28‒2.47), female sex (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.82‒1.93), multiple (≥2) chronic conditions (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.74‒1.93), presence of a distressed caregiver (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.27‒1.35), making economic trade-offs (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11‒1.34) and falls (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19‒1.26). Urinary incontinence is common among older adults with diabetes using home-care services.

Narrative review. LTSS for older adults post-incarceration. Literature review and policy analysis. Skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, adult foster homes, and informal care from family and friends compose LTSS for older adults, but their utilization suffers from access and payment complexities, especially for older adults post-incarceration. A combination of public-private partnerships, utilization of health professional trainees, and unique approaches to informal caregiver support, including direct compensation to caregivers, could help older adults reentering our communities following prison. Long-standing gaps in US LTSS are revealed by the coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic.

120,121,Pain Assessment For Nursing Home Residents: A Systematic Review Protocol.,"dirk,kennedy","Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Background: The burden of pain in nursing homes is substantial; however, pain assessment for both acute and chronic conditions remains inadequate, resulting in inappropriate or inadequate treatment. Complexities in assessing resident pain have been attributed to factors (barriers and facilitators) arising at the resident, healthcare provider, and healthcare system levels. Objectives: In this systematic review protocol, we identify our research approach that will be used to critically appraise and synthesize data in order to assess barriers and facilitators to pain assessment in nursing home residents aged ≥65 years. Methods: This is a Cochrane style systematic review protocol adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols reporting standards. This review will include primary (original) qualitative literature concerning either barriers or facilitators to pain assessment in older adult nursing home residents. A thematic analysis approach will be employed in collating and summarizing included data and will be categorized into resident, healthcare provider, and system-level factors. Database searches will include Abstracts in Social Gerontology, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Discussion: The identification of barriers and facilitators to pain assessment in older adult nursing home residents may assist healthcare providers across all platforms and levels of education to improve pain assessment among nursing home residents.

121,122,Seeing The Collective: Family Arrangements For Care At Home For Older People With Dementia.,"ceci,christine","With the predicted growth in the number of people with dementia living at home across the globe, the need for home-based care is expected to increase. As such, it will be primarily family carers who will provide this crucial support to family members. Designing appropriate support for family carers is thus essential to minimise risks to their health, to prevent premature institutionalisation or poor care for persons with dementia, as well as to sustain the effective functioning of health and social care systems. To date, the high volume of research related to care at home and acknowledged low impact of interventions suggests that a re-examination of the nature of care at home, and how we come to know about it, is necessary if we are to advance strategies that will contribute to better outcomes for families. This paper describes findings from an ethnographic study that was designed to support an analysis of the complexity and materiality of family care arrangements – that is, the significance of the actual physical, technological and institutional elements shaping care-giving situations. In this paper, we describe the arrangements made by one family to show the necessary collectivity of these arrangements, and the consequences of the formal care system's failure to respond to these.",2019,0,1,10.1017/S0144686X17001477,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=136001986&site=ehost-live
122,123,The Health Care Aide Position In Nursing Homes: A Comparative Survey Of Nurses' And Aides' Perceptions.,"zysberg,leehu","The health care aide position embodies one of the most basic paradoxes of long-term care for older adults: those who have the most contact and most intensive interaction with nursing-home residents are also those having the least training, authority, and status within the system. They therefore hold one of the keys to quality care in many settings, especially nursing homes. In the absence of agreement on the position's roles, responsibilities, and authority, it is important to examine how the position is perceived by the key members in the long-term-care framework. The current study examined and compared health care aides' and nurses' perceptions of the position in nursing-home settings in Israel, using a standardized tool developed for this inquiry. The comparison accounted for potential intervening factors that may help better understand the job requirements and boundaries. A comparative survey design. 30 nursing homes (of at least 20 beds) in northern Israel. We used convenience sampling to recruit 369 health care aides and 261 nurses (a total of 630 participants). The main instrument of data collection was specially designed and validated for this study. It was based on a qualitative study that defined basic content units representing tasks importance, knowledge, and personal characteristics for the job. Participants found it difficult to prioritize the job components or to differentiate between core tasks and characteristics and the secondary aspects of their job. General care, profession-specific knowledge, and emotional abilities were endorsed the most by participants. Cleaning, communication, and safety were ranked lower (although rankings were still considerably high). However, previous experience as a health care aide undermined incumbents' perceptions of their own responsibilities and professionalism. Incumbent health care aides rated most factors higher than nurses did, with the exception of the importance of communication. Our results may help decision makers understand the complexity around the health care aide position, manage and develop it more effectively while setting standards (training and certification, performance appraisal, and more) for professionalization processes and better defining the division of nursing work between health care aides and nurses.",2019,0,1,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.03.007,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=137213511&site=ehost-live

Specifically, we address the research question: 'How do expectations of informal care impact spousal caregivers in later life?' Methods: These comprise interpretive qualitative in‐depth interviews in order to understand the lived experience of caregiving within the context of long‐term marriage. Results: Findings highlight the complexity and diversity of marital relationships as the context of informal care. Individual and social obligations were evident in key themes, demonstrating how spouses automatically assume and continue in caregiver roles in later life. Conclusion: Caregiving is an expectation of couples in long‐term marriages, regardless of the relationship quality and willingness to care. Normative expectations also impact decision‐making around future care planning and transitions away from home‐based care.

124,125,Healthy Aging: American Geriatrics Society White Paper Executive Summary.,"friedman,susan.m","In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, ""Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?"" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

96,97,Within‐Couple Dissimilarities In Functional Impairment As Determinants Of Spousal Care Arrangement Among Older Married Couples.,"liu,huiying","Existing research on spousal care focuses on one spouse receiving care from the other, which fails to address the complexity that is created when both spouses experience some impairments. Our study included situations in which one or both spouses have functional impairments when examining the extent to which spouses from the same couple hold a (dis)similar level of functional impairment and whether such within‐couple (dis)similarity has an impact on the spousal care arrangement. A subsample of 1170 older married couples was selected from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study. Descriptive statistics were used for describing the level of each spouse's functional impairment regarding the number of limitations in activities (activities of daily living [ADL]) or instrumental ADL (IADL). Logistic regressions were used to examine whether spousal dissimilarity in functional impairment (dissimilar, similarly low, similarly high) was associated with spousal care arrangement. Within couples with one functionally impaired spouse, the impaired spouse was more likely to receive spousal care when reporting a higher level of ADL/IADL impairment. Within couples with two functionally impaired spouses, the more impaired person was more likely to receive spousal care (without giving back) when spouses reported dissimilar level of IADL impairment; spouses were more likely to report mutual care when they had similarly high levels of IADL impairment. By documenting the role of spousal dissimilarities in functioning for determining spousal care arrangement, our study can inform couple‐based interventions that capitalize on each spouse's capabilities and resources.",2021,0,1,10.1002/nur.22113,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=149047107&site=ehost-live
127,128,Does An Impaired Capacity For Self-Care Impact The Prevalence Of Social And Emotional Loneliness Among Elderly People?,"canjuga,irena","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of self-care on the prevalence of loneliness among elderly people living in retirement homes and older people living in their homes/communities.Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted through standardized SELSA-L assessment loneliness questionnaires and the Self Care Assessment Worksheet for self-care assessment. The results were processed using the Kruskal–Wallis test.Findings The obtained results have shown that impaired self-care ability affects the prevalence of loneliness among the elderly almost the same in both groups of participants. However, regarding the relationship between the state of health and self-care, only a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of loneliness is found in the case of the participants living in their homes, with the worst health condition affecting the poorer psychological care.Research limitations/implications It is necessary to point out the limitations of the research, primarily sample limitations and the selected design of the study. The sample consisted of two different and relatively small groups of participants which could adversely affect the representativeness of the sample and reduce the possibility of generalising the results. The next limiting factor is the age distribution the authors used in the research, where the age of the participants as a very important variable was collected by age range and not precisely which consequently resulted in inequality in subgroup sizes. Thus, the middle age (75–85) covers up to ten years, which is a huge range at an older age and can mean major differences in functional ability, and can impact the self-care assessment.Practical implications Nurses are indispensable in care for the elderly and they need to promote and encourage self-care of the elderly through health care. Elderly people living in retirement homes should be allowed to participate equally in health care in order to preserve their own autonomy and dignity. However, to benefit those who live in their homes, nurses should be connected to the local community and thus stimulate various forms of preventative (testing blood sugar levels, blood pressure and educating on the importance of preventive examinations) or recreational activities in the environment of elderly people with the goal of preserving their functional abilities.Originality/value The impact of self-care on loneliness was not sufficiently researched, and this paper contributed to understanding the complexity of loneliness phenomena among the elderly with the aim of developing a model of prevention.",2018,0,1,10.1108/WWOP-01-2018-0001,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=133160874&site=ehost-live

The current article provides a case exemplar to demonstrate the use of the Rothschild Care Planning Process for Resident Choice with one NH resident who was perceived by staff to be making a risky choice. The scenario outlines six steps to the process, highlighting areas for focus and documentation that addresses complexities and best practices in delivering PCC.

There is, however, little discussion in methodological literature about this type of data; the meaning is taken for granted and the data are regarded as simple sources of information, which are convenient and cost-effective. This approach denies the social meaning of the data, and is likely to lead to misinterpretation of the content.

A review of patient education, concordance (compliance), health promotion and pharmacology literature was undertaken to illuminate the current status of the evidence for effective medication interactions. Observation (n = 48) and audio-recordings (n = 37) of nurse-patient interactions about medication were collected in seven different contexts focusing on adult and older-person, mental-health and community-nursing settings. Post-interaction interviews with nurse (n = 29) and patient (n = 39) participants were conducted to explore views on the observed interaction and to attempt to identify intended outcomes of the interactions. Issues highlighted by the research concern: the need for a pluralistic understanding of what might constitute the evidence base for practice; a requirement to recognise the complexities of professionals' and patients' perspectives on what constitutes quality; the need for caution in the application of generic `standards' to individualised care contexts, coupled with the problem of what counts as effective outcomes.

81,82,An Investigation Of The Components Of Best Nursing Practice In The Care Of Acutely Ill Hospitalized Older Patients With Coincidental Dementia: A Multi-Method Design.,"tolson,d","The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method research.",1999,0,1,10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01194.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107084789&site=ehost-live
161,162,"The Prognostic Value Of Heart Rate Variability In The Elderly, Changing The Perspective: From Sympathovagal Balance To Chaos Theory.","nicolini,paola","Heart rate variability (HRV) is the temporal beat-to-beat variation in successive RR intervals on an electrocardiographic (ECG) recording and it reflects the regulation of the heart rate (HR) by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). HRV analysis is a noninvasive tool for the assessment of autonomic function that gained momentum in the late 1980s when its clinical relevance as a predictor of mortality was established by a milestone study by Kleiger et al. in patients with postacute myocardial infarction. In the last few decades, the increasing availability of commercial ECG devices offering HRV analysis has made HRV a favorite marker for risk stratification in the setting of cardiovascular disease. The rapid aging of the world population and the growing popularity of HRV have also fueled interest for the prognostic value of HRV in the elderly, outside a specific cardiological context. However, the discussion of HRV measures in the elderly is still very much centered on the rather reductionistic model of sympathovagal balance, with the orthosympathetic and parasympathetic limbs of the ANS exercising opposing effects on the heart via autonomic tone. The expanding application of nonlinear dynamics to medicine has brought to the forefront the notion of system complexity, embedded in the mathematical concepts of chaos theory and fractals, and provides an opportunity to suggest a broader interpretation for the prognostic significance of HRV, especially in the elderly. Although the use of novel indices of HRV may be hampered by practical issues, a more holistic approach to HRV may still be safeguarded if traditional time- and frequency-domain measures are viewed in terms of autonomic modulation. This review focuses on HRV in geriatric populations. It considers studies on the prognostic value of HRV in elderly subjects, discussing the potential confounding effect of erratic rhythm, and concentrates on the conceptual distinction between autonomic tone and autonomic modulation. It also briefly addresses the question of the practicality of ECG recordings and identifies a promising area for future research in the effects of common noncardioactive drugs on HRV.

182,183,Blood Pressure In Frail Older Adults: Associations With Cardiovascular Outcomes And All-Cause Mortality.,"masoli,jane.a.h","Background Blood pressure (BP) management in frail older people is challenging. An randomised controlled trial of largely non-frail older people found cardiovascular and mortality benefit with systolic (S) BP target <120 mmHg. However, all-cause mortality by attained BP in routine care in frail adults aged above 75 is unclear. Objectives To estimate observational associations between baseline BP and mortality/cardiovascular outcomes in a primary-care population aged above 75, stratified by frailty. Methods Prospective observational analysis using electronic health records (clinical practice research datalink, n  = 415,980). We tested BP associations with cardiovascular events and mortality using competing and Cox proportional-hazards models respectively (follow-up ≤10 years), stratified by baseline electronic frailty index (eFI: fit (non-frail), mild, moderate, severe frailty), with sensitivity analyses on co-morbidity, cardiovascular risk and BP trajectory. Results Risks of cardiovascular outcomes increased with SBPs >150 mmHg. Associations with mortality varied between non-frail <85 and frail 75–84-year-olds and all above 85 years. SBPs above the 130–139-mmHg reference were associated with lower mortality risk, particularly in moderate to severe frailty or above 85 years (e.g. 75–84 years: 150–159 mmHg Hazard Ratio (HR) mortality compared to 130–139: non-frail HR = 0.94, 0.92–0.97; moderate/severe frailty HR = 0.84, 0.77–0.92). SBP <130 mmHg and Diastolic(D)BP <80 mmHg were consistently associated with excess mortality, independent of BP trajectory toward the end of life. Conclusions In representative primary-care patients aged ≥75, BP <130/80 was associated with excess mortality.

184,185,Comparing The Case-Mix Of Frail Older People At Home And Of Those Being Admitted Into Residential Care: A Longitudinal Study.,"de,almeida.mello.johanna","Background: In order to optimize interventions and services in the community, it is important to identify the profile of persons who are able to stay at home and of those who are being admitted into residential care. Understanding their needs and their use of resources is essential. The main objective of the study is to identify persons who are likely to enter residential care based upon their needs and resource utilization, so that care providers can plan interventions effectively and optimize services and resources to meet the persons' needs.Methods: This is a longitudinal quasi-experimental study. The data consists of primary data from the community setting collected every six months during the period of 2010-2016. Interventions had the goal of keeping older people longer at home. Participants were at least 65 years old and were living in the community. The interRAI Resource Utilization Group system (RUG-III) was used to calculate the case-mix indexes (CMI) of all participants. Comparisons were made between the case-mix of those who were still living at home and those who were admitted into residential care at follow-up.Results: A total of 10,289 older persons participated in the study (81.2 ± 7.1 yrs., 69.1% female). From this population, 853 participants (8.3%) were admitted into residential care. The CMI of the persons receiving night care at home were the highest (1.6 at baseline and 1.7 at the entry point of residential care), followed by persons receiving occupational therapy (1.5 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care) and persons enrolled in case management interventions with rehabilitation (1.4 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care). The CMIs at follow-up were significantly higher than at baseline and the linear regression model showed that admission to residential care was a significant factor in the model.Conclusions: The study showed that the RUG-III system offers possibilities for identifying persons at risk of institutionalization. Interventions designed to avoid early nursing home admission can make use of the RUG-III system to optimize care planning and the allocation of services and resources. Based on the RUG-III case-mix, resources can be allocated to keep older persons at home longer, bearing in mind the complexity of care and the availability of services in the community.",2020,0,1,10.1186/s12877-020-01593-w,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=143608927&site=ehost-live

However the number of bed days they occupy are disproportionate to this; comprising 48% of the total bed days. The average number of bed days rises exponentially with age, with those aged under 70 averaging less than two days; those aged 80 averaging approximately 4.5 bed days and those aged over 90 approximately 7 bed days. This disparity was recognised and a Medicine for Older People (MOP) liaison team comprising consultant geriatrician and Advanced Clinical Practitioner in Frailty starting working with the acute surgical team in November 2018, initially providing support two days a week, increasing to 5 days in March 2019. Methods: The MOP liaison team meets with the acute surgical team each morning identifying and discussing relevant patients; those identified as living with frailty with associated complexity and uncertainty. This group of patients is then reviewed by the MOP liaison team utilising the principles of the comprehensive geriatric assessment to formulate a person-centred plan. Plans are discussed and coordinated with the surgical, nursing and therapy teams utilising a multi-disciplinary/ multi-professional approach. Results: Length of stay is the main outcome measure and readmissions are monitored. Data on admission length and readmissions was analysed from April 2018 and has continued following commencement of the liaison service. Primary results-Length of stay has reduced from 4.4 to 3.3 days on average for all over 70-year-olds admitted to the ASU team. Whilst admission rates have dropped across all age ranges the biggest reduction in readmissions is among the over 80-year-olds with an almost 50% reduction as opposed to a 33% reduction in the under 70 age group Conclusions: Proactively managing the admissions and discharges of patients with frailty allows them to receive the right care at the right time in their period of crisis and shortens their admissions by approximately 25%.",2020,0,1,10.1093/ageing/afz183.32,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141761300&site=ehost-live
73,74,Geropharmacology. Recognizing And Preventing Drug Interactions In Older Adults With Hiv.,"mclennon,sm","Currently, adults older than 50 account for approximately 15% of the total number of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases. As baby boomers age, the number of older adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is expected to rise. This expected increase is due, in part, to an increase in the number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV, and, in part, to improved efficacy of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications used to treat HIV/AIDS. Older individuals who are infected with HIV also are expected to seek treatment for common conditions associated with aging. Thus, a considerable risk for drug interactions between the medications used specifically for HIV treatment and those used for other conditions exists. This article is intended as a guide for gerontological nurses facing these complexities. It includes reviews of the goals of HAART therapy and of the mechanisms of drug interactions, as well as detailed discussions related to the effects of HAART and their potential interactions with medications used to treat conditions commonly found in aging populations.",2003,0,1,10.3928/0098-9134-20030401-05,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106701107&site=ehost-live

Perturbations in protein/amino acid metabolism are associated with both functional impairment and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the present study, we compared the concentrations of a panel of circulating 37 amino acids and derivatives between frail/pre-frail older adults with T2DM and robust non-diabetic controls. Sixty-six functionally impaired older persons aged 70+ with T2DM and 30 age and sex-matched controls were included in the analysis. We applied a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-based analytical strategy to characterize the metabotype of study participants. The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found to be two latent variables. The proportion of correct classification was 94.1 ± 1.9% for frail/pre-frail persons with T2DM and 100% for control participants. Functionally impaired older persons with T2DM showed higher levels of 3-methyl histidine, alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, ethanolamine sarcosine, and tryptophan. Control participants had higher levels of ornithine and taurine. These findings indicate that a specific profile of amino acids and derivatives characterizes pre-frail/frail older persons with T2DM. The dissection of these pathways may provide novel insights into the metabolic perturbations involved in the disabling cascade in older persons with T2DM.",2020,0,1,10.3390/nu12010199,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141547056&site=ehost-live
71,72,Nursing Home Care: Changes After Supervision.,"hansebo,g","BACKGROUND: An intervention project was conducted in three nursing home wards in Sweden. Most patients had severe dementia. The intervention consisted of supervision for individualized and documented nursing care, based on multidimensional assessment. AIM: To illuminate changes in carers' approach after the intervention. METHODS: Several data collections were conducted across the intervention and consisted of nursing documentation, patient life stories as told by carers, video recorded interactions, stimulated recall interviews and a questionnaire. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the analyses. FINDINGS: The findings from the different methods mirrored each other and added to the credibility of the intervention. Communicated knowledge about patients improved in nursing documentation and also as told by carers. Carers were differently skilled in managing the complexity of nursing care situations before as well as after the intervention, but the intervention contributed to developing carers in 'confirming nursing care'. They also improved in their ability to verbalize reflections about their everyday life with patients with dementia. CONCLUSION: Supervision made it possible for carers to share their lived experiences about their day-to-day life with patients, which could promote personal and professional development and thus improve care quality. It also appeared that a detailed assessment tool used as part of the nursing process contributed to seeing a patient as a real person behind a dementia surface.",2004,0,1,10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02888.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106715963&site=ehost-live

Furthermore, the combination of PCC, Integrated Care (IC) and Pro-active care are widely recognised as desirable for multi-morbid elderly, yet previous studies focus on single components only, leaving synergies unexplored. The effect of a synergistic intervention, which implements 1) Person-centred goal-oriented care driven by ""What matters to you?"" with 2) IC and 3) pro-active care is unknown.Methods: Inspired by theoretical foundations, complexity science, previous health service research and a patient-driven evaluation of care quality, we designed the Patient-Centred Team (PACT) intervention across primary and secondary care. The PACT team collaborate with the patient to make and deliver a person-centred, integrated and proactive multi-morbidity care-plan. The control group receives conventional care. The study design is a pragmatic six months prospective, controlled clinical trial based on hospital electronic health record data of 439 multi-morbid frail elderly at risk for emergency (re) admissions referred to PACT and 779 propensity score matched controls in Norway, 2014-2016. Outcomes are emergency admissions, the sum of emergency inpatient bed days, 30-day readmissions, planned and emergency outpatient visits and mortality at three and six months follow-up.Results: The Rate Ratios (RR) for emergency admissions was 0,9 (95%CI: 0,82-0,99), for sum of emergency bed days 0,68 (95%CI:0,52-0,79) and for 30-days emergency readmissions 0,72 (95%CI: 0,41-1,24). RRs were 2,3 (95%CI: 2,02-2,55) and 0,9 (95%CI: 0,68-1,20) for planned and emergency outpatient visits respectively. The RR for death at 3 months was 0,39 (95% CI: 0,22-0,70) and 0,57 (95% CI: 0,34-0,94) at 6 months.Conclusion: Compared with propensity score matched controls, the care process of frail multi-morbid elderly who received the PACT intervention had a reduced risk of high-level emergency care, increased use of low-level planned care, and substantially reduced mortality risk.

69,70,A Nursing Analysis Of The Causes Of And Approaches For Urinary Incontinence Among Elderly Women In Nursing Homes.,"enriquez,el","Urinary incontinence is a widespread but often ignored problem among elderly women residing in nursing homes. Despite numerous research studies performed within this setting, few have been able to demonstrate lasting change in the care of and enduring outcomes in this population. However, neither the most commonly used definitions of incontinence nor current management approaches are meeting the needs of institutionalized frail elderly, particularly women, who are twice as likely as men to demonstrate symptoms of the condition. Costs in terms of quality of life and expense of care are staggering. Because many believe that a holistic approach may provide direction for management of urinary incontinence, and because nursing is a holistic profession, a solution to the challenges involved in treating incontinence among the elderly potentially lies in utilizing a nursing as opposed to medical framework for the analysis of factors and care. Specifically, the complexities of testing necessary to differentiate current diagnoses might be simplified by classifying incontinence in a different way, such as using nurse-identified levels of need as opposed to physiologically-based factors. The use of nursing theory to guide patient assessment and an evaluation of systems of care provides a fresh approach to this long-standing problem.",2004,0,1,,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106668011&site=ehost-live

195,196,Cognitive Function In Prefrail And Frail Community-Dwelling Older Adults In China.,"ma,lina","Background: Physical frailty, characterized by reduced physiologic complexity and ability to cope with stressors, is closely associated with cognitive impairment, which increases the risk of poor clinical outcomes. To better capture the association between frailty and cognitive impairment, a new construct, cognitive frailty, has been proposed. Cognitive frailty is a clinical condition characterized by the simultaneous presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment. There is little evidence on the relationship between physical frailty and cognition, as well as cognitive frailty, in Chinese older adults. We aimed to elucidate whether physical frailty is associated with cognitive impairment in an older Chinese population.Methods: Data were obtained from the China Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Study. The sample comprised 3202 community-dwelling adults, aged 60 years and older, from seven Chinese cities. Physical frailty was assessed using a modified, four-item version of the Fried criteria, according to frailty phenotype. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).Results: The prevalence of physical frailty, prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and cognitive frailty was 9.9, 33.9, 7.5, and 2.3%, respectively (weighted: 8.8, 33.8, 6.5, and 2.0%). The prevalence of the combination of prefrail/frail and cognitive impairment was 5.1% (weighted 4.5%). Frail participants performed worse on global cognition and all cognitive domains than robust and prefrail participants. The MMSE total score was positively correlated with walking speed and negatively correlated with age and frailty. A multivariate logistic regression revealed that after adjusting for age, gender, education level, living area, and chronic diseases, frailty, exhaustion, slowness, and inactivity were significantly associated with poor global cognition.Conclusions: The standard prevalence of physical frailty, prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and cognitive frailty in community-dwelling older adults in China was 8.8, 33.8, 6.5, and 2.0%, respectively.

196,197,Sharing Frailty-Related Information In Perioperative Care: An Analysis From A Temporal Perspective.,"fürstenau,daniel","Background: Especially patients older than 65 years undergoing surgery are prone to develop frailty-related complications that may go far beyond the index hospitalization (e.g., cognitive impairment following postoperative delirium). However, aging-relevant information are currently not fully integrated into hospitals' perioperative processes.Methods: We introduce a temporal perspective, which focuses on the social construction of time, to better understand existing barriers to the exchange of frailty-related data, targeting complexity research. Our chosen context is perioperative care provided by a tertiary hospital in Germany that has implemented a special track for patients over 65 years old undergoing elective surgery. The research followed a participatory modelling approach between domain and modelling experts with the goal of creating a feedback loop model of the relevant system relationships and dynamics.Results: The results of the study show how disparate temporal regimes, understood as frameworks for organizing actions in the light of time constraints, time pressure, and deadlines, across different clinical, ambulant, and geriatric care sectors create disincentives to cooperate in frailty-related data exchanges. Moreover, we find that shifting baselines, meaning continuous increases in cost and time pressure in individual sectors, may unintentionally reinforce - rather than discourage - disparate temporal regimes.Conclusions: Together, these results may (1) help to increase awareness of the importance of frailty-related data exchanges, and (2) impel efforts aiming to transform treatment processes to go beyond sectoral boundaries, taking into account the potential benefits for frail patients arising from integrated care processes using information technology.",2019,0,1,10.1186/s12913-019-3890-y,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=134594485&site=ehost-live

We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications. PARTICIPANTS Frail older persons and older persons with limited life expectancy. MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of tools. RESULTS: We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medication‐specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, step‐wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in very low‐quality studies). CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use.

198,199,Co-Designing Urban Living Solutions To Improve Older People'S Mobility And Well-Being.,"cinderby,steve","Mobility is a key aspect of active ageing enabling participation and autonomy into later life. Remaining active brings multiple physical but also social benefits leading to higher levels of well-being. With globally increasing levels of urbanisation alongside demographic shifts meaning in many parts of the world this urban population will be older people, the challenge is how cities should evolve to enable so-called active ageing. This paper reports on a co-design study with 117 participants investigating the interaction of existing urban spaces and infrastructure on mobility and well-being for older residents (aged 55 + years) in three cities. A mixed method approach was trialled to identify locations beneficial to subjective well-being and participant-led solutions to urban mobility challenges. Spatial analysis was used to identify key underlying factors in locations and infrastructure that promoted or compromised mobility and well-being for participants. Co-designed solutions were assessed for acceptability or co-benefits amongst a wider cross-section of urban residents (n = 233) using online and face-to-face surveys in each conurbation. Our analysis identified three critical intersecting and interacting thematic problems for urban mobility amongst older people: The quality of physical infrastructure; issues around the delivery, governance and quality of urban systems and services; and the attitudes and behaviors of individuals that older people encounter. This identified complexity reinforces the need for policy responses that may not necessarily involve design or retrofit measures, but instead might challenge perceptions and behaviors of use and access to urban space. Our co-design results further highlight that solutions need to move beyond the generic and placeless, instead embedding specific locally relevant solutions in inherently geographical spaces, populations and processes to ensure they relate to the intricacies of place.",2018,0,1,10.1007/s11524-018-0232-z,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=130103235&site=ehost-live

With decreasing life expectancy, medication use should shift from cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment to increase the patient's well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of (potentially) dangerous medications were reduced, and non-pharmacological alternatives were considered. There were some medicines added, as underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. Deprescribing long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family as ""giving up hope"".

Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months).

Of consequence, discharge of an elderly patient must be considered in a new cultural perspective and should be imagined as a well-structured process starting from admission to surgical department and finishing with the patient discharge in a setting able to support her/him in the best possible way. The lack of a suitable discharge planning and of a proper transition program in the elderly subjects increases the risk of quick re-admission and may negatively affect the functional and the status quality of life of patients and caregivers. To reduce the risk of negative outcome it is essential a hospital organization dedicated to the discharge of frail older patients considering: (1) adequate attention to assess the comprehensive clinical/social/care conditions; (2) respect of the expectations of the patient and her/his relatives; (3) formalization of institutional roles or teams designated to the planning and coordination of discharge; (4) good knowledge of management programs of transitional care, and (5) strong communication/information ability in patients transition between hospital, home care and community settings.",2018,0,1,10.1007/s40520-017-0885-6,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=128548053&site=ehost-live

203,204,Multimorbidity: Will It Stand The Test Of Time?,"ford,joanna.c","The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical problems. However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and researchers.",2018,0,1,10.1093/ageing/afx159,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=127189162&site=ehost-live
204,205,Frail Questionnaire Screening Tool And Short-Term Outcomes In Geriatric Fracture Patients.,"gleason,lauren.jan","Objectives There are limited screening tools to predict adverse postoperative outcomes for the geriatric surgical fracture population. Frailty is increasingly recognized as a risk assessment to capture complexity. The goal of this study was to use a short screening tool, the FRAIL scale, to categorize the level of frailty of older adults admitted with a fracture to determine the association of each frailty category with postoperative and 30-day outcomes. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Level 1 trauma center. Participants A total of 175 consecutive patients over age 70 years admitted to co-managed orthopedic trauma and geriatrics services. Measurements The FRAIL scale (short 5-question assessment of fatigue, resistance, aerobic capacity, illnesses, and loss of weight) classified the patients into 3 categories: robust (score = 0), prefrail (score = 1–2), and frail (score = 3–5). Postoperative outcome variables collected were postoperative complications, unplanned intensive care unit admission, length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and orthopedic follow-up after surgery. Thirty-day outcomes measured were 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality. Analysis of variance (1-way) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare continuous variables across the 3 FRAIL categories. Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Multiple regression analysis, adjusted by age, sex, and Charlson index, was conducted to study the association between frailty category and outcomes. Results FRAIL scale categorized the patients into 3 groups: robust (n = 29), prefrail (n = 73), and frail (n = 73). There were statistically significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidity, dementia, functional dependency, polypharmacy, and rate of institutionalization, being higher in the frailest patients. Hip fracture was the most frequent fracture, and it was more frequent as the frailty of the patient increased (48%, 61%, and 75% in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, respectively). The American Society of Anesthesiologists preoperative risk significantly correlated with the frailty of the patient (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3–4: 41%, 82% and 86%, in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, P < .001). After adjustment by age, sex, and comorbidity, there was a statistically significant association between frailty and both LOS and the development of any complication after surgery (LOS: 4.2, 5.0, and 7.1 days, P = .002; any complication: 3.4%, 26%, and 39.7%, P = .03; in robust, prefrail, and frail groups). There were also significant differences in discharge disposition (31% of robust vs 4.1% frail, P = .008) and follow-up completion (97% of robust vs 69% of the frail ones). Differences in time to surgery, unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day readmission and mortality, although showing a trend, did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Frailty, measured by the FRAIL scale, was associated with increase LOS, complications after surgery, and discharge to rehabilitation facility in geriatric fracture patients. The FRAIL scale is a promising short screen to stratify and help operationalize the perioperative care of older surgical patients.",2017,0,1,10.1016/j.jamda.2017.07.005,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=126351189&site=ehost-live

206,207,The Need Of Operational Paradigms For Frailty In Older Persons: The Sprintt Project.,"cesari,matteo","The exploration of frailty as a pre-disability geriatric condition represents one of the most promising research arenas of modern medicine. Frailty is today indicated as a paradigmatic condition around which the traditional healthcare systems might be re-shaped and optimized in order to address the complexities and peculiarities of elders. Unfortunately, the lack of consensus around a single operational definition has limited the clinical implementation of frailty in clinical practice. In these last years, growing attention (even beyond the traditional boundaries of geriatric medicine) has been given to physical performance measures. These instruments have shown to be predictive of negative health-related events and able to support an accurate estimation of the 'biological age' in late life. The strong construct of physical performance measures also makes them particularly suitable for the assessment of the frailty status. Furthermore, the adoption of physical performance measures may help render the frailty condition more organ-specific (i.e., centred on the skeletal muscle quality) and less heterogeneous than currently perceived. The translation of the frailty concept by means of physical performance measures implicitly represents an attempt to go beyond traditional paradigms. In this context, the recently funded 'Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies' (SPRINTT) project (largely based on such a novel approach) may indeed fill an important gap in the field and provide key insights for counteracting the disabling cascade in the elderly.",2017,0,1,10.1007/s40520-016-0712-5,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=121658093&site=ehost-live

Ensuring that they are given appropriate and timely access to the range of hospital and community medical, rehabilitation and social care facilities has become more difficult due to the complexity of management options now available, and limited senior medical staff time. METHODS:we established a scheme in which specialist nurses made first assessments of all inter-departmental referrals to a hospital department of geriatric medicine. We evaluated the scheme prospectively using process and outcome data. RESULTS:2825 new patients were seen by two nurses in the first two years, an average of 5.4 per weekday (range 0-17). Mean time from admission to referral was 9 days. Most referrals were seen within 1 day. Mean total length of hospital stay was 43 days (range 1-351). Seven percent died on the referring ward, and 31% were discharged directly from the referring ward. Almost half were accepted for in-patient rehabilitation. Sixty percent of these were discharged home. Thirteen percent were transferred to an acute geriatric medical or stroke ward. One-quarter of these died. Senior medical review was requested in 8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:nurses could select patients suitable for rehabilitation, identify those requiring on-going acute in-patient care, and make arrangements for supported direct discharges where appropriate.

171,172,Assessment And Treatment Approaches For Behavioral Disturbances Associated With Dementia In The Nursing Home: Self-Reports Of Physicians' Practices.,"cohen-mansfield,j","OBJECTIVES: Behavior problems are common in dementia, yet little is known about how physicians deal with these problems in practice. This article reports on a survey asking physicians to describe, with respect to the last nursing home resident with dementia they treated for behavior problems, the behaviors observed, assessment methods used, suspected etiology of the problem, types of intervention, and their reaction to the intervention process. DESIGN: This is a descriptive study presenting responses to a Web-based questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 110 physicians providing services to nursing home residents. MEASUREMENTS: Physicians answered a close-ended questionnaire with open-ended 'other' options concerning symptoms, methods of assessment, suspected etiological factors, and interventions to describe the last nursing home resident they treated for behavior problems associated with dementia. RESULTS: Resisting care was the most frequently reported symptom (71%). Physicians were most likely to attribute the behavior problems to the indirect effects of dementia on the ability to remember, communicate, and comprehend (67%). Most (87%) reported using more than one method for treating these problems. Rate of reported use of psychotropic drugs (80%) was slightly higher than that for nonpharmacological methods (75%), with the majority (61%) reporting use of both of these methods. Standardized instruments were not used in assessment. Forty percent of the participants reported feeling satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention they provided, and close to a third (32%) reported feeling frustrated with the intervention process. CONCLUSION: The data underscore the complexity in the treatment of behavior problems. Despite federal regulations limiting their use, the potential for side effects, and ambivalence toward such treatment, psychotropic drugs are still used for the majority of nursing home residents with behavior problems associated with dementia. On the other hand, physicians report employing nonpharmacological methods to a closely similar extent, although their role in the implementation of these treatments is less clear. Further work is needed to clarify physicians' involvement in and decision to use nonpharmacological interventions.",2008,0,1,10.1016/j.jamda.2008.02.010,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105696599&site=ehost-live

This will only increase in frequency and complexity as the new century dawns. Delirium and agitation affect morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and costs--in short, outcomes. To manage and care for these patients, orthopaedic nurses must first update their knowledge of acute disorders that can disrupt mental status and behavior, and the effects of systemic events on brain function. With the knowledge of the pathophysiology of delirium and agitation, nurses then need to refine their assessment and intervention skills.

Moreover, suggestions are made on how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure population.",2004,1,1,10.1016/j.ejcnurse.2004.08.004,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106574254&site=ehost-live
75,76,"Stroke Patients In Nursing Homes: Eating, Feeding, Nutrition And Related Care.","kumlien,s","The purpose of this study was to explore eating, feeding and nutrition among stroke patients in nursing homes as described by their nurses and by assessments. Registered Nurses were interviewed about an individual stroke patient's state of health, care needs and nursing care received and nursing records were reviewed. Information on eating, feeding and nutrition was extracted from the interviews and nursing records. A comprehensive instrument, the Resident Assessment Instrument, was also used to assess these patients' state of health. The domains of eating, feeding and nutrition were focused on in this study. Manifest content analysis was used. The results showed that more than 80% of the stroke patients in nursing homes were assessed as having some sort of dependence in eating. According to the Registered Nurses, 22 out of 40 patients demonstrated different eating disabilities. The number of eating disabilities in individual patients ranged from 1 to 7, which emphasized the complexity of eating disabilities in stroke patients. Dysphagia was reported in almost one-fourth of the patients and 30% were described and/or assessed as having a poor food intake or poor appetite. The Registered Nurses' descriptions of the eating disabilities, nutritional problems and their care were often vague and unspecific. Only six weights were documented in the nursing records and there were no nutritional records. The findings highlight the importance of making careful observations and assessments, and of maintaining documentation about eating and nutrition early after a patient's arrival in the nursing home to enable appropriate care and promotion of health.",2002,0,1,10.1046/j.1365-2702.2002.00636.x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106966986&site=ehost-live
177,178,Theoretical Constraints In The First Phase Of A Multisite Case Study Of Health Services.,"scavenius,m","This article illuminates the difficulties involved in conducting a multisite case study of different health services. It confines itself to describing the initial phase of such an inquiry. It argues that both the methodological and the content-related complexity of such research places great theoretical constraints on the researcher. Such constraints should not be resolved by simply applying some pregiven theory. It is shown how theoretical constraints arise in the need to formulate some notion of comparability for the different sites under investigation. Because such comparability is conceptualized mainly in a confrontation with the empirical data, the description of the process contains several reformulations of the research problem, taking note of various pitfalls and stumbling blocks. Finally, the general results of the pilot study are reported.",1996,0,1,10.1177/104973239600600404,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107312679&site=ehost-live
172,173,"Care Staff Working With People With Dementia: Training, Knowledge And Confidence.","hughes,j","The complexity and diversity of the needs of older people in care homes presents challenges to those responsible for caring for residents, in particular nursing and care assistant staff providing the majority of direct care. This study examines the degree of knowledge and confidence of these staff in caring for people with dementia and seeks to identify factors which can contribute to greater confidence. It reveals that although staff knowledge of dementia is reasonable, confidence in dealing with related situations is lower. Results also suggest that training can positively influence staff confidence in dealing with behaviour associated with the condition, recognizing that it is one of many factors influencing performance as a paid carer. These findings are discussed in terms of the quality of care provided to residents with dementia, the forms such training might take and the importance of a work environment which facilitates on-the-job training.",2008,0,1,10.1177/1471301208091159,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=109849846&site=ehost-live

Inherent risks include high-risk extractions of redundant leads when extraction is required at a later date.Objectives: We aimed to report our experience with transvenous lead extraction (TLE) at the time of device upgrade.Methods: All consecutive TLE procedures at the time of device upgrade at the Cleveland Clinic between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2012 were included (n = 503). Success and complications were defined according to the Heart Rhythm Society consensus document on TLE.Results: There were a total of 984 leads in place, and 719 were targeted with extraction (589 pacer and 130 defibrillator leads, 63 of them being dual-coil leads). In all patients, TLEs aimed to avoid abandoning leads. Concomitant lead management issues included lead malfunction (15%), previously abandoned leads (9%), vascular access occlusion (6%), or leads on advisory (3%). In most procedures (75.4%), special extraction tools were needed. The complete procedural and clinical success rates were 96.6% and 97.2%, respectively. During planned extractions, damage of coexisting leads occurred in 19 patients (3.8%), eventually requiring extraction. The major and minor complication rates were 1% and 1.4%, respectively.Conclusion: In a high-volume center, TLEs at the time of device upgrade were successful in the vast majority of patients with a low complication rate.",2017,1,0,10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.08.019,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=126231887&site=ehost-live

A secondary objective was to develop and assess the quality of an algorithm for ascertaining admissions into publicly funded nursing homes in Ontario using a combination of health administrative data sources that indirectly identifies the residential status of new nursing home residents. DESIGN Population‐based serial cross‐sectional study with an accompanying quality assessment study of algorithms. SETTING Publicly funded nursing care homes in Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS The reference standard for the assessment of algorithm performance was 21 544 newly admitted nursing home residents identified from the Resident Assessment Instrument‐Minimum Data Set in 2012. The selected algorithm was then used to identify serial cross‐sectional cohorts of newly admitted residents between 2000 and 2015 that ranged in size between 14 651 and 23 630 residents. MEASUREMENTS Sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, and functional status of new residents were determined upon admission to examine patterns in the cohorts' profiles. RESULTS: The proportion of residents aged 85 years and older increased from 45.1% to 53.8% over 16 years. The proportions of individuals with seven or more chronic conditions (from 14.1% to 22.1%) and with nine or more prescription medications (from 44.9% to 64.2%) have also increased in parallel over time. Hypertension, osteoarthritis, and dementia were the most prevalent conditions captured, with the proportion of incoming residents with dementia increasing from 42.3% to 54.1% between 2000 and 2015. Newly admitted residents were more likely to have extensive physical and cognitive impairments upon admission. CONCLUSION: Admission trends show that new residents were older and had greater multimorbidity and limitations in physical functioning over time.

The findings suggest that the old male athletes controlled their bodies in order to gain physical capital, but that different ways of employing the body were valued in the contexts of aging, athletics and masculinity. On the whole the men displayed a contradictious way of relating to their bodies and health. However, they could to some extent reconcile the tensions between the different norms of body and health by emphasizing the need to preserve physical autonomy, an ideal that appeared to be valid in all three contexts.",2013,1,0,10.3149/jmh.1201.29,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103938283&site=ehost-live
277,279,The Complexity Of Food For People With Multiple Long-Term Health Conditions.,"francis,helen","INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of long-term health conditions (LTCs) continues to increase and it is normal for people to have several. Lifestyle is a core feature of the self-management support given to people with LTCs, yet it seems to fail to meet their needs. From a larger study exploring the experiences of this group, this paper reports on the role of food and mealtimes, and the effect of the nutritional advice on the lives of people with several LTCs. METHODS: The experiences of 16 people with several advanced LTCs were explored using multiple qualitative case studies. Over an 18-month period, contact with participants included monthly conversations, two longer, semi-structured interviews and one interview with their primary care clinicians. The data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There was profound social, psychological and cultural significance of food to the participants. These aspects of food were then described using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health. The approach to food and nutrition participants experienced in health care was closely associated with conventional weight management. They found this advice largely irrelevant and therefore ineffective. DISCUSSION: The pressure people with several LTCs experience during clinical encounters has perverse effects on wellbeing and reinforces an overall sense of failure. This research challenges the assumption that all people have the will, agency and income to follow the advice they receive about nutrition and exercise. Considering people's needs using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health offers clinicians a framework to re-conceptualise the core features of self-management support and provide realistic, compassionate care that will optimise the quality of life for people with multiple LTCs.",2018,1,0,10.1071/HC18020,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=132130311&site=ehost-live
268,269,Reducing Cost And Complexity Of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Using Universal Donors For Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection.,"kim,kyeong.ok","Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation resolves recurrent Clostridium difficile infections in greater than 82% of patients. Highly screened, processed universal donor fecal material is available. We compared cost and scheduling efficiency of fecal microbiota transplantation by universal donors to patient-directed donors.Methods: Medical records from a prospectively maintained database of recurrent C. difficile patients who underwent fecal microbiota transplantation between 2012 and 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient-directed donor stool was prepared in our microbiology laboratory using protocol-based screening. We transitioned to purchasing and using universal donor fecal material in 2015. Clinical outcomes, adverse events, time between consult to infusion, consultation fees, and material costs were compared. This was a retrospective comparison of two historical cohorts.Results: A total of 111 fecal microbiota transplantations were performed on 105 patients (56 from patient-directed donors and 55 from universal donors). Median recipient age was 66 years (18-96) with male to female ratio of 1:2.7, equivalent in both cohorts. Total consultation fees were significantly lower in the universal donor group owing to fewer infectious disease consultations. Costs for donor screening and stool preparation were lower in the universal donor cohort ($485.0 vs. $1189.90 ± 541.4, p < 0.001, 95% CI 559.9-849.9). Time from consultations to infusion was shorter in the universal donor cohort (18.9 ± 19.1 vs. 36.4 ± 23.3 days, p < 0.001, 95% CI 9.521-25.591). Recurrences within 8 weeks after fecal microbiota transplantation were equivalent (p = 0.354). Adverse events were equivalent.Conclusions: Fecal microbiota transplantation using universal donors versus patient-directed donors for recurrent C. difficile showed comparable efficacy and short-term complications. The use of universal donors resulted in significant cost savings and scheduling efficiency.",2019,1,0,10.1007/s12325-019-00974-x,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=136788121&site=ehost-live

253,254,"The Complexity Of Diagnosing Sarcoma In A Timely Manner: Perspectives Of Health Professionals, Patients, And Carers In Australia.","weaver,rhys","Background: Prolonged diagnosis intervals occur more often in rare cancers, such as sarcoma. Patients with a delayed diagnosis may require more radical surgery and have a reduced chance of survival. Previous research has focused on quantifying the time taken to achieve a diagnosis without exploring the reasons for potential delays. The aim of this study was to explore patients', carers', and health professionals' perceived barriers to timely diagnosis and referral for treatment for sarcoma.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with: health professionals working with sarcoma (n = 21); patients who have been diagnosed with sarcoma (n = 22); and carers of patients diagnosed with sarcoma (n = 17). Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Four overarching themes were identified: patient perception of symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, lack of experience, and availability of health services. Diagnosis was prolonged by the limited availability of health services, lack of prompt referrals to a sarcoma specialist centre, and diagnostic challenges. Intervals also occurred when patients underestimated the severity of their symptoms and did not seek prompt medical consultation.Conclusions: Patients with a potential sarcoma need to be promptly referred to a sarcoma specialist centre and additional diagnosis pathways need to be developed to reduce the rate of patients being referred to wrong specialists. Sarcoma education must be embedded in medical courses and professional development curricula. A public health approach should be taken to improve sarcoma knowledge and health seeking behaviours in the community.",2020,1,0,10.1186/s12913-020-05532-8,http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=144919917&site=ehost-live
272,273,Better Understanding The Influence And Complexity Of Beliefs On Medication Adherence In Asthma.,"foot,holly","Objective: The aim was to better understand how beliefs influence medication adherence in asthma.Methods: All participants were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid for a diagnosis of asthma. Each participant completed a survey consisting of: Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids was elicited using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Multiple linear regression with interaction effects was used to identify significant predictors of medication adherence and interactions between beliefs.Results: A total of 198 participants completed the survey. The mean(±SD) MARS score was 19.2(±4.5). A multivariable model (adjusted R2 = 0.39) predicted adherence using: age, asthma hospitalisation, timeline (B-IPQ) subscale, necessity and concern (BMQ) subscales, doctor (MHLCS) subscale and the two interaction effects (concerns [BMQ] moderated by chance [MHLCS] and treatment control [B-IPQ] moderated by understanding [B-IPQ]).Conclusion: The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the role of beliefs in medication adherence in asthma.

The close relationship between mental and physical health is reflected in the high frequency with which illnesses of both kinds overlap in an age of multi-morbidity. This study demonstrates that those with comorbid mental health problems show poorer clinical outcomes, lower quality of life and reduced ability to manage physical symptoms effectively. This also affects their capacity to engage in treatment and make decisions, which affects not only their care and treatment but ultimately their quality of life.
