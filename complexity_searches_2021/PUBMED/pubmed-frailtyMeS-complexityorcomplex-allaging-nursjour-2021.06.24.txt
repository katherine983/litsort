AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe how the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) is uniquely suited to 
      meet the needs of older adults throughout the continuum of cancer, to explore the 
      progress that APNs have made in gero-oncology care, and make suggestions for future 
      directions. DATA SOURCE: Google Scholar, PubMed, and CINAHL. Search terms included: 
      "gero-oncology," "geriatric oncology," "Advanced Practice Nurse," "Nurse 
      Practitioner," "older adult," "elderly," and "cancer." CONCLUSION: Over the last 
      decade, APNs have made advances in caring for older adults with cancer by playing a 
      role in prevention, screening, and diagnosis; through evidence-based gero-oncology 
      care during cancer treatment; and in designing tailored survivorship care models. 
      APNs must combat ageism in treatment choice for older adults, standardize 
      comprehensive geriatric assessments, and focus on providing person-centered care, 
      specifically during care transitions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: APNs are 
      well-positioned to help understand the complex relationship between risk factors, 
      geriatric syndromes, and frailty and translate research into practice. Palliative 
      care must expand beyond specialty providers and shift toward APNs with a focus on 
      early advanced care planning. Finally, APNs should continue to establish 
      multidisciplinary survivorship models across care settings, with a focus on primary 
      care.

TI  - Quality of life of older persons in nursing homes after the implementation of a 
      knowledge-based palliative care intervention.
PG  - e12258
LID - 10.1111/opn.12258 [doi]
LID - e12258
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goals of palliative care are to relieve suffering and promote 
      quality of life. Palliative care for older persons has been less prioritised than 
      palliative care for younger people with cancer, which may lead to unnecessary 
      suffering and decreased quality of life at the final stage of life. AIM: To evaluate 
      whether a palliative care intervention had any influence on the perceived quality of 
      life of older persons (≥65 years). METHODS: This study was conducted as a complex 
      intervention performed with an experimental crossover design. The intervention was 
      implemented in 20 nursing homes, with a six-month intervention period in each 
      nursing home. Twenty-three older persons (≥65 years) in the intervention group and 
      29 in the control group were interviewed using the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD 
      questionnaires at both baseline and follow-up. The collected data were analysed 
      using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare paired data between baseline and 
      follow-up. RESULTS: In the intervention group, no statistically significant 
      increases in quality of life were found. This result contrasted with the control 
      group, which revealed statistically significant declines in quality of life at both 
      the dimension and item levels. Accordingly, this study showed a trend of decreased 
      health after nine months in both the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: It 
      is reasonable to believe that quality of life decreases with age as part of the 
      natural course of the ageing process. However, it seems that the palliative care 
      approach of the intervention prevented unnecessary quality of life decline by 
      supporting sensory abilities, autonomy and social participation among older persons 
      in nursing homes. From the ageing perspective, it may not be realistic to strive for 
      an increased quality of life in older people living in nursing homes; maybe the goal 
      should be to delay or prevent reduced quality of life. Based on this perspective, 
      the intervention prevented decline in quality of life in nursing home residents. 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The high number of deaths shows the importance to 
      identify palliative care needs in older persons at an early stage to prevent or 
      delay deterioration of quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the concept of "frailty syndrome" in the literature, according 
      to the method proposed by Walker and Avant. METHODS: It is a concept analysis, 
      guided by the method proposed by Walker and Avant, made operational through an 
      integrative literature review. The search in a scientific database was carried out 
      using the descriptors: Frail elderly, syndrome, phenotype, geriatric assessment, and 
      aging. The literary corpus comprised 66 studies. RESULTS: The study found the 
      antecedents and attributes (categorized as physical, sociodemographic, and 
      behavioral/environmental) that integrate the signs and symptoms evidenced in the 
      "frailty syndrome," as well as the consequences of this concept. The variables were 
      analyzed with emphasis on the conceptions that influence the frailty process of the 
      elderly. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the complexity arising from the 
      multifactorial genesis of the referred syndrome, emphasizing the specificities of 
      the elderly's frailty. However, we recommend conducting further research involving 
      the phenomenon in question to understand the construct better.

TI  - Initiating End-of-Life Care at the Emergency Department: An Observational Study.
PG  - 941-946
LID - 10.1177/1049909119836931 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Terminally ill patients at their end-of-life (EOL) phase attending the 
      emergency department (ED) may have complex and specialized care needs frequently 
      overlooked by ED physicians. To tailor to the needs of this unique group, the ED in 
      a tertiary hospital implemented an EOL pathway since 2014. The objective of our 
      study is to describe the epidemiological characteristics, symptom burden and 
      management of patients using a protocolized management care bundle. METHODS: We 
      conducted an observational study on the database of EOL patients over a 28-month 
      period. Patients aged 21 years and above, who attended the ED and were managed 
      according to these guidelines, were included. Clinical data were extracted from the 
      hospital's electronic medical records system. RESULTS: Two hundred five patients 
      were managed under the EOL pathway, with a slight male predominance (106/205, 51.7%) 
      and a median age of 78 (interquartile range 69-87) years. The majority were 
      chronically frail (42.0%) or diagnosed with cancer or other terminal illnesses 
      (32.7%). The 3 most commonly experienced symptoms were drowsiness (66.3%), dyspnea 
      (61.5%), and fever (29.7%). Through the protocolized management care bundle, 74.1% 
      of patients with dyspnea and/or pain received opiates while 59.5% with copious 
      secretions received hyoscine butylbromide for symptomatic relief. CONCLUSION: The 
      institution of a protocolized care bundle is feasible and provides ED physicians 
      with a guide in managing EOL patients. Though still suboptimal, considerable 
      advances in EOL care at the ED have been achieved and may be further improved 
      through continual education and enhancements in the care bundle.

AB  - Aging together with multimorbidity, polymedication and various social factors are 
      some of the determinants that lead to increasing complexity of care in the elderly, 
      thus making it difficult for health systems to meet their needs. To approach this 
      new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal health and social care 
      systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing specialists trained to 
      address the needs of older people from a perspective of comprehensive care, both for 
      healthy aging, and for the different health problems of this population group, 
      characterized by the consequences of aging and chronicity, towards dependence, and 
      develop the powers established by law in the framework of an interdisciplinary team, 
      for those who have been trained and accredited, thus adding value to the response 
      that health systems have to provide for this growing problem of the 
      'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.

TI  - Strengths and support of older people affected by precarity in South Louisiana.
PG  - e12232
LID - 10.1111/opn.12232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few empirical studies have examined strengths and support of older 
      people in circumstances of precarity. A better understanding of this problem has the 
      potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery. PURPOSE: 
      To investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana. 
      METHOD: More than 300 hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted 
      with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for 
      low-income older persons and two senior citizen centres. RESULTS: The findings 
      demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to 
      manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home-based healthcare services, (b) stress 
      after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive 
      impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support 
      that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological 
      strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love 
      and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home-based 
      services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships 
      and activities, and (i) grocery store and café contacts. CONCLUSION: Home-based 
      services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people 
      because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: This study adds to the literature about precarity among community-based 
      older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The 
      findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home-based services are 
      necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive 
      and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths 
      and supportive resources of older people.

TI  - Narratives of older persons' frailty and physical activity in relation to 
      environmental landscapes and time.
PG  - e12298
LID - 10.1111/opn.12298 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the 
      environmental landscape on the physical activity of older persons experiencing 
      frailty. BACKGROUND: This manuscript describes the second phase of an unpublished 
      larger study in the northern province of Lampang, Thailand. Phase One revealed that 
      14% of 1,788 older persons surveyed were found to have experienced frailty according 
      to Fried's frailty phenotypes, and low physical activity was associated with 
      frailty. In the light of frailty, how older persons experience physical activity in 
      their day-to-day living environments warrants in-depth exploration. DESIGN: This was 
      a qualitative study guided by narrative inquiry. METHODS: In-depth interviews and 
      observations were conducted with 13 older persons living with frailty. The method of 
      analysis was thematic and performance analysis. RESULTS: Two broad themes relating 
      to the environmental landscapes were as follows: (a) limiting environmental 
      landscapes and (b) engaging environmental landscapes. These landscapes, which change 
      across time, refer to physical and social spaces, and beliefs of older persons and 
      their family that have either positive or negative impacts on physical activity of 
      frail older persons. CONCLUSION: Complex interactions between physical and social 
      spaces and beliefs of older persons and family influence the physical activity 
      behaviours of older persons living with frailty. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This 
      study warrants education and policy aiming at creating optimal environmental 
      landscapes to promote physical activity in frail older persons.

AB  - GENERAL PURPOSE: To provide information about changes associated with aging skin and 
      the implications for wound care practitioners. TARGET AUDIENCE: This continuing 
      education activity is intended for physicians, physician assistants, nurse 
      practitioners, and nurses with an interest in skin and wound care. LEARNING 
      OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES: After participating in this educational activity, the 
      participant should be better able to:1. Describe proposed biologic theories of aging 
      and the biology of aging skin.2. Discuss the clinical consequences of aging skin and 
      the implications for wound care practitioners. ABSTRACT: Aging is a complex 
      phenomenon manifested by macromolecular damage, adverse changes to the genome, 
      blunted immunologic function, alterations in body composition, and decreased 
      adaptation to stress. Understanding the changes that skin undergoes with age is 
      essential for wound care practitioners. Accordingly, this article will introduce the 
      reader to theories of aging, the biologic changes associated with aging skin, and 
      clinical considerations for the wound care practitioner, including the concepts of 
      skin failure, Skin Changes At Life's End, and frailty.

PG  - 833-837
LID - 10.12968/bjon.2019.28.13.833 [doi]
AB  - People in nursing and residential homes are more likely to suffer frailty. 
      Registered nurses are a crucial component of the care delivery service and can offer 
      support to patients who have complex care needs and comorbidities and are at risk of 
      unplanned admissions to secondary care. This article explores frailty and the role 
      of the nurse in assessing for frailty. Three aspects of patient care-nutrition 
      status, polypharmacy and exercise and cognitive function-are discussed as areas 
      where nurses can target their interventions in order to support those considered as 
      frail, aiming to reduce the impact of frailty and negative health outcomes.

      review.
PG  - 284, 288-91
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.6.284 [doi]
AB  - As the UK population lives to older ages, with more complex health and social care 
      needs, there comes a time when going to live in a care home might be essential for a 
      frail, older person. Residents and their families expect high-quality care in return 
      for the costs of their placements, but often find this is not the case ( Help the 
      Aged, 2006 ). In order to improve quality in care homes, the Lincolnshire Community 
      Health Services NHS Trust are piloting a care home support team. The new service 
      aims to provide education and training to an unpredictable workforce, with the 
      addition of regular ward rounds in care homes to ensure more proactive care for 
      residents, in order to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and improve the 
      quality of care offered. This article looks at the literature relating to education 
      and training for staff in care homes to support this service. It also aims to use 
      the reviewed articles to identify specific training and education needed to improve 
      quality of care for residents and reduce avoidable hospital admissions.

AB  - Nutrition and hydration are vital components of critical care nursing. However, 
      meeting the nutrition and hydration needs of the critically ill older adult is often 
      complex, because of preexisting risk factors (malnutrition, unintentional weight 
      loss, frailty, and dehydration); as well as intensive care unit-related challenges 
      (catabolism, eating and feeding, end-of-life care). This article highlights the 
      challenges of managing nutrition and hydration in the critically ill older adult, 
      reviews assessment principles, and offers strategies for optimizing nutrition and 
      hydration.

TI  - The Obesity Paradox in Sepsis: A Theoretical Framework.
PG  - 287-294
LID - 10.1177/1099800420905889 [doi]
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome that occurs in response to a severe infection. 
      In recent years, the understanding of the pathobiology of sepsis has been refined, 
      with research describing an altered host response as the underlying cause. Survivors 
      of sepsis often have long hospital stays and suffer from subsequent frailty and 
      long-term health consequences. Predicting attributes of sepsis survivors remains 
      challenging; however, an obesity paradox exists, wherein obese individuals survive 
      sepsis at higher rates than their normal-weight counterparts. We present a model 
      that describes the relationships between sepsis and obesity, focusing on 
      inflammation as a shared pathway for dysregulation in obese and healthy-weight 
      adults. Understanding the interaction of these complex variables is an important 
      first step toward developing interventions and treatments to augment sepsis 
      survival.

TI  - Identifying a Relationship Between Physical Frailty and Heart Failure Symptoms.
PG  - E1-E7
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0000000000000408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with 
      significant symptom burden; however, our understanding of the relationship between 
      symptoms and physical frailty in HF is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was 
      to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. 
      METHODS: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional 
      study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea 
      subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. 
      Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the 
      Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to 
      the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, 
      and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling 
      were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, 
      controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. RESULTS: The mean age of 
      the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 ± 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart 
      Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail 
      participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P < .001), 75% worse wake 
      disturbances (P < .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with 
      those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake 
      disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and 
      improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.

TI  - POLST Facilitation in Complex Care Management: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1177/1049909118797077 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is an 
      advance care planning tool designed for seriously ill patients. The discussions 
      needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not 
      occur in the outpatient setting. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a single-arm feasibility 
      study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a 
      standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. 
      SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a 
      complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. MEASUREMENTS: We 
      assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible 
      patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting 
      Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items 
      about the intervention. RESULTS: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, 
      with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. 
      The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. 
      Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the 
      required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week 
      follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers 
      agreed or strongly agreed that "Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about 
      what I really want." CONCLUSIONS: The POLST facilitation can be successfully 
      delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high 
      fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this 
      approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes.

TI  - The holistic assessment and care planning in partnership intervention study (HAPPI): 
      A protocol for a feasibility, cluster randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 3078-3087
LID - 10.1111/jan.14106 [doi]
AB  - AIM: During an initial phase of this research, an e-Delphi survey was conducted to 
      gain consensus among stakeholders on the components of a nurse-led assessment and 
      care planning intervention for older people who live with frailty in primary care. 
      This feasibility randomized controlled trial (fRCT) will test the proposed 
      intervention and its implementation and determine methods for the design of a 
      conclusive randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The fRCT, with embedded qualitative 
      study, aims to recruit 60 participants. Moderately and severely frail older people 
      will be identified using the electronic frailty index (eFI) and the intervention 
      will be delivered by senior community nurses. The control participants will receive 
      usual primary care for frailty. The study is funded by the National Institute of 
      Health Research (NIHR; funding granted in May 2016, ref: ICA-CDRF-2016-02-018) and 
      received NHS and University Research Ethics Committee approval in 2018. DISCUSSION: 
      There is evidence that the delivery of complex interventions for community-dwelling 
      older people can reduce care home and hospital admissions and falls, there is less 
      evidence for the benefit of any specific type or intensity of intervention or the 
      additional benefits of targeting the frail population. This trial will determine 
      feasibility of the intervention, define recruitment and retention parameters and 
      trial logistics, and decide outcome measures. IMPACT: This study aims to address the 
      limitations of current research by using a systematic method of frailty diagnosis 
      and participant identification, trialling implementation of a person-centred 
      intervention, and testing of feasibility parameters. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      ISRCTN: 74345449.

PG  - 174-179

AB  - Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently 
      complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center 
      expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity 
      patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to 
      initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the 
      supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the 
      need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development 
      of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in 
      elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP 
      (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of 
      hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, 
      p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average 
      decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. 
      $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients 
      admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a 
      significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing 
      facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have 
      proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study 
      institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive 
      outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current 
      practice model.

AB  - Frailty and falls are closely associated with each other as well as with disability, 
      hospitalization, and death. Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail 
      older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a 
      one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 
      community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. 
      After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of 
      falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail 
      participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a 
      viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where 
      these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a 
      lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.

PG  - 261-72
LID - 10.1177/0884533611405794 [doi]
AB  - Older adults who reside in nursing facilities tend to be frail and to have multiple 
      comorbidities, increased risk of unintended weight loss, and protein energy 
      malnutrition. Approximately 5.8% of nursing facility residents in the United States 
      receive enteral feedings. The prevalence is higher for residents with cognitive 
      impairment, ranging from 18% to 34%. In cognitively impaired residents, the majority 
      of tube feeding placements occur in the acute care setting and result in significant 
      use of additional healthcare resources and high postinsertion mortality rates within 
      60 days of insertion. Nursing facilities must abide by state and federal regulations 
      and undergo stringent survey evaluation while balancing complex decisions related to 
      initial placement of feeding tubes. Informed choice, resident-centered care 
      decisions, and the role of advance directives are essential in the decision-making 
      process. In nursing facilities, it is often the registered dietitian who alerts the 
      healthcare team to determine whether a feeding tube is appropriate. Once a tube is 
      placed, healthcare practitioners must make careful decisions related to ordering, 
      administering, and monitoring enteral nutrition (EN) delivery; adequacy of 
      nutritional content; tolerance to feedings; monitoring for potential complications; 
      and the possibility of return to oral feeding or, conversely, the decision to 
      discontinue feedings. Further evidence-based research is needed to document 
      effectiveness, along with research to support positive outcomes for residents in 
      nursing facilities who receive EN. Optimal care requires careful coordination and an 
      interdisciplinary approach across the continuum of care and between caregivers 
      within the individual nursing facility.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To undertake a mixed methods thematic literature review that 
      explored how elderly adults approached decision-making in regard to their health 
      care following discharge. BACKGROUND: A critical time for appropriate health 
      decisions occurs during hospital discharge planning with nursing staff. However, 
      little is known how the 89% of elderly living at home make decisions regarding their 
      health care. Research into older adults' management of chronic conditions emerges as 
      an important step to potentially encourage symptom monitoring, prevent missed care 
      and detect deterioration. All should reduce the risk of hospital re-admission. 
      DESIGN: A mixed methods thematic literature review was undertaken. The structure 
      followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews recommended by the 
      EQUATOR network. METHODS: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus online databases were searched using keywords, 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. References drawn from relevant publications, 
      identified by experts and published between 1995 and 2017 were also considered. 
      Twenty-five qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies and reviews were 
      critically appraised (CASP 2013) before inclusion in the review. Analysis of each 
      study's findings was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (2006) steps to identify 
      major themes and sub-themes. RESULTS: Four main themes associated with 
      health-related decision-making in the elderly were identified: "the importance of 
      maintaining independence," "decision making style," "management of conditions at 
      home" and "discharge planning." CONCLUSION: Health care decision preferences in the 
      elderly emerged as highly complex and influenced by multiple factors. Development of 
      a tool to assess these components has been recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Nurses play a vital role in exploring and understanding the influence that 
      maintaining independence has with each patient. This understanding provides an 
      initial step toward development of a tool to assist collaboration between patients 
      and healthcare professionals involved in their care.

TI  - To use or not to use. A literature review of factors that influence family 
      caregivers' use of support services.
PG  - 20-8; quiz 29
AB  - Many family caregivers of frail older adults postpone or decline accessible and 
      affordable services such as respite, despite their acknowledgement of unmet needs 
      for support and time away from the burdens and stress of caregiving. How caregivers 
      perceive their need for services, and the factors that influence their decisions to 
      use or not to use services, remain poorly understood. This article reviews the 
      literature on family caregiving and the complex interrelated factors that influence 
      caregivers' choices regarding support services. It organizes these factors into four 
      areas: (a) service characteristics, (b) personal predisposing factors that affect 
      perceived need, (c) experiential coping and decision-making patterns, and (d) 
      relational factors. It also examines the implications of this evidence for nursing 
      assessments and interventions with frail older adults and their family caregivers.

TI  - From clinical reasoning to ehealth interventions; a study on how nurses asses care 
      and ehealth in home care.

AB  - The assessment of care in homecare today is complex. Nurses have to decide on care 
      for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise 
      solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, 
      how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 
      homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study 
      shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest 
      eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of 
      eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that 
      eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses 
      need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in 
      close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. 
      Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be 
      convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this 
      with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date 
      information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.

TI  - Managing deterioration in older adults in care homes: a quality improvement project 
      to introduce an early warning tool.
PG  - 58-66
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2019.24.2.58 [doi]
AB  - Many older adults living in care homes have complex health needs requiring 
      comprehensive care. Early warning tools can help identify deterioration, but 
      currently they are less often used in care homes. The aim of this quality 
      improvement project was to introduce an early warning tool, the Significant 7, to 
      facilitate identification and management of deterioration in care home residents. 
      The plan, do, study, act (PDSA) method was used, and process mapping informed a 
      tailored intervention. Introducing the tool had positive outcomes for residents and 
      care staff. There was a reduction in the incidence of pressure ulcers and falls, and 
      care staff were more confident in recognising resident deterioration. Next steps 
      include scaling up the project to further examine how this early warning tool can 
      improve resident, staff and organisational outcomes, in order to explore the 
      potential use of the tool by community nurses with older people living at home.

TI  - Developing a holistic, multidisciplinary community service for frail older people.
PG  - 34-40
LID - 10.7748/nop.2018.e1064 [doi]
AB  - This article explores the development of an ambulatory community service that 
      demonstrates multidisciplinary working to meet the diverse needs of frail older 
      people and their carers. The service comprises advanced nurse practitioners, a 
      pharmacist, a community navigator, consultants, occupational therapists, 
      physiotherapists, a nurse, rehabilitation assistants, a healthcare assistant and an 
      administrator. This multidisciplinary team (MDT) serves adults with complex medical 
      and rehabilitation needs who are being discharged from hospital, staying in bedded 
      rehabilitation units or living at home by offering assessments, investigations and 
      rehabilitation, where appropriate closer to home. The aims of the service are to: 
      keep people well, prevent unplanned hospital admissions, promote health and 
      well-being, reduce the risk of falls, enable independent living and provide 
      rehabilitation. Personalised care plans are developed with patients and their 
      carers. Advanced nursing practice is demonstrated in assessment, investigation, 
      diagnosis, management, referral and non-medical prescribing. Development of this MDT 
      is required to support and promote integrated, evidence-based work. Such development 
      leads to integrated care across communities, and bridges gaps between patients and 
      carers, GPs, home, residential and hospital-based services, and the voluntary, 
      statutory and non-statutory sectors.

AB  - Many people with dementia have other complex health needs, including comorbidity and 
      frailty. Most models of care focus on single diseases and do not take into account 
      the needs of those with comorbidities and dementia. Integration, continuity of care 
      and personalisation are particularly important for this vulnerable group. It is also 
      important to recognise potential barriers to accessing care so that these can be 
      addressed. Issues around providing health care for people with dementia and complex 
      health needs are considered in this article, including management and organisation 
      of care, access to care, models of care, role of the family carer, and prevention of 
      dementia, frailty and long-term conditions.

PG  - 25-9
LID - 10.7748/nop.28.5.25.s25 [doi]
AB  - This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the 
      use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA 
      is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and 
      mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues 
      that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable 
      individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the 
      case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a 
      number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding 
      needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental 
      health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a 
      better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant 
      transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the 
      provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.

AB  - Activity-limiting pain is common among older home care patients and pain management 
      is complicated by the high prevalence of physical frailty and multimorbidity in the 
      home care population. A comparative effectiveness study was undertaken at a large 
      urban home care agency to examine an evidence-based pain self-management program 
      delivered by physical therapists (PTs). This article focuses on PT training, methods 
      implemented to reinforce content after training and to encourage uptake of the 
      program with appropriate patients, and therapists' fidelity to the program. 
      Seventeen physical therapy teams were included in the cluster randomized controlled 
      trial, with 8 teams (155 PTs) assigned to a control and 9 teams (165 PTs) assigned 
      to a treatment arm. Treatment therapists received interactive training over two 
      sessions, with a follow-up session 6 months later. Additional support was provided 
      via emails, e-learning materials including videos, and a therapist manual. Program 
      fidelity was assessed by examining PT pain documentation in the agency's electronic 
      health record. PT feedback on the program was obtained via semistructured surveys. 
      There were no between-group differences in the number of PTs documenting program 
      elements with the exception of instruction in the use of imagery, which was 
      documented by a higher percentage of intervention therapists (p = 0.002). PTs felt 
      comfortable teaching the program elements, but cited time as the biggest barrier to 
      implementing the protocol. Possible explanations for study results suggesting 
      limited adherence to the program protocol by intervention-group PTs include the 
      top-down implementation strategy, competing organizational priorities, program 
      complexity, competing patient priorities, and inadequate patient buy-in. 
      Implications for the implementation of complex new programs in the home healthcare 
      setting are discussed.

TI  - Deconditioning in the hospitalized elderly.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - Deconditioning is a complex process of physiological change following a period of 
      inactivity, bedrest or sedentary lifestyle. It results in functional losses in such 
      areas as mental status, degree of continence and ability to accomplish activities of 
      daily living. It is frequently associated with hospitalization in the elderly. The 
      most predictable effects of deconditioning are seen in the musculoskeletal system 
      and include diminished muscle mass, decreases of muscle strength by two to five 
      percent per day, muscle shortening, changes in periarticular and cartilaginous joint 
      structure and marked loss of leg strength that seriously limit mobility. The decline 
      in muscle mass and strength has been linked to falls, functional decline, increased 
      frailty and immobility. The authors describe a three-pronged strategy to combat 
      deconditioning that includes a model of care appropriate to the growing population 
      of elderly clients, the creation of an "elder-friendly" hospital environment and an 
      exercise program.

TI  - Barriers and enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in heart failure with atrial 
      fibrillation: patient and provider perspectives.
PG  - 4325-4334
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13759 [doi]
AB  - AIMS & OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the barriers and 
      enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in individuals with chronic heart failure 
      (CHF) with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) from the perspective of patients and 
      providers. BACKGROUND: CHF and AF commonly coexist and are associated with increased 
      stroke risk and mortality. Oral anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke risk 
      and improves outcomes. Yet, in approximately 30% of cases, anticoagulation is not 
      commenced for a variety of reasons. DESIGN: Qualitative study using narrative 
      inquiry. METHODS: Data from face-to-face individual interviews with patients and 
      information retrieved from healthcare file note review documented the clinician 
      perspective. This study is a synthesis of the two data sources, obtained during 
      patient clinical assessments as part of the Atrial Fibrillation And Stroke 
      Thromboprophylaxis in hEart failuRe (AFASTER) Study. RESULTS: Patient choice and 
      preference were important factors in anticoagulation decisions, including treatment 
      burden, unfavourable or intolerable side effects and patient refusal. Financial 
      barriers included cost of travel, medication cost and reimbursement. Psychological 
      factors included psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment and depression. Social 
      barriers included homelessness and the absence of a caregiver or lack of caregiver 
      assistance. Clinician reticence included fear of falls, frailty, age, fear of 
      bleeding and the challenges of multimorbidity. Facilitators to successful 
      prescription and adherence were caregiver support, reminders and routine, 
      self-testing and the use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: Many barriers remain to 
      high-risk individuals being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. There 
      are a number of enabling factors that facilitate prescription and optimise treatment 
      adherence. Nurses should challenge these treatment barriers and seek enabling 
      factors to optimise therapy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses can help 
      patients and caregivers to understand complex anticoagulant risk-benefit 
      information, and act as a patient advocate when making complex stroke prevention 
      decisions.

TI  - Frailty: a review of the first decade of research.
PG  - 422-32
LID - 10.1177/1099800412462866 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased 
      vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, 
      hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and 
      operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty 
      development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of 
      conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put 
      forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated 
      pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and 
      exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes 
      of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere 
      length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and 
      metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, 
      lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive 
      decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological 
      approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for 
      future methodological and physiological inquiry.

TI  - The chaos of hospitalisation for patients with critical limb ischaemia approaching 
      major amputation.
PG  - 3530-3543
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14536 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To illuminate the hospital experience for patients and families 
      when major amputation has been advised for critical limb ischaemia (CLI). 
      BACKGROUND: CLI creates significant burden to the health system and the family, 
      particularly as the person with CLI approaches amputation. Major amputation is often 
      offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked deterioration of an 
      ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced mobility, intractable pain, 
      infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of clinical outcome data on CLI and 
      amputation exists internationally, little is known about the patient/family-centred 
      experience of hospitalisation to inform preservation of personhood and 
      patient-centred care planning. DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative study using 
      Heideggerian phenomenology. METHODS: Fourteen patients and 13 family carers provided 
      a semistructured interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation 
      followed, a second interview (6 months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients 
      and seven family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and 
      transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed. RESULTS: 
      Hospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of chaos, 
      characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile body and 
      fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift within 
      uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation and 
      unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages (multiple 
      stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful decision-making 
      in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic process occurring within 
      a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the care complexity and burden of 
      family advocacy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A coordinated, interprofessional 
      response should improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation 
      scheduling and discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a 
      sense of safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should 
      be actively facilitated.

TI  - Implementation and evaluation of an education programme for nursing staff on 
      recognising, reporting and managing resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in aged 
      care facilities.
PG  - 187-196
LID - 10.1111/jan.13819 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To implement an educational programme for nursing staff on recognising, 
      reporting and managing resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in aged care 
      facilities. BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the 
      demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for 
      older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction 
      between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those 
      behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as 
      abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an 
      educational programme. DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia 
      New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). METHODS: This trial was 
      undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded 
      in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control 
      group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were 
      consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the 
      intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control 
      group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, 
      managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be 
      evaluated on an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: It is vital to manage and 
      reduce resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may 
      assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and 
      may improve comprehensive evidence-based care for older people residing in aged care 
      facilities.

TI  - Older Adult Caregiving in an Amish Community.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.3928/19404921-20171128-02 [doi]
AB  - Amish older adults represent a growing and understudied population whose current 
      health practices, interactions with health care systems outside of their community, 
      and care needs are unknown. Limited research exists on why, when, and how Amish 
      older adults and their caregivers experience health care services outside of their 
      family and community. The purpose of the current study was to describe and explore 
      the perspectives of Amish caregivers caring for older adults and their experiences 
      with health care services outside of their community. A qualitative phenomenological 
      research design was used in combination with a community-based participatory 
      framework with caregivers in a small, rural Amish settlement. Amish caregiving of 
      older adults is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by cultural characteristics. 
      Caregivers place significant cultural value on home caregiving, emphasize the 
      experience as a blessing, and relate misunderstandings between themselves and 
      outside health care providers as significant concerns. [Res Gerontol Nurs. 2018;

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in the nursing home.
PG  - 24, 27-8, 35-9
AB  - Risk factors, diagnosis, ethical considerations, and treatment of pneumonia in a 
      nursing home setting are summarized. Risk factors for pneumonia include 
      age-associated changes, co-morbid conditions, declining general health, and 
      iatrogenic factors. Diagnosis can be challenging in geriatric residents because of 
      atypical presentations and complex underlying diseases. Key features of presentation 
      include rhonchi and confusion. An increased respiratory rate can be a sensitive 
      indicator for pneumonia. Ethical dilemmas include identifying a resident's wishes 
      for treatment in the event of an acute illness and the decision on whether to 
      relocate the resident to an acute care facility. Decisions are based on available 
      resources, medical stability of the resident, unimpeded access to a hospital, and 
      the resident's well-informed decision. The common etiologic pathogen(s) of 
      nursing-home-acquired pneumonia reflect a mixture between community-acquired and 
      hospital-acquired pathogens. Multiple pharmacologic interventions are available, as 
      well as supportive measures including oxygen therapy and hydration. Preventive 
      measures are utilized to decrease the incidence of further infection.

AB  - Presently only about 9% of seniors over the age of 75 live in residential care 
      facilities but the anticipated exponential growth of the senior population will put 
      increasing pressure on the need for supportive, continuing care services in the 
      years ahead (CIHI 2017a). They are on average 86 years of age with a diagnosis of 
      dementia (67%) and some cognitive and/or functional impairment (98%) (CIHI 2017b). 
      These compromised seniors are also more likely to use hospital services than others, 
      and in many jurisdictions occupy acute care beds for extended periods because 
      ongoing management of their complex conditions is often not possible within 
      long-term care (LTC) homes. In addition, unnecessary and futile care at the end of 
      life often leads to suffering for individuals and their families (Dobbins 2016), 
      which might otherwise be avoided with the presence of institutionally based 
      providers such as nurse practitioners (NPs). Christian and Barker (2009) identified 
      NPs as a valuable resource to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations which often lead 
      to complications and devastating results for seniors. Although evidence of the 
      positive impact of NPs working in LTC facilities dates back to the 1970s, very few 
      organizations have created and obtained funding support for these positions in LTC 
      settings. This case study illustrates the impact of the NP role in a New Brunswick 
      LTC facility; demonstrating the value of a model that includes an NP collaborating 
      with physicians, nurses and allied health professionals. As shown in this case, the 
      presence of an NP clearly impacted a reduction in emergency room visits and 
      hospitalizations, events that more often than not accelerate further physical, 
      mental and functional decline particularly among the frail elderly. Christian and 
      Barker (2009) described the significant consequences of hospitalization for the 
      elderly patient including irreversible decline in function, delirium and exposure to 
      iatrogenic disease. Having an NP available within LTC affords the residents ongoing 
      monitoring that allows for preemptive and proactive care. NPs providing oversight to 
      the collaborative management of the care of LTC residents has the potential to not 
      only realize cost-avoidance for the healthcare system but also enhance the quality 
      of care for residents and their families.

AB  - The number of older adults continues to increase in all healthcare settings. The 
      majority of older adults are living in the community. Most are dealing with at least 
      one chronic physical illness or mental health concern. Nutritional status and 
      depression, key indicators of overall health, have a complex and interdependent 
      relationship. Clinicians must understand factors that affect nutrition and 
      depression to promote positive health outcomes and enhance the overall quality of 
      life for the oldest-old in the community.

TI  - Comprehensive geriatric assessment of a patient with complex needs.
PG  - 16-20
LID - 10.7748/nop.28.4.16.s20 [doi]
AB  - This is the third in a short series that presents case study examples of the 
      application of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical 
      settings. CGA is a holistic assessment model, which is designed to determine a frail 
      older person's medical and mental health status, as well as functional, social and 
      environmental issues. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised care 
      planning. The case study presented explores the application of CGA with an 
      89-year-old patient with complex health and social care needs. It demonstrates how a 
      hospital admission was avoided and the patient's health outcomes improved, by using 
      a nurse-led systematic approach to assessment and by careful consideration of CGA 
      domains.

TI  - Attributes of person-centred communication: A qualitative exploration of 
      communication with older persons in home health care.
PG  - e12284
LID - 10.1111/opn.12284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research points to challenges related to the home healthcare of 
      older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although person-centred care 
      has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to 
      enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons. 
      AIM: The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication 
      between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home. METHODS: A 
      descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the 
      COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between 
      registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative 
      thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the attributes of 
      person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older 
      persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness 
      on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated 
      when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' 
      views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions. CONCLUSION: The nurses' 
      attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication 
      with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve 
      older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. Implication 
      for practice The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred 
      approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included 
      in education and training.

PG  - 113-124

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are complex 
      cardiogeriatric syndromes mediated by physical, psychological and social factors. 
      Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these 
      syndromes, particularly stroke. PURPOSE: This study sought to describe the clinical 
      characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and 
      concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined 
      the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors 
      of adverse events. METHODS: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and 
      concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were 
      assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, 
      stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding. RESULTS: All-cause readmission 
      to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). 
      The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly 
      associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 
      0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates 
      of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of 
      participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. 
      Self-reported self-care behaviour and 'not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were 
      associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical 
      significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having 
      greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge. 
      CONCLUSION: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be 
      important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients 
      and caregivers offers the potential to improve treatment knowledge, adherence and 
      outcomes in this group of patients with complex care needs.

TI  - Symptom trajectory and symptom burden in older people with multimorbidity, secondary 
      outcome from the RCT AGe-FIT study.
PG  - 2773-2783
LID - 10.1111/jan.13032 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of 
      community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on 
      symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment. BACKGROUND: Older community-dwelling people with 
      multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring 
      symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a 
      need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people 
      living with multimorbidity. DESIGN: Secondary outcome data from the randomized 
      controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT). 
      METHODS: Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom 
      Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 
      24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an 
      ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in 
      addition to usual care. RESULTS: Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and 
      stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. 
      Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly 
      prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and 
      numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No 
      differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding 
      prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Older community-dwelling 
      people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving 
      advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not 
      significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of heart failure in the long-term care setting.
PG  - 177-81
AB  - Heart failure is increasing in incidence and prevalence and is predominantly a 
      condition of the elderly, which confers significant morbidity and mortality risks 
      and places an enormous economic burden on the health care system and society. A 
      reduction in hospitalizations and improvement of quality of life are the primary 
      goals in the management of heart failure. Evidence-based medicine provides 
      clinicians with the best armamentarium to provide high quality and cost-effective 
      care to patients diagnosed with this chronic, progressive, and debilitating 
      condition. A multidisciplinary approach to care can be instrumental in the 
      management of these complex patients. Further studies are warranted in elderly 
      patients to provide the evidence for optimal therapies in this frail population.

TI  - Deciding about the use of a Personal Safety Alerting Device-The need for a 
      legitimation process: A qualitative study.
PG  - 331-342
LID - 10.1111/jan.14566 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore reasons, thoughts, motives, and influencing factors regarding the 
      use or non-use of Personal Safety Alerting Devices (PSADs) in the daily lives of 
      community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was 
      used. METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons 
      between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide 
      of Leuven. RESULTS: The participants described the use or non-use of PSADs as a 
      decision resulting from a "legitimation process". This process implies that a person 
      needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at 
      which to start using it. During this process, each person weighs her or his "ageing 
      self" and "perception of technology" then decides whether to start using a device or 
      to delay its use. "Critical events" initiate this process, compelling the person to 
      consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance. CONCLUSION: The 
      legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning 
      point in life. Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex 
      decision-making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven 
      with one's individual ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the 
      device. IMPACT: Older persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time 
      to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this 
      process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty 
      balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to 
      preserve their independence.

TI  - Being acknowledged by others and bracketing negative thoughts and feelings: Frail 
      older people's narrations of how existential loneliness is eased.
PG  - e12213
LID - 10.1111/opn.12213 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe how EL was eased, as 
      narrated by frail older people. BACKGROUND: Existential loneliness (EL) is an 
      unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been 
      described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older 
      people, the experience of EL can be reduced. DESIGN: In this qualitative study, we 
      used an exploratory and descriptive design. METHODS: The study was based on 22 
      narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were 
      receiving long-term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional 
      content analysis. RESULTS: Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of 
      others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having 
      meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the 
      background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, 
      that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the 
      rear-view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract 
      themselves. CONCLUSION: Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing 
      meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the 
      forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease 
      EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person-centred care and 
      create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherness. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: If frail older people's ongoing processes of adjusting and accepting their 
      situation are understood and confirmed by people in their environment, for example, 
      by nurses, family and friends, the experience of living a meaningful life can be 
      supported, which, in turn, can ease EL.

AB  - Home-Based Primary Care is a program designed by the Department of Veteran Affairs 
      (VA) to care for frail, medically complex, elderly veteran patients in their home 
      setting. Unique to the VA, the program has similarities and differences in relation 
      to typical Medicare/Medicaid home health and hospice programs. The VA has 
      demonstrated success in maintaining the patients' independence and quality of life 
      as well as exceptional management of chronic disease and prevention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the profile of patients evaluated by Nurse Care Management 
      in an Emergency Department and identify the type of alternative healthcare resource 
      assigned and report the results of clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Prospective follow-up, on admission to the Emergency Department in an acute hospital 
      and on discharge from the alternative healthcare resource, of patients assessed by 
      Nurse Care Management, from July to December 2015. The patient characteristics, 
      social environment and results of clinical practice were studied. RESULTS: 190 
      patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 (59.8%) cases from the 
      Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) 
      cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital 
      and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, 
      presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with 
      dementia, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and 
      cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before 
      emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative 
      healthcare resource (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with advanced age, 
      complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary 
      care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other 
      patients. After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional 
      capacity and present less polypharmacy.

TI  - Frailty: a term with many meanings and a growing priority for community nurses.
PG  - 385-9
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.8.385 [doi]
AB  - The question of exactly what frailty is and what that may mean for patients is 
      extremely complex. This is a very conceptual problem requiring a broad and long-term 
      solution. It is not a disease or a condition that can be treated in isolation. 
      Frailty is a collection of contributing factors that culminate in an individual 
      being susceptible to poorer outcomes following health-care interventions and minor 
      illness. The solution to such a complex problem lies in engaging and empowering 
      staff to understand and champion frailty. Once better understood, it will be 
      possible to educate and enable this workforce to recognise the signs of frailty, 
      poor prognosis and patients requiring more specialised palliative care. Informing 
      staff working within a health-care economy of this issue must be the first step in a 
      shift towards managing patients with frailty more appropriately, and streaming their 
      care towards the correct care pathways sooner. This article discusses what frailty 
      is, what it may mean for patients, and attempts to expand on why the construct of 
      frailty is a prevalent issue for community nurses. The link between frailty and 
      mortality is discussed and how targeted appropriate advanced care planning may be 
      used to address this demographic challenge.

TI  - Revisiting geriatric failure to thrive: a complex and compelling clinical condition.
PG  - 18-24; quiz 26-7
AB  - Geriatric failure to thrive (GFTT) poses a complex clinical issue in gerontological 
      nursing practice. GFTT is not a normal part of aging, nor is it an outcome of 
      chronic illness. Rather, GFTT describes a lack of vitality and diminished capacity 
      for life and outlines a process of functional decline that is often difficult to 
      explain. The purpose of this article is to review GFTT, examine the literature on 
      GFTT, and suggest strategies for the identification, assessment, and creative 
      management of this complex condition that affects millions of older adults.

TI  - Increasing the profile of the care of the older person in the ED: a contemporary 
      nursing challenge.
PG  - 152-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ienj.2008.05.005 [doi]
AB  - The numbers of frail older persons using emergency departments are already 
      considerable and will continue to increase over time. There are a number of issues 
      related to the assessment and care of older patients that are significantly 
      different to other patient groups. The traditional emergency department (ED) model 
      focusing on rapid triage, treatment and throughput does not meet the needs of many 
      older patients, who have complex presentations, and require comprehensive assessment 
      and referral. In response to this, there are already a number of appropriate and 
      innovative approaches to the care of the older patient demonstrated in the 
      literature. Nurses have a crucial role in contributing to these approaches and in 
      raising the profile of quality care of the older person. Some specific areas that ED 
      nurses can focus on include a more comprehensive approach to assessment and 
      discharge planning, improved communication with the patient and their personal 
      carers, attention to basic nursing care, and making the physical environment safer 
      and less stressful for the older patient. While developing collaborations with their 
      aged care nursing colleagues is important, emergency nurses need to view care of the 
      older person as a central part of their own core business.

TI  - Framing moving and handling as a complex healthcare intervention within the acute 
      care of older people with osteoporosis: a qualitative study.
PG  - 2906-20
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13344 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of 
      caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving 
      and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling 
      risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a 
      skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. 
      Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and 
      mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults 
      are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As 
      presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is 
      frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often 
      suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched. DESIGN: 
      An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical 
      realism. METHODS: The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health 
      professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of 
      osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical 
      guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. RESULTS: Awareness of 
      osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are 
      indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal 
      moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 
      'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', 
      with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for 
      dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational 
      context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and 
      dependency dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: This study informs moving and handling in higher 
      risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when 
      adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' 
      experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: Increased focus on musculoskeletal conditions and moving and 
      handling implications is required.

AB  - PURPOSE: Seventy percent of people over 65 years of age have hypertension, and one 
      third of elders fall each year. These conditions frequently coexist, and each 
      carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews 
      the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with 
      hypertension. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the published and unpublished 
      literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must 
      include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments 
      that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. 
      Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The 
      periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse 
      practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication 
      management accordingly. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article will assist the NP 
      to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.

TI  - Professional and family caregivers' attitudes towards involuntary treatment in 
      community-dwelling people with dementia.
PG  - 96-107
LID - 10.1111/jan.13839 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to gain insight into professional and family 
      caregivers' attitudes towards involuntary treatment in community-dwelling people 
      with dementia (PwD). BACKGROUND: The number of PwD with complex care needs living at 
      home is increasing rapidly. In some situations, caregivers provide care against the 
      will of PwD, referred to as involuntary treatment, which includes non-consensual 
      care, psychotropic medication and physical restraints. DESIGN: A cross-sectional 
      study. METHODS: A total of 228 professional (nursing staff, general practitioners 
      (GPs) and other healthcare professionals such as physical therapists and 
      psychologists) and 77 family caregivers of PwD completed the Maastricht Attitude 
      Questionnaire-Home Care. This questionnaire measures attitudes towards involuntary 
      treatment and perceived restrictiveness of and experienced discomfort in using 
      involuntary treatment. Data were collected in the Netherlands between June and 
      November 2016. RESULTS: Family caregivers and GPs had more positive attitudes 
      towards involuntary treatment than nursing staff and other healthcare professionals, 
      indicating that they are more accepting of involuntary treatment. A more positive 
      attitude was associated with higher perceived caregiver burden and being a family 
      caregiver. Family caregivers and GPs found the use of involuntary treatment less 
      restrictive and indicated feeling more comfortable when using these measures. 
      CONCLUSION: It is important to account for the differences in attitudes and foster 
      dialogue among professional and family caregivers to find common ground about 
      alternatives to involuntary treatment. These results will inform the development of 
      an intervention that aims to prevent involuntary treatment in home care.

AB  - The elderly population in Sweden is increasing. This will lead to an increased need 
      for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. 
      Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra 
      demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical 
      presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance 
      personnel to understand and meet these patients' care needs. Using a caring science 
      approach, we apply the patient's perspective, and the aim of this study is to 
      identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the 
      assessment category "general affected health condition". Thus, we have analyzed the 
      characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective 
      audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service 
      records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty 
      which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state 
      of "general affected health condition", as either illness or ill-health. This offers 
      a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and 
      support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the 
      concept of frailty ought to be included in "The International Statistical 
      Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (ICD-10).

TI  - Why intermediate care services need to be refreshed.
PG  - 16-20
LID - 10.7748/nop2014.03.26.3.16.e570 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate care services are usually intended for frail, older people and those 
      with complex needs. Their aims are to avoid unnecessary hospital admission, help 
      people regain independence after a hospital stay and prevent premature admission to 
      long-term care. Services are time limited and delivered in patients' own homes, 
      community hospitals and sometimes nursing homes. But, as Louise Hunt reports, the 
      second national audit of intermediate care, published late last year, found capacity 
      in England is just half of what is needed. There is also significant variation 
      between localities in capacity outside hospital and in the balance of bed-based, 
      home-based and re-enablement services. Two case studies are presented of 
      intermediate care services where nurses play an important role in achieving positive 
      outcomes for patients and saving the health service money.

TI  - Community care for severely frail older people: Developing explanations of how, why 
      and for whom it works.
PG  - e12217
LID - 10.1111/opn.12217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A Community Wellness Team was implemented in North East England in 2014, 
      in line with national policy directives to support frail older people in the 
      community. The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which 
      aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients 
      to stay at home. DESIGN: A realist design combining a review of the literature and 
      primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop 
      programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust 
      development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; 
      advice on self-management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of 
      services. DISCUSSION: The programme theories explain the role and impact of the 
      Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one 
      another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the 
      Community Wellness Team "works" is discussed. Of particular importance was the 
      comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and 
      physical environment within which older people live. CONCLUSION: Severely frail 
      older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and 
      environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a 
      complex and flexible person-centred approach. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study 
      paves the way for further research into the care networks surrounding severely frail 
      older people living in the community, and how they can most effectively be 
      implemented.

AB  - Structured clinical data generated using standardized terminologies such as the 
      Omaha System are available for evaluating healthcare quality and patient outcomes. 
      New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, 
      complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived 
      using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 
      14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted 
      hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. 
      Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies 
      in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization 
      outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is 
      needed and the level of care that is provided.

TI  - An aging renal population-is dialysis always the answer?
PG  - 545-7
AB  - As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid 
      conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the 
      treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
      transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those 
      who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering 
      a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which 
      people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only 
      substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the 
      past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more 
      recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on 
      dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, 
      particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and 
      palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.

TI  - Exploring the expectations, needs and experiences of general practitioners and 
      nurses towards a proactive and structured care programme for frail older patients: a 
      mixed-methods study.
PG  - 2262-73
LID - 10.1111/jan.12110 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and 
      practice nurses regarding the U-CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of 
      the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older 
      people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. BACKGROUND: Care for 
      older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and 
      time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve 
      physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. DESIGN: An 
      explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. METHODS: The 
      barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and 
      expectations regarding the U-CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires 
      sent to all participating general practitioners (n = 32) and practice nurses 
      (n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme 
      after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. RESULTS: 
      Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide 
      proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different 
      cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and 
      financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated 
      that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to 
      provide structured care. CONCLUSION: This explanatory mixed-methods study showed 
      that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U-CARE programme as 
      feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care 
      towards a proactive and preventive care approach.

TI  - The impact of medical issues in inpatient geriatric psychiatry.
PG  - 23-46
AB  - At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. 
      Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from 
      coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are 
      important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of 
      hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes 
      adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better 
      treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need 
      for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the 
      importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.

TI  - Fall prevention in frail elderly nursing home residents: a challenge to case 
      management: part I.
PG  - 246-51
AB  - Parts I and II of this article examine the impact of a falls prevention program on 
      the fall incidents among the residents in a nursing home. It was hypothesized that a 
      diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home 
      residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number 
      of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The 
      program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks 
      facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining 
      changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results 
      identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized 
      interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex 
      medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that 
      muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. 
      Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail 
      elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and 
      postponing problems resulting from inactivity. Part I discusses the background and 
      process of a falls program and factors contributing to the occurrence of falls. Part 
      II will examine the interdisciplinary team approach to assessment, method, and 
      implementing strategies for an effective fall prevention program. Tools used for 
      prevention, monitoring, and investigation of falls will be detailed in Part II.

TI  - Restraint-free care: how does a nurse decide?
PG  - 7-14
AB  - Decisions by nurses to avoid physical restraint use in older adults is a complex 
      process that requires individualized, comprehensive assessment and creative 
      problem-solving. Institutional and social policy increasingly support a standard of 
      restraint elimination influencing care decisions with frail older adults. It has 
      become clear that the decision to avoid or use physical restraint is influenced as 
      well by nurses' attitude or beliefs about the efficacy of restraint. To further 
      understand how decisions are made to avoid physical restraint, it is important to 
      also explore the degree to which nurses possess knowledge, autonomy, and 
      accountability in this decision-making process. Understanding how decisions are 
      influenced will advance the development of restraint-free care interventions for 
      older adults.

TI  - Carers' and nurses' appraisals of needs of nursing home placement for frail older in 
      Norway.
PG  - 3079-88
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02663.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' 
      appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people 
      awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions 
      regarding nursing home placement. BACKGROUND: Requesting nursing home placement can 
      be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and 
      guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the 
      older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides 
      support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers 
      face difficult life situations. DESIGN: This is a descriptive and comparative 
      cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. METHODS: The convenience sample (n 
      = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list 
      in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly 
      participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content 
      analysis. RESULTS: Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' 
      appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, 
      beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making 
      concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising 
      nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able 
      to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 
      'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be 
      placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and 
      involved ethical issues. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite insufficient 
      resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and 
      their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each 
      situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for 
      the timely nursing home placement of older people.

TI  - Development of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac 
      surgery (the PREDOCS programme), following phase one of the guidelines of the 
      Medical Research Council.
PG  - 494-505
LID - 10.1177/1474515113511715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In older patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the timely 
      identification and preparation of patients at risk for frequent postoperative 
      hospital complications provide opportunities to reduce the risk of these 
      complications. AIMS: We developed an evidence-based, multi-component nursing 
      intervention (Prevention of Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery Patients; the PREDOCS 
      programme) for application in the preadmission period to improve patients' physical 
      and psychosocial condition to reduce their risk of postoperative complications. This 
      paper describes in detail the process used to design and develop this 
      multi-component intervention. METHODS: In a team of researchers, experts, cardiac 
      surgeons, registered cardiac surgery nurses, and patients, the revised guidelines 
      for developing and evaluating complex interventions of the Medical Research Council 
      (MRC) were followed, including identifying existing evidence, identifying and 
      developing theory and modelling the process and outcomes. Additionally, the criteria 
      for reporting the development of complex interventions in healthcare (CReDECI) were 
      followed. RESULTS: The intervention is administered during a consultation by the 
      nurse two to four weeks before the surgery procedure. The consultation includes 
      three parts: a general part for all patients, a second part in which patients with 
      an increased risk are identified, and a third part in which selected patients are 
      informed about how to prepare themselves for the hospital admission to reduce their 
      risk. CONCLUSIONS: Following the MRC guidelines, an extended, stepwise, multi-method 
      procedure was used to develop the multi-component nursing intervention to prepare 
      older patients for cardiac surgery, creating transparency in the assumed working 
      mechanisms. Additionally, a detailed description of the intervention is provided.

TI  - Complexity in caring for an ageing heart failure population: concomitant chronic 
      conditions and age related impairments.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further 
      complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age 
      related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in 
      activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, 
      lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, 
      outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by 
      putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on 
      how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by 
      applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure 
      population.

TI  - Understanding the challenges to vascular access in an ageing population.
PG  - S15-S23
LID - 10.12968/bjon.2017.26.14.S15 [doi]
AB  - At the beginning of the 21st century, one in five of UK residents can expect to see 
      their 100th birthday and one in four people are aged 60 years or older. The UK has 
      an ageing population. With older age comes an increasing variety of comorbidities 
      that have an impact not only on an individual's quality of life but also on 
      healthcare resources. Older people account for a rapidly rising cohort of 
      individuals admitted to hospital, often with complex needs, and this can require 
      achieving venous access. Venepuncture and cannulation are the most commonly 
      performed invasive procedures in health care today. This article aims to increase 
      awareness of vascular access challenges in older patients so the potential for 
      complications relating to venepuncture, cannulation and infusion therapy can be 
      minimised, thereby improving their overall quality of care. The article will look at 
      the healthcare challenges facing the older population, and the importance of a 
      holistic approach to assess their vascular access needs to deliver optimum care.

AB  - To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand 
      the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to 
      introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct 
      a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults 
      with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom 
      management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom 
      Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors 
      that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It 
      accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within 
      the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its 
      interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some 
      limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability 
      Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it 
      encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate 
      for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of 
      rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health 
      status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a 
      guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the 
      functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

TI  - Unravelling the differences between complexity and frailty in old age: findings from 
      a constructivist grounded theory study.
PG  - 67-73

AB  - UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but 
      there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important 
      if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in 
      society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study 
      into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and 
      operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded 
      theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses 
      and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the 
      relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within 
      the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand 
      important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to 
      describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has 
      resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity 
      means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has 
      implications for nursing practice that require further study.

TI  - Is hospitalisation necessary? A survey of frail older persons with cognitive 
      impairment transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department.
PG  - 1138-1147
LID - 10.1111/scs.12559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the 
      transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is 
      associated with a high risk of them developing complications. AIM: To survey the 
      most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from 
      nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, 
      symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. METHOD: A retrospective descriptive 
      survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and 
      presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. 
      FINDINGS: The persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail 
      with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of 
      criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined 
      and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. CONCLUSION: Frail older persons 
      with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end-of-life care, should be prevented 
      from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency 
      department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially 
      trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making 
      house calls.

TI  - Conceptualizations of frailty in relation to older adults.
PG  - 58-68
AB  - AIM: The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy 
      in identifying and describing older adults as frail. BACKGROUND: Despite the 
      dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a 
      lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear 
      conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. 
      Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding 
      eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. 
      METHOD: The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and 
      conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the 
      paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. 
      The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six 
      conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions 
      about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the 
      ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are 
      discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. CONCLUSION: The 
      review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in 
      older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex 
      interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the 
      concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of 
      ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and 
      incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the 
      contribution of both individual and environmental factors.

TI  - Transforming emergency services for frail older people in hospital.
PG  - 18-9
LID - 10.7748/nm.22.3.18.s29 [doi]
AB  - Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a 
      difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the 
      likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve 
      services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with 
      more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is 
      an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of 
      this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ 
      to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop 
      effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.

PG  - e12950
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12950 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic decision-making for older patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) with no identifiable activating mutation is complex. In this 
      prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in 
      identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients ≥70 years of age were evaluated 
      with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: 
      fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity 
      and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age 
      was 76 (70-92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 
      or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with 
      overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity 
      (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of 
      vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was 
      higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable 
      analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p < 0.001) and GA group 
      (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that 
      GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.

TI  - Psychological transition into a residential care facility: older people's 
      experiences.
PG  - 1159-68

AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper is to discuss the complexity of admission into a 
      residential care facility from a psychological perspective for residents and their 
      relatives and the resulting implications for nursing care. BACKGROUND: Admission 
      into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well 
      as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful 
      involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is 
      important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. DATA SOURCES: The 
      background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into 
      nursing homes and psychological transitions. DISCUSSION: The concepts of transition 
      from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by 
      residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very 
      different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a 
      difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require 
      improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will 
      support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      NURSING: Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication 
      strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that 
      occurs when an older person is admitted into care. CONCLUSION: Improving the 
      psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal 
      for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal 
      constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a 
      more positive experience.

TI  - Triaging seniors in health crisis in the emergency department: a three-year summary.
PG  - 8-11
AB  - The "geriatric triage" approach for management of the most complex frail older adult 
      population by geriatric nurses in the emergency department setting was a benefit to 
      the patient/family and the health care system. The patients, through assessment and 
      individualized plans of care, received the right care in the right setting. Seniors 
      were assessed and their care planned by health care professionals who had geriatric 
      knowledge, understood the complexity of their problems, and acted as their advocate. 
      Geriatric triaging resulted in benefits across the health care system. Resources 
      were used effectively. Patients received care in the most appropriate and 
      cost-efficient setting. This new and creative approach served as a catalyst for 
      improvement in services and care for the senior population. Health care workers in 
      the hospitals as well as the community increased their knowledge of geriatrics 
      through consultation with this service. The community and hospitals had a formal 
      linkage, which provided an opportunity for collaboration and continuity of care. The 
      hospital system experienced decreased competition for scarce acute care beds due to 
      diverted admissions. The emergency department had consultants to assist with the 
      decision-making for this high-risk population and decreased the number of patients 
      held in emergency department awaiting an inpatient bed. The community system 
      received patients with a comprehensive plan of care that provided creative and 
      innovative care management strategies. Home care adapted its service to respond with 
      immediate services to assist with health crises in addition to what had been 
      traditionally available. The finding of this study supports a new approach to care 
      of the elderly and chronically ill population who present to the emergency 
      department in health crisis. Creative strategies are required to meet the needs of 
      the aging population in these times of fiscal restraint. The nursing geriatric 
      triage service is one strategy that holds merit.

PG  - 940-50
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13154 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe how the included items in three different scales, 
      Downton Fall Risk Index, the short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment and the 
      Modified Norton Scale are associated to severe outcomes as falls, weight loss and 
      pressure ulcers. BACKGROUND: Falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are common 
      adverse events among nursing home residents and risk scoring are common preventive 
      activities, mainly focusing on single risks. In Sweden the three scales are 
      routinely used together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention. 
      DESIGN: Longitudinal quantitative study. METHODS: Descriptive analyses and Cox 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: Only 4% scored no risk for any of these serious 
      events. Longitudinal risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating 
      increased risks. This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general 
      condition. There were no statistical significant differences between residents 
      categorised at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but 
      decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of 
      general health were most important. CONCLUSIONS: Risk tendencies for falls, 
      malnutrition and pressure ulcers are high in nursing homes, and when measure them at 
      the same time the majority will have several of these risks. Items assessing 
      mobility or items affecting mobility were of most importance. Care processes can 
      always be improved and this study can add to the topic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: A more comprehensive view is needed and prevention can not only be based 
      on total scores. Mobility is an important factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both 
      as a risk factor and a protective factor. This involves a challenge for care--to 
      keep the inmates physical active and at the same time prevent falls.

TI  - Frailty in older adults: an evolutionary concept analysis.
PG  - 66-84
AB  - The term frailty is often used to describe a subset of the older population with 
      complex health issues. It is associated with dependence, disability, increased 
      health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to 
      the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to 
      clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a 
      definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. 
      The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state 
      of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, 
      psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's 
      susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.

TI  - Older women, intimate partner violence and mental health: a consideration of the 
      particular issues for health and healthcare practice.
PG  - 2177-2191
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13490 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history 
      of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. 
      BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and 
      well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate 
      partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has 
      not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to 
      address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's 
      experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health 
      issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic 
      synthesis of qualitative evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and 
      PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end 
      of December 2015. RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence 
      exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner 
      violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the 
      boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within 
      the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of 
      intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence 
      of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who 
      experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner 
      violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service 
      providers need to be aware of these. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and 
      healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management 
      and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they 
      are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of 
      abuse and this includes older women.

TI  - Fall prevention in frail elderly nursing home residents: a challenge to case 
      management: part II.
PG  - 32-44
AB  - Parts I and II of this article examine the impact of a falls prevention program on 
      the fall incidents among the residents in a nursing home. It was hypothesized that a 
      diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home 
      residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number 
      of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The 
      program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks 
      facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining 
      changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results 
      identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized 
      interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex 
      medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that 
      muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. 
      Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail 
      elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and 
      postponing problems resulting from inactivity. Part I (LCM, Nov-Dec 2001) discussed 
      the background and process of a falls program and factors contributing to the 
      occurrence of falls. This month we examine the interdisciplinary team approach to 
      assessment, method, and implementing strategies for an effective fall prevention 
      program. Tools used for prevention, monitoring, and investigation of falls are also 
      detailed.

TI  - Treatment Fidelity of an Evidence-Based Nurse-Led Intervention in a Proactive 
      Primary Care Program for Older People.
PG  - 75-84
LID - 10.1111/wvn.12151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a large randomized trial, Utrecht PROactive Frailty Intervention 
      Trial (U-PROFIT), we evaluated the effectiveness of an integrated program on the 
      preservation of daily functioning in older people in primary care that consisted of 
      a frailty identification tool and a multicomponent nurse-led care program. 
      Examination of treatment fidelity is critical to successful translation of 
      evidence-based interventions into practice. AIMS: To assess treatment delivery, dose 
      and content of nursing care delivered within the nurse-led care program, and to 
      explore if the delivery may have influenced the trial results. METHODS: A 
      mixed-methods study was conducted. Type and dose of nursing care were collected 
      during the trial. Shortly after the trial, a focus group with nurses was conducted 
      to explore reasons for the observed differences between the type and dose of nursing 
      care delivered. RESULTS: A total of 835 older persons were included in the nurse-led 
      care program. The mean age was 75 years, 64% were female and 53.5% were living 
      alone. The most frequent self-reported conditions were loneliness (60.8%) and 
      cognitive problems (59.4%). One-third of the patients with a geriatric condition 
      received an additional assessment (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination), and the 
      majority of these patients received at least one nurse intervention (>85%). Most 
      nursing care was delivered to patients at risk of falling and to those with urinary 
      incontinence. Patients with nutrition problems seldom received nursing 
      interventions. The nurses explained that differences in type and dose were 
      influenced by the preference of the patient, the type of geriatric problem, and the 
      time required to apply a nurse intervention. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: All 
      intervention components were delivered; however, differences were observed in the 
      type and dose of nursing care delivered across geriatric conditions. The findings 
      better explain the treatment fidelity and suggest that there is room for improvement 
      that may result in more beneficial patient outcomes.

TI  - Quality of life in nursing homes: perception of physically frail elderly residents.
PG  - 48-55
AB  - The purpose of this research was to disclose the characteristics of quality of life 
      as perceived by physically frail but lucid elderly people living in nursing homes to 
      increase the understanding of the phenomenon of quality of life in this setting. 
      Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on 
      two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for 
      hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both 
      nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The 
      participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main 
      themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for 
      departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon 
      quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important 
      aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing 
      home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set 
      their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be 
      recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and 
      doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to 
      living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in 
      caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what 
      matters most in relation to their quality of life.

TI  - Complexity theory: a long-term care specialty practice exemplar for the education of 
      advanced practice nurses.
PG  - 84-7
AB  - This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported 
      gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to 
      managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), 
      which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the 
      faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included 
      advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal 
      of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach 
      evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the 
      practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, 
      reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes 
      included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex 
      geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design 
      and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility 
      outcomes.

TI  - Feasibility of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac 
      surgery: a mixed-methods study.
PG  - 342-51
LID - 10.1177/1474515114535511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the growing number of vulnerable, older cardiac surgery patients, 
      the preadmission PREvention Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery patients (PREDOCS) 
      programme was developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. 
      Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be 
      evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with 
      the acceptability, compliance and delivery. AIM: The purpose of this study was to 
      test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings. 
      METHODS: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) 
      guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost 
      savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data 
      registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for 
      reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI). RESULTS: Twenty-one 
      females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and 
      provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the 
      PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were 
      satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative 
      complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. 
      Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both 
      patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the 
      patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative 
      complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should 
      be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.

TI  - Development of a frailty measure for older adults: the frailty index for elders.
PG  - 223-40
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Frailty is a significant challenge for health care. 
      Therefore, it is important to identify frail individuals. Theoretical Framework: The 
      Vulnerability/Risk/Human Response/Care Model. The purpose of this study was to 
      develop and validate a measure to identify frail older adults. METHODS: Instrument 
      development encompassed the following: delineation of content domains, item 
      generation, content validity, quantitative content validity analysis, and 
      psychometric analysis. RESULTS: Findings indicated the following: (a) Frailty is a 
      complex concept, (b) the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE) is composed of 10 items, 
      (c) FIFE was able to predict depression, and (d) FIFE was able to differentiate 
      differences in demographic profiles by social support environment. CONCLUSIONS: FIFE 
      is a valid instrument. FIFE can be used to study the relationships among frailty 
      determinants, provide standardized measurement, and develop and measure 
      interventional studies.

TI  - Violence in nursing homes: perceptions of female caregivers.
PG  - 1660-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02196.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence. 
      BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and 
      injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, 
      few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence. METHODS: Forty-one female 
      caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a 
      situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The 
      reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The main 
      finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the 
      beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, 
      ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes. CONCLUSION 
      AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the perception of violence is subjective, 
      there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as 
      over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined 
      operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also 
      indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. 
      To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how 
      caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.

TI  - Developing advanced nursing skills for frail older people.
PG  - 20-3
LID - 10.7748/nop2014.04.26.4.20.e561 [doi]
AB  - Improving hospital care for frail older people requires expertise, leadership and 
      resources as these patients have multiple complex needs. One innovative solution to 
      providing the skilled care necessary is to train experienced nurses to become 
      advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs). Such roles encompass activity previously 
      undertaken by medical staff, together with leadership, teaching, research and 
      service development. Skills specific to caring for older people, such as 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment, are also required. This article discusses the 
      need for ANPs in this clinical area, a pilot that is under way in one acute trust to 
      develop these roles, and the potential benefits and challenges that may accompany 
      this development.

TI  - Loneliness and health care consumption among older people.
PG  - 435-43
LID - 10.1111/scs.12147 [doi]
AB  - Few studies have investigated loneliness in relation to health care consumption 
      among frail older people. The aim of this study was to examine loneliness, 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and health complaints in relation to health 
      care consumption of in- and outpatient care among frail older people living at home. 
      The study, with a cross-sectional design, comprised a sample of 153 respondents aged 
      from 65 years (mean age 81.5 years) or older, who lived at home and were frail. Data 
      was collected utilising structured interviews in the respondent's home assessing 
      demographic data, loneliness, HRQoL and health complaints. Patient administrative 
      registers were used to collect data on health care consumption. Loneliness was the 
      dependent variable in the majority of the analyses and dichotomised. For group 
      comparisons Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used. The 
      results showed that 60% of the respondents had experienced loneliness during the 
      previous year, at least occasionally. The study identified that lonely respondents 
      had a lower HRQoL (p = 0.022), with a higher total number of reported health 
      complaints (p = 0.001), and used more outpatient services including more acute 
      visits at the emergency department, compared to not lonely respondents (p = 0.026). 
      Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a depressed mood was independently 
      associated to total use of outpatient care (B = 7.4, p < 0.001). Therefore, it might 
      not be loneliness, per se, that is the reason for seeking health care. However, 
      reasons for using health care services are difficult to determine due to the complex 
      situation for the frail older person. To avoid emergency department visits and to 
      benefit the well-being of the frail older person, interventions targeting the 
      complex health situation, including loneliness, are suggested.

TI  - Around-the-clock nursing care for the elderly in Japan.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the first phase of creating a Japanese model of community-based 
      long-term care, called around-the-clock care (ACC), by operationally defining the 
      components of ACC, identifying those eligible for the program, clarifying methods of 
      planning and organization, and exploring outcomes. DESIGN: Exploratory evaluation 
      for the population of frail elderly Japanese citizens living at home. A convenience 
      sample of 44 patients receiving care from four visiting-nurse-service stations 
      during 3 months in 1994 was used. METHODS: Needs assessments; record reviews of 
      patient encounters; evaluations by patients, families, and visiting nurses; and 
      reviews of administrative data. FINDINGS: Nurses perceived that ACC stabilized 
      medical status, reduced the emotional and physical burden of treatment, and improved 
      hygiene. It also reduced family caregiving burdens and the stress of family 
      caregivers' employment responsibilities. The highest rating of ACC by patient and 
      families was for those with the most complex physical needs. Skilled nursing at home 
      permitted early identification and treatment of problems before they became crises 
      or required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Early findings suggest 24-hour nurse-home 
      helper teamwork may be an effective system of community-based long-term care and 
      should be considered a key element of future Japanese health policy.

AB  - Complex older patients represent about half of all acute public hospital admissions 
      in Australia. People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, 
      and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. 
      Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and 
      cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has 
      been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited 
      ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. 
      Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or 
      mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for 
      nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. 
      Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient 
      mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed. 
      This paper offers a theoretical proposition of 'Failure to Maintain' as a conceptual 
      framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes 
      to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then 
      contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital 
      acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and 
      delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of 'Failure to Maintain'. Hospital 
      focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and 
      medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge 
      over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This 
      privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically 
      associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, 
      pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including 
      those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have 
      higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). 'Failure 
      to Maintain' offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, 
      this vulnerable population. Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely 
      contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and 
      hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability 
      data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward 
      and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, 
      understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute 
      geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling 
      multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide 
      patient focussed care, and avoid 'Failing to Maintain'. The research field of acute 
      geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including 
      controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention 
      studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the 
      different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and 
      functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work 
      environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older 
      patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin 
      care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify key elements of optimal treatment decision-making for 
      surgeons and older patients with colorectal (CRC) or pancreatic cancer (PC). 
      METHODS: Six focus groups with different participants were performed: three with 
      older CRC/PC patients and relatives, and three with physicians. Supplementary 
      in-depth interviews were conducted in another seven patients. Framework analysis was 
      used to identify key elements in decision-making. RESULTS: 23 physicians, 22 
      patients and 14 relatives participated. Three interacting components were revealed: 
      preconditions, content and facilitators of decision-making. To provide optimal 
      information about treatments' impact on an older patient's daily life, physicians 
      should obtain an overall picture and take into account patients' frailty. Depending 
      on patients' preferences and capacities, dividing decision-making into more sessions 
      will be helpful and simultaneously emphasize patients' own responsibility. GPs may 
      have a valuable contribution because of their background knowledge and supportive 
      role. CONCLUSION: Stakeholders identified several crucial elements in the complex 
      surgical decision-making of older CRC/PC patients. Structured qualitative research 
      may also be of great help in optimizing other treatment directed decision-making 
      processes. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Surgeons should be trained in examining 
      preconditions and useful facilitators in decision-making in older CRC/PC patients to 
      optimize its content and to improve the quality of shared care.

      qualitative exploratory study.
PG  - 1558-67
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05589.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate how one aspect of anticipatory care is understood and delivered 
      in practice. 'Anticipatory care' in this context can be understood as proactive 
      care, which is oriented towards prevention of adverse events. BACKGROUND: Scotland 
      has identified the intention to move away from a preoccupation with acute care and 
      invest in health improvement and anticipatory care. Community nurses are the key, 
      yet little is known about how they understand and deliver anticipatory care. 
      METHODS: A qualitative case study design using individual in-depth interviews 
      (n=10), observation (n=9) and focus groups (n=5) was selected. Five focus group 
      interviews were carried out with district nurses, practice nurses and health 
      visitors. Subsequently, nine observation events took place, each focused on a single 
      nurse/client encounter. Data were collected during 2008 and 2009 in one Community 
      Health Partnership in Scotland. FINDINGS: Two approaches to anticipatory care 
      emerged; these were influenced by participants' roles and responsibilities. Approach 
      1 derives from Government policy agenda and is focused on protocol-focused 
      management of long-term illness. Approach 2 is synonymous with long-standing nursing 
      activity focused on holistic care of individual patients. Both approaches are 
      proactive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: There is scope to develop a more conceptually 
      complex model of anticipatory care, building on this initial exploration, within 
      which all aims, roles, practices and methods of evaluation can be located and 
      clearly visible. This offers the potential to enable practitioners to interpret and 
      apply policy--otherwise change may be limited and result in service gaps.

TI  - Recruitment of frail older people to research: lessons learnt through experience.
PG  - 643-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based 
      practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to 
      provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, 
      interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important 
      factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. 
      Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. 
      However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. AIMS OF THE 
      PAPER: This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older 
      people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of 
      research related to ethical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of frail older people 
      to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the 
      researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not 
      to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is 
      sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and 
      refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older 
      people to research while protecting their right to refuse.

      living with complex health problems.
LID - 10.1111/opn.12172 [doi]
LID - e12172
AB  - AIM: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in 
      their daily lives. BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the personal experience of 
      frailty in the context of fluctuating ill-health has the potential to contribute to 
      the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. DESIGN: An 
      ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a 
      community matron service in a large city in the North of England. METHODS: Up to six 
      care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were 
      observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11 months. 
      Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own 
      homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4-year period. Data analysis was undertaken using 
      the constant comparative method. FINDINGS: The experience of frailty was understood 
      through the construction of four themes: Fluctuating ill-health and the disruption 
      of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety 
      and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of 
      complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience 
      episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living 
      becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding 
      of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has 
      the potential to inform nursing practice in person-centred care . IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and 
      continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.

TI  - Nursing management of constipation in housebound older people.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - In this article two algorithms are suggested for use by district nurses in the 
      management of constipation in dependent older people at home. Prescribing for this 
      group of patients requires a complex assessment of medical and social factors as 
      24-hour supervision is not always available and local health and social service 
      resources may impact on the level of care that is available in terms of the 
      provision of food and drink and the taking of medicines.

PG  - 1387-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03026.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aims to explore nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised 
      older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and 
      strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem. BACKGROUND: Urinary tract 
      infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. 
      Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms 
      causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of 
      caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition. 
      DESIGN: Qualitative. METHODS: A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a 
      hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen 
      nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. RESULTS: When 
      managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, 
      nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms 
      and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed 
      the basis for deciding whether the patient's urinary condition should be managed by 
      nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on 
      this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be 
      effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to 
      improve nurses' existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary 
      tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified. CONCLUSION: 
      Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing 
      care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive 
      'basic urinary tract infection care' on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms 
      could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by 
      nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of 
      interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine 
      which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.

AB  - This study identifies factors that affect decisions people make regarding whether 
      they want to receive life-sustaining treatment. It is an interpretive-descriptive 
      study based on qualitative data from three focus groups (N = 23), representing a 
      diverse population in central Pennsylvania. Study sites included a suburban senior 
      center serving a primarily White, middle-class population; an urban senior center 
      serving a frail, underserved, African American population; and a breast cancer 
      support group. The most important factors affecting whether participants wished to 
      receive life-sustaining medical treatment were prognosis, expected quality of life, 
      burden to others, burden to oneself in terms of the medical condition and treatment, 
      and effect on mental functioning and independence. Our findings contribute to the 
      knowledge of the complex factors that influence how people make decisions about 
      advance care planning and life-sustaining treatments. This understanding is critical 
      if nurses are to translate the patient's goals, values, and preferences into an 
      actionable medical plan.

TI  - A threat to our integrity--Meanings of providing nursing care for older patients 
      with cognitive impairment in acute care settings.
PG  - 48-56
LID - 10.1111/scs.12220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people with cognitive impairment represent a large group of 
      patients in acute care settings. Research show that these acute care environments 
      can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical 
      experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to 
      work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring 
      for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities 
      have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to 
      connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them. 
      AIM: This study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with 
      cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff. METHOD: 
      A purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with 
      cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative 
      interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a 
      phenomenological hermeneutic method. FINDINGS: Caring for older, acutely ill 
      cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring 
      for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of 
      the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) 
      in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care 
      was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' 
      personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed. 
      CONCLUSION: The comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having 
      to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an 
      environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' 
      personal-professional integrity.

      disease: A series review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite improvements in revascularization, major amputation remains a 
      significant part of the case-mix in vascular surgical units. These patients tend to 
      be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of 
      stay (LOS). AIM: This series review provides a description of the patient 
      complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb 
      amputation for peripheral arterial disease. METHOD: Medical records coded for major 
      amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, 
      tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed. 
      FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions 
      from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before 
      amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial 
      morbidity and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Major amputation continues to present 
      challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These 
      issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes 
      consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to 
      optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding 
      to surgery require further investigation.

TI  - Nursing case management for psychogeriatric patients and their families: description 
      of a clinical model.
PG  - 529-42
AB  - A theoretical model of clinical case management for psychogeriatric patients and 
      their families is described. Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care 
      needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these 
      patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make 
      professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case 
      management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the 
      conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles 
      of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a 
      clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management 
      is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached 
      in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, 
      planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires 
      nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively 
      with members of a multidisciplinary team.

TI  - Specialist care for frail older people.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - At Leicester Royal Infirmary, the care of frail older people occupies a 
      disproportionate amount of emergency department (ED) staff's time and resources. Too 
      few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with 
      older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the 
      pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has 
      set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not 
      be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as 
      possible. This article describes how the unit operates.

TI  - A systematic review of predictors and screening instruments to identify older 
      hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline.
PG  - 46-57
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly 
      instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at 
      risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially 
      considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of 
      existing screening instruments are investigated. BACKGROUND: Functional decline is a 
      common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in 
      quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people 
      develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital 
      stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing 
      home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not 
      only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, 
      the impact on health-care costs is also high. RESULTS: Age, lower functional status, 
      cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily 
      life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of 
      functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at 
      risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission 
      Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity 
      Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease 
      of use in the clinical setting were not well described. CONCLUSION: These three 
      instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for 
      functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are 
      identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe 
      and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in 
      this process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) is widely recommended as a way to support 
      patients in making healthcare choices. Due to an ageing population, the number of 
      older patients will increase. Existing models for SDM are not sufficient for this 
      patient group, due to their multi-morbidity, the lack of guidelines and evidence 
      applicable to the numerous combinations of diseases. The aim of this study was to 
      gain consensus on a model for SDM in frail older patients with multiple morbidities. 
      METHODS: We used a three-round Delphi study to reach consensus on a model for SDM in 
      older patients with multiple morbidities. The expert panel consisted of 16 patients 
      (round 1), and 59 professionals (rounds 1-3). In round 1, the SDM model was 
      introduced, rounds 2 and 3 were used to validate the importance and feasibility of 
      the SDM model. RESULTS: Consensus for the proposed SDM model as a whole was achieved 
      for both importance (91% panel agreement) and feasibility (76% panel agreement). 
      CONCLUSIONS: SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities is a dynamic process. 
      It requires a continuous counselling dialogue between professional and patient or 
      proxy decision maker. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The developed model for SDM in clinical 
      practice may help professionals to apply SDM in the complex situation of the care 
      for older patients.

TI  - Use of hypodermoclysis to manage dehydration.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - Older people, particularly those who are frail, are vulnerable to dehydration. 
      Management of dehydration in older people can be more complex than in younger adults 
      because of the physical effects of ageing. As the population ages, nurses will 
      increasingly care for older patients in every setting. This article provides an 
      overview of the physiological changes that affect the ability of older people to 
      maintain a normal fluid balance. Risk factors for dehydration are reviewed and 
      strategies for the prevention, detection and management of dehydration are 
      discussed. The article focuses on subcutaneous fluid replacement for the management 
      of dehydration in older adults.

AB  - Older adults and their family caregivers face numerous decisions about hospital 
      discharge, including where they will go and how they will receive care. Older adults 
      who account for nearly 37% of all hospital discharges often need care and support of 
      family members at the time of hospital discharge. This study examines decisions made 
      by hospitalized older adults, families, and health care team members (HCTMs) about 
      hospital discharge. The sample included older adults (n = 13, average age 84), 
      family members (n = 12, average age 71), and HCTMs (n = 7, average age 47). Findings 
      revealed the complexity of hospital discharge planning for older adults through five 
      themes as follows: (a) home, (b) staying independent, (c) "advocating for them," (d) 
      deciding what to tell, and (e) changing the plan.

TI  - Visibility and meanings of partnership in health care for older people who need 
      support to live at home.
PG  - 1027-1037
LID - 10.1111/scs.12545 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Problems experienced by older people with complex needs to live at 
      home have been reported in the literature. This qualitative study builds on previous 
      research and investigates enduring issues older people face when interacting with 
      healthcare services. AIM: To gain an in-depth understanding of what is involved in 
      providing good quality health care for older people who need support to live at 
      home. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN: We adopted an interpretive descriptive approach and 
      conducted semi-structured interviews with older people (n = 7), carers (n = 8) and 
      key informants (n = 11). Initial and secondary analysis of qualitative data was 
      completed. FINDINGS: Major themes emerged about meanings of partnership in health 
      care, and invisibility of the older person as a partner in health care. Partnership 
      in health care was understood to mean being treated as an equal, being involved in 
      decision-making, and making contributions which impact on health care and health 
      systems. The metaphorical concept of 'invisibility' related to the older person not 
      being seen and heard as a partner in health care, as well as being a recipient of 
      care. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that older people who need support to live at home 
      are not highly visible to health providers, policymakers and researchers as a 
      central partner and consumer to be meaningfully engaged in shaping their health 
      care. Opportunities to address persistent issues with quality of health care may in 
      future be achieved through stronger partnerships between older people and health 
      providers, to find new ways to improve the quality of care for older people.

AB  - This article explores the work of an acute assessment and liaison service for older 
      people, including the role of the older people's specialist nurse in the service. 
      The service screens all patients admitted who are over the age of 75 for problems 
      specific to a frail population and to identify where ongoing specialist support, 
      referral or advice is indicated. Patients with complex problems undergo a 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment. The service has reduced length of stay and 
      resulted in better care for older people.

AB  - The UK has an ageing population, which means that more and more older people with 
      complex social and healthcare problems will present to emergency departments (EDs). 
      This article explains why ED staff must have appropriate training and education in 
      all aspects of caring for frail older people, including the use of appropriate and 
      specific assessment tools. The authors also refer to a soon-to-be-published 
      guideline for the care of frail older people with emergency care needs.

TI  - The complexities of documenting clinical information in long-term care settings in 
      Australia.
PG  - 8-12
AB  - Clinical nursing documentation, written, verbal or supported by technology, is being 
      affected by both the worldwide "information explosion" and budgetary constraints. In 
      Australia, the necessity of documenting complex care needs and treatment plans in 
      older adult care settings has become more imperative because funding levels and 
      sources are frequently tied to these documents. As a consequence, the statutory 
      requirements for documentation have become a significant driving force in shaping 
      nursing practice. Although the value of quality documentation is or should be 
      recognized, the seemingly vast amounts of time required inevitably distracts nurses 
      from what they see as their primary purpose-the provision of direct patient care. 
      Older adults who are frail are among the most complex clients requiring services in 
      what is traditionally a poorly resourced sector. Under-funding frequently impacts on 
      the staff skill mix, resulting in low levels of senior, highly qualified, and 
      skilled staff. These factors impact the quality of the documentation and possibly 
      the usage of the information itself. This article will provide an overview of the 
      issues related to documentation of clinical information in older adult care settings 
      with particular reference to some of the "unique" inefficiencies inherent in the 
      Australian system.

TI  - Older people's experiences of nurse-patient telephone communication in the primary 
      healthcare setting.
PG  - 373-382
LID - 10.1111/jan.13449 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine which aspects of primary nurse-patient telephone communication are 
      viewed positively or negatively in terms of meeting the older persons' needs. 
      BACKGROUND: Health professionals are increasingly being called on to develop 
      different ways of working and increase their capacity to meet the needs of an ageing 
      population. In some countries, telephone communication between primary nurses and 
      patients in General Practice is already seen as a routine practice, but determining 
      the value of this type of communication as a specific health service needs more 
      understanding. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study as the aim was to explore the 
      older person's experiences. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 
      21 older people from General Practices in New Zealand during 2014-2015. Thematic 
      analysis was informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: The 
      overarching theme was the difficulties older people face in making decisions about 
      whether to contact a health professional by telephone and whether this should be the 
      Primary nurse. Accounting for some of their symptoms as age related added to the 
      uncertainty of decision-making. Importantly, some older people were not raising 
      concerns e.g. emotional state. CONCLUSION: Decision-making by older people around 
      treatment seeking is complex. Increasing the awareness of the nurse role in the 
      General Practice is integral to creating a health system which will meet the needs 
      of a growing older population. Primary care practices can review their systems to 
      better inform older people how the nurse-telephone role as a specific health service 
      works and what they can expect when using this service.

TI  - Clinical profile of acute confusion in the long-term care setting.
PG  - 145-58
AB  - Aspects of acute confusion (AC) including risk factors, behavior patterns, and 
      outcomes are not well documented in long-term care (LTC) residents. The purpose of 
      this prospective study was to describe the clinical profile of AC in LTC including 
      risk factors, behavior patterns, etiologies, and 3-month outcomes. Seventy-four 
      elderly LTC residents were assessed for AC, depression, and global cognitive 
      impairment. Risk factors associated with AC included hearing deficits, depression, 
      pulmonary disorders, and abnormal serum sodium or potassium levels. Behavior 
      patterns of acutely confused residents included hyperactive (n = 9, 31%), hypoactive 
      (n = 8, 28%), and mixed (n = 7, 24%). In the majority of the AC cases, the etiology 
      was multIfactorial infections and dehydration were the most common causes. Residents 
      with AC had very poor 3-month outcomes. Thirty-four percent (n = 10) of the 
      residents with AC died within 3 months of the evaluation. This study highlights the 
      complexity and serious nature of AC in this frail population.

TI  - Effects of a continuum of care intervention on frail older persons' life 
      satisfaction: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 1079-90
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12699 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse effects of a comprehensive 
      continuum of care (intervention group) on frail older persons' life satisfaction, as 
      compared to those receiving usual care (control group). The intervention included 
      geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for 
      relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes. 
      BACKGROUND: Improvements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in 
      studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects 
      of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life 
      satisfaction are not well explored. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. METHODS: 
      The validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older 
      persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12 months after the 
      baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for 
      intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as 
      well as six- to 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Older persons who received the 
      intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who 
      received usual care, between 6 and 12 month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding 
      functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a 
      positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, 
      psychological health and financial situation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Frail 
      older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from 
      the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care 
      interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential 
      part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers 
      promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.

TI  - Health and social care planning in collaboration in older persons' homes: the 
      perspectives of older persons, family members and professionals.
PG  - 147-156
LID - 10.1111/scs.12440 [doi]
AB  - Providing health and social care to older persons is challenging, since older 
      persons often have multiple diseases and a complex health situation. Hence many 
      professions and organisations are involved. Lack of interprofessional and 
      interorganisational collaboration leads to fragmented care. Care planning meetings 
      before hospital discharge have long been used to overcome this fragmentation, but 
      meetings conducted at the hospital have limitations in identifying long-term needs 
      at home. A new model for health and social care planning in collaboration (HSCPC) in 
      older persons' homes was introduced in two Swedish municipalities. The aim of this 
      study was to gain a deeper understanding of the HSCPC-meeting from the perspectives 
      of older persons, family members, and professionals. Ten care planning meetings from 
      two municipalities were consecutively included. Interviews in retrospect with ten 
      older persons, eight family members, and ten groups of professionals who had 
      attended the HSCPC-meeting at home were analysed with a hermeneutic approach. Four 
      themes emerged: unspoken agendas and unpreparedness, security and enhanced 
      understanding, asymmetric relationships, and ambiguity about the mission and need 
      for follow-up. The comprehensive interpretation is that the professionals handled 
      the HSCPC-meeting mainly as a routine task, while the older persons and family 
      members viewed it as part of their life course. Older persons are in an inferior 
      institutional, cognitive and existential position. However, meeting together in the 
      home partly reduced their inferior position. Findings from this study provide some 
      general suggestions for how HSCPC-meetings should be designed and developed: 
      attention of power relations, the importance of meeting skills and follow-up.

TI  - Syringe feeding: current clinical practice and recommendations.
PG  - 85-7
AB  - In a survey of directors of nursing services of 101 nursing homes, it was found that 
      17 homes still used syringes to feed some of their frail residents. Three of these 
      17 facilities did not have easy access to speech pathologists, and the facility 
      feeding the greatest number of residents by syringe did not use the services of a 
      speech pathologist to assess swallowing. The practice of syringe feeding seems to be 
      going out of favor, but until this practice is no longer used it is hoped that the 
      recommendations in this article will increase the knowledge and awareness of 
      professional nurses, who are often instrumental in coordinating the difficult and 
      complex decision to syringe feed.

TI  - Integrated care for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium: Lessons 
      learned the hard way.
PG  - e12366
LID - 10.1111/opn.12366 [doi]
LID - e12366
AB  - The corona pandemic challenges countries worldwide in many different ways. Due to 
      its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several 
      shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and 
      deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such 
      as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown 
      that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed 
      and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between 
      various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level 
      of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But 
      setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes 
      and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in 
      their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This case study shows that 
      integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit 
      from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance 
      concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing 
      homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) 
      crises in nursing homes.

TI  - Helping family members manage medication administration hassles.
PG  - 13-5
AB  - Managing the medication regimens of dependent older adults in the home is a complex 
      issue for family caregivers. The tasks involved can include helping the older adults 
      manage their own medications or may require involvement in the purchasing, 
      scheduling, and administering of multiple medications for serious conditions. The 
      hassles associated with this responsibility are now known to be associated with 
      increased caregiver strain. In this article, we provide an overview of the body of 
      research on medication administration hassles and offer a tool to assess family 
      caregivers who are involved in this important aspect of care.

PG  - 22-33
AB  - Rural dwelling, frail older adults are a vulnerable population owing to the 
      complexity of health problems superimposed upon limited health care resources. Home 
      care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued 
      independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail 
      older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A 
      major theme identified was "Circles of Care." Grounded in rural culture, the circles 
      assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, 
      maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.

      home staff often experience a frustrating ethical conflict. This study examines the 
      effects of sets of independent variables on six autonomy dimensions to examine 
      nursing home personnel's perceptions of how care was provided in their facility. For 
      each of six case studies, respondents were asked the following question: "If Mr. or 
      Mrs. X were at your facility, what would have been decided?" Responses were recorded 
      along a continuum that indicated whether the resident would be allowed to make his 
      or her own decisions or whether the nursing home staff would decide for the 
      resident. Findings indicated staff members' education and race had the greatest 
      effect on their perceptions of personal autonomy. Somewhat surprisingly, staffing 
      levels, turnover rates, and restraint usage did not affect their views of autonomy. 
      Additional research is recommended to more completely examine the complex dimensions 
      of autonomy and to identify what changes nursing home staff and administrators could 
      implement to improve residents' quality of life.

TI  - Nurse care coordination and technology effects on health status of frail older 
      adults via enhanced self-management of medication: randomized clinical trial to test 
      efficacy.
PG  - 269-78
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0b013e318298aa55 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is 
      challenging for many older adults. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support 
      program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination 
      and technology. DESIGN: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three 
      arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. SETTING: Older adults having difficulty 
      in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three 
      Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. METHODS: All 
      participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no 
      further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses 
      coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either 
      an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the 
      Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance 
      Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were 
      measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS: After covariate and 
      baseline health status adjustment, time × group interactions for the MD.2 and 
      medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time × group 
      interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. 
      DISCUSSION: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health 
      status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 
      machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.

TI  - A nurse-led interdisciplinary primary care approach to prevent disability among 
      community-dwelling frail older people: a large-scale process evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased 
      risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, 
      an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving 
      individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and 
      long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case 
      manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates 
      cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications 
      regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale 
      had not hitherto been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which the 
      interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into 
      healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the 
      benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. DESIGN: A process evaluation was 
      conducted using a mixed methods design. SETTINGS: Six GP practices in the south of 
      the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Practice nurses (n=7), GPs (n=12), occupational 
      therapists (n=6) and physical therapists (n=20) participated in the process 
      evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (≥ 70 years) were 
      included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were 
      confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to 
      communicate in Dutch were excluded. METHODS: Quantitative data (logbooks and 
      evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 
      13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, 
      data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured 
      interviews and four focus group discussions. RESULTS: Although some parts of the 
      protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older 
      people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for 
      the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive 
      treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and 
      experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the 
      interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of 
      the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the 
      protocol need special attention.

TI  - Encountering the older confused patient: professional carers' experiences.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - THE STUDY'S RATIONALE: Confusion is a common condition among older patients and 
      often a fearful experience. Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for 
      confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost 
      as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 
      study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with 
      older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected 
      from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the 
      care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach 
      was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with 
      older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research 
      Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles 
      were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter 
      providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the 
      interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff 
      health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been 
      changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused 
      patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the 
      patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. 
      The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the 
      unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging 
      professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the 
      confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and 
      the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. 
      Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the 
      professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.

TI  - The Cardiac Care Bridge randomized trial in high-risk older cardiac patients: A 
      mixed-methods process evaluation.
PG  - 2498-2510
LID - 10.1111/jan.14786 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate healthcare professionals' performance and treatment fidelity in the 
      Cardiac Care Bridge (CCB) nurse-coordinated transitional care intervention in older 
      cardiac patients to understand and interpret the study results. DESIGN: A 
      mixed-methods process evaluation based on the Medical Research Council Process 
      Evaluation framework. METHODS: Quantitative data on intervention key elements were 
      collected from 153 logbooks of all intervention patients. Qualitative data were 
      collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 CCB professionals (cardiac 
      nurses, community nurses and primary care physical therapists), from June 2017 until 
      October 2018. Qualitative data-analysis is based on thematic analysis and integrated 
      with quantitative key element outcomes. The analysis was blinded to trial outcomes. 
      Fidelity was defined as the level of intervention adherence. RESULTS: The overall 
      intervention fidelity was 67%, ranging from severely low fidelity in the 
      consultation of in-hospital geriatric teams (17%) to maximum fidelity in the 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment (100%). Main themes of influence in the 
      intervention performance that emerged from the interviews are interdisciplinary 
      collaboration, organizational preconditions, confidence in the programme, time 
      management and patient characteristics. In addition to practical issues, the 
      patient's frailty status and limited motivation were barriers to the intervention. 
      CONCLUSION: Although involved healthcare professionals expressed their confidence in 
      the intervention, the fidelity rate was suboptimal. This could have influenced the 
      non-significant effect of the CCB intervention on the primary composite outcome of 
      readmission and mortality 6 months after randomization. Feasibility of intervention 
      key elements should be reconsidered in relation to experienced barriers and the 
      population. IMPACT: In addition to insight in effectiveness, insight in intervention 
      fidelity and performance is necessary to understand the mechanism of impact. This 
      study demonstrates that the suboptimal fidelity was subject to a complex interplay 
      of organizational, professionals' and patients' issues. The results support 
      intervention redesign and inform future development of transitional care 
      interventions in older cardiac patients.

TI  - Development of a proactive care program (U-CARE) to preserve physical functioning of 
      frail older people in primary care.
PG  - 230-7
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12023 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, 
      and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program 
      (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of 
      life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process 
      of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. METHODS: The framework of the 
      Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex 
      interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. 
      An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of 
      researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an 
      independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to 
      increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature 
      and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert 
      opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. FINDINGS: Based on 
      predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises 
      three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home 
      followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based 
      care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical 
      practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development 
      process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in 
      reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the 
      general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE 
      intervention is feasible in clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCES: The U-CARE 
      program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care 
      of older patients.

TI  - Relationships between nurses and family caregivers: partners in care?
PG  - 89-103
AB  - Increasing reliance on family care of elderly people at home calls for a critical 
      analysis of the relationship between formal and informal caregivers. Although much 
      has been written about how health professionals and family caregivers should relate 
      to one another, we know very little about the relationships that develop between 
      them. Using data from a qualitative study, this article illustrates that 
      relationships between community nurses and family members caring for frail elders 
      are complex, dynamic, and multifaceted. Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to 
      changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four 
      distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) 
      manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient. Each type is described, and implications for 
      nursing practice and research are discussed.

TI  - Medication-taking by the frail elderly in two ethnic groups.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - A complex and dangerous area of medical intervention with the elderly population is 
      drug therapy. Although drugs have contributed to the well-being of many older 
      persons, some elderly individuals are at risk due to polypharmacy and age-related 
      factors. The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the 
      medication-taking behaviors of two ethnic groups of noninstitutionalized frail 
      elderly individuals. The findings indicate that these individuals may be at risk for 
      harm due to their medication-taking practices. Healthcare professionals must 
      evaluate drug use by the elderly and be aware of the risks of drug misuse by this 
      vulnerable group.

TI  - An investigation of the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely 
      ill hospitalized older patients with coincidental dementia: a multi-method design.
PG  - 1127-36
AB  - The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the 
      components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly 
      people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the 
      problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design 
      comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived 
      from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently 
      combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and 
      older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of 
      elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer 
      from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey 
      revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were 
      more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. 
      No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had 
      items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. 
      A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were 
      invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to 
      the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of 
      the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between 
      documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within 
      each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care 
      is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. 
      Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide 
      nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by 
      the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method 
      research.

TI  - Discharge of frail older people from acute hospitals across Europe.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - Over the last few years the number of elderly patients in acute hospitals throughout 
      Europe has risen dramatically. The pressure on hospital beds leads to earlier 
      discharge and the task of sending patients home from hospitals is becoming more 
      complex. The provision of health and social services is organized in different ways 
      all over Europe. Therefore, it would be of interest to know more about how different 
      kinds of systems support the professional carers in their effort to satisfy the 
      needs which older people and their significant others experience in the discharge 
      process. A pilot study was set up mainly to provide information on what kinds of 
      problems are inherent in a multicentre, interprofessional research project involving 
      a large number of countries. The findings serve as an important knowledge base in a 
      future project. Experiences from the pilot study and the benefits of it are 
      presented.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of nursing homes residents requiring light-care.
PG  - 210-9
AB  - Rising nursing home (NH) costs and the poor quality of NH care make it important to 
      recognize elders for whom NH care may be inappropriate. As a first step in 
      developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH 
      residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 
      12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we 
      developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III 
      (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance 
      with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no 
      complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the 
      criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal 
      care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining 
      balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still 
      light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as 
      light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer 
      services than NHs.

TI  - Caring for caregivers: home care nursing's challenge.
PG  - 10-4
AB  - Home care nurses frequently manage patients who also receive a substantial amount of 
      care from a lay caregiver in the home. Because many of these care givers are 
      themselves frail and elderly, the home care nurse must assist both the patient and 
      the caregiver to cope with demands for physical care, complex technology, and 
      behavioral manifestations of chronic conditions. Specialty practice nurses are in an 
      ideal position to assist both the primary visiting nurse and the lay caregiver in 
      the management of complex wound, ostomy, and continence care associated with early 
      discharge from the hospital.

TI  - Age-related hearing loss in the dependent elderly population: a model for nursing 
      care.
PG  - 224-30
AB  - Advancing nursing care through the implementation of evidence-based practice is a 
      legitimate professional ideal. In reality there are many complex issues that need be 
      addressed before such a goal can be achieved. This paper takes an intermediate step 
      towards the realization of this aim in one aspect of continuing care nursing through 
      the presentation of a procedural model. The presented model is designed to stimulate 
      debate as to what could be, and arguably should be the role of the nurse in relation 
      to meeting the auditory rehabilitative needs of dependent elderly patients. The 
      model is based upon a published management model which outlines the auditory 
      rehabilitative process within a psychosocial framework. The original model has been 
      modified as a result of knowledge synthesis from a range of specialist disciplines 
      including nursing. The Audiological Care Model for Nursing is intended to offer an 
      accessible guide to this often neglected aspect of care.

TI  - Nurses with special interests.
PG  - 258
AB  - High Quality Care for All (Department of Health (DH), 2008) emphasised the 
      centrality of quality within NHS provision based upon a service that is 'fair, 
      personalized, effective and safe'. The challenge of meeting this aspiration is even 
      greater today amid resource constraints and the imperative of transferring more 
      complex care out of hospitals and into primary care and community settings. The 
      quality of care delivered to older people in particular has attracted much negative 
      comment (Ombudsman, 2011), with the values of care and compassion appearing to have 
      evaporated in some services.

TI  - The octogenarian cardiac surgery patient.
PG  - 75-95
AB  - As advances are made in medical-surgical technology and overall life expectancy 
      increases, cardiac surgery previously done only in younger populations is now 
      becoming common in older adult age groups. Most of the nursing literature regarding 
      elderly cardiac surgery patients focuses on the 65- to 75-year-old age group; little 
      has been written about the 80- to 90-year-old age group. Very elderly patients 
      present unique and complex challenges to the interdisciplinary teams involved in 
      their care. Nurses must recognize and anticipate the specialized needs of these 
      frail individuals to optimally manage their care. Aortic valve replacement is the 
      most common cardiac valve surgical procedure performed in very elderly persons. A 
      case study and an integrated care plan for the aortic valve surgery patient are 
      described.

TI  - Managing perplexing patients: the case of Helen.
PG  - 47-63
AB  - The challenges faced in provision of high quality and effective care to geriatric 
      psychiatric inpatients are substantial for all members of the interdisciplinary 
      team. Common care dilemmas, including the interplay of social, medical, and 
      psychiatric factors in treating complex patients, are perhaps best understood by 
      examining such a case. The hypothetical case of "Helen" illustrates the 
      multi-dimensional and often perplexing care needs of patients admitted multiple 
      times for inpatient care. Linked nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions, and 
      interdisciplinary care plans emphasize the changing care needs of such patients.

TI  - Pre-morbid skin changes in patients with cancer: Using 'Welam's sign' as a new 
      prognostic marker?
PG  - 272-3
AB  - Identification of the imminently dying patient can be a complex and difficult 
      process, especially in a frail and elderly population with malignancy. The Liverpool 
      Care Pathway utilizes a number of identification criteria for end-of-life care, but 
      additional prognostic physical signs may be useful. This article describes specific 
      skin changes not previously featured in the literature in four patients at end of 
      life with malignancy, and discusses the potential use of this as a prognostic 
      indicator.

TI  - Nurse case management: collaborative beyond the hospital walls.
PG  - 51-5
AB  - In 1989, St. Joseph Medical Center initiated a community-based nursing case 
      management program with two nurses providing care to high-risk, chronically ill, 
      frail elderly patients. This program has expanded to five registered nurses actively 
      following over 120 patients. Target populations now served have expanded to include: 
      frail elderly, high-risk pregnant women, premature infants, AIDS patients, and those 
      with chronic physical and mental illness. The nurse manages and coordinates the care 
      for patients through all settings (community and hospital), brokering services, 
      acting as a patient advocate, and giving traditional hands-on care as needed. 
      Outcomes analysis has shown that, after nursing case management intervention, the 
      patients demonstrated a 71% decrease in admissions to the medical center, a 21% 
      decrease in length of stay, and a 64% decrease in Emergency Room usage. Nursing case 
      management helps to prevent patients' health problems from becoming more complex. 
      Consequently, managing their health effectively requires fewer, less costly 
      resources while achieving improved patient outcomes.
