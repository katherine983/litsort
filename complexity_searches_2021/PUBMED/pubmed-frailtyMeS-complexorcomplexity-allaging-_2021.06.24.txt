TI  - Approach to frailty in the elderly in primary care and the community.
PG  - 240-245
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2018052 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a distinct clinical syndrome wherein the individual has low reserves and 
      is highly vulnerable to internal and external stressors. Although it is associated 
      with disability and multiple comorbidities, it can also be present in individuals 
      who seem healthy. Frailty is multidimensional and its pathophysiology is complex. 
      Early identification and intervention can potentially decrease or reverse frailty, 
      especially in the early stages. Primary care physicians, community nurses and 
      community social networks have important roles in the identification of pre-frail 
      and frail elderly through the use of simple frailty screening tools and rapid 
      geriatric assessments. Appropriate interventions that can be initiated in a primary 
      care setting include a targeted medical review for reversible medical causes of 
      frailty, medication appropriateness, nutritional advice and exercise prescription. 
      With ongoing training and education, the multidisciplinary engagement and 
      coordination of care of the elderly in the community can help to build resilience 
      and combat frailty in our rapidly ageing society.

AB  - Perioperative management of older adults is a complex field that is heavily 
      influenced by the clinical heterogeneity of older adults. Frailty-a geriatric 
      syndrome in which a patient is more vulnerable to stressors due to decreases in 
      physical function and reserve-has been indicative of adverse postoperative outcomes. 
      Many tools have been developed to measure frailty that incorporate a variety of 
      factors including physical and cognitive function, comorbidities, self-reported 
      measures of health, and clinical judgment. Most of these frailty assessment tools 
      are able to identify a subset of patients at risk of adverse outcomes including 
      postoperative complications, longer hospital length of stay, discharge to a higher 
      level of care, and mortality. Frailty assessment before surgical interventions can 
      also guide discussions among patients, their families, anesthesiologists, and 
      surgeons to tailor operative plans for patients to mitigate this increased risk. 
      Studies are ongoing to identify interventions in frail patients that can improve 
      postoperative outcomes, but high-quality data in the form of randomized controlled 
      trials are lacking at this time.

TI  - Frailty in lung transplantation: a systematic review.
PG  - 219-227
LID - 10.1080/17476348.2020.1702527 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Lung transplantation is an effective treatment for certain types of 
      end-stage lung disease. Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with 
      decreased physiological reserve and an increased risk for suboptimal health 
      outcomes.Area covered: This article reviews the current literature on frailty in 
      lung transplantation, with an emphasis on frailty measures, prevalence and impact of 
      frailty on morbidity and mortality prior to and following lung transplantation. 
      Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane systematic review databases were searched to 
      September 2019. The search included the MeSH terms 'frail elderly' or 'frailty' or 
      'sarcopenia' and 'lung disease' or 'lung transplantation'. Studies were included if: 
      the population were undergoing evaluation for, listed for or received a lung 
      transplant; frailty was prospectively assessed during lung transplant evaluation 
      using systematically defined criteria; used human subjects and; published in 
      English. The prevalence of frailty varied from 0% - 58%. The frailty phenotype and 
      short physical performance battery were the most common measures. Frailty was 
      associated with delisting and death pre-transplantation. Frailty was associated with 
      an increased risk of early mortality post-lung transplantation.Expert opinion: 
      Frailty is identified often in lung transplant candidates and is associated with 
      adverse pre and post-transplantation outcomes. Further research is necessary to 
      identify potential frailty interventions.

TI  - Nursing care needs and services utilised by home-dwelling elderly with complex 
      health problems: observational study.
PG  - 645
LID - 10.1186/s12913-017-2600-x [doi]
LID - 645
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Norway, as in many Western countries, a shift from institutional care 
      to home care is taking place. Our knowledge is limited regarding which needs for 
      nursing interventions patients being cared for in their home have, and how they are 
      met. We aimed at assessing aspects of health and function in a representative sample 
      of the most vulnerable home-dwelling elderly, to identify their needs for nursing 
      interventions and how these needs were met. METHODS: In this observational study we 
      included patients aged 75+ living in their own homes in Oslo, who received daily 
      home care, had three or more chronic diagnoses, received daily medication, and had 
      been hospitalized during the last year. Focused attention and cognitive processing 
      speed were assessed with the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), handgrip strength was used 
      as a measure of sarcopenia, mobility was assessed with the "Timed Up-and-Go" test, 
      and independence in primary activities of daily living by the Barthel Index. 
      Diagnoses and medication were collected from electronic medical records. For each 
      diagnosis, medication and functional impairment, a consensus group defined which 
      nursing service that the particular condition necessitated. We then assessed whether 
      these needs were fulfilled for each participant. RESULTS: Of 150 eligible patients, 
      83 were included (mean age 87Â years, 25% men). They had on average 6 diagnoses and 
      used 9 daily medications. Of the 83 patients, 61 (75%) had grip strength indicating 
      sarcopenia, 27 (33%) impaired mobility, and 69 (83%) an impaired TMT-A score. Median 
      amount of home nursing per week was 3.6Â h (interquartile range 2.6 to 23.4). 
      Fulfilment of pre-specified needs was >60% for skin and wound care in patients with 
      skin diseases, observation of blood glucose in patients taking antidiabetic drugs, 
      and in supporting food intake in patients with eating difficulties. Most other needs 
      as defined by the consensus group were fulfilled in <10% of the patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified a very frail group of home-dwelling patients. For this 
      group, resources for home nursing should probably be used in a more flexible and 
      pro-active way to aim for preserving functional status, minimize symptom burden, and 
      prevent avoidable hospitalisations.

TI  - Are Edentulousness, Oral Health Problems and Poor Health-Related Quality of Life 
      Associated with Malnutrition in Community-Dwelling Elderly (Aged 75 Years and Over)? 
      A Cross-Sectional Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu10121965 [doi]
LID - 1965
AB  - As the population ages, the risk of becoming malnourished increases. Research has 
      shown that poor oral health can be a risk factor for malnutrition in 
      institutionalized elderly. However, it remains unclear whether oral health problems, 
      edentulousness and health-related quality of life also pose a risk for malnutrition 
      in community-dwelling older adults. In this cross-sectional observational study, 
      1325 community-living elderly (â¥75 years) were asked to complete questionnaires 
      regarding nutritional status, oral status (edentulous, remaining teeth, or 
      implant-supported overdentures), oral health problems, health-related quality of 
      life (HRQoL), frailty, activities of daily living (ADL) and complexity of care 
      needs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with 
      nutritional status as dependent variable. Of the respondents, 51% (n = 521) were 
      edentulous, 38.8% (n = 397) had remaining teeth and 10.2% (n = 104) had an 
      implant-supported overdenture. Elderly with complex care needs were malnourished 
      most frequently, followed by frail and robust elderly (10%, 4.5% and 2.9%, 
      respectively). Malnourished elderly reported more frequent problems with chewing and 
      speech when compared with well-nourished elderly (univariate analysis). However, 
      multivariate analysis did not show an association between malnutrition and oral 
      health problems and edentulousness, although HRQoL was associated with malnutrition 
      (odds ratio (OR) 0.972, confidence interval (CI) 0.951â»0.955). Based on the results 
      of this cross-sectional study, it can be concluded that poor HRQoL is significantly 
      associated with malnutrition; however, edentulousness and oral health problems are 
      not.

AB  - Primary care physicians are uniquely placed to offer holistic, patient-centred care 
      to patients with T2DM. While the recent FDA-mandated cardiovascular outcome trials 
      offer a wealth of data to inform treatment discussions, they have also contributed 
      to increasing complexity in treatment decisions, and in the guidelines that seek to 
      assist in making these decisions. To assist physicians in avoiding treatment 
      inertia, Primary Care Diabetes Europe has formulated a position statement that 
      summarises our current understanding of the available T2DM treatment options in 
      various patient populations. New data from recent outcomes trials is contextualised 
      and summarised for the primary care physician. This consensus paper also proposes a 
      unique and simple tool to stratify patients into 'very high' and 'high' 
      cardiovascular risk categories and outlines treatment recommendations for patients 
      with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney 
      disease. Special consideration is given to elderly/frail patients and those with 
      obesity. A visual patient assessment tool is provided, and a comprehensive set of 
      prescribing tips is presented for all available classes of glucose-lowering 
      therapies. This position statement will complement the already available, often 
      specialist-focused, T2DM treatment guidelines and provide greater direction in how

AB  - BACKGROUND: Detecting infection in frail elderly is a challenge due to lack of 
      specific signs and symptoms. We highlight the complex situation when an elderly 
      woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified 
      health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly 
      individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system. METHODS: A 
      descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was 
      used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data 
      and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative 
      content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from 
      the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for 
      analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory 
      for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is 
      explored in the discussion. RESULTS: The latent content analysis of the daughter's 
      story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis 
      and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take 
      part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to 
      understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different 
      diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When 
      urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women 
      recovers quickly. CONCLUSION: The healthcare system should embrace the complexity in 
      the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate 
      reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as 
      complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with 
      multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage "correctly" for later 
      placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case 
      study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption 
      of complexity.

TI  - Strategies to promote access to medications during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 530-532
LID - 10.31128/AJGP-04-20-5390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable and older people with chronic 
      and complex conditions have self-isolated in their homes, potentially limiting 
      opportunities for consultations to have medications prescribed and dispensed. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe initiatives to ensure ongoing 
      access toÂ medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Cooperation between 
      wholesalers and purchase limits in pharmacies have helped to ensure supply of 
      essential medications. Therapeutic substitution by pharmacists is permitted for 
      specific products authorised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Prescribers 
      are permitted to issue digital image prescriptions, and implementation of electronic 
      prescribing has been fast-tracked. Expanded continued dispensing arrangements 
      introduced during the bushfire crises have been temporarily extended. Pharmacists 
      are permitted to provide medication management reviews via telehealth. A Home 
      Medicines Service has been introduced to facilitate delivery of medications to 
      people who are vulnerable or elderly. Anticipatory prescribing and medication 
      imprest systems are valuable for access to end-of-life medications within 
      residential aged care.

TI  - Experiences of elderly patients regarding participation in their hospital discharge: 
      a qualitative metasummary.
PG  - e025789
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025789 [doi]
LID - e025789
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ageing patients are discharged from the hospital 'quicker and sicker' 
      than before, and hospital discharge is a critical step in patient care. Older 
      patients form a particularly vulnerable group due to multimorbidity and frailty. 
      Patient participation in healthcare is influenced by government policy and an 
      important part of quality improvement of care. There is need for greater insights 
      into the complexity of patient participation for older patients in discharge 
      processes based on aggregated knowledge. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      review reported evidence concerning the experiences of older patients aged 65 years 
      and above regarding their participation in the hospital discharge process. METHODS: 
      We conducted a qualitative metasummary. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, 
      Cinahl, PsycINFO and SocINDEX were conducted. Data from 18 studies were included, 
      based on specific selection criteria. All studies explored older patients' 
      experience of participation during the discharge process in hospital, but varied 
      when it came to type of discharge and diagnosis. The data were categorised into 
      themes by using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis indicated that 
      participation in the discharge process varied among elderly patients. Five themes 
      were identified: (1) complexity of the patients state of health, (2) management and 
      hospital routines, (3) the norm and preference of returning home, (4) challenges of 
      mutual communication and asymmetric relationships and (5) the significance of 
      networks. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration between different levels in the health systems 
      and user-friendly information between staff, patient and families are crucial. The 
      complexity of patient participation for this patient group should be recognised to 
      enhance user involvement during discharge from hospital. Interventions or follow-up 
      studies of how healthcare professionals can improve their communication skills and 
      address the tension between client-centred goals and organisational priorities are 
      requested. Organisational structure may need to be restructured to ensure the 
      participation of elderly patients.

AB  - Frailty is a complex and growing phenomenon facing health care providers throughout 
      the continuum of care. Frailty is not well understood in post-acute care (PAC) 
      settings. The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize current evidence of 
      frailty impact on outcomes and frailty mitigation initiatives in PAC. Three major 
      publication databases were searched from January 2000 to June 2017 that identified 
      18 articles specifically addressing frailty in PAC. Three themes were identified: 
      scales used to measure frailty, factors that led to an adverse outcome or diagnosis 
      of frailty, and interventions to address frailty in PAC. Scales used to measure 
      frailty were dominated by physical factors and scarce on nutrition and social 
      support. Functional decline, grip strength, gait speed, polypharmacy, and nutrition 
      were identified in the studies as factors that identify frailty and are associated 
      with poor outcomes. All these frailty characteristics compromise patients' ability 
      to benefit from rehabilitation, which further establishes the importance of PAC 
      providers to identify, prevent, and treat frailty. Intervention studies had mixed 
      outcomes, suggesting a need for further development in this area. The findings of 
      this scoping review highlight the need for a comprehensive multidimensional 
      assessment of frailty risks in PAC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Healthy Aging: American Geriatrics Society White Paper Executive Summary.
PG  - 17-20
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15644 [doi]
AB  - In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript 
      titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In 
      response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care 
      Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS 
      and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive 
      summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The 
      full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has 
      increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for 
      personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with 
      illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has 
      focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity 
      and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is 
      likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is 
      committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults 
      as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to 
      promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and 
      experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in 
      complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; 
      the ability to provide culturally competent, person-centered care; the ability to 
      assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems 
      in optimizing outcomes. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:17-20, 2019.

TI  - Narratives of older persons' frailty and physical activity in relation to 
      environmental landscapes and time.
PG  - e12298
LID - 10.1111/opn.12298 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the 
      environmental landscape on the physical activity of older persons experiencing 
      frailty. BACKGROUND: This manuscript describes the second phase of an unpublished 
      larger study in the northern province of Lampang, Thailand. Phase One revealed that 
      14% of 1,788 older persons surveyed were found to have experienced frailty according 
      to Fried's frailty phenotypes, and low physical activity was associated with 
      frailty. In the light of frailty, how older persons experience physical activity in 
      their day-to-day living environments warrants in-depth exploration. DESIGN: This was 
      a qualitative study guided by narrative inquiry. METHODS: In-depth interviews and 
      observations were conducted with 13 older persons living with frailty. The method of 
      analysis was thematic and performance analysis. RESULTS: Two broad themes relating 
      to the environmental landscapes were as follows: (a) limiting environmental 
      landscapes and (b) engaging environmental landscapes. These landscapes, which change 
      across time, refer to physical and social spaces, and beliefs of older persons and 
      their family that have either positive or negative impacts on physical activity of 
      frail older persons. CONCLUSION: Complex interactions between physical and social 
      spaces and beliefs of older persons and family influence the physical activity 
      behaviours of older persons living with frailty. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This 
      study warrants education and policy aiming at creating optimal environmental 
      landscapes to promote physical activity in frail older persons.

TI  - A mixed methods thematic review: Health-related decision-making by the older person.
PG  - e1327-e1343
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14261 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To undertake a mixed methods thematic literature review that 
      explored how elderly adults approached decision-making in regard to their health 
      care following discharge. BACKGROUND: A critical time for appropriate health 
      decisions occurs during hospital discharge planning with nursing staff. However, 
      little is known how the 89% of elderly living at home make decisions regarding their 
      health care. Research into older adults' management of chronic conditions emerges as 
      an important step to potentially encourage symptom monitoring, prevent missed care 
      and detect deterioration. All should reduce the risk of hospital re-admission. 
      DESIGN: A mixed methods thematic literature review was undertaken. The structure 
      followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews recommended by the 
      EQUATOR network. METHODS: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus online databases were searched using keywords, 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. References drawn from relevant publications, 
      identified by experts and published between 1995 and 2017 were also considered. 
      Twenty-five qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies and reviews were 
      critically appraised (CASP 2013) before inclusion in the review. Analysis of each 
      study's findings was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (2006) steps to identify 
      major themes and sub-themes. RESULTS: Four main themes associated with 
      health-related decision-making in the elderly were identified: "the importance of 
      maintaining independence," "decision making style," "management of conditions at 
      home" and "discharge planning." CONCLUSION: Health care decision preferences in the 
      elderly emerged as highly complex and influenced by multiple factors. Development of 
      a tool to assess these components has been recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Nurses play a vital role in exploring and understanding the influence that 
      maintaining independence has with each patient. This understanding provides an 
      initial step toward development of a tool to assist collaboration between patients 
      and healthcare professionals involved in their care.

TI  - Identifying a Relationship Between Physical Frailty and Heart Failure Symptoms.
PG  - E1-E7
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0000000000000408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with 
      significant symptom burden; however, our understanding of the relationship between 
      symptoms and physical frailty in HF is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was 
      to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. 
      METHODS: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional 
      study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea 
      subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. 
      Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the 
      Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to 
      the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, 
      and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling 
      were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, 
      controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. RESULTS: The mean age of 
      the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 Â± 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart 
      Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail 
      participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P < .001), 75% worse wake 
      disturbances (P < .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with 
      those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake 
      disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and 
      improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aged population is increasing rapidly across the world and this is 
      expected to continue. People living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) 
      represent amongst the sickest and frailest cohort of the aged population, with a 
      high prevalence of chronic conditions and complex comorbidities. Given the 
      vulnerability of RACF residents and the demands on the system, there is a need to 
      determine the extent that care is delivered in line with best practice ('appropriate 
      care') in RACFs. There is also a recognition that systems should provide care that 
      optimises quality of life (QoL), which includes support for physical and 
      psychological well-being, independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and a 
      caring external environment. The aims of CareTrack Aged are to develop sets of 
      indicators for appropriate care and processes of care for commonly managed 
      conditions, and then assess the appropriateness of care delivered and QoL of 
      residents in RACFs in Australia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will extract 
      recommendations from clinical practice guidelines and, using expert review, convert 
      these into sets of indicators for 15 common conditions and processes of care for 
      people living in RACFs. We will recruit RACFs in three Australian states, and 
      residents within these RACFs, using a stratified multistage sampling method. 
      Experienced nurses, trained in the CareTrack Aged methods ('surveyors'), will review 
      care records of recruited residents within a 1-month period in 2019 and 2020, and 
      assess the care documented against the indicators of appropriate care. Surveyors 
      will concurrently assess residents' QoL using validated questionnaires. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics 
      Committee of Macquarie University (5201800386). The research findings will be 
      published in international and national journals and disseminated through 
      conferences and presentations to interested stakeholder groups, including consumers, 
      national agencies, healthcare professionals, policymakers and researchers.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with frailty among the young-old elderly 
      (YOE) and old-old elderly (OOE). METHODS: This longitudinal study with a 3-year 
      follow-up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS: 
      Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility 
      and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3-year 
      period. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent frailty, we suggest weight-loss prevention programs 
      for the YOE, lower-limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management 
      programs for both groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The findings may be 
      used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and 
      YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.

AB  - As the UK population lives to older ages, with more complex health and social care 
      needs, there comes a time when going to live in a care home might be essential for a 
      frail, older person. Residents and their families expect high-quality care in return 
      for the costs of their placements, but often find this is not the case ( Help the 
      Aged, 2006 ). In order to improve quality in care homes, the Lincolnshire Community 
      Health Services NHS Trust are piloting a care home support team. The new service 
      aims to provide education and training to an unpredictable workforce, with the 
      addition of regular ward rounds in care homes to ensure more proactive care for 
      residents, in order to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and improve the 
      quality of care offered. This article looks at the literature relating to education 
      and training for staff in care homes to support this service. It also aims to use 
      the reviewed articles to identify specific training and education needed to improve 
      quality of care for residents and reduce avoidable hospital admissions.

TI  - Effectiveness of professional oral health care intervention on the oral health of 
      residents with dementia in residential aged care facilities: a systematic review 
      protocol.
PG  - 110-22
LID - 10.11124/jbisrir-2015-2330 [doi]
AB  - REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to critically appraise 
      and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of professional oral health care 
      intervention on the oral health of aged care residents with dementia.More 
      specifically the objectives are to identify the efficacy of professional oral health 
      care interventions on general oral health, the presence of plaque and the number of 
      decayed or missing teeth. BACKGROUND: Dementia poses a significant challenge for 
      health and social policy in Australia. The quality of life of individuals, their 
      families and friends is impacted by dementia. Older people with dementia often have 
      other health comorbidities resulting in the need for a higher level of care. From 
      2009 to 2010, 53% of permanent residents in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) 
      had dementia on admission. Older Australians are retaining more of their natural 
      teeth, therefore residents entering RACFs will have more of their natural teeth and 
      require complex dental work than they did in previous generations. Data from the 
      Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that more than half the residents 
      in RACFs are now partially dentate with an average of 12 teeth each. Furthermore, 
      coronal and root caries are significant problems, especially in older Australians 
      who are cognitively impaired.Residents in aged care facilities frequently have poor 
      oral health and hygiene with moderate to high levels of oral disease and overall 
      dental neglect. This is reinforced by aged care staff who acknowledge that the 
      demands of feeding, toileting and behavioral issues amongst residents often take 
      precedence over oral health care regimens. Current literature shows that there is a 
      general reluctance on the part of aged care staff to prioritize oral care due to 
      limited knowledge as well as existing psychological barriers to working on another 
      person's mouth. Although staff routinely deal with residents' urinary and faecal 
      incontinence, deep psychological barriers exist when working on someone's mouth due 
      to their own personal values of oral health or their views that residents should be 
      looking after their own teeth or dentures. Furthermore, residents with behavioral 
      issues associated with dementia frequently have their oral hygiene neglected as they 
      may be resistant and violent towards receiving oral care from aged care staff. 
      Studies have shown that residents with dementia will often refuse to open their 
      mouth or partake in oral hygiene care by aged care staff. The aged care staff in 
      return often do not pursue an oral care regimen for these "difficult" residents, 
      perpetuating the cycle of oral neglect and resultant disease.Dental hygienists are 
      qualified oral health professionals who are specifically trained to develop 
      individualized oral health care plans and preventative programs to reduce oral 
      health disease in the community. Residents with dementia in aged care facilities 
      have the right to live their lives comfortably and free of oral discomfort or pain. 
      A Victorian study conducted by Hopcraft et al. investigated the ability of a dental 
      hygienist to undertake a dental examination/screening for residents in aged care 
      facilities, to develop a preventative and periodontal treatment plan and to refer 
      patients appropriately to a dentist. Results from this study demonstrated that there 
      was an excellent agreement between the dentist and dental hygienist regarding the 
      decision to refer residents to a dentist for treatment, demonstrating high 
      sensitivity (99.6%) and high specificity (82.9%). Residents from 31 Victorian RACFs 
      (n=510) were examined by a single experienced dental epidemiologist and one of four 
      dental hygienists using a simple mouth mirror and probe. Hopcraft et al. concluded 
      that hygienists should be utilized more widely in providing holistic oral health 
      care to residents in aged care facilities.Recently, Lewis et al. discussed the need 
      to develop models of care to improve access to dental care for frail and 
      functionally dependent elderly people in aged care facilities, with the model of 
      care involving dental hygienists/oral health therapists having merit.The concept of 
      professional oral care involves an oral health professional such as a dental 
      hygienist or oral health therapist supervising or assisting residents with their 
      oral care. Oral care involves the mechanical removal of plaque and food debris using 
      a toothbrush, interproximal brush and floss.In 2014, Morino et al. explored the 
      efficacy of short term professional oral care from dental hygienists once a week 
      after breakfast for one month. In this study, the dental hygienists did not perform 
      dental scaling but brushed subjects' teeth using a toothbrush and interdental brush. 
      Dental plaque scores decreased significantly (Fisher's two-tailed tests, p<0.05) in 
      the professional oral health intervention group. Interestingly, the positive effects 
      of this short term intervention were sustained for the following three months 
      (Wilcoxon test, p<0.05).A pilot study in Arkansas was conducted by Amerine et al. 
      and utilized the dental hygienist as the "oral health champion" in the residential 
      aged care facility using the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) and Geriatric Oral 
      Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) scores to measure oral health. The results from this 
      study showed improvements in three measured areas (tongue health, denture status and 
      oral cleanliness) in the dental hygiene champion group. These findings suggest that 
      the presence of a dental hygiene champion in long term care facilities may 
      positively impact the oral health of residents requiring assistance with their oral 
      care. However, the authors noted further research in this concept is required.Van 
      Der Putten GJ et al. explored the effectiveness of a supervised implementation of an 
      oral health care guideline in care homes. In each ward of the care homes, a nurse 
      who acted as the ward oral health care organiser (WOO) was appointed. The dental 
      hygienist and an investigator would attend the RACFs every six weeks to support 
      them. The dental hygienist would train the WOO, and the WOO would train the ward 
      nurses and nurse assistants. Participants were allocated into an intervention or a 
      control group. The intervention group received supervised oral care. Statistically 
      significant differences in mean dental and denture plaque scores at six months in 
      both groups occurred (student t-test, p < 0.0001). This research study implemented 
      an intervention using the train-the-trainer approach and although improvements in 
      dental and denture plaque scores were seen in the six-month period, the long-term 
      effects of this intervention are unknown. Further studies exploring the long-term 
      effects of staff training on oral health education are needed as well as ongoing 
      staff training in aged care facilities.A systematic review on oral health and 
      aspiration pneumonia conducted by Vander Maarel-Wierink et al. has suggested that, 
      in the frail elderly, the best intervention to reduce the incidence of aspiration 
      pneumonia is brushing of teeth after each meal, cleaning dentures once a day, and 
      receiving professional oral health care once a week.The need to advocate for a new 
      model of geriatric dentistry is critical. A holistic multi-disciplinary approach to 
      health care for residents entering aged care homes is imperative to achieve better 
      oral health and comfort for residents, especially with Australia's ageing dentate 
      population. A dental examination and assessment on admission to a RACF should be 
      conducted by a Registered Nurse (RN), followed by an oral health professional such 
      as a dentist, dental hygienist or oral health therapist. Current practice in the 
      majority of Australian government funded nursing homes is that the RN or the 
      Assistant in Nursing (AIN) conduct the oral health assessment as part of the aged 
      care funding instrument (ACFI). Ongoing oral health care supported by an oral health 
      professional is important throughout the individual's residency and eventual 
      palliation whilst in an aged care facility.No systematic reviews conducted on the 
      impact of professional oral care on the oral health of elderly people living in 
      residential aged care facilities could be located, despite extensive searching of 
      Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Trials and 
      Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source (DOSS) databases. A JBI systematic review was 
      conducted in 2004, titled, "Oral hygiene care for adults with dementia in 
      residential aged care facilities"; however, this review examined the prevalence, 
      incidence and increments of oral diseases; the use of assessment tools to evaluate 
      oral health; preventative oral hygiene care strategies; and the provision of dental 
      treatment and so had a different clinical focus. Twenty studies were included for 
      analysis in the review conducted by Weening-Verbree et al, The studies in this 
      review addressed oral health knowledge of aged care staff and mostly were conducted 
      as an educational session delivered by dental hygienists or dentists.Overall, the 
      current evidence available on interventions to improve oral health for residents 
      living in aged care facilities is inadequate and should be explored further.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising burden of chronic diseases has attracted the attention of 
      public health researchers and policymakers worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To assess the 
      demographic, morbidity and outcome patterns of chronic illness among the older 
      patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals 
      Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred and eighty-eight (788) adults 
      (60 years and over) hospitalized between 2010 and 2014 in the hospital. 
      INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: The age of the selected study population ranged from 
      60 to 99 years with a mean of 76.08(Â±10.42). More than half (53.0%) were between 
      60-69 years, with a subsequent decline. Male patients accounted for 64.0%, but 
      females were more frequent among patients 80 years and older. The most common health 
      conditions were heart diseases (22.5%), neoplasm (13.2%), cerebrovascular accident 
      (12.4%), and gastrointestinal diseases (14.5%). The records showed that 14.9% were 
      referred to other institution for various reasons (including further management, 
      lack of space, industrial action by workers, discharged against medical advice or 
      dead). CONCLUSION: Heart diseases were the major chronic illnesses among the older 
      adults followed by neoplasm conditions, while musculoskeletal conditions were the 
      least. It also found that there was a poor outcome of conditions among older adults 
      in this setting. Therefore, efforts should be made towards the prevention and 
      reduction of chronic illnesses, as well as improving the outcome of care. FUNDING:

AB  - Nutrition and hydration are vital components of critical care nursing. However, 
      meeting the nutrition and hydration needs of the critically ill older adult is often 
      complex, because of preexisting risk factors (malnutrition, unintentional weight 
      loss, frailty, and dehydration); as well as intensive care unit-related challenges 
      (catabolism, eating and feeding, end-of-life care). This article highlights the 
      challenges of managing nutrition and hydration in the critically ill older adult, 
      reviews assessment principles, and offers strategies for optimizing nutrition and 
      hydration.

TI  - Perceptions About Technologies That Help Community-Dwelling Older Adults Remain at 
      Home: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e17930
LID - 10.2196/17930 [doi]
LID - e17930
AB  - BACKGROUND: The population of Europe is aging rapidly. Most community-dwelling older 
      adults (CDOAs) want to remain in their homes, particularly those experiencing 
      functional decline. Politicians and academics repeatedly praise technological 
      instruments for being the preferred solution for helping older adults with 
      deteriorating health to remain at home. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand 
      the perceptions of CDOAs and their informal caregivers (ICs) and professional 
      caregivers (PCs) about technologies that can help keep older adults at home. 
      METHODS: This qualitative study used personal interviews, focus groups, and 
      photo-elicitation interviews to better understand the perceptions of a convenience 
      sample of 68 CDOAs, 21 ICs, and 32 PCs. RESULTS: A fraction of CDOAs did not 
      perceive technological instruments to be a very useful means of helping them remain 
      at home. However, the ICs and PCs were more positive. The CDOAs preferred and were 
      more willing to adopt technologies related to their mobility and safety and those 
      that would help slow down their cognitive decline. The ICs preferred technological 
      aids that assist in the activities of daily living as well as safety-related 
      technologies for detecting falls and helping to locate disoriented older adults. The 
      PCs preferred integrated communication and information systems to improve 
      collaboration between all stakeholders, housing equipped with technologies to manage 
      complex care, high-performance ancillary equipment to transfer people with reduced 
      mobility, and surveillance systems to ensure safety at home. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      our study reports that CDOAs have limited interest in innovative technologies to 
      help them remain at home, their technological skills will undoubtedly improve in the 
      future, as will those of ICs and PCs. Technological tools will play an increasingly 
      important role in home health care.

TI  - Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative: Early Implementation Results of a 
      National Veterans Affairs Program to Honor Veterans' Care Preferences.
PG  - 1803-1812
LID - 10.1007/s11606-020-05697-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: On July 1, 2018, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) National Center 
      for Ethics in Health Care implemented the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions 
      Initiative (LSTDI). Its goal is to identify, document, and honor LST decisions of 
      seriously ill veterans. Providers document veterans' goals and decisions using a 
      standardized LST template and order set. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the first 7Â months of 
      LSTDI implementation and identify predictors of LST template completion. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective observational study of clinical and administrative data. We identified 
      all completed LST templates, defined as completion of four required template fields. 
      Templates also include four non-required fields. Results were stratified by risk of 
      hospitalization or death as estimated by the Care Assessment Need (CAN) score. 
      SUBJECTS: All veterans with VA utilization between July 1, 2018, and January 31, 
      2019. MAIN MEASURES: Completed LST templates, goals and LST preferences, and 
      predictors of documentation. RESULTS: LST templates were documented for 108,145 
      veterans, and 85% had one or more of the non-required fields completed in addition 
      to the required fields. Approximately half documented a preference for 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among those who documented specific goals, half 
      wanted to improve or maintain function, independence, and quality of life while 28% 
      had a goal of life prolongation irrespective of risk of hospitalization/death and 
      45% expressed a goal of comfort. Only 7% expressed a goal of being cured. Predictors 
      of documentation included VA nursing home residence, older age, frailty, and 
      comorbidity, while non-Caucasian race, rural residence, and receipt of care in a 
      lower complexity medical center were predictive of no documentation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      LST decisions were documented for veterans at high risk of hospitalization or death. 
      While few expressed a preference for cure, half desire, cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation. Predictors of documentation were generally consistent with existing 
      literature. Opportunities to reduce observed disparities exist by leveraging 
      available VA resources and programs.

TI  - The Obesity Paradox in Sepsis: A Theoretical Framework.
PG  - 287-294
LID - 10.1177/1099800420905889 [doi]
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome that occurs in response to a severe infection. 
      In recent years, the understanding of the pathobiology of sepsis has been refined, 
      with research describing an altered host response as the underlying cause. Survivors 
      of sepsis often have long hospital stays and suffer from subsequent frailty and 
      long-term health consequences. Predicting attributes of sepsis survivors remains 
      challenging; however, an obesity paradox exists, wherein obese individuals survive 
      sepsis at higher rates than their normal-weight counterparts. We present a model 
      that describes the relationships between sepsis and obesity, focusing on 
      inflammation as a shared pathway for dysregulation in obese and healthy-weight 
      adults. Understanding the interaction of these complex variables is an important 
      first step toward developing interventions and treatments to augment sepsis 
      survival.

TI  - The outcome for surgical fixation of distal radial fractures in patients with 
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease: a cohort study.

LID - 125
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurologic 
      disorder causing postural instability and unsteady gait. These patients are at 
      increased risk for fractures and have inferior outcomes after treatment. Several 
      studies have evaluated the incidence and outcome of PD patients after hip fractures. 
      However, there are limited studies assessing the outcome of upper extremity 
      fractures in these patients. In this study, we evaluated the outcome of PD patients 
      that received surgical intervention for distal radial fractures (DRF). We 
      hypothesize that these patients have an inferior outcome after surgery in comparison 
      with non-PD patients. METHODS: Between May 2005 and May 2017, we retrospectively 
      reviewed all of the patients with DRF and subsequently underwent open reduction and 
      internal fixation (ORIF) at a level 1 trauma center. All of the surgeries were 
      performed by fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons. The inclusion criteria include 
      patients with a definitive diagnosis of PD, non-pathological DRF, and a minimum 
      follow-up of 1âyear or up until the time of treatment failure was noted. Each PD 
      patient was matched for age and gender to 3 non-PD patients. The primary objective 
      was to determine the failure rate after surgical fixation for DRF. The secondary 
      outcomes include time to treatment failure, reoperation rate, readmission rate, 
      length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 88 
      patients were included in this study (23 PD, 65 non-PD patients). All underwent ORIF 
      and received standard postoperative follow-ups. The overall treatment failure rate 
      in PD was 39.1% vs. 4.6% in the non-PD group (p < 0.05). The time to treatment 
      failure were 9.11 Â± 3.86âweeks and 14.67 Â± 5.8âweeks for PD and non-PD, respectively 
      (p < 0.05). PD patients had a significantly higher rate of failure when k-wires and 
      ESF were used (p < 0.05%), while loss of reduction was the most common mode of 
      failure in PD (44.4%). The length of hospital stay for PD was 5.3 Â± 4.69âdays 
      compared with 3.78 Â± 0.96âdays for non-PD (p = 0.01). There were 3 PD patients 
      readmitted within 30âdays after surgery, and 1 patient had pneumonia after the 
      surgery. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that patients with PD have a high treatment 
      failure rate despite surgical intervention for DRF. PD patients had a longer 
      hospital stay and had a shorter time to treatment failure. In treating PD patients 
      complicated with DRF, the surgeon must take into consideration the complex disease 
      course of PD and the associated comorbidities such as osteoporosis, frail status, 
      and frequent falls. Rehabilitation and disposition plans should be discussed in 
      advance and longer hospital stays should be expected. Level of evidenceLevel IV, 
      retrospective cohort study.

AB  - AIM: To develop and validate a physical exercise programme aimed at delaying the 
      functional decline in frail older adults. DESIGN: The revised guideline of Criteria 
      for Reporting the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions in health care 
      was followed. METHODS: The physical exercise programme was designed and validated by 
      exercise specialists to be implemented by healthcare professionals. The physical 
      exercise programme underwent three stages of development, piloting and evaluation. 
      It includes a portfolio of exercises in different support materials (posters, e-book 
      and website). A testing intervention was delivered to the target population. 
      RESULTS: The Criteria for Reporting the Development and Evaluation of Complex 
      Interventions in health care process has the potential to help practitioners in 
      developing and planning complex interventions, such as an exercise programme. Its 
      components can be adjusted to the context and to the characteristics of the target 
      population. A study protocol and a pilot study will be developed to test the 
      effectiveness of the physical exercise programme on delaying the functional decline 
      of frail older adults.

TI  - POLST Facilitation in Complex Care Management: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1177/1049909118797077 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is an 
      advance care planning tool designed for seriously ill patients. The discussions 
      needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not 
      occur in the outpatient setting. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a single-arm feasibility 
      study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a 
      standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. 
      SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a 
      complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. MEASUREMENTS: We 
      assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible 
      patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting 
      Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items 
      about the intervention. RESULTS: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, 
      with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. 
      The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. 
      Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the 
      required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week 
      follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers 
      agreed or strongly agreed that "Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about 
      what I really want." CONCLUSIONS: The POLST facilitation can be successfully 
      delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high 
      fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this 
      approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - Interprofessional collaborative education and practice has become a cornerstone of 
      optimal person-centered management in the current complex health care climate. This 
      is especially important when working with older adults, many with multiple chronic 
      conditions and challenging health care needs. This paper describes a feasibility 
      study of the Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training 2.0 (GITT 2.0) program 
      focused on providing interprofessional care to complex and frail older adults with 
      multiple chronic conditions. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design 
      facilitated program implementation and evaluation. Over three years (2013-2016), 65 
      graduate students from nursing, midwifery, social work, and pharmacy participated 
      along with 25 preceptors. Participants were surveyed on their attitudes toward 
      interprofessional collaboration pre and post-intervention and participated in focus 
      groups. While attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration did not change 
      quantitatively, focus groups revealed changes in language and enhanced perspectives 
      of participants. Based on the evaluation data, the GITT 2.0 Toolkit was refined for 
      use in interprofessional education and practice activities related to quality 
      initiatives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies supporting discharged patients are hospital-based which 
      admission criteria tend to include mainly those with complex needs and/or specific 
      disease conditions. This study captured the service gap where these non-frail older 
      patients might have no specific medical problem upon discharge but they might 
      encounter residual health and social issues when returning home. METHODS: Discharged 
      community-dwelling non-frail older adults from an emergency medical ward were 
      recruited and randomized into either intervention (nÂ =â37) or control (nÂ =â38) 
      group. The intervention group received a 12-week complex interventions that included 
      structured assessment, health education, goal empowerment, and care coordination 
      supported by a health-social team. The control group received usual discharge care 
      and monthly social call. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL). Secondary outcomes included activities of daily living (ADL), the presence 
      of depressive symptoms, and the use of health services. The outcomes were measured 
      at pre-intervention (T1) and at three months post-intervention (T2). The independent 
      t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the group differences in 
      HRQoL, ADL, and presence of depressive symptoms according to the normality of data. 
      RESULTS: Analysis showed that the intervention group experienced a statistically 
      significantly improvement in the mental component scale of quality of life 
      (pÂ =â.036), activities of daily living (pÂ =â.005), and presence of depressive 
      symptoms (pÂ =â.035) at T2 compared with at T1. No significant differences were found 
      in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting self-care is necessary to enable 
      community-dwelling non-frail older adults to be independent to the fullest extent 
      possible in the community. The promising results found in this pilot study suggested 
      that the integration of the health-social partnership into transitional care 
      practice is effective and can be sustained in the community. Future studies can draw 
      on these findings and maximize the integrated care quality during the transition 
      phase. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04434742 (date: 17 June 2020, retrospectively 
      registered).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore prevalences and occupational group inequalities of two 
      measures of multimorbidity with frailty. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The 
      Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway, a total county population health survey, 
      2006-2008. PARTICIPANTS: Participants older than 25 years, with complete 
      questionnaires, measurements and occupation data were included. OUTCOMES: â¥2 of 51 
      multimorbid conditions with â¥1 of 4 frailty measures (poor health, mental illness, 
      physical impairment or social impairment) and â¥3 of 51 multimorbid conditions with 
      â¥2 of 4 frailty measures. ANALYSIS: Logistic regression models with age and 
      occupational group were specified for each sex separately. RESULTS: Of 41 193 
      adults, 38 027 (55% female; 25-100 years old) were included. Of them, 39% had â¥2 
      multimorbid conditions with â¥1 frailty measure, and 17% had â¥3 multimorbid 
      conditions with â¥2 frailty measures. Prevalence differences in percentage points 
      (pp) with 95% confidence intervals of those in high versus low occupational group 
      with â¥2 multimorbid conditions and â¥1 frailty measure were largest in women age 30 
      years, 17 (14 to 20) pp and 55 years, 15 (13 to 17) pp and in men age 55 years, 15 
      (13 to 17) pp and 80 years, 14 (9 to 18) pp. In those with â¥3 multimorbid conditions 
      and â¥2 frailty measures, prevalence differences were largest in women age 30 years, 
      8 (6 to 10) pp and 55 years, 10 (8 to 11) ppand in men age 55 years, 9 (8 to 11) pp 
      and 80 years, 6 (95% CI 1 to 10) pp. CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity with frailty is 
      common, and social inequalities persist until age 80 years in women and throughout 
      the lifespan in men. To manage complex multimorbidity, strategies for proportionate 
      universalism in medical education, healthcare, public health prevention and 
      promotion seem necessary.

      healthy and healthy elderly individuals.
PG  - 471-478
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2017-0311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reference intervals are widely used as decision tools, providing the 
      physician with information about whether the analyte values indicate ongoing disease 
      process. Reference intervals are generally based on individuals without diagnosed 
      diseases or use of medication, which often excludes elderly. The aim of the study 
      was to assess levels of albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST), creatinine and Î³-glutamyl transferase (Î³-GT) in frail, 
      moderately healthy and healthy elderly indivuduals. METHODS: Blood samples were 
      collected from individuals >80 years old, nursing home residents, in the Elderly in 
      LinkÃ¶ping Screening Assessment and Nordic Reference Interval Project, a total of 569 
      individuals. They were divided into three cohorts: frail, moderately healthy and 
      healthy, depending on cognitive and physical function. Albumin, ALT, AST, creatinine 
      and Î³-GT were analyzed using routine methods. RESULTS: Linear regression predicted 
      factors for 34% of the variance in albumin were activities of daily living (ADL), 
      gender, stroke and cancer. ADLs, gender and weight explained 15% of changes in ALT. 
      For AST levels, ADLs, cancer and analgesics explained 5% of changes. Kidney disease, 
      gender, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease explained 25% of the variation in creatinine levels and MMSE explained three 
      per cent of Î³-GT variation. CONCLUSIONS: Because a group of people are at the same 
      age, they should not be assessed the same way. To interpret results of laboratory 
      tests in elderly is a complex task, where reference intervals are one part, but far 
      from the only one, to take into consideration.

AB  - AIM: To implement an educational programme for nursing staff on recognising, 
      reporting and managing resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in aged care 
      facilities. BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the 
      demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for 
      older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction 
      between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those 
      behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as 
      abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an 
      educational programme. DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia 
      New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). METHODS: This trial was 
      undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded 
      in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control 
      group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were 
      consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the 
      intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control 
      group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, 
      managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be 
      evaluated on an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: It is vital to manage and 
      reduce resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may 
      assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and 
      may improve comprehensive evidence-based care for older people residing in aged care 
      facilities.

TI  - Caregivers' experiences of a home support program after the hospital discharge of an 
      older family member: a qualitative analysis.
PG  - 220

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ageing global population has seen increasing numbers of older people 
      living with chronic health problems, declining function, and frailty. As older 
      people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours 
      (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured 
      health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can 
      find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The 
      Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach 
      intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers 
      of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The 
      objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who 
      participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from 
      hospital. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers 
      of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian 
      hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their 
      experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, 
      transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one family 
      caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89âyears) participated in the interviews. Themes 
      emerging were 'The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH 
      program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers 
      indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise 
      the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed 
      support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and 
      resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to 
      care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH 
      discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care 
      systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, 
      physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred 
      health and social care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZCTR Trial ID: ACTRN126140011746773 .

AB  - The number of older adults continues to increase in all healthcare settings. The 
      majority of older adults are living in the community. Most are dealing with at least 
      one chronic physical illness or mental health concern. Nutritional status and 
      depression, key indicators of overall health, have a complex and interdependent 
      relationship. Clinicians must understand factors that affect nutrition and 
      depression to promote positive health outcomes and enhance the overall quality of 
      life for the oldest-old in the community.

AB  - Frailty and falls are closely associated with each other as well as with disability, 
      hospitalization, and death. Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail 
      older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a 
      one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 
      community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. 
      After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of 
      falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail 
      participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a 
      viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where 
      these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a 
      lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older people with frailty (OPF) can experience reduced quality of care 
      and adverse outcomes due to poorly coordinated and fragmented care, making this 
      patient population a key target group for integrated care. This systematic review 
      explores service user, carer and provider perspectives on integrated care for OPF, 
      and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation, to draw out 
      implications for policy, practice and research. METHODS: Systematic review and 
      narrative synthesis of qualitative studies identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO 
      and Social Sciences Citation Index, hand-searching of reference lists and citation 
      tracking of included studies, and review of experts' online profiles. Quality of 
      included studies was appraised with The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for 
      qualitative research. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the synthesis. We 
      identified four themes related to stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for 
      OPF: different preferences for integrated care among service users, system and 
      service organisation components, relational aspects of care and support, and 
      stakeholder perceptions of outcomes. Service users and carers highlighted continuity 
      of care with a professional they could trust, whereas providers emphasised improved 
      coordination of care between providers in different care sectors as key strategies 
      for integrated care. We identified three themes related to factors facilitating and 
      hindering implementation: perceptions of the integrated care intervention and target 
      population, service organisational factors and system level factors influencing 
      implementation. Different stakeholder groups perceived the complexity of care needs 
      of this patient population, difficulties with system navigation and access, and 
      limited service user and carer involvement in care decisions as key factors 
      hindering implementation. Providers mainly also highlighted other organisational and 
      system factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation of integrated care 
      for OPF. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities and differences in lay and professional 
      stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF and factors perceived to 
      facilitate and hinder implementation were evident. Findings highlight the importance 
      of addressing organisational and system level components of integrated care and 
      factors influencing implementation for OPF. Greater attention needs to be placed on 
      collaboratively involving service users, carers and providers to improve the 
      co-design and implementation of integrated care programmes for this patient 
      population.

AB  - Eight percent of Australians aged 65 years and over receive residential aged care 
      each year. Residents are increasingly older, frailer and have complex care needs on 
      entry to residential aged care. Up to 63% of Australian residents of aged care 
      facilities take nine or more medications regularly. Together, these factors place 
      residents at high risk of adverse drug events. This paper reviews medication-related 
      policies, practices and research in Australian residential aged care. Complex 
      processes underpin prescribing, supply and administration of medications in aged 
      care facilities. A broad range of policies and resources are available to assist 
      health professionals, aged care facilities and residents to optimise medication 
      management. These include national guiding principles, a standardised national 
      medication chart, clinical medication reviews and facility accreditation standards. 
      Recent Australian interventions have improved medication use in residential aged 
      care facilities. Generating evidence for prescribing and deprescribing that is 
      specific to residential aged care, health workforce reform, medication-related 
      quality indicators and inter-professional education in aged care are important steps 
      toward optimising medication use in this setting.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although the majority of older patients admitted to a cardiology unit 
      present with at least one geriatric syndrome, guidelines on managing heart disease 
      often do not consider the complex needs of frail older patients. Geriatric 
      co-management has demonstrated potential to improve functional status, and reduce 
      complications and length of stay, but evidence on the effectiveness in cardiology 
      patients is lacking. This study aims to determine if geriatric co-management is 
      superior to usual care in preventing functional decline, complications, mortality, 
      readmission rates, reducing length of stay and improving quality of life in older 
      patients admitted for acute heart disease or for transcatheter aortic valve 
      implantation, and to identify determinants of success for geriatric co-management in 
      this population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective quasi-experimental 
      before-and-after study will be performed on two cardiology units of the University 
      Hospitals Leuven in Belgium in patients aged â¥75 years. In the precohort (n=227), 
      usual care will be documented. A multitude of implementation strategies will be 
      applied to allow for successful implementation of the model. Patients in the after 
      cohort (n=227) will undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment within 24âhours of 
      admission to stratify them into one of three groups based on their baseline risk for 
      developing functional decline: low-risk patients receive proactive consultation, 
      high-risk patients will be co-managed by the geriatric nurse to prevent 
      complications and patients with acute geriatric problems will receive an additional 
      medication review and co-management by the geriatrician. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee UZ Leuven/KU Leuven 
      (S58296). Written voluntary (proxy-)informed consent will be obtained from all 
      participants at the start of the study. Dissemination of results will be through 
      articles in scientific and professional journals both in English and Dutch and by 
      conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02890927.

TI  - Family conferences and shared prioritisation to improve patient safety in the frail 
      elderly (COFRAIL): study protocol of a cluster randomised intervention trial in 
      primary care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty in elderly patients is associated with an increased risk of poor 
      health outcomes, including falls, delirium, malnutrition, hospitalisation, and 
      mortality. Because polypharmacy is recognised as a possible major contributor to the 
      pathogenesis of geriatric frailty, reducing inappropriate medication exposure is 
      supposed to be a promising approach to improve health-related quality of life and 
      prevent adverse outcomes. A major challenge for the process of deprescribing of 
      inappropriate polypharmacy is to improve the communication between general 
      practitioner (GPs), patient and family carer. This study investigates the effects of 
      a complex intervention in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy living at home. 
      METHODS: This is a cluster randomised controlled trial including 136 GPs and 676 
      patients. Patients with a positive clinical screening for frailty are eligible if 
      they are aged 70âyears or older, receiving family or professional nursing care at 
      home, and taking in five or more drugs per day. Exclusion criteria are higher grade 
      of dementia and life expectancy of 6 months or less. The GPs of the intervention 
      group receive an educational training promoting a deprescribing guideline and 
      providing information on how to conduct a family conference focussing on 
      prioritisation of treatment goals concerning drug therapy. During the 1-year 
      intervention, GPs are expected to perform a total of three family conferences, each 
      including a structured medication review with patients and their family carers. GPs 
      of the control group will receive no training and will deliver care as usual. 
      Geriatric assessment of all patients will be performed by study nurses during home 
      visits at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is the 
      hospitalisation rate during the observation period of 12âmonths. Secondary outcomes 
      are number and appropriateness of medications, mobility, weakness, cognition, 
      depressive disorder, health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, 
      weight, and costs of health care use. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence 
      for a pragmatic co-operative and patient-centred educational intervention using 
      family conferences to improve patient safety in frail elderly patients with 
      polypharmacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00015055 (WHO

TI  - To use or not to use. A literature review of factors that influence family 
      caregivers' use of support services.
PG  - 20-8; quiz 29
AB  - Many family caregivers of frail older adults postpone or decline accessible and 
      affordable services such as respite, despite their acknowledgement of unmet needs 
      for support and time away from the burdens and stress of caregiving. How caregivers 
      perceive their need for services, and the factors that influence their decisions to 
      use or not to use services, remain poorly understood. This article reviews the 
      literature on family caregiving and the complex interrelated factors that influence 
      caregivers' choices regarding support services. It organizes these factors into four 
      areas: (a) service characteristics, (b) personal predisposing factors that affect 
      perceived need, (c) experiential coping and decision-making patterns, and (d) 
      relational factors. It also examines the implications of this evidence for nursing 
      assessments and interventions with frail older adults and their family caregivers.

TI  - Risk Prediction for Adverse Outcomes for Frail Older Persons with Complex Healthcare 
      and Social Care Needs Admitted to a Community Virtual Ward Model.
PG  - 915-926
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S236895 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Population ageing is challenging healthcare systems with limited resources, 
      necessitating the development of new care models to address the needs of older, 
      frail community-dwellers. Community Virtual Wards (CVW) reduce adverse events in 
      these patients. We examined the effect of an established CVW on pre-defined health 
      trajectories (between "stable", "deteriorating", and "unstable" states) and 
      characteristics that increased the likelihood of adverse healthcare outcomes 
      (hospitalization, institutionalization and death). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We 
      collected prospective data on frail patients admitted to a CVW in a single centre in 
      Ireland. Relationships between risk scores, health states and adverse outcomes at 
      30, 60 and 90 days after admission were examined using multinomial regression 
      analysis. RESULTS: In total, 88 community-dwellers, mean (Â±SD) age of 82.8 Â±6.4 
      years, were included. Most were severely frail on the Rockwood Clinical Frailty 
      Scale (mean 6.8/9 Â±1.33). Reaching stability ("stable" state) within 30 days was a 
      predictor for stability at 60 and 90 days and remaining at home. Stability was also 
      associated with fewer care episodes (<2) (p=<0.001), a requirement for fewer 
      healthcare professionals (HCP) (<7) (p<0.001) and lower risk of delirium (p<0.001). 
      By contrast, being "unstable" at 60 days increased the numbers of HCP referrals (>7) 
      and was predictive of more acute episodes (>2) and institutionalization or death 
      (p<0.001). Predictors of adverse outcomes of either institutionalization or death 
      included frailty status, function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risk and 
      cognition. CONCLUSION: A CVW model can provide a framework for monitoring and case 
      management to support older people to remain at home or identify those at risk of 
      institutional care. The use of defined health states helped to stratify those at 
      lower or higher risk in an already high-risk frail population. Level of frailty, 
      function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risks and cognition were predictive of 
      remaining at home and reaching a level of stability or instability/deterioration and 
      institutional care.

TI  - From clinical reasoning to ehealth interventions; a study on how nurses asses care 
      and ehealth in home care.

AB  - The assessment of care in homecare today is complex. Nurses have to decide on care 
      for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise 
      solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, 
      how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 
      homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study 
      shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest 
      eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of 
      eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that 
      eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses 
      need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in 
      close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. 
      Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be 
      convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this 
      with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date 
      information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.

TI  - Deconditioning in the hospitalized elderly.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - Deconditioning is a complex process of physiological change following a period of 
      inactivity, bedrest or sedentary lifestyle. It results in functional losses in such 
      areas as mental status, degree of continence and ability to accomplish activities of 
      daily living. It is frequently associated with hospitalization in the elderly. The 
      most predictable effects of deconditioning are seen in the musculoskeletal system 
      and include diminished muscle mass, decreases of muscle strength by two to five 
      percent per day, muscle shortening, changes in periarticular and cartilaginous joint 
      structure and marked loss of leg strength that seriously limit mobility. The decline 
      in muscle mass and strength has been linked to falls, functional decline, increased 
      frailty and immobility. The authors describe a three-pronged strategy to combat 
      deconditioning that includes a model of care appropriate to the growing population 
      of elderly clients, the creation of an "elder-friendly" hospital environment and an 
      exercise program.

TI  - Managing deterioration in older adults in care homes: a quality improvement project 
      to introduce an early warning tool.
PG  - 58-66
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2019.24.2.58 [doi]
AB  - Many older adults living in care homes have complex health needs requiring 
      comprehensive care. Early warning tools can help identify deterioration, but 
      currently they are less often used in care homes. The aim of this quality 
      improvement project was to introduce an early warning tool, the Significant 7, to 
      facilitate identification and management of deterioration in care home residents. 
      The plan, do, study, act (PDSA) method was used, and process mapping informed a 
      tailored intervention. Introducing the tool had positive outcomes for residents and 
      care staff. There was a reduction in the incidence of pressure ulcers and falls, and 
      care staff were more confident in recognising resident deterioration. Next steps 
      include scaling up the project to further examine how this early warning tool can 
      improve resident, staff and organisational outcomes, in order to explore the 
      potential use of the tool by community nurses with older people living at home.

TI  - Deciding about the use of a Personal Safety Alerting Device-The need for a 
      legitimation process: A qualitative study.
PG  - 331-342
LID - 10.1111/jan.14566 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore reasons, thoughts, motives, and influencing factors regarding the 
      use or non-use of Personal Safety Alerting Devices (PSADs) in the daily lives of 
      community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was 
      used. METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons 
      between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide 
      of Leuven. RESULTS: The participants described the use or non-use of PSADs as a 
      decision resulting from a "legitimation process". This process implies that a person 
      needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at 
      which to start using it. During this process, each person weighs her or his "ageing 
      self" and "perception of technology" then decides whether to start using a device or 
      to delay its use. "Critical events" initiate this process, compelling the person to 
      consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance. CONCLUSION: The 
      legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning 
      point in life. Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex 
      decision-making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven 
      with one's individual ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the 
      device. IMPACT: Older persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time 
      to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this 
      process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty 
      balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to 
      preserve their independence.

TI  - Implementation of a complex intervention to improve participation in older people 
      with joint contractures living in nursing homes: a process evaluation of a 
      cluster-randomised pilot trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Joint contractures in frail older people are associated with serious 
      restrictions in participation. We developed the Participation Enabling CAre in 
      Nursing (PECAN) intervention, a complex intervention to enable nurses to promote 
      participation in nursing home residents with joint contractures. The aim of this 
      study was to examine the feasibility of the implementation strategy and to identify 
      enablers and barriers for a successful implementation. METHODS: The implementation 
      of PECAN was investigated in a 6-month pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial 
      (c-RCT). As a key component of the implementation strategy, nominated nurses were 
      trained as facilitators in a one-day workshop and supported by peer-mentoring 
      (visit, telephone counselling). A mixed-methods approach was conducted in 
      conjunction with the pilot trial and guided by a framework for process evaluations 
      of c-RCTs. Data were collected using standardised questionnaires (nursing staff), 
      documentation forms, problem-centred qualitative interviews (facilitators, 
      therapists, social workers, relatives, peer-mentors), and a group discussion 
      (facilitators). A set of predefined criteria on the nursing home level was examined. 
      Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were 
      analysed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Seven nursing homes (nÂ =â4 
      intervention groups, nÂ =â3 control groups) in two regions of Germany took part in 
      the study. Facilitators responded well to the qualification measures (workshop 
      participation: 14/14; workshop rating: "good"; peer-mentor visit participation: 
      10/14). The usage of peer-mentoring via telephone varied (one to seven contacts per 
      nursing home). Our implementation strategy was not successful in connection with 
      supplying the intervention to all the nurses. The clear commitment of the entire 
      nursing home and the respect for the expertise of different healthcare professionals 
      were emphasised as enablers, whereas a lack of impact on organisational conditions 
      and routines and a lack of time and staff competence were mentioned as barriers. 
      CONCLUSION: The PECAN intervention was delivered as planned to the facilitators but 
      was unable to produce comprehensive changes in the nursing homes and subsequently 
      for the residents. Strategies to systematically include the management and the 
      nursing team from the beginning are needed to support the facilitators during 
      implementation in the main trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German clinical trials

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality of end of life care in long-term care 
      (LTC) for residents with different diagnostic trajectories. The aim of this study 
      was to compare symptoms before death in LTC for those with cancer, dementia or 
      chronic illness. METHODS: After-death prospective staff survey of resident deaths 
      with random cluster sampling in 61 representative LTC facilities across New Zealand 
      (3709 beds). Deaths (nÂ =â286) were studied over 3 months in each facility. 
      Standardised questionnaires - Symptom Management (SM-EOLD) and Comfort Assessment in 
      End of life with Dementia (CAD-EOLD) - were administered to staff after the 
      resident's death. RESULTS: Primary diagnoses at the time of death were dementia 
      (49%), chronic illness (30%), cancer (17%), and dementia and cancer (4%). Residents 
      with cancer had more community hospice involvement (30%) than those with chronic 
      illness (12%) or dementia (5%). There was no difference in mean SM-EOLD in the last 
      month of life by diagnosis (cancer 26.9 (8.6), dementia 26.5(8.2), chronic illness 
      26.9(8.6). Planned contrast analyses of individual items found people with dementia 
      had more pain and those with cancer had less anxiety. There was no difference in 
      mean CAD-EOLD scores in the week before death by diagnosis (total sample 33.7(SD 
      5.2), dementia 34.4(SD 5.2), chronic illness 33.0(SD 5.1), cancer 33.3(5.1)). 
      Planned contrast analyses showed significantly more physical symptoms for those with 
      dementia and chronic illness in the last month of life than those with cancer. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, symptoms in the last week and month of life did not vary by 
      diagnosis. However, sub-group planned contrast analyses found those with dementia 
      and chronic illness experienced more physical distress during the last weeks and 
      months of life than those with cancer. These results highlight the complex nature of 
      LTC end of life care that requires an integrated gerontology/palliative care 
      approach.

AB  - Activity-limiting pain is common among older home care patients and pain management 
      is complicated by the high prevalence of physical frailty and multimorbidity in the 
      home care population. A comparative effectiveness study was undertaken at a large 
      urban home care agency to examine an evidence-based pain self-management program 
      delivered by physical therapists (PTs). This article focuses on PT training, methods 
      implemented to reinforce content after training and to encourage uptake of the 
      program with appropriate patients, and therapists' fidelity to the program. 
      Seventeen physical therapy teams were included in the cluster randomized controlled 
      trial, with 8 teams (155 PTs) assigned to a control and 9 teams (165 PTs) assigned 
      to a treatment arm. Treatment therapists received interactive training over two 
      sessions, with a follow-up session 6 months later. Additional support was provided 
      via emails, e-learning materials including videos, and a therapist manual. Program 
      fidelity was assessed by examining PT pain documentation in the agency's electronic 
      health record. PT feedback on the program was obtained via semistructured surveys. 
      There were no between-group differences in the number of PTs documenting program 
      elements with the exception of instruction in the use of imagery, which was 
      documented by a higher percentage of intervention therapists (p = 0.002). PTs felt 
      comfortable teaching the program elements, but cited time as the biggest barrier to 
      implementing the protocol. Possible explanations for study results suggesting 
      limited adherence to the program protocol by intervention-group PTs include the 
      top-down implementation strategy, competing organizational priorities, program 
      complexity, competing patient priorities, and inadequate patient buy-in. 
      Implications for the implementation of complex new programs in the home healthcare 
      setting are discussed.

TI  - Barriers and enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in heart failure with atrial 
      fibrillation: patient and provider perspectives.
PG  - 4325-4334
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13759 [doi]
AB  - AIMS & OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the barriers and 
      enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in individuals with chronic heart failure 
      (CHF) with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) from the perspective of patients and 
      providers. BACKGROUND: CHF and AF commonly coexist and are associated with increased 
      stroke risk and mortality. Oral anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke risk 
      and improves outcomes. Yet, in approximately 30% of cases, anticoagulation is not 
      commenced for a variety of reasons. DESIGN: Qualitative study using narrative 
      inquiry. METHODS: Data from face-to-face individual interviews with patients and 
      information retrieved from healthcare file note review documented the clinician 
      perspective. This study is a synthesis of the two data sources, obtained during 
      patient clinical assessments as part of the Atrial Fibrillation And Stroke 
      Thromboprophylaxis in hEart failuRe (AFASTER) Study. RESULTS: Patient choice and 
      preference were important factors in anticoagulation decisions, including treatment 
      burden, unfavourable or intolerable side effects and patient refusal. Financial 
      barriers included cost of travel, medication cost and reimbursement. Psychological 
      factors included psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment and depression. Social 
      barriers included homelessness and the absence of a caregiver or lack of caregiver 
      assistance. Clinician reticence included fear of falls, frailty, age, fear of 
      bleeding and the challenges of multimorbidity. Facilitators to successful 
      prescription and adherence were caregiver support, reminders and routine, 
      self-testing and the use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: Many barriers remain to 
      high-risk individuals being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. There 
      are a number of enabling factors that facilitate prescription and optimise treatment 
      adherence. Nurses should challenge these treatment barriers and seek enabling 
      factors to optimise therapy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses can help 
      patients and caregivers to understand complex anticoagulant risk-benefit 
      information, and act as a patient advocate when making complex stroke prevention 
      decisions.

TI  - Frailty: a review of the first decade of research.
PG  - 422-32
LID - 10.1177/1099800412462866 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased 
      vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, 
      hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and 
      operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty 
      development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of 
      conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put 
      forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated 
      pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and 
      exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes 
      of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere 
      length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and 
      metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, 
      lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive 
      decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological 
      approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for 
      future methodological and physiological inquiry.

TI  - The chaos of hospitalisation for patients with critical limb ischaemia approaching 
      major amputation.
PG  - 3530-3543
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14536 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To illuminate the hospital experience for patients and families 
      when major amputation has been advised for critical limb ischaemia (CLI). 
      BACKGROUND: CLI creates significant burden to the health system and the family, 
      particularly as the person with CLI approaches amputation. Major amputation is often 
      offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked deterioration of an 
      ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced mobility, intractable pain, 
      infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of clinical outcome data on CLI and 
      amputation exists internationally, little is known about the patient/family-centred 
      experience of hospitalisation to inform preservation of personhood and 
      patient-centred care planning. DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative study using 
      Heideggerian phenomenology. METHODS: Fourteen patients and 13 family carers provided 
      a semistructured interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation 
      followed, a second interview (6Â months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients 
      and seven family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and 
      transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed. RESULTS: 
      Hospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of chaos, 
      characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile body and 
      fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift within 
      uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation and 
      unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages (multiple 
      stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful decision-making 
      in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic process occurring within 
      a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the care complexity and burden of 
      family advocacy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A coordinated, interprofessional 
      response should improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation 
      scheduling and discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a 
      sense of safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should 
      be actively facilitated.

TI  - Developing a holistic, multidisciplinary community service for frail older people.
PG  - 34-40
LID - 10.7748/nop.2018.e1064 [doi]
AB  - This article explores the development of an ambulatory community service that 
      demonstrates multidisciplinary working to meet the diverse needs of frail older 
      people and their carers. The service comprises advanced nurse practitioners, a 
      pharmacist, a community navigator, consultants, occupational therapists, 
      physiotherapists, a nurse, rehabilitation assistants, a healthcare assistant and an 
      administrator. This multidisciplinary team (MDT) serves adults with complex medical 
      and rehabilitation needs who are being discharged from hospital, staying in bedded 
      rehabilitation units or living at home by offering assessments, investigations and 
      rehabilitation, where appropriate closer to home. The aims of the service are to: 
      keep people well, prevent unplanned hospital admissions, promote health and 
      well-being, reduce the risk of falls, enable independent living and provide 
      rehabilitation. Personalised care plans are developed with patients and their 
      carers. Advanced nursing practice is demonstrated in assessment, investigation, 
      diagnosis, management, referral and non-medical prescribing. Development of this MDT 
      is required to support and promote integrated, evidence-based work. Such development 
      leads to integrated care across communities, and bridges gaps between patients and 
      carers, GPs, home, residential and hospital-based services, and the voluntary, 
      statutory and non-statutory sectors.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in the nursing home.
PG  - 24, 27-8, 35-9
AB  - Risk factors, diagnosis, ethical considerations, and treatment of pneumonia in a 
      nursing home setting are summarized. Risk factors for pneumonia include 
      age-associated changes, co-morbid conditions, declining general health, and 
      iatrogenic factors. Diagnosis can be challenging in geriatric residents because of 
      atypical presentations and complex underlying diseases. Key features of presentation 
      include rhonchi and confusion. An increased respiratory rate can be a sensitive 
      indicator for pneumonia. Ethical dilemmas include identifying a resident's wishes 
      for treatment in the event of an acute illness and the decision on whether to 
      relocate the resident to an acute care facility. Decisions are based on available 
      resources, medical stability of the resident, unimpeded access to a hospital, and 
      the resident's well-informed decision. The common etiologic pathogen(s) of 
      nursing-home-acquired pneumonia reflect a mixture between community-acquired and 
      hospital-acquired pathogens. Multiple pharmacologic interventions are available, as 
      well as supportive measures including oxygen therapy and hydration. Preventive 
      measures are utilized to decrease the incidence of further infection.

TI  - Stakeholder Meeting: Integrated Knowledge Translation Approach to Address the 
      Caregiver Support Gap.
PG  - 108-119
LID - 10.1017/S0714980816000660 [doi]
AB  - Family caregivers are an integral and increasingly overburdened part of the health 
      care system. There is a gap between what research evidence shows is beneficial to 
      caregivers and what is actually provided. Using an integrated knowledge translation 
      approach, a stakeholder meeting was held among researchers, family caregivers, 
      caregiver associations, clinicians, health care administrators, and policy makers. 
      The objectives of the meeting were to review current research evidence and conduct 
      multi-stakeholder dialogue on the potential gaps, facilitators, and barriers to the 
      provision of caregiver supports. A two-day meeting was attended by 123 individuals. 
      Three target populations of family caregivers were identified for discussion: 
      caregivers of seniors with dementia, caregivers in end-of-life care, and caregivers 
      of frail seniors with complex health needs. The results of this meeting can and are 
      being used to inform the development of implementation research endeavours and 
      policies targeted at providing evidence-informed caregiver supports.

TI  - Multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care: important considerations in treatment with 
      anticoagulation drugs. Outcomes of the AFASTER study.
PG  - 113-124
LID - 10.1177/1474515116642604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are complex 
      cardiogeriatric syndromes mediated by physical, psychological and social factors. 
      Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these 
      syndromes, particularly stroke. PURPOSE: This study sought to describe the clinical 
      characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and 
      concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined 
      the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors 
      of adverse events. METHODS: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and 
      concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were 
      assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, 
      stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding. RESULTS: All-cause readmission 
      to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). 
      The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly 
      associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 
      0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates 
      of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of 
      participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. 
      Self-reported self-care behaviour and 'not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were 
      associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical 
      significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having 
      greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge. 
      CONCLUSION: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be 
      important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients 
      and caregivers offers the potential to improve treatment knowledge, adherence and 
      outcomes in this group of patients with complex care needs.

AB  - Presently only about 9% of seniors over the age of 75 live in residential care 
      facilities but the anticipated exponential growth of the senior population will put 
      increasing pressure on the need for supportive, continuing care services in the 
      years ahead (CIHI 2017a). They are on average 86 years of age with a diagnosis of 
      dementia (67%) and some cognitive and/or functional impairment (98%) (CIHI 2017b). 
      These compromised seniors are also more likely to use hospital services than others, 
      and in many jurisdictions occupy acute care beds for extended periods because 
      ongoing management of their complex conditions is often not possible within 
      long-term care (LTC) homes. In addition, unnecessary and futile care at the end of 
      life often leads to suffering for individuals and their families (Dobbins 2016), 
      which might otherwise be avoided with the presence of institutionally based 
      providers such as nurse practitioners (NPs). Christian and Barker (2009) identified 
      NPs as a valuable resource to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations which often lead 
      to complications and devastating results for seniors. Although evidence of the 
      positive impact of NPs working in LTC facilities dates back to the 1970s, very few 
      organizations have created and obtained funding support for these positions in LTC 
      settings. This case study illustrates the impact of the NP role in a New Brunswick 
      LTC facility; demonstrating the value of a model that includes an NP collaborating 
      with physicians, nurses and allied health professionals. As shown in this case, the 
      presence of an NP clearly impacted a reduction in emergency room visits and 
      hospitalizations, events that more often than not accelerate further physical, 
      mental and functional decline particularly among the frail elderly. Christian and 
      Barker (2009) described the significant consequences of hospitalization for the 
      elderly patient including irreversible decline in function, delirium and exposure to 
      iatrogenic disease. Having an NP available within LTC affords the residents ongoing 
      monitoring that allows for preemptive and proactive care. NPs providing oversight to 
      the collaborative management of the care of LTC residents has the potential to not 
      only realize cost-avoidance for the healthcare system but also enhance the quality 
      of care for residents and their families.

TI  - Symptom trajectory and symptom burden in older people with multimorbidity, secondary 
      outcome from the RCT AGe-FIT study.
PG  - 2773-2783
LID - 10.1111/jan.13032 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of 
      community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on 
      symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment. BACKGROUND: Older community-dwelling people with 
      multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring 
      symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a 
      need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people 
      living with multimorbidity. DESIGN: Secondary outcome data from the randomized 
      controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT). 
      METHODS: Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom 
      Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 
      24Â months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an 
      ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in 
      addition to usual care. RESULTS: Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and 
      stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. 
      Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly 
      prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and 
      numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No 
      differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding 
      prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Older community-dwelling 
      people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving 
      advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not 
      significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.

TI  - A structure, process and outcome evaluation of the Geriatric Emergency Department 
      Intervention model of care: a study protocol.
PG  - 76

LID - 76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergency departments are chaotic environments in which complex, frail 
      older persons living in the community and residential aged care facilities are 
      sometimes subjected to prolonged emergency department lengths of stay, excessive 
      tests and iatrogenic complications. Given the ageing population, the importance of 
      providing appropriate, quality health care in the emergency department for this 
      cohort is paramount. One possible solution, a nurse-led, physician-championed, 
      emergency department gerontological intervention team, which provides frontload 
      assessment, early collateral communication and appropriate discharge planning, has 
      been developed. The aim of this Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention is to 
      maximise the quality of care for this vulnerable cohort in a cost effective manner. 
      METHODS: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention research project consists 
      of three interrelated studies within a program evaluation design. The research 
      comprises of a structure, process and outcome framework to ascertain the overall 
      utility of such a program. The first study is a pre-post comparison of the Geriatric 
      Emergency Department Intervention in the emergency department, comparing the 
      patient-level outcomes before and after service introduction using a 
      quasi-experimental design with historical controls. The second study is a 
      descriptive qualitative study of the structures and processes required for the 
      operation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention and clinician and 
      patient satisfaction with service models. The third study is an economic evaluation 
      of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention model of care. DISCUSSION: There 
      is a paucity of evidence in the literature to support the implementation of 
      nurse-led teams in emergencyÂ departments designed to target frail older persons 
      living in the community and residential aged care facilities. This is despite the 
      high economic and patient morbidity and mortality experienced in these vulnerable 
      cohorts. This research project will provide guidance related to the optimal 
      structures and processes required to implement the model of care and the associated 
      cost related outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials 
      Registration Number is 12615001157561 . Date of registration 29 October 2015.

      Needs: Learning From the Muscling Up Against Disability Study.

LID - 10.1016/j.apmr.2018.03.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of balance confidence with physical and 
      cognitive markers of well-being in older adults receiving government-funded aged 
      care services and whether progressive resistance plus balance training could 
      positively influence change. DESIGN: Intervention study. SETTING: Community-based 
      older adult-specific exercise clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (N=245) with 
      complex care needs who were receiving government-funded aged care support. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-four weeks of twice weekly progressive resistance plus balance 
      training carried out under the supervision of accredited exercise physiologists. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure was the Activity-specific Balance 
      Confidence Scale. Secondary measures included the Short Physical Performance 
      Battery; fall history gathered as part of the health history questionnaire; 
      hierarchical timed balance tests; Geriatric Anxiety Index; Geriatric Depression 
      Scale; Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, Loss of Weight scale; and EuroQoL-5 
      dimension 3 level. RESULTS: At baseline, better physical performance (r=.54; P<.01) 
      and quality of life (r=.52; P<.01) predicted better balance confidence. In contrast, 
      at baseline, higher levels of frailty predicted worse balance confidence (r=-.55; 
      P<.01). Change in balance confidence after the exercise intervention was accompanied 
      by improved physical performance (+12%) and reduced frailty (-11%). Baseline balance 
      confidence was identified as the most consistent negative predictor of change scores 
      across the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that reduced physical 
      performance and quality of life and increased frailty are predictive of worse 
      balance confidence in older adults with aged care needs. However, when a targeted 
      intervention of resistance and balance exercise is implemented that reduces frailty 
      and improves physical performance, balance confidence will also improve. Given the 
      influence of balance confidence on a raft of well-being determinants, including the 
      capacity for positive physical and cognitive change, this study offers important 
      insight to those looking to reduce falls in older adults.

TI  - Treatment Fidelity of an Evidence-Based Nurse-Led Intervention in a Proactive 
      Primary Care Program for Older People.
PG  - 75-84
LID - 10.1111/wvn.12151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a large randomized trial, Utrecht PROactive Frailty Intervention 
      Trial (U-PROFIT), we evaluated the effectiveness of an integrated program on the 
      preservation of daily functioning in older people in primary care that consisted of 
      a frailty identification tool and a multicomponent nurse-led care program. 
      Examination of treatment fidelity is critical to successful translation of 
      evidence-based interventions into practice. AIMS: To assess treatment delivery, dose 
      and content of nursing care delivered within the nurse-led care program, and to 
      explore if the delivery may have influenced the trial results. METHODS: A 
      mixed-methods study was conducted. Type and dose of nursing care were collected 
      during the trial. Shortly after the trial, a focus group with nurses was conducted 
      to explore reasons for the observed differences between the type and dose of nursing 
      care delivered. RESULTS: A total of 835 older persons were included in the nurse-led 
      care program. The mean age was 75 years, 64% were female and 53.5% were living 
      alone. The most frequent self-reported conditions were loneliness (60.8%) and 
      cognitive problems (59.4%). One-third of the patients with a geriatric condition 
      received an additional assessment (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination), and the 
      majority of these patients received at least one nurse intervention (>85%). Most 
      nursing care was delivered to patients at risk of falling and to those with urinary 
      incontinence. Patients with nutrition problems seldom received nursing 
      interventions. The nurses explained that differences in type and dose were 
      influenced by the preference of the patient, the type of geriatric problem, and the 
      time required to apply a nurse intervention. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: All 
      intervention components were delivered; however, differences were observed in the 
      type and dose of nursing care delivered across geriatric conditions. The findings 
      better explain the treatment fidelity and suggest that there is room for improvement 
      that may result in more beneficial patient outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the issues that influenced the implementation of programmes 
      designed to identify and support frail older people in the community in the 
      Netherlands. METHODS: Qualitative research methods were used to investigate the 
      perspectives of project leaders, project members and members of the steering 
      committee responsible for the implementation of the programmes. Interviews were 
      conducted in 2009 (n = 10) and in 2012 (n = 13) and a focus group was organised in 
      2012 (n = 5). MAIN FINDINGS: The interviews revealed that the implementation was 
      influenced by the extent and quality of collaboration between organisations, 
      adaptation to existing structures, future funding for the programmes and project 
      leadership. A good relationship between participating organisations and 
      professionals is required for successful implementation. A lack of clear project 
      leadership and structural funding hampers the implementation of complex programmes 
      in primary care settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study are 
      useful for organisations and professionals who are planning to implement complex 
      programmes. Identifying barriers concerning institutional collaboration, adaptation 
      to existing structures, leadership and continuation of financial support at an early 
      stage of the implementation process can support practitioners in overcoming them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) carries a high event rate 
      following discharge. The complex interplay between age, frailty and decongestion may 
      lend itself to a functional test. METHODS: In the doorbell test the patient 
      simulates answering the doorbell. They are timed rising from a recumbent position, 
      bending over twice and walking 10âmetres, this time is added to the change in 
      respiratory rate. We aimed to determine if the doorbell test was associated with 
      post ADHF events (death or readmission). The test was performed at hospital 
      discharge, with follow up at 30-days and 1-year. RESULTS: In 74 patients at 30-days 
      there was a 14% event rate. At 1-year there were 40 (54%) events (9 deaths and 31 
      readmissions, 28 were cardiovascular of which 14 were [heart failure] HF). Amongst 
      those who had an event at 30-days only doorbell test scores were different (58 
      [36,72] vs 32 [26,53] pâ<â0.05). One-year (1-year) events were associated with 
      doorbell test scores (47 [29,62] vs 30 [26,42] pâ<â0.05), body weight (78âkg [68,94] 
      vs 95 [76,105] (pâ<â0.05), creatinine (134âmmol/L [114, 173] vs 99 [82, 133] 
      pâ<â0.01) and age (76 years [61,86] vs 67 [53, 73] pâ<â0.01). Heart failure 
      readmissions were associated with doorbell test scores (56 [46,68] vs 30 [26,47] 
      pâ<â0.001). Death was associated with body weight (74âkg [69,81] vs 88 [72,101] 
      pâ<â0.05) and age (83 years [78,86] vs 69 [55,77] pâ<â0.01). After age 
      stratification, the hazard ratio for heart failure readmission associated with a 
      high doorbell test score was 11.08 (95%C.I. 2.01-61.17 pâ=â0.006), while the hazard 
      ratio for 1-year cardiovascular readmission was 4.62 (95%C.I. 1.71-12.51 pâ=â0.003). 
      There was no association with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSION: The doorbell test 
      represents a novel test of multiple domains of the ADHF pre-discharge state and 
      demonstrates an association with 30-day and 1-year rehospitalisation.

TI  - Conceptualizations of frailty in relation to older adults.
PG  - 58-68
AB  - AIM: The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy 
      in identifying and describing older adults as frail. BACKGROUND: Despite the 
      dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a 
      lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear 
      conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. 
      Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding 
      eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. 
      METHOD: The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and 
      conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the 
      paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. 
      The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six 
      conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions 
      about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the 
      ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are 
      discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. CONCLUSION: The 
      review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in 
      older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex 
      interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the 
      concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of 
      ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and 
      incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the 
      contribution of both individual and environmental factors.

AB  - Frail older patients suffer from multiple, complex needs that often go unmet in an 
      acute care setting. Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults 
      is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated 
      "sub-acute" frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. 
      Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants (n = 62) 
      required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely 
      ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went 
      unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The 
      majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of 
      post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part 
      of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being 
      funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home.

TI  - Knowledge Gaps in Cardiovascular Care of Older Adults: A Scientific Statement from 
      the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American 
      Geriatrics Society: Executive Summary.
PG  - 2185-2192
LID - 10.1111/jgs.14576 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of most cardiovascular disorders increase with age, and 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and major disability in 
      adults aged 75 and older. Despite the effect of CVD on quality of life, morbidity, 
      and mortality in older adults, individuals aged 75 and older have been markedly 
      underrepresented in most major cardiovascular trials, and virtually all trials have 
      excluded older adults with complex comorbidities, significant physical or cognitive 
      disabilities, frailty, or residence in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. 
      As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations 
      for diagnosis and treatment of older adults typical of those encountered in routine 
      clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize 
      current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical 
      gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision-making, and 
      recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these 
      objectives, a detailed review was conducted of current American College of 
      Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and American Stroke Association 
      (ASA) guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted 
      older adults. A pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision-making in 
      older adults with CVD was found, as well as a paucity of data on the effect of 
      diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on outcomes that are particularly important 
      to older adults, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of 
      independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large 
      population-based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older 
      adults representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate 
      relevant outcomes important to older adults in the study design. The results of 
      these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines 
      applicable to older adults and enhance person-centered care of older individuals 
      with CVD in the United States and around the world.

TI  - A community virtual ward model to support older persons with complex health care and 
      social care needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally the older population is increasing rapidly. As a result there 
      is an increase in frail older persons living within the community, with increased 
      risks of a hospital admission and higher mortality and morbidity rates. Due to 
      complexity of care, health care professionals face challenges in providing effective 
      case management and avoiding unplanned admissions to hospital. A community virtual 
      ward (CVW) model was developed to assist health care professionals to support older 
      persons at home during periods of illness and/or functional decline. METHODS: A 
      quantitative observational study was conducted to examine if a CVW model of care 
      reduced unplanned hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations in 
      54 patients over a 12-month period. The sign-rank test examined matched data on bed 
      days, ED presentations, and unplanned hospital admissions pre- and post-CVW 
      implementation. Other risk factors for admission to hospital were examined using the 
      Mann-Whitney test pre-and post-CVW admission, including falls, living alone, and 
      cognition. Correlations between hospital admission avoidances and unplanned hospital 
      admissions and ED presentations were tested using Spearman's Ï test. RESULTS: There 
      was a reduction in ED presentations post-CVW admission (P<0.001), and median 
      unscheduled admissions were reduced (P=0.001). Those living alone had a lower number 
      of ED presentations (median 0.5, interquartile range 0-1) prior to admission in 
      comparison to those living with a caregiver, with no differences observed during 
      admission to CVW. For those who experienced a fall during CVW admission, the odds 
      ratio (OR) of requiring long-term care doubled for each extra fall (OR =2.24, 95% CI 
      1.11 to 4.52, P=0.025). Reduced cognition was associated with an increased risk of 
      ED presentations (Ï=0.292, P<0.05) but not associated with increased risks of 
      unplanned hospital admissions (Ï=0.09, P=0.546). There were no significant 
      correlations seen between admission avoidance and the number of unplanned hospital 
      admissions or ED presentations. CONCLUSION: Through an integrated approach to care, 
      a CVW model in the care of older persons can reduce ED presentations and unplanned 
      hospital admissions.

TI  - Carers' and nurses' appraisals of needs of nursing home placement for frail older in 
      Norway.
PG  - 3079-88
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02663.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' 
      appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people 
      awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions 
      regarding nursing home placement. BACKGROUND: Requesting nursing home placement can 
      be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and 
      guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the 
      older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides 
      support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers 
      face difficult life situations. DESIGN: This is a descriptive and comparative 
      cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. METHODS: The convenience sample (n 
      = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list 
      in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly 
      participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content 
      analysis. RESULTS: Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' 
      appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, 
      beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making 
      concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising 
      nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able 
      to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 
      'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be 
      placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and 
      involved ethical issues. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite insufficient 
      resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and 
      their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each 
      situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for 
      the timely nursing home placement of older people.

TI  - Framing moving and handling as a complex healthcare intervention within the acute 
      care of older people with osteoporosis: a qualitative study.
PG  - 2906-20
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13344 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of 
      caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving 
      and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling 
      risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a 
      skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. 
      Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and 
      mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults 
      are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As 
      presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is 
      frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often 
      suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched. DESIGN: 
      An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical 
      realism. METHODS: The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health 
      professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of 
      osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical 
      guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. RESULTS: Awareness of 
      osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are 
      indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal 
      moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 
      'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', 
      with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for 
      dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational 
      context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and 
      dependency dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: This study informs moving and handling in higher 
      risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when 
      adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' 
      experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: Increased focus on musculoskeletal conditions and moving and 
      handling implications is required.

TI  - Older women, intimate partner violence and mental health: a consideration of the 
      particular issues for health and healthcare practice.
PG  - 2177-2191
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13490 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history 
      of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. 
      BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and 
      well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate 
      partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has 
      not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to 
      address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's 
      experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health 
      issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic 
      synthesis of qualitative evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and 
      PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end 
      of December 2015. RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence 
      exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner 
      violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the 
      boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within 
      the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of 
      intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence 
      of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who 
      experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner 
      violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service 
      providers need to be aware of these. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and 
      healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management 
      and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they 
      are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of 
      abuse and this includes older women.

AB  - Neighborhood environment is consistently associated with obesity; changes to 
      modifiable aspects of the neighborhood environment may curb the growth of obesity in 
      the US and other developed nations. However, currently the majority of studies are 
      cross-sectional and thus not appropriate for evaluating causality. The goal of this 
      study was to evaluate the effect of a neighborhood-changing intervention on changes 
      in obesity among older women. Over the past 30 years the Portland, Oregon 
      metropolitan region has made significant investments in plans, regulatory 
      structures, and public facilities to reduce sprawl and increase compact growth 
      centers, transit-oriented development approaches, and green space. We used geocoded 
      residential addresses to link data on land-use mix, public transit access, street 
      connectivity, and access to green space from four time points between 1986 and 2004, 
      with longitudinal data on body mass index (BMI) from a cohort of 2003 
      community-dwelling women aged 66 years and older. Height and weight were measured at 
      clinic visits. Women self-reported demographics, health habits, and chronic 
      conditions, and self-rated their health. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was 
      assessed from census data. Neighborhood walkability and access to green space 
      improved over the 18-year study period. On average there was a non-significant mean 
      weight loss in the cohort between baseline (mean age 72.6 years) and the study's end 
      (mean age 85.0 years). We observed no association between neighborhood built 
      environment or change in built environment and BMI. Greater neighborhood 
      socioeconomic status at baseline was independently associated with a healthier BMI 
      at baseline, and protected against an age-related decline in BMI over time. BMI 
      decreases with age reflect increased frailty, especially among older adults with 
      complex morbidities. Future research should consider the influence of the 
      neighborhood environment on additional relevant health outcomes and should include 
      measures of the social environment in conjunction with built environment measures.

TI  - Uniplanar versus biplanar monolateral external fixator knee arthrodesis after 
      end-stage failed infected total knee arthroplasty: a comparative study.
PG  - 815-825
LID - 10.1007/s00590-020-02633-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: External fixator knee arthrodesis is a salvage procedure used primarily 
      in cases of end-stage infected total knee replacement (iTKR). Stable fixation 
      combined with bone-end compression is essential to achieve knee fusion, but 
      providing sufficient stability can be challenging in the presence of severe bone 
      loss. Our hypothesis is that using an external fixation biplanar configuration would 
      bring about a fusion rate superior to that of a monolateral frame. METHODS: This 
      study compares outcomes of biplanar external fixator knee fusion due to 
      non-revisable iTKR with those of a historical cohort control study with patients 
      managed with a monoplanar configuration. Primary endpoints were fusion rate, time to 
      achieve bone fusion and infection eradication rate. Limb-length discrepancy, pain 
      level, patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: A total of 29 knee fusion cases were included. In the biplanar group, 
      infection was eradicated in 100% of the patients and fusion was achieved in all 
      cases within an average of 5.24Â months. In comparison, in the monolateral group, 
      infection was eradicated in 86% of the cases and fusion was achieved in 81% of the 
      patients after a mean of 10.3Â months (pâ<â0.05). In both groups, postoperative pain 
      was mild and patients expressed a high degree of satisfaction once fusion was 
      achieved. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, external fixation knee fusion is a 
      useful limb-salvage procedure in end-stage cases of knee PJI. We conclude that a 
      biplanar configuration can halve the time required to achieve solid bone fusion in 
      such a complex scenario.

AB  - Structured clinical data generated using standardized terminologies such as the 
      Omaha System are available for evaluating healthcare quality and patient outcomes. 
      New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, 
      complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived 
      using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 
      14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted 
      hospitalizations among frail (nâ=â386) and non-frail (nâ=â1,364) elders. 
      Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies 
      in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization 
      outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is 
      needed and the level of care that is provided.

TI  - Older adults' satisfaction with a medication dispensing device in home care.
PG  - 211-22
LID - 10.3109/17538157.2012.741084 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions face the complex task of 
      medication management involving multiple medications of varying doses at different 
      times. Advances in telehealth technologies have resulted in home-based devices for 
      medication management and health monitoring of older adults. We examined older 
      adults' perceptions of a telehealth medication dispensing device as part of a 
      clinical trial involving home healthcare clients, nurse coordination and use of the 
      medication dispensing device. METHODS: Ninety-six frail older adult participants who 
      used the medication dispensing device for 12 months completed a satisfaction survey 
      related to perceived usefulness and reliability. Results were analyzed and grouped 
      by themes in the following areas: Ease of Use, Reliability, Medication Management 
      Assistance, Routine Task Performance and Acceptability. RESULTS: Nearly all 
      participants perceived the medication dispensing device as very easy to use, very 
      reliable and helpful in the management of their medications. Eighty-four percent of 
      participants expressed a desire to use the machine in the future. CONCLUSION: The 
      technology-enhanced medication management device in this study is an acceptable tool 
      for older adults to manage medication in collaboration with home care nurses. 
      Improved usability and cost models for medication dispensers are areas for future 
      research.

      homes.
PG  - 47-59
LID - 10.1017/S0714980814000506 [doi]
AB  - Older adults living in residential long-term care or nursing homes have increasingly 
      complex needs, including more dementia than in the past, yet we know little about 
      the unregulated workforce providing care. We surveyed 1,381 care aides in a 
      representative sample of 30 urban nursing homes in the three Canadian Prairie 
      provinces and report demographic, health and well-being, and work-related 
      characteristics. Over 50 per cent of respondents were not born in Canada and did not 
      speak English as their first language. They reported moderately high levels of 
      burnout and a strong sense of their work's worth. Few respondents reported attending 
      educational sessions. This direct caregiver workforce is poorly understood, has 
      limited training or standards for minimum education, and training varies widely 
      across provinces. Workplace characteristics affecting care aides reflect factors 
      that precipitate burnout in allied health professions, with implications for quality 
      of care, staff health, and staff retention.

TI  - Recognizing and responding to deterioration in care homes: a scoping review 
      protocol.
PG  - 447-453
LID - 10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00413 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the available published primary research and any relevant 
      policies, guidelines, or protocols regarding how care home staff recognize and 
      respond to an acutely deteriorating resident. INTRODUCTION: Older people living in 
      care homes have complex health care needs. Chronic illnesses, comorbidities, 
      frailty, cognitive impairment, and physical dependency can contribute to 
      unpredictable changes in their health status that can lead to residents becoming 
      unwell and acutely deteriorating. Exploring how care home staff recognize and 
      respond to acutely deteriorating health among residents is important to understand 
      whether opportunities exist to minimize these unpredictable changes in health. 
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will consider studies that feature the 
      recognition and response to acute deterioration in care home residents. This review 
      will consider qualitative and quantitative primary research. Non-indexed and gray 
      literature such as policies, deterioration tools, and reports from health policy 
      organizations will also be included. METHODS: The searches will be conducted using 
      bibliographic databases, university repositories, and non-indexed and gray 
      literature, such as reports by health care and health policy organizations. The 
      studies will be independently selected from the inclusion criteria by two 
      researchers based on their title and abstract. In case of disagreement, a third 
      researcher will be consulted. An adapted version of the JBI data extraction form 
      will be used to extrapolate data from included studies. The results will be 
      presented in tabular form, accompanied by a narrative summary related to the 
      objectives of the scoping review.

TI  - Psychological and social resources relate to biomarkers of allostasis in newly 
      admitted nursing home residents.
PG  - 88-99
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2015.1072796 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper presents preliminary baseline data from a prospective study 
      of nursing home adaptation that attempts to capture the complexity of residents' 
      adaptive resources by examining psychological, social, and biological variables from 
      a longitudinal conceptual framework. Our emphasis was on validating an index of 
      allostasis. METHOD: In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone 
      and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of 
      physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, 
      hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via 
      interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of 
      self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the 
      prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes. RESULTS: Our results supported 
      both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary 
      validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one 
      other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. 
      As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other 
      resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with 
      physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting 
      physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social 
      support, optimism, and hope. CONCLUSION: Although these results are based on a small 
      sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of 
      pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and 
      physical resources and well-being.

TI  - Patient outcomes following lower leg major amputations for peripheral arterial 
      disease: A series review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite improvements in revascularization, major amputation remains a 
      significant part of the case-mix in vascular surgical units. These patients tend to 
      be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of 
      stay (LOS). AIM: This series review provides a description of the patient 
      complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb 
      amputation for peripheral arterial disease. METHOD: Medical records coded for major 
      amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, 
      tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed. 
      FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions 
      from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before 
      amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial 
      morbidity and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Major amputation continues to present 
      challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These 
      issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes 
      consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to 
      optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding 
      to surgery require further investigation.

TI  - Developing and piloting a multifactorial intervention to address participation and 
      quality of life in nursing home residents with joint contractures (JointConImprove): 
      study protocol.
PG  - Doc13
LID - 10.3205/000217 [doi]
LID - Doc13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Joint contractures are common problems in frail older people in nursing 
      homes. Irrespective of the exact extent of older individuals in geriatric care 
      settings living with joint contractures, they appear to be a relevant problem. Also, 
      the new emphasis on the syndrome of joint contractures, e. g. by the German 
      statutory long term care insurance, led to an increase in assessment and 
      documentation efforts and preventive interventions in clinical care. However, more 
      attention should be paid to the actual situation of older individuals in nursing 
      homes with prevalent joint contractures, particularly their experience of related 
      activity limitations and participation restrictions. Thus, the aim of this study is 
      1) to develop a tailored intervention to improve functioning, and especially 
      participation and quality of life in older residents with joint contractures in 
      nursing homes and 2) to test the feasibility of the intervention accompanied by a 
      rigorous process evaluation. METHODS: The complex intervention, which will be 
      developed in this project follows the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework 
      and integrates the perspectives of all potentially relevant user groups, from the 
      affected individuals to clinicians and researchers. The development process will 
      comprise a systematic literature review, reanalysis of existing data and the 
      integration of the knowledge of the affected individuals and experts. The developed 
      intervention including a comprehensive process evaluation will be pilot tested with 
      residents with joint contractures in three nursing homes. DISCUSSION: The projected 
      study will provide a tailored intervention to improve functioning, participation and 
      quality of life in older residents with joint contractures in nursing homes. With 
      this focus, the intervention will support patient relevant outcomes. The pilot study 
      including process evaluation will offer a first opportunity to indicate the size of 
      the intervention's effect and prepare further studies.

TI  - Complexity in caring for an ageing heart failure population: concomitant chronic 
      conditions and age related impairments.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further 
      complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age 
      related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in 
      activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, 
      lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, 
      outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by 
      putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on 
      how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by 
      applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure 
      population.

TI  - Quality of life in nursing homes: perception of physically frail elderly residents.
PG  - 48-55
AB  - The purpose of this research was to disclose the characteristics of quality of life 
      as perceived by physically frail but lucid elderly people living in nursing homes to 
      increase the understanding of the phenomenon of quality of life in this setting. 
      Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on 
      two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for 
      hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both 
      nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The 
      participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main 
      themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for 
      departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon 
      quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important 
      aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing 
      home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set 
      their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be 
      recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and 
      doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to 
      living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in 
      caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what 
      matters most in relation to their quality of life.

AB  - To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand 
      the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to 
      introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct 
      a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults 
      with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom 
      management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom 
      Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors 
      that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It 
      accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within 
      the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its 
      interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some 
      limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability 
      Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it 
      encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate 
      for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of 
      rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health 
      status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a 
      guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the 
      functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diabetes in older adults is increasing in its prevalence and complexity. 
      To date, little research has been done to inform current diabetes management, 
      including education and support, in older adults in Canada. The objective of this 
      interactive national workshop was to develop key research priorities for future 
      research related to diabetes in older adults. METHODS: Workshop participants 
      comprised interprofessional healthcare providers, decision makers and policy makers 
      from across Canada. Approximately 30 individuals attended an interactive 2-day 
      meeting that included expert presentations and group consensus building using an 
      electronic meeting system as well as nominal group techniques. RESULTS: The results 
      of the 2-day meeting found more than 50 ideas that were summarized into 5 overall 
      themes, with 14 subquestions, reflecting areas such as 1) identifying relevant 
      outcomes for patients, providers and decision makers; 2) diabetes prevention; 3) the 
      impact of diabetes on older adults and informal caregivers; 4) risk assessment tools 
      and 5) effective models of care across a variety of healthcare settings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To date, this workshop is the first of its kind and follows suit with 
      other international working groups and associations. The research priorities 
      developed through consensus from this workshop set forward a research agenda for 
      diabetes in older adults in Canada.

TI  - Integrated client care for frail older adults in the community: preliminary report 
      on a system-wide approach.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - The Toronto Central Community Care Access Centre is leading a collaborative local 
      health integration network systemic change initiative to implement and evaluate a 
      practical model of integrated care for older adults with complex needs. The approach 
      is embedded in the community where older adults and their families live and is 
      designed to first and foremost improve the quality of care while ultimately bending 
      the cost curve. The model is leveraging and aligning existing system resources by 
      bringing together sectors from across the health system to create ways of working 
      that build capacity in the system to be more responsive to this population. Outcomes 
      to date will be discussed and next steps described. The secondary goal was to 
      understand the key elements of this integration that can be scaled locally and 
      across the province.

AB  - CONTEXT: Identifying high-value health care delivery for patients with clinically 
      complex and high-cost conditions is important for future reimbursement models. 
      OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the Medicare reimbursement 
      savings of an established palliative care homebound program. METHODS: This is a 
      retrospective cohort study involving 50 participants enrolled in a palliative care 
      homebound program and 95 propensity-matched control patients at Mayo Clinic in 
      Rochester, Minnesota, between September 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. Total Medicare 
      reimbursement was compared in the year before enrollment with the year after 
      enrollment for participants and controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were 
      observed in demographic characteristics or prognostic indices between the two 
      groups. Total Medicare reimbursement per program participant the year before program 
      enrollment was $16,429 compared with $14,427 per control patient, resulting in $2004 
      higher charges per program patient. In 12Â months after program enrollment, mean 
      annual payment was $5783 per patient among participants and $22,031 per patient 
      among the matched controls. In the second year, the intervention group had a 
      decrease of $10,646 per patient; the control group had an increase of $7604 per 
      patient. The difference between the participant group and control group was 
      statistically significant (PÂ <Â 0.001) and favored the palliative care homebound 
      program enrollees by $18,251 (95% CI, $11,268-$25,234). CONCLUSION: The Mayo Clinic 
      Palliative Care Homebound Program reduced annual Medicare expenditures by $18,251 
      per program participant compared with matched control patients. This supports the 
      role of home-based palliative medicine in delivering high-value care to high-risk 
      older adults.

TI  - Older people's experiences of nurse-patient telephone communication in the primary 
      healthcare setting.
PG  - 373-382
LID - 10.1111/jan.13449 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine which aspects of primary nurse-patient telephone communication are 
      viewed positively or negatively in terms of meeting the older persons' needs. 
      BACKGROUND: Health professionals are increasingly being called on to develop 
      different ways of working and increase their capacity to meet the needs of an ageing 
      population. In some countries, telephone communication between primary nurses and 
      patients in General Practice is already seen as a routine practice, but determining 
      the value of this type of communication as a specific health service needs more 
      understanding. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study as the aim was to explore the 
      older person's experiences. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 
      21 older people from General Practices in New Zealand during 2014-2015. Thematic 
      analysis was informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: The 
      overarching theme was the difficulties older people face in making decisions about 
      whether to contact a health professional by telephone and whether this should be the 
      Primary nurse. Accounting for some of their symptoms as age related added to the 
      uncertainty of decision-making. Importantly, some older people were not raising 
      concerns e.g. emotional state. CONCLUSION: Decision-making by older people around 
      treatment seeking is complex. Increasing the awareness of the nurse role in the 
      General Practice is integral to creating a health system which will meet the needs 
      of a growing older population. Primary care practices can review their systems to 
      better inform older people how the nurse-telephone role as a specific health service 
      works and what they can expect when using this service.

TI  - Violence in nursing homes: perceptions of female caregivers.
PG  - 1660-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02196.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence. 
      BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and 
      injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, 
      few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence. METHODS: Forty-one female 
      caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a 
      situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The 
      reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The main 
      finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the 
      beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, 
      ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes. CONCLUSION 
      AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the perception of violence is subjective, 
      there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as 
      over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined 
      operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also 
      indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. 
      To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how 
      caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterised by reductions in muscle 
      mass, strength, endurance and activity level. The frailty syndrome, prevalent in 
      25-50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, is associated with increased rates of 
      mortality and major morbidity as well as function decline postoperatively. This 
      trial will compare a preoperative, interdisciplinary exercise and health promotion 
      intervention to current standard of care (StanC) for elective coronary artery bypass 
      and valvular surgery patients for the purpose of determining if the intervention 
      improves 3-month and 12-month clinical outcomes among a population of frail patients 
      waiting for elective cardiac surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, 
      randomised, open end point, controlled trial using assessor blinding and 
      intent-to-treat analysis. Two-hundred and forty-four elective cardiac surgical 
      patients will be recruited and randomised to receive either StanC or StanC plus an 
      8-week exercise and education intervention at a certified medical fitness facility. 
      Patients will attend two weekly sessions and aerobic exercise will be prescribed at 
      40-60% of heart rate reserve. Data collection will occur at baseline, 1-2âweeks 
      preoperatively, and at 3 and 12âmonths postoperatively. The primary outcome of the 
      trial will be the proportion of patients requiring a hospital length of stay greater 
      than 7âdays. POTENTIAL IMPACT OF STUDY: The healthcare team is faced with an 
      increasingly complex older adult patient population. As such, this trial aims to 
      provide novel evidence supporting a health intervention to ensure that frail, older 
      adult patients thrive after undergoing cardiac surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      Trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national 
      and international scientific meetings. The University of Manitoba Health Research 
      Ethics Board has approved the study protocol V.1.3, dated 11 August 2014 
      (H2014:208). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial has been registered on 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry and results database of privately and publicly funded

TI  - Clinical profile of acute confusion in the long-term care setting.
PG  - 145-58
AB  - Aspects of acute confusion (AC) including risk factors, behavior patterns, and 
      outcomes are not well documented in long-term care (LTC) residents. The purpose of 
      this prospective study was to describe the clinical profile of AC in LTC including 
      risk factors, behavior patterns, etiologies, and 3-month outcomes. Seventy-four 
      elderly LTC residents were assessed for AC, depression, and global cognitive 
      impairment. Risk factors associated with AC included hearing deficits, depression, 
      pulmonary disorders, and abnormal serum sodium or potassium levels. Behavior 
      patterns of acutely confused residents included hyperactive (n = 9, 31%), hypoactive 
      (n = 8, 28%), and mixed (n = 7, 24%). In the majority of the AC cases, the etiology 
      was multIfactorial infections and dehydration were the most common causes. Residents 
      with AC had very poor 3-month outcomes. Thirty-four percent (n = 10) of the 
      residents with AC died within 3 months of the evaluation. This study highlights the 
      complexity and serious nature of AC in this frail population.

TI  - Around-the-clock nursing care for the elderly in Japan.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the first phase of creating a Japanese model of community-based 
      long-term care, called around-the-clock care (ACC), by operationally defining the 
      components of ACC, identifying those eligible for the program, clarifying methods of 
      planning and organization, and exploring outcomes. DESIGN: Exploratory evaluation 
      for the population of frail elderly Japanese citizens living at home. A convenience 
      sample of 44 patients receiving care from four visiting-nurse-service stations 
      during 3 months in 1994 was used. METHODS: Needs assessments; record reviews of 
      patient encounters; evaluations by patients, families, and visiting nurses; and 
      reviews of administrative data. FINDINGS: Nurses perceived that ACC stabilized 
      medical status, reduced the emotional and physical burden of treatment, and improved 
      hygiene. It also reduced family caregiving burdens and the stress of family 
      caregivers' employment responsibilities. The highest rating of ACC by patient and 
      families was for those with the most complex physical needs. Skilled nursing at home 
      permitted early identification and treatment of problems before they became crises 
      or required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Early findings suggest 24-hour nurse-home 
      helper teamwork may be an effective system of community-based long-term care and 
      should be considered a key element of future Japanese health policy.

TI  - Do gerontology nurse specialists make a difference in hospitalization of long-term 
      care residents? Results of a randomized comparison trial.
PG  - 1962-7
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13022 [doi]
AB  - Residents of long-term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of 
      care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive 
      assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute 
      hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program (RACIP) is a quality 
      improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on-site 
      support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology 
      nurse specialists (GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of 
      the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of 
      hospitalization 1 year before and after program implementation. The sample included 
      29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 
      residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased 
      for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was 
      significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after 
      the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention 
      group (rate ratio (RR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61-0.86, P < .001). 
      Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for 
      medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group 
      (69% increase) (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56-0.82, P < .001). Conversely, there was no 
      significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention 
      and comparison groups (RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.68-1.46, P = .99). The integration of 
      GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to 
      provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.

TI  - 'Failure to Maintain': A theoretical proposition for a new quality indicator of 
      nurse care rationing for complex older people in hospital.

AB  - Complex older patients represent about half of all acute public hospital admissions 
      in Australia. People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, 
      and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. 
      Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and 
      cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has 
      been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited 
      ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. 
      Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or 
      mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for 
      nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. 
      Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient 
      mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed. 
      This paper offers a theoretical proposition of 'Failure to Maintain' as a conceptual 
      framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes 
      to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then 
      contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital 
      acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and 
      delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of 'Failure to Maintain'. Hospital 
      focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and 
      medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge 
      over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This 
      privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically 
      associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, 
      pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including 
      those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have 
      higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). 'Failure 
      to Maintain' offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, 
      this vulnerable population. Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely 
      contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and 
      hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability 
      data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward 
      and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, 
      understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute 
      geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling 
      multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide 
      patient focussed care, and avoid 'Failing to Maintain'. The research field of acute 
      geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including 
      controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention 
      studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the 
      different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and 
      functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work 
      environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older 
      patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin 
      care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.

TI  - Investigating the contribution of community nurses to anticipatory care: a 
      qualitative exploratory study.
PG  - 1558-67

AB  - AIMS: To investigate how one aspect of anticipatory care is understood and delivered 
      in practice. 'Anticipatory care' in this context can be understood as proactive 
      care, which is oriented towards prevention of adverse events. BACKGROUND: Scotland 
      has identified the intention to move away from a preoccupation with acute care and 
      invest in health improvement and anticipatory care. Community nurses are the key, 
      yet little is known about how they understand and deliver anticipatory care. 
      METHODS: A qualitative case study design using individual in-depth interviews 
      (n=10), observation (n=9) and focus groups (n=5) was selected. Five focus group 
      interviews were carried out with district nurses, practice nurses and health 
      visitors. Subsequently, nine observation events took place, each focused on a single 
      nurse/client encounter. Data were collected during 2008 and 2009 in one Community 
      Health Partnership in Scotland. FINDINGS: Two approaches to anticipatory care 
      emerged; these were influenced by participants' roles and responsibilities. Approach 
      1 derives from Government policy agenda and is focused on protocol-focused 
      management of long-term illness. Approach 2 is synonymous with long-standing nursing 
      activity focused on holistic care of individual patients. Both approaches are 
      proactive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: There is scope to develop a more conceptually 
      complex model of anticipatory care, building on this initial exploration, within 
      which all aims, roles, practices and methods of evaluation can be located and 
      clearly visible. This offers the potential to enable practitioners to interpret and 
      apply policy--otherwise change may be limited and result in service gaps.

TI  - Recruitment of frail older people to research: lessons learnt through experience.
PG  - 643-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based 
      practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to 
      provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, 
      interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important 
      factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. 
      Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. 
      However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. AIMS OF THE 
      PAPER: This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older 
      people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of 
      research related to ethical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of frail older people 
      to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the 
      researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not 
      to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is 
      sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and 
      refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older 
      people to research while protecting their right to refuse.

TI  - Nursing management of constipation in housebound older people.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - In this article two algorithms are suggested for use by district nurses in the 
      management of constipation in dependent older people at home. Prescribing for this 
      group of patients requires a complex assessment of medical and social factors as 
      24-hour supervision is not always available and local health and social service 
      resources may impact on the level of care that is available in terms of the 
      provision of food and drink and the taking of medicines.

TI  - Nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients: a 
      descriptive study of what nurses actually do?
PG  - 1387-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03026.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aims to explore nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised 
      older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and 
      strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem. BACKGROUND: Urinary tract 
      infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. 
      Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms 
      causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of 
      caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition. 
      DESIGN: Qualitative. METHODS: A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a 
      hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen 
      nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. RESULTS: When 
      managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, 
      nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms 
      and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed 
      the basis for deciding whether the patient's urinary condition should be managed by 
      nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on 
      this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be 
      effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to 
      improve nurses' existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary 
      tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified. CONCLUSION: 
      Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing 
      care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive 
      'basic urinary tract infection care' on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms 
      could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by 
      nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of 
      interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine 
      which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.

TI  - Nurse care coordination and technology effects on health status of frail older 
      adults via enhanced self-management of medication: randomized clinical trial to test 
      efficacy.
PG  - 269-78
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0b013e318298aa55 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is 
      challenging for many older adults. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support 
      program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination 
      and technology. DESIGN: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three 
      arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. SETTING: Older adults having difficulty 
      in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three 
      Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. METHODS: All 
      participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no 
      further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses 
      coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either 
      an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the 
      Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance 
      Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were 
      measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS: After covariate and 
      baseline health status adjustment, time Ã group interactions for the MD.2 and 
      medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time Ã group 
      interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. 
      DISCUSSION: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health 
      status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 
      machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.

TI  - A threat to our integrity--Meanings of providing nursing care for older patients 
      with cognitive impairment in acute care settings.
PG  - 48-56
LID - 10.1111/scs.12220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people with cognitive impairment represent a large group of 
      patients in acute care settings. Research show that these acute care environments 
      can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical 
      experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to 
      work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring 
      for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities 
      have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to 
      connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them. 
      AIM: This study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with 
      cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff. METHOD: 
      A purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with 
      cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative 
      interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a 
      phenomenological hermeneutic method. FINDINGS: Caring for older, acutely ill 
      cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring 
      for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of 
      the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) 
      in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care 
      was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' 
      personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed. 
      CONCLUSION: The comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having 
      to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an 
      environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' 
      personal-professional integrity.

TI  - The indispensable intermediaries: a qualitative study of informal caregivers' 
      struggle to achieve influence at and after hospital discharge.
PG  - 331
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-14-331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The care policy and organization of the care sector is shifting to 
      accommodate projected demographic changes and to ensure a sustainable model of 
      health care provision in the future. Adult children and spouses are often the first 
      to assume care giving responsibilities for older adults when declining function 
      results in increased care needs. By introducing policies tailored to enabling family 
      members to combine gainful employment with providing care for older relatives, the 
      sustainability of the future care for older individuals in Norway is more explicitly 
      placed on the family and informal caregivers than previously. Care recipients and 
      informal caregivers are expected to take an active consumer role and participate in 
      the care decision-making process. This paper aims to describe the informal 
      caregivers' experiences of influencing decision-making at and after hospital 
      discharge for home-bound older relatives. METHODS: This paper reports findings from 
      a follow-up study with an exploratory qualitative design. Qualitative telephone 
      interviews were conducted with 19 informal caregivers of older individuals 
      discharged from hospital in Norway. An inductive thematic content analysis was 
      undertaken. RESULTS: Informal caregivers take on comprehensive all-consuming roles 
      as intermediaries between the care recipient and the health care services. In 
      essence, the informal caregivers take the role of the active participant on behalf 
      of their older relative. They describe extensive efforts struggling to establish 
      dialogues with the "gatekeepers" of the health care services. Achieving the goal of 
      the best possible care for the care recipient seem to depend on the informal 
      caregivers having the resources to choose appropriate strategies for gaining 
      influence over decisions. CONCLUSIONS: The care recipients' extensive frailty and 
      increasing dependence on their families coupled with the complexity of health care 
      services contribute to the perception of the informal caregivers' indispensable role 
      as intermediaries. These findings accentuate the need to further discuss how frail 
      older individuals and their informal caregivers can be supported and enabled to 
      participate in decision-making regarding care arrangements that meet the care 
      recipient's needs.

AB  - AIM: To identify the direct and indirect effects of nutritional status, physical 
      function, and cognitive function on activities of daily living in Japanese older 
      adults requiring long-term care. METHODS: In total, 179 participants aged â¥ 65 years 
      who were eligible for long-term care insurance (mean age 85.5 Â± 7.8 years) were 
      recruited for this study. Nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment, Short 
      Form) and physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery) were examined. 
      Activities of daily living, cognitive function and frailty were assessed using the 
      Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Frailty Scale, 
      respectively. Path analysis was used to determine relationships between these 
      factors and the activities of daily living. RESULTS: For Japanese older adults 
      requiring long-term care, pathways were modeled for nutritional status, physical 
      function and the activities of daily living. The total effect of nutritional status 
      was 0.516 (P<0.001). The indirect effect of nutritional status through physical 
      function on the activities of daily living was 0.458 (P<0.001). Finally, no 
      significant direct effect of nutritional status on activities of daily living was 
      observed (b=0.058, P=0.258). CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified the complex 
      pathway from nutritional status to the activities of daily living through physical 
      function in aged Japanese people requiring long-term care. These findings suggest 
      that maintaining good nutritional status and nutritional support might delay 
      physical function decline, and prolong the activities of daily living.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The population is ageing, with increasing health and supportive care 
      needs. For older people, complex chronic health conditions and frailty can lead to a 
      cascade of repeated hospitalisations and further decline. Existing solutions are 
      fragmented and not person centred. The proposed Being Your Best programme integrates 
      care across hospital and community settings to address symptoms of frailty. METHODS 
      AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre pragmatic mixed methods study aiming to recruit 80 
      community-dwelling patients aged â¥65 years recently discharged from hospital. Being 
      Your Best is a codesigned 6-month programme that provides referral and linkage with 
      existing services comprising four modules to prevent or mitigate symptoms of 
      physical, nutritional, cognitive and social frailty. Feasibility will be assessed in 
      terms of recruitment, acceptability of the intervention to participants and level of 
      retention in the programme. Changes in frailty (Modified Reported Edmonton Frail 
      Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), functional ability (Barthel and 
      Lawton), loneliness (University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-3 items) 
      and nutrition (Malnutrition Screening Tool) will also be measured at 6 and 12 
      months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from Monash Health 
      Human Research Ethics Committee (RES-19-0000904L). Results will be disseminated 
      through peer-reviewed journals, conference and seminar presentations. TRIAL

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of nursing homes residents requiring light-care.
PG  - 210-9
AB  - Rising nursing home (NH) costs and the poor quality of NH care make it important to 
      recognize elders for whom NH care may be inappropriate. As a first step in 
      developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH 
      residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 
      12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we 
      developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III 
      (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance 
      with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no 
      complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the 
      criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal 
      care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining 
      balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still 
      light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as 
      light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer 
      services than NHs.

TI  - Medication-taking by the frail elderly in two ethnic groups.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - A complex and dangerous area of medical intervention with the elderly population is 
      drug therapy. Although drugs have contributed to the well-being of many older 
      persons, some elderly individuals are at risk due to polypharmacy and age-related 
      factors. The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the 
      medication-taking behaviors of two ethnic groups of noninstitutionalized frail 
      elderly individuals. The findings indicate that these individuals may be at risk for 
      harm due to their medication-taking practices. Healthcare professionals must 
      evaluate drug use by the elderly and be aware of the risks of drug misuse by this 
      vulnerable group.

TI  - Minimal effect on energy intake by additional evening meal for frail elderly service 
      flat residents--a pilot study.
PG  - 295-301
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional problems are common in frail elderly individuals receiving 
      municipal care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if an additional evening meal could improve 
      total daily food intake, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life 
      (HRQOL) in frail elderly service flat (SF) residents. DESIGN: Out of 122 residents 
      in two SF complexes, 60 subjects agreed to participate, of which 49 subjects (median 
      84 (79-90) years, (25th-75th percentile)) completed the study. For six months 23 
      residents in one SF complex were served 530 kcal in addition to their regular meals, 
      i.e. intervention group (I-group). Twenty-six residents in the other SF building 
      were controls (C-group). Nutritional status, energy and nutrient intake, length of 
      night time fast, cognitive function and HRQOL was assessed before and after the 
      intervention. RESULTS: At the start, the Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 27% 
      as malnourished and 63% as at risk for malnutrition, with no difference between the 
      groups. After six months the median body weight was unchanged in the I-group, +0.6 
      (-1.7-+1.6) kg (p=0.72) and the C-group -0.6 (-2.0-+0.5) kg (p=0.15). Weight change 
      ranged from -13% to +15%. The evening meal improved the protein and carbohydrate 
      intake (p<0.01) but the energy intake increased by only 180 kcal/day (p=0.15). The 
      night time fast decreased in the I-group from 15.0 (13.0-16.0) to 13.0 (12.0-14.0) 
      hours (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in cognitive function or HRQOL 
      between the groups. CONCLUSION: Nine out of ten frail elderly SF residents had 
      nutritional problems. Serving an additional evening meal increased the protein and 
      carbohydrate intake, but the meal had no significant effect on energy intake, body 
      weight or HRQOL. The variation in outcome within each study group was large.

TI  - Impact of Social Frailty on Relocation of Older Adults.
PG  - 254-258
LID - 10.14283/jfa.2021.3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between frailty and variables such as housing are the 
      least included in models of frailty and research on frailty or social frailty and 
      relocation is negligible. The decision to relocate is complex and demanding for 
      older adults with a loss of independence but little is known about what makes older 
      adults relocate to congregated housing designated for older adults, let alone in 
      combination with social frailty, and how they navigate this transition. OBJECTIVES: 
      This mixed method descriptive study aims to understand the influence of social 
      frailty for a population of French-speaking semi-independent older adults relocating 
      to a housing continuum community. DESIGN: Semi-structured individual interviews 
      including sociodemographic data and the PRISMA-7 Frailty Scale were conducted with 
      recently relocated older adults. SETTING: A newly opened French-speaking housing 
      continuum community in Eastern Canada that offers luxury apartments for independent 
      older adults, two assisted living facilities for semi-independent older adults along 
      with a long-term care facility. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine older adults with a mean 
      age of 85 years, mostly female, married or widowed and highly educated. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Content analysis of the transcribed recorded interviews and 
      descriptive statistical analyses to examine relationships between the frailty 
      PRISMA-7 scale, answers to additional questions and the sociodemographic data. 
      RESULTS: There was not a significant difference in the scores for socialization 
      before and after relocation nor between prior help and current help; however, there 
      was a significant negative correlation between help and socialization before and 
      after relocation. Three main themes included: imposed influences, push and pull 
      factors and post relocation. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that several social 
      factors contributed to relocation and that participants were experiencing social 
      frailty. Participants were at the crossover point of being vulnerable to 
      experiencing additional deficits which would potentially have led to higher frailty 
      had they not relocated.

TI  - A critique of research measures used to assess inappropriate psychoactive drug use 
      in older adults.
PG  - 374-7
AB  - An overview and critique of research measures of inappropriate psychoactive drug use 
      in the treatment of frail older adults is presented. These measures are compared on 
      the basis of six key criteria for the complex determination of inappropriate 
      psychoactive drug use as a research variable. These six instruments/standards are 
      examined also for their advantages and disadvantages as research tools. Based on 
      this review and related literature, recommendations are made that future studies of 
      inappropriate psychoactive drug use include expert clinician assessment, measures of 
      target symptoms and functional status, physiological indicators wherever possible, 
      and drug and dosage classifications according to interdisciplinary consensus-based 
      criteria.

TI  - The complexities of documenting clinical information in long-term care settings in 
      Australia.
PG  - 8-12
AB  - Clinical nursing documentation, written, verbal or supported by technology, is being 
      affected by both the worldwide "information explosion" and budgetary constraints. In 
      Australia, the necessity of documenting complex care needs and treatment plans in 
      older adult care settings has become more imperative because funding levels and 
      sources are frequently tied to these documents. As a consequence, the statutory 
      requirements for documentation have become a significant driving force in shaping 
      nursing practice. Although the value of quality documentation is or should be 
      recognized, the seemingly vast amounts of time required inevitably distracts nurses 
      from what they see as their primary purpose-the provision of direct patient care. 
      Older adults who are frail are among the most complex clients requiring services in 
      what is traditionally a poorly resourced sector. Under-funding frequently impacts on 
      the staff skill mix, resulting in low levels of senior, highly qualified, and 
      skilled staff. These factors impact the quality of the documentation and possibly 
      the usage of the information itself. This article will provide an overview of the 
      issues related to documentation of clinical information in older adult care settings 
      with particular reference to some of the "unique" inefficiencies inherent in the 
      Australian system.

TI  - Transitional care from skilled nursing facilities to home: study protocol for a 
      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with 
      multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have 
      experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or 
      acute care use is over 50% within 90âdays of discharge, yet these patients and their 
      caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them 
      to manage serious illnesses at home. METHODS: The study will test the efficacy of 
      Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting 
      seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study 
      setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' 
      home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will 
      transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the 
      Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and 
      their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and 
      Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff 
      create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at 
      home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement 
      the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of 
      the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using 
      study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for 
      discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample 
      and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect 
      a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ 
      linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care 
      periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality 
      of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden 
      and distress. DISCUSSION: Study results will determine the efficacy of an 
      intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for 
      seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute 
      care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) 
      advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care 
      trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was 
      being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to 
      mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study 
      team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications.

AB  - The corona pandemic challenges countries worldwide in many different ways. Due to 
      its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several 
      shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and 
      deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such 
      as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown 
      that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed 
      and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between 
      various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level 
      of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But 
      setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes 
      and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in 
      their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This case study shows that 
      integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit 
      from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance 
      concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing 
      homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) 
      crises in nursing homes.

TI  - Helping family members manage medication administration hassles.
PG  - 13-5
AB  - Managing the medication regimens of dependent older adults in the home is a complex 
      issue for family caregivers. The tasks involved can include helping the older adults 
      manage their own medications or may require involvement in the purchasing, 
      scheduling, and administering of multiple medications for serious conditions. The 
      hassles associated with this responsibility are now known to be associated with 
      increased caregiver strain. In this article, we provide an overview of the body of 
      research on medication administration hassles and offer a tool to assess family 
      caregivers who are involved in this important aspect of care.

TI  - Circles of care: home care and community support for rural older adults.
PG  - 22-33
AB  - Rural dwelling, frail older adults are a vulnerable population owing to the 
      complexity of health problems superimposed upon limited health care resources. Home 
      care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued 
      independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail 
      older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A 
      major theme identified was "Circles of Care." Grounded in rural culture, the circles 
      assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, 
      maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.

TI  - Development of a proactive care program (U-CARE) to preserve physical functioning of 
      frail older people in primary care.
PG  - 230-7
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12023 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, 
      and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program 
      (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of 
      life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process 
      of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. METHODS: The framework of the 
      Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex 
      interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. 
      An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of 
      researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an 
      independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to 
      increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature 
      and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert 
      opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. FINDINGS: Based on 
      predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises 
      three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home 
      followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based 
      care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical 
      practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development 
      process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in 
      reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the 
      general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE 
      intervention is feasible in clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCES: The U-CARE 
      program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care 
      of older patients.

TI  - An investigation of the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely 
      ill hospitalized older patients with coincidental dementia: a multi-method design.
PG  - 1127-36
AB  - The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the 
      components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly 
      people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the 
      problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design 
      comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived 
      from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently 
      combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and 
      older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of 
      elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer 
      from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey 
      revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were 
      more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. 
      No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had 
      items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. 
      A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were 
      invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to 
      the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of 
      the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between 
      documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within 
      each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care 
      is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. 
      Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide 
      nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by 
      the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method 
      research.

TI  - Discharge of frail older people from acute hospitals across Europe.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - Over the last few years the number of elderly patients in acute hospitals throughout 
      Europe has risen dramatically. The pressure on hospital beds leads to earlier 
      discharge and the task of sending patients home from hospitals is becoming more 
      complex. The provision of health and social services is organized in different ways 
      all over Europe. Therefore, it would be of interest to know more about how different 
      kinds of systems support the professional carers in their effort to satisfy the 
      needs which older people and their significant others experience in the discharge 
      process. A pilot study was set up mainly to provide information on what kinds of 
      problems are inherent in a multicentre, interprofessional research project involving 
      a large number of countries. The findings serve as an important knowledge base in a 
      future project. Experiences from the pilot study and the benefits of it are 
      presented.

      clinimetric testing. Part II.
PG  - 822-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2011.01685.x [doi]
AB  - The interRAI Acute Care is a comprehensive geriatric assessment tool that provides a 
      holistic picture of complex and frail hospitalized older persons. It is designed to 
      support holistic care planning and to transfer patient data across settings. Its 
      usefulness in clinical decision making depends on the extent to which clinicians can 
      rely on the patient data as accurate and meaningful indicators of patients 
      functioning. But its multidimensional character implies challenges for clinimetric 
      testing as some of the traditional analyses techniques cannot be unconditionally 
      applied. The objective was to present an overview of methods to examine the 
      reliability of the interRAI Acute Care. For each line of evidence, examples of 
      hypotheses and research questions are listed.

TI  - Age-related hearing loss in the dependent elderly population: a model for nursing 
      care.
PG  - 224-30
AB  - Advancing nursing care through the implementation of evidence-based practice is a 
      legitimate professional ideal. In reality there are many complex issues that need be 
      addressed before such a goal can be achieved. This paper takes an intermediate step 
      towards the realization of this aim in one aspect of continuing care nursing through 
      the presentation of a procedural model. The presented model is designed to stimulate 
      debate as to what could be, and arguably should be the role of the nurse in relation 
      to meeting the auditory rehabilitative needs of dependent elderly patients. The 
      model is based upon a published management model which outlines the auditory 
      rehabilitative process within a psychosocial framework. The original model has been 
      modified as a result of knowledge synthesis from a range of specialist disciplines 
      including nursing. The Audiological Care Model for Nursing is intended to offer an 
      accessible guide to this often neglected aspect of care.

TI  - Nurses with special interests.
PG  - 258
AB  - High Quality Care for All (Department of Health (DH), 2008) emphasised the 
      centrality of quality within NHS provision based upon a service that is 'fair, 
      personalized, effective and safe'. The challenge of meeting this aspiration is even 
      greater today amid resource constraints and the imperative of transferring more 
      complex care out of hospitals and into primary care and community settings. The 
      quality of care delivered to older people in particular has attracted much negative 
      comment (Ombudsman, 2011), with the values of care and compassion appearing to have 
      evaporated in some services.

TI  - Medication administration hassles reported by family caregivers of dependent elderly 
      persons.
PG  - M412-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even under the new long-term care mantra for increased home- and 
      community-based care options, attention to and an understanding of the ways that 
      family caregivers are managing complex care for dependent elderly persons, for 
      example, with medication administration, have been slow to materialize. METHODS: 
      Twenty-three family caregivers completed semistructured, face-to-face interviews to 
      capture the shared and idiosyncratic experiences of individuals responsible for all 
      aspects of medication administration regimens for elderly, dependent family members. 
      Data analysis consisted of content analysis of the verbatim interview transcripts. 
      This article reports an emerging typology of caregiver medication administration 
      hassles derived from the interviews. RESULTS: Based on 122 separate accounts, three 
      categories of medication administration hassles were identified. The categories 
      (with the percentage of all accounts represented by the category) include (i) 
      scheduling logistics (29.5%), (ii) administration procedures (31.9%), and (iii) 
      safety issues (38.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers must continually 
      reevaluate and simplify medication regimens for dependent elderly persons in the 
      care of family members, and the family caregivers must be given adequate training 
      and access to ongoing information support systems to help them perform safe and 
      effective medication administration responsibilities.

TI  - LIFE: Learning Informally From Elders.
PG  - 267-70
AB  - The Better Elder Services Today (BEST) Project helps frail elders maintain healthy, 
      independent living through partnership with their formal and informal caregivers. 
      This article reports on achieving one particular project goal: the development of 
      community forums in which elders engaged in problem-solving with health care 
      professionals and policy makers. The methodology involved community assessment and 
      qualitative analysis of themes in 102 elders' responses to the question, "What has 
      it been like for you trying to remain as independent as possible in the community?" 
      Five predominant themes emerged: safety; problems communicating with health care 
      providers; dissatisfaction with hospital services; complexity in access to community 
      services; and fears about losses.
