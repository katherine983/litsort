TI  - Frailty syndrome: an overview.
PG  - 433-41
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S45300 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a common and important geriatric syndrome characterized by age-associated 
      declines in physiologic reserve and function across multiorgan systems, leading to 
      increased vulnerability for adverse health outcomes. Two major frailty models have 
      been described in the literature. The frailty phenotype defines frailty as a 
      distinct clinical syndrome meeting three or more of five phenotypic criteria: 
      weakness, slowness, low level of physical activity, self-reported exhaustion, and 
      unintentional weight loss. The frailty index defines frailty as cumulative deficits 
      identified in a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Significant progress has 
      recently been made in understanding the pathogenesis of frailty. Chronic 
      inflammation is likely a key pathophysiologic process that contributes to the 
      frailty syndrome directly and indirectly through other intermediate physiologic 
      systems, such as the musculoskeletal, endocrine, and hematologic systems. The 
      complex multifactorial etiologies of frailty also include obesity and specific 
      diseases. Major clinical applications include risk assessment and stratification. 
      This can be applied to the elderly population in the community and in a variety of 
      care settings. Frailty may also be useful for risk assessment in surgical patients 
      and those with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, or human immunodeficiency virus 
      infection, as well as for assessment of vaccine effectiveness in older adults. 
      Currently, exercise and comprehensive geriatric interdisciplinary assessment and 
      treatment are key interventions for frailty. As understanding of the biologic basis 
      and complexity of frailty further improves, more effective and targeted 
      interventional strategies and innovative geriatric-care models will likely be 
      developed.

TI  - Frailty and chronic disease.
PG  - 486-492

AB  - Chronic diseases and frailty represent the clinical expressions of the accumulations 
      of biological deficits that occur with aging. However, when addressing chronic 
      diseases, the evaluation of frailty is yet far to be part of routine clinical 
      practice. Frailty and chronic diseases are often treated as different identities. 
      However, the two concepts are related and present a certain amount of overlap and 
      the presence of chronic diseases contributes to the onset of frailty. By taking into 
      considerations not only the physical domain and function, but also psychological, 
      socioeconomical and spiritual factors, frailty is a good descriptor of complexity 
      found in older age. Strategies to identify, manage, and prevent frailty at any age 
      in individuals with multimorbidity or chronic conditions are advised. Benefits and 
      harms of pharmacological treatments should be weighted in older people considering 
      the underlying frailty status. In fact, frailty acts as a modifier of the risks and 
      benefits of chronic diseases treatments. Moreover, some treatments could lead to 
      frailty itself (i.e. proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, hypoglycemic drugs, 
      antihypertensive treatments), underlining the need of an individualized and flexible 
      prescribing decision-making in this population. For these reasons, a different 
      pathway of care for older patients with frailty and chronic diseases seems 
      necessary. An assessment of frailty should be simple and not time consuming in order 
      to address patient's needs and expectations, evaluating the social background, 
      lifestyle and priorities. Empowering the patient implies a personalized evaluation 
      and the development of individualized management plans which would ultimately lead 
      to a reorganization of the health care provision and eventually increase quality of 
      life in the elderly multimorbid frail patient.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review points out unmet medical needs and open research 
      questions of older adults living with HIV. Starting from the definition of aging in 
      HIV, it explores the mosaic of this condition at epidemiological, 
      pathophysiological, and clinical level. Antiretroviral management and diverse models 
      of care are critically discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Aging cohorts suggest HIV as a 
      paradigm of chronic inflammation and immune activation with specific aging 
      trajectory patterns in which antiretroviral therapy may play a role. In the absence 
      of randomized clinical trials, observational cohorts show that therapy is driven by 
      duration of HIV infection and burden of non-infectious comorbidities. This review 
      suggests that geriatric approach should be used to recognize the complexity of aging 
      goes beyond the viro-immunological success and management of progressive 
      accumulation of non-communicable diseases. This requires recognition of frailty and 
      geriatric syndromes to stratify patients' diversity by using comprehensive geriatric 
      assessment tools.

TI  - Biomarkers for physical frailty and sarcopenia.
PG  - 29-34
LID - 10.1007/s40520-016-0708-1 [doi]
AB  - Physical frailty (PF) and sarcopenia are major health issues in geriatric 
      populations, given their high prevalence and association with several adverse 
      outcomes. Nevertheless, the lack of an univocal operational definition for the two 
      conditions has so far hampered their clinical implementation. Existing definitional 
      ambiguities of PF and sarcopenia, together with their complex underlying 
      pathophysiology, also account for the absence of robust biomarkers that can be used 
      for screening, diagnostic and/or prognostication purposes. This review provides an 
      overview of currently available biological markers for PF and sarcopenia, as well as 
      a critical appraisal of strengths and weaknesses of traditional procedures for 
      biomarker development in the field. A novel approach for biomarker identification 
      and validation, based on multivariate methodologies, is also discussed. This 
      strategy relies on the multidimensional modeling of complementary biomarkers to cope 
      with the phenotypical and pathophysiological complexity of PF and sarcopenia. 
      Biomarkers identified through the implementation of multivariate strategies may be 
      used to support the detection of the two conditions, track their progression over 
      time or in response to interventions, and reveal the onset of complications (e.g., 
      mobility disability) at a very early stage.

TI  - Frailty in Critical Care Medicine: A Review.
PG  - 1462-1473
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004665 [doi]
AB  - Traditional approaches to clinical risk assessment utilize age as a marker of 
      increased vulnerability to stress. Relatively recent advancements in the study of 
      aging have led to the concept of the frailty syndrome, which represents a 
      multidimensional state of depleted physiologic and psychosocial reserve and clinical 
      vulnerability that is related to but variably present with advancing age. The 
      frailty syndrome is now a well-established clinical entity that serves as both a 
      guide for clinical intervention and a predictor of poor outcomes in the primary and 
      acute care settings. The biological aspects of the syndrome broadly represent a 
      network of interrelated perturbations involving the age-related accumulation of 
      molecular, cellular, and tissue damage that leads to multisystem dysregulation, 
      functional decline, and disproportionately poor response to physiologic stress. 
      Given the complexity of the underlying biologic processes, several well-validated 
      approaches to define frailty clinically have been developed, each with distinct and 
      reasonable considerations. Stemming from this background, the past several years 
      have seen a number of observational studies conducted in intensive care units that 
      have established that the determination of frailty is both feasible and 
      prognostically useful in the critical care setting. Specifically, frailty as 
      determined by several different frailty measurement tools appears associated with 
      mortality, increased health care utilization, and disability, and has the potential 
      to improve risk stratification of intensive care patients. While substantial 
      variability in the implementation of frailty measurement likely limits the 
      generalizability of specific findings, the overall prognostic trends may offer some 
      assistance in guiding management decisions with patients and their families. 
      Although no trials have assessed interventions to improve the outcomes of critically 
      ill older people living with frailty, the particular vulnerability of this 
      population offers a promising target for intervention in the future.

TI  - Complexity of syncope in elderly people: a comprehensive geriatric approach.
PG  - 182-190
LID - 10.12809/hkmj176945 [doi]
AB  - Syncope is a prevalent health problem among elderly people. It may be neurally 
      mediated or caused by conditions such as orthostatic hypotension, postprandial 
      hypotension, and cardiac disorders. A combination of different aetiologies is not 
      uncommon in the elderly people. Many pathophysiological processes, including 
      age-related physiological changes, co-morbidities, concomitant medication use, and 
      prolonged bedrest, coexist and predispose elderly people to syncope; advanced age 
      and cardiac syncope are associated with increased mortality. Recurrent syncope and 
      its co-morbidities, such as fall-related physical injury, negative psychological 
      impact, and functional decline, may increase the dependency of elderly patients. 
      Furthermore, the overlap between falls and syncope, and the interaction between 
      syncope and frailty complicate management. Available clinical guidelines for the 
      management of syncope that focus on diagnosis, investigation, and treatment are 
      therefore insufficient to address syncope in elderly patients. A comprehensive 
      geriatric approach that considers an individual's functional and cognitive 
      capacities, as well as medical and psychosocial aspects, would be more appropriate.

TI  - Geriatric syndromes: clinical, research, and policy implications of a core geriatric 
      concept.
PG  - 780-91
AB  - Geriatricians have embraced the term "geriatric syndrome," using it extensively to 
      highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric 
      syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, 
      multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. 
      Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This 
      article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced 
      approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based 
      on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors-older age, baseline 
      cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility-were 
      identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, 
      falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in 
      geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted 
      therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial 
      conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate 
      more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different 
      risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research 
      advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and 
      falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives 
      are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy 
      advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.

AB  - The changing physiology and lifestyle of older people affect the gut microbiota 
      composition. In particular, the age-related diet modifications can alter the gut 
      microbiota biodiversity and determine the relative abundance of specific microbial 
      taxa, resulting in microbiota dysbiosis with negative consequences for the host 
      physiology. Unhealthy microbiota may then induce an acceleration of the age-related 
      physiological changes, consequently concurring at determining the characteristic 
      complexity of frail older persons. One of the major clinical manifestations of 
      frailty is represented by the individual's physical decline. Besides of a 
      well-established clinical phenotype of frailty, the qualitative and quantitative 
      skeletal muscle impairment (i.e., sarcopenia) is today of particular interest for 
      potentially serving as target for (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) 
      interventions to prevent incident disability. Evidence suggests that gut microbiota 
      is able to influence the skeletal muscle homeostasis via microbiota-dependent 
      metabolites, thus representing the possible biological substratum for the sarcopenia 
      onset. In fact, the rearrangements of gut microbiota as well as the alteration of 
      its functions contribute at increasing the anabolic resistance, releasing 
      pro-inflammatory mediators, determining mitochondrial abnormalities with consequent 
      oxidation, and causing insulin resistance. In this article, the link between gut 
      microbiota and physical frailty is discussed. It is especially explained the role 
      that sarcopenia may play in this likely bidirectional relationship.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in developed countries 
      and disproportionately affects older adults. Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome 
      with multiple causes and contributing factors in which there is increased 
      vulnerability when exposed to a minor stressor and increased risk for adverse 
      outcomes, such as disability, hospitalization and mortality. Frailty is an important 
      prognostic factor in patients with CVD, and so identifying this feature when 
      assessing these patients may help to individually tailor cardiovascular treatment. 
      The first step is to identify frailty. Several tools have been validated as 
      screening methods for frailty. However, they diverge with regard to complexity, 
      nature, feasibility and the outcome they can predict. The aim of this review is to 
      describe the available screening tools for frailty and to examine their usefulness 
      in patients with CVD.

AB  - Anesthetists are increasingly faced with the challenge of delivering perioperative 
      care to frail older people. Patients with frailty undergoing surgical intervention 
      are at a significantly increased risk of perioperative complications, mortality, and 
      longer length of stay. Moreover, frailty is often associated with multimorbidity and 
      a range of geriatric syndromes including functional dependency, cognitive 
      impairment, and malnutrition which further increases risk and complexity of care. 
      There is a growing body of evidence that prehabilitation-intervention delivered 
      during the preoperative period to improve overall health and function-can improve 
      postoperative outcomes for patients undergoing surgery. However, whether this 
      vulnerable population stand to benefit from prehabilitation is less clear. We review 
      the evidence for prehabilitation for patients with frailty including whether the 
      risks associated with and outcomes from surgery can be modified through 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are limited screening tools to predict adverse postoperative 
      outcomes for the geriatric surgical fracture population. Frailty is increasingly 
      recognized as a risk assessment to capture complexity. The goal of this study was to 
      use a short screening tool, the FRAIL scale, to categorize the level of frailty of 
      older adults admitted with a fracture to determine the association of each frailty 
      category with postoperative and 30-day outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. 
      SETTING: Level 1 trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 175 consecutive patients 
      over age 70 years admitted to co-managed orthopedic trauma and geriatrics services. 
      MEASUREMENTS: The FRAIL scale (short 5-question assessment of fatigue, resistance, 
      aerobic capacity, illnesses, and loss of weight) classified the patients into 3 
      categories: robust (score = 0), prefrail (score = 1-2), and frail (score = 3-5). 
      Postoperative outcome variables collected were postoperative complications, 
      unplanned intensive care unit admission, length of stay (LOS), discharge 
      disposition, and orthopedic follow-up after surgery. Thirty-day outcomes measured 
      were 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality. Analysis of variance (1-way) and 
      Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare continuous variables across the 3 FRAIL 
      categories. Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Multiple 
      regression analysis, adjusted by age, sex, and Charlson index, was conducted to 
      study the association between frailty category and outcomes. RESULTS: FRAIL scale 
      categorized the patients into 3 groups: robust (n = 29), prefrail (n = 73), and 
      frail (n = 73). There were statistically significant differences between groups in 
      terms of age, comorbidity, dementia, functional dependency, polypharmacy, and rate 
      of institutionalization, being higher in the frailest patients. Hip fracture was the 
      most frequent fracture, and it was more frequent as the frailty of the patient 
      increased (48%, 61%, and 75% in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, respectively). 
      The American Society of Anesthesiologists preoperative risk significantly correlated 
      with the frailty of the patient (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3-4: 
      41%, 82% and 86%, in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, P < .001). After adjustment 
      by age, sex, and comorbidity, there was a statistically significant association 
      between frailty and both LOS and the development of any complication after surgery 
      (LOS: 4.2, 5.0, and 7.1 days, P = .002; any complication: 3.4%, 26%, and 39.7%, 
      P = .03; in robust, prefrail, and frail groups). There were also significant 
      differences in discharge disposition (31% of robust vs 4.1% frail, P = .008) and 
      follow-up completion (97% of robust vs 69% of the frail ones). Differences in time 
      to surgery, unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day readmission and 
      mortality, although showing a trend, did not reach statistical significance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, measured by the FRAIL scale, was associated with increase LOS, 
      complications after surgery, and discharge to rehabilitation facility in geriatric 
      fracture patients. The FRAIL scale is a promising short screen to stratify and help 
      operationalize the perioperative care of older surgical patients.

TI  - Frailty defined by deficit accumulation and geriatric medicine defined by frailty.

AB  - As nonreplicative cells age, they commonly accumulate subcellular deficits that can 
      compromise function. As people age, they too experience problems that can 
      accumulate. As deficits (symptoms, signs, illnesses, disabilities) accumulate, 
      people become more susceptible to adverse health outcomes, including worse health 
      and even death. This state of increased risk of adverse health outcomes is 
      indistinguishable from the idea of frailty, so deficit accumulation represents 
      another way to define frailty. Counting deficits not only allows grades of frailty 
      to be discerned but also provides insights into the complex problems of older 
      adults. This process is potentially useful to geriatricians who need to be experts 
      in managing complexity. A key to managing complexity is through instruments such as 
      a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which can serve as the basis for routine 
      clinical estimation of an individual's degree of frailty. Understanding people and 
      their needs as deficits accumulate is an exciting challenge for clinical research on 
      frailty and its management by geriatricians.

TI  - Tools for Deprescribing in Frail Older Persons and Those with Limited Life 
      Expectancy: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 172-180
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15616 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize available tools that can assist clinicians in identifying 
      and reducing or stopping (deprescribing) potentially inappropriate medications and 
      that specifically consider frailty or limited life expectancy. DESIGN: Systematic 
      review and narrative synthesis. SETTING: We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE 
      (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL from inception to December 2017, along with grey 
      literature. We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of 
      medications. PARTICIPANTS: Frail older persons and older persons with limited life 
      expectancy. MEASUREMENTS: Narrative description of tools. RESULTS: We identified 15 
      tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a 
      model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a 
      deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that 
      provided medication-specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple 
      lists to detailed, step-wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, 
      and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most 
      tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in 
      clinical practice (in very low-quality studies). CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help 
      clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life 
      expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing 
      process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in 
      practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication 
      use. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:172-180, 2019.

AB  - Many frail older adults are thin, weak, and undernourished; this component of 
      frailty remains a critical concern in the geriatric field. However, there is also 
      strong evidence that excessive adiposity contributes to frailty by reducing the 
      ability of older adults to perform physical activities and increasing metabolic 
      instability. Our scoping review explores the impact of being obese on physical 
      frailty in older adults by summarizing the state of the science for both clinical 
      markers of physical function and biomarkers for potential underlying causes of 
      obesity-related decline. We used the 5-stage methodological framework of Arksey and 
      O'Malley to conduct a scoping review of randomized trials of weight loss and/or 
      exercise interventions for obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) in older adults 
      (aged >60 years), examining the outcomes of inflammation, oxidative stress, and 
      lipid accumulation in muscle, as well as direct measures of physical function. Our 
      initial search yielded 212 articles; exclusion of cross-sectional and observational 
      studies, cell culture and animal studies, disease-specific interventions, and 
      articles published before 2001 led to a final result of 21 articles. Findings of 
      these trials included the following major points. The literature consistently 
      confirmed benefits of lifestyle interventions to physical function assessed at the 
      clinical level. Generally speaking, weight loss alone produced a greater effect than 
      exercise alone, and the best outcomes were achieved with a combination of weight 
      loss and exercise, especially exercise programs that combined aerobic, resistance, 
      and flexibility training. Weight loss interventions tended to reduce markers of 
      inflammation and/or oxidative damage when more robust weight reduction was achieved 
      and maintained over time, whereas exercise did not change markers of inflammation. 
      However, participation in a chronic exercise program did reduce the oxidative stress 
      induced by an acute bout of exercise. Weight loss interventions consistently reduced 
      lipid accumulation in the muscle; however, in response to exercise, 3 studies showed 
      an increase and 2 a decrease in muscle lipid infiltration. In summary, this scoping 
      review identified strong clinical evidence that weight reduction and/or exercise 
      interventions can improve physical function and biomarkers of physical dysfunction 
      among overweight/obese older adults, supporting the suggestion that excessive 
      adiposity contributes to physical frailty. However, the evidence also suggests a 
      complexity of metabolic influences, both systemically and within muscle, which has 
      not been elucidated to date. Considerable further study is needed to examine the 
      mechanisms by which lifestyle interventions influence physical frailty before the 
      net impact of such interventions can be fully understood.

PG  - 546-51
LID - 10.1016/j.jamda.2012.04.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To enable prevention of poor outcome in elderly people, a valid 
      instrument is required to detect individuals at high risk. The concept of frailty is 
      a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been 
      developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct 
      validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. 
      SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly 
      persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion 
      criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. 
      MEASUREMENTS: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion 
      of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was 
      established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were 
      applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). 
      Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations 
      between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs 
      (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living 
      (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used 
      multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (<4 versus 
      ≥4). RESULTS: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the 
      GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant 
      GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent 
      (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as 
      hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher 
      levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life 
      satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and 
      validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and 
      institutionalized elderly people.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Person-centred care (PCC) focusing on personalised goals and care plans 
      derived from "What matters to you?" has an impact on single disease outcomes, but 
      studies on multi-morbid elderly are lacking. Furthermore, the combination of PCC, 
      Integrated Care (IC) and Pro-active care are widely recognised as desirable for 
      multi-morbid elderly, yet previous studies focus on single components only, leaving 
      synergies unexplored. The effect of a synergistic intervention, which implements 1) 
      Person-centred goal-oriented care driven by "What matters to you?" with 2) IC and 3) 
      pro-active care is unknown. METHODS: Inspired by theoretical foundations, complexity 
      science, previous health service research and a patient-driven evaluation of care 
      quality, we designed the Patient-Centred Team (PACT) intervention across primary and 
      secondary care. The PACT team collaborate with the patient to make and deliver a 
      person-centred, integrated and proactive multi-morbidity care-plan. The control 
      group receives conventional care. The study design is a pragmatic six months 
      prospective, controlled clinical trial based on hospital electronic health record 
      data of 439 multi-morbid frail elderly at risk for emergency (re) admissions 
      referred to PACT and 779 propensity score matched controls in Norway, 2014-2016. 
      Outcomes are emergency admissions, the sum of emergency inpatient bed days, 30-day 
      readmissions, planned and emergency outpatient visits and mortality at three and six 
      months follow-up. RESULTS: The Rate Ratios (RR) for emergency admissions was 0,9 
      (95%CI: 0,82-0,99), for sum of emergency bed days 0,68 (95%CI:0,52-0,79) and for 
      30-days emergency readmissions 0,72 (95%CI: 0,41-1,24). RRs were 2,3 (95%CI: 
      2,02-2,55) and 0,9 (95%CI: 0,68-1,20) for planned and emergency outpatient visits 
      respectively. The RR for death at 3 months was 0,39 (95% CI: 0,22-0,70) and 0,57 
      (95% CI: 0,34-0,94) at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Compared with propensity score matched 
      controls, the care process of frail multi-morbid elderly who received the PACT 
      intervention had a reduced risk of high-level emergency care, increased use of 
      low-level planned care, and substantially reduced mortality risk. Further study of 
      process differences between groups is warranted to understand the genesis of these 
      results better. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02541474 ),

AB  - Sarcopenia, the progressive and generalised loss of muscle mass and 
      strength/function, is a major health issue in older adults given its high prevalence 
      and burdensome clinical implications. Over the years, this condition has been 
      endorsed as a marker for discriminating biological from chronological age. However, 
      the absence of a unified operational definition has hampered its full appreciation 
      by healthcare providers, researchers and policy-makers. In addition to this unsolved 
      debate, the complexity of musculoskeletal ageing represents a major challenge to the 
      identification of clinically meaningful biomarkers. Here, we illustrate the 
      advantages of biomarker discovery procedures in muscle ageing based on multivariate 
      methodologies as an alternative approach to traditional single-marker strategies. 
      The rationale, design and methods of the "BIOmarkers associated with Sarcopenia and 
      PHysical frailty in EldeRly pErsons" (BIOSPHERE) study are described as an 
      application of a multi-marker strategy for the development of biomarkers for the 
      newly operationalised Physical Frailty & Sarcopenia condition.

TI  - Critical Illness and the Frailty Syndrome: Mechanisms and Potential Therapeutic 
      Targets.
PG  - 1545-1555
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004792 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a syndrome characterized by decreased reserves across multiple 
      physiologic systems resulting in functional limitations and vulnerability to new 
      stressors. Physical frailty develops over years in community-dwelling older adults 
      but presents or worsens within days in the intensive care unit (ICU) because common 
      mechanisms governing age-related physical frailty are often exacerbated by critical 
      illness. The hallmark of physical frailty is a combined loss of muscle mass, force, 
      and endurance. About one-third of ICU patients have frailty before hospitalization, 
      which increases their risk for both short- and long-term disability and mortality. 
      While there are several valid ways to measure clinical frailty in patients before or 
      after an ICU admission, the mechanistic underpinnings of frailty in critically ill 
      patients and ICU survivors have not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, 
      therapeutic interventions to treat frailty during and after time in the ICU are 
      lacking. In this narrative review, we examine studies that identify potential 
      biological mechanisms underlying the development and propagation of physical frailty 
      in both aging and critical illness (eg, inflammation, mitochondrial myopathy, and 
      neuroendocrinopathy). We discuss specific aspects of these frailty mechanisms in 
      older adults, critically ill patients, and ICU survivors that may represent 
      therapeutic targets. Consistent with complexity underlying frailty, this syndrome is 
      unlikely to result from an excess of a single harmful mediator or deficit of a 
      single protective mediator. Rather, frailty occurs in the presence of an 
      incompletely understood state of multisystem dysregulation. We further describe 
      knowledge gaps that warrant clinical and translational research in frailty and 
      critical care with an overall goal of developing effective frailty treatments in 
      critically ill patients and ICU survivors.

TI  - Use of Emergency Departments by Frail Elderly Patients: Temporal Patterns and Case 
      Complexity.
PG  - 215-223
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190830 [doi]
AB  - Emergency department (ED) care for frail elderly patients is associated with an 
      increased use of resources due to their complex medical needs and frequently 
      difficult psycho-social situation. To better target their needs with specially 
      trained staff, it is vital to determine the times during which these particular 
      patients present to the ED. Recent research was inconclusive regarding this question 
      and the applied methods were limited to coarse time windows. Moreover, there is 
      little research on time variation of frail ED patients' case complexity. This study 
      examines differences in arrival rates for frail vs. non-frail patients in detail and 
      compares case complexity in frail patients within vs. outside of regular GP working 
      hours. Arrival times and case variables (admission rate, ED length of stay [LOS], 
      triage level and comorbidities) were extracted from the EHR of an ED in an urban 
      German teaching hospital. We employed Poisson time series regression to determine 
      patterns in hourly arrival rates over the week. Frail elderly patients presented 
      more likely to the ED during already high frequented hours, especially at midday and 
      in the afternoon. Case complexity for frail patients was significantly higher 
      compared to non-frail patients, but varied marginally in time only with respect to 
      triage level and ED LOS. The results suggest that frailty-attuned emergency care 
      should be available in EDs during the busiest hours. Based on EHR data, hospitals 
      thus can tailor their staff needs.

TI  - Cognitive function in Prefrail and frail community-dwelling older adults in China.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s12877-019-1056-8 [doi]
LID - 53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical frailty, characterized by reduced physiologic complexity and 
      ability to cope with stressors, is closely associated with cognitive impairment, 
      which increases the risk of poor clinical outcomes. To better capture the 
      association between frailty and cognitive impairment, a new construct, cognitive 
      frailty, has been proposed. Cognitive frailty is a clinical condition characterized 
      by the simultaneous presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment. There is 
      little evidence on the relationship between physical frailty and cognition, as well 
      as cognitive frailty, in Chinese older adults. We aimed to elucidate whether 
      physical frailty is associated with cognitive impairment in an older Chinese 
      population. METHODS: Data were obtained from the China Comprehensive Geriatric 
      Assessment Study. The sample comprised 3202 community-dwelling adults, aged 60 years 
      and older, from seven Chinese cities. Physical frailty was assessed using a 
      modified, four-item version of the Fried criteria, according to frailty phenotype. 
      Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of physical frailty, prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and 
      cognitive frailty was 9.9, 33.9, 7.5, and 2.3%, respectively (weighted: 8.8, 33.8, 
      6.5, and 2.0%). The prevalence of the combination of prefrail/frail and cognitive 
      impairment was 5.1% (weighted 4.5%). Frail participants performed worse on global 
      cognition and all cognitive domains than robust and prefrail participants. The MMSE 
      total score was positively correlated with walking speed and negatively correlated 
      with age and frailty. A multivariate logistic regression revealed that after 
      adjusting for age, gender, education level, living area, and chronic diseases, 
      frailty, exhaustion, slowness, and inactivity were significantly associated with 
      poor global cognition. CONCLUSIONS: The standard prevalence of physical frailty, 
      prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and cognitive frailty in community-dwelling older 
      adults in China was 8.8, 33.8, 6.5, and 2.0%, respectively. Frailty, exhaustion, 
      slowness, and inactivity were significantly associated with poor global cognition.

AB  - Frailty encompasses several domains (i.e., metabolic, physical, cognitive). The 
      multisystem derangements underlying frailty pathophysiology, its phenotypic 
      heterogeneity, and the fluctuations of individuals across severity states have 
      hampered a comprehensive appraisal of the condition. Circulating biomarkers emerged 
      as an alleged tool for capturing this complexity and, as proxies for organismal 
      metabolic changes, may hold the advantages of: 1) supporting diagnosis, 2) tracking 
      the progression, 3) assisting healthcare professionals in clinical and therapeutic 
      decision-making, and 4) verifying the efficacy of an intervention before measurable 
      clinical manifestations occur. Among available analytical tools, metabolomics are 
      able to identify and quantify the (ideally) whole repertoire of small molecules in 
      biological matrices (i.e., cells, tissues, and biological fluids). Results of 
      metabolomics analysis may define the final output of genome-environment interactions 
      at the individual level. This entire collection of metabolites is called 
      "metabolome" and is highly dynamic. Here, we discuss how monitoring the dynamics of 
      metabolic profiles may provide a read-out of the environmental and clinical 
      disturbances affecting cell homeostasis in frailty-associated conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the major threats looming over the growing older population is 
      frailty. It is a distinctive health state characterised by increased vulnerability 
      to internal and external stressors. Although the presence of frailty is well 
      acknowledged, its concept and operationalisation are hampered by the extraordinary 
      phenotypical and biological complexity. Yet, a widely accepted conception is needed 
      to offer tailored policies and approaches. The ADVANTAGE Group aims to analyse the 
      diverse frailty concepts to uncover the essence of frailty as a basis for a shared 
      understanding. METHOD: A systematic literature review was performed on frailty 
      concepts and definitions from 2010 onwards. Eligible publications were reviewed 
      using concept analysis that led to the extraction of text data for the themes 
      "definition", "attributes", "antecedents", "consequences", and "related concepts". 
      Qualitative description was used to further analyse the extracted text passages, 
      leading to inductively developed categories on the essence of frailty. RESULTS: 78 
      publications were included in the review, and 996 relevant text passages were 
      extracted for analysis. Five components constituted a comprehensive definition: 
      vulnerability, genesis, features, characteristics, and adverse outcomes. Each 
      component is described in more detail by a set of defining and explanatory criteria. 
      An underlying functional perspective of health or its impairments is most compatible 
      with the entity of frailty. DISCUSSION: The recent findings facilitate a focus on 
      the relevant building blocks that define frailty. They point to the commonalities of 
      the diverse frailty concepts and definitions. Based on these components, a widely 
      accepted broad definition of frailty comes into range.

PG  - 317-324
LID - 10.1111/odi.12647 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To propose the application of the concept of geriatric syndrome for 
      common geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions and to suggest the necessity of 
      developing effective evaluation methods for oral and maxillofacial frailty. DESIGN: 
      The concepts of frailty and geriatric syndrome based on multi-morbidity and 
      polypharmacy were applied to five common geriatric oral medicinal dysfunctional 
      problems: salivary gland hypofunction (dry mouth), chronic oral mucosal pain 
      disorders (burning mouth symptoms), taste disorders (taste disturbances), swallowing 
      disorders (dysphagia), and oral and maxillofacial movement disorders (oromandibular 
      dyskinesia and dystonia). RESULTS: Each of the dysfunctions is caused by various 
      kinds of diseases and/or conditions and medications, thus the concept of geriatric 
      syndrome could be applied. These dysfunctions, suggested as components of oral and 
      maxillofacial geriatric syndrome, are associated and interacted with each other in a 
      complexity of vicious cycle. The resulting functional impairments caused by this 
      syndrome can cause oral and maxillofacial frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric oral and 
      maxillofacial dysfunctions could be better appreciated in the context of geriatric 
      syndrome. The development of effective methods for evaluating the severity of these 
      dysfunctions and the resulting frailty is essential.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The number and the complexity of procedures taking place at 
      ambulatory surgery centers is steadily increasing. The rate at which medically 
      complex patients, including those with baseline neurocognitive disorders, are 
      undergoing ambulatory procedures is seeing a concurrent rise. Given the significant 
      physical and psychological stress associated with surgery even in the ambulatory 
      setting, it is essential to evaluate the ability of a patient to acclimate to 
      stressful triggers in order to assess risk of subpar medical outcomes and increased 
      mortality. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the assessment of both 
      cognition and frailty and describe the implementation of these tools in the 
      ambulatory surgery setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent Society for Perioperative 
      Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) recommendations for evaluating at-risk 
      patients focus on a two-pronged approach that encompasses screening for both 
      impaired cognition and frailty. Screening should ideally occur as early as possible, 
      but tools such as the Mini-Cog examination and FRAIL Questionnaire are efficient and 
      effective even when used the day of surgery in high-risk patients. SUMMARY: The 
      recognition of at-risk patients using standardized screening and the use of this 
      assessment to guide perioperative monitoring and interventions is essential for 
      optimizing outcomes for the complex ambulatory surgery patient.

AB  - Neuropsychological tests, besides reflecting the cognitive reserves and deficits of 
      the tested individual, might also be differently affected by his/her underlying 
      biological asset. In this context, the construct of frailty may offer an opportunity 
      for better weighting the results of traditional tests. We evaluated the 
      relationships between a set neuropsychological measures and a 35-item Frailty Index 
      (FI). The role played by the FI in the relationship between neuropsychological tests 
      and global cognition was also explored. Data from the first neurological and 
      neuropsychological assessments of 79 subjects attending our university memory clinic 
      because complaining cognitive disturbances were considered for the present analysis. 
      A statistically significant correlation between FI and Trail Making Test-B was 
      observed (Spearman's rho 0.33; p = 0.02). The relationship between the performance 
      at the Rey Complex Figure and global cognition (as measured by the Mini Mental State 
      Examination) was influenced by the FI. In fact, participants with higher FI levels 
      had a weakened association linking constructional/visual memory abilities and 
      general cognitive functioning. The interpretation of the neuropsychological 
      assessment can be biased by the frailty status of the tested individual. It can be 
      hypothesized the need of developing new models of correction, that may better 
      reflect the person's biology and complexity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic marker in 
      surgical populations. The effects of frailty on outcomes after mitral valve 
      replacement (MVR) is less clear given the inherent complexity of this patient 
      population. We evaluated the influences of frailty on outcomes and readmission rates 
      after MVR. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing isolated MVR were queried from the 
      National Readmissions Database from 2010 to 2014. Frailty was defined using the 
      Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator, a 
      validated instrument developed for use in health administrative data. Multivariable 
      logistic regression was used to determine hospital- and patient-level risk factors 
      for readmission, postoperative complications, and death. RESULTS: Among 50,410 
      patients who underwent MVR, 7.9% met frailty criteria. Frail patients were more 
      likely to be older, have nonprivate insurance, an index admission from the emergency 
      department, and teaching hospital care (all P < .001). Frail patients had 
      significantly more postoperative complications (77% vs 47%, P < .001), more 
      discharges to a facility (50% vs 21%, P < .001), and higher in-hospital mortality 
      (12% vs 4%, P < .001). Index hospitalization costs were almost doubled in frail 
      patients, and of those who survived to discharge, 30-day readmissions were more 
      frequent (28% vs 20%, P < .001). Frailty independently increased the risk of index 
      hospitalization composite complications (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.28; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 2.61-4.12), in-hospital mortality (AOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 
      1.90-2.92), and 30-day readmission (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.20-1.78). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Frailty is an independent predictor of morbidity, death, and increased costs after 
      MVR. Frailty metrics should be increasingly understood among patients requiring 
      mitral valve intervention as percutaneous approaches for intervention become 
      increasingly used.

AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Frailty is a measure of decreased physiologic reserve that 
      has been associated with adverse outcomes in older surgical patients. We aimed to 
      measure the association of preoperative frailty with outcomes in patients undergoing 
      sinonasal cancer surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We 
      identified 5,346 patients in the Nationwide Readmissions Database undergoing 
      sinonasal cancer surgery from 2010 to 2014. Frailty was defined using the Johns 
      Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator. Multivariate 
      regression was used to analyze the association of frailty with postoperative 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Frailty was present in 7.4% of patients. Frailty was a 
      significant independent predictor of intensive care unit-level complications (odds 
      ratio [OR]: 4.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.95-7.93; P < .001) and nonhome 
      discharge (OR: 3.07; 95% CI: 1.68-5.60; P < .001). Compared to nonfrail patients, 
      frail patients had threefold longer median length of stay (12 days vs. 4 days; P < 
      .001) and more than twofold higher median hospital costs ($44,408 vs. $18,660; P < 
      .001). Frailty outperformed advanced comorbidity (defined as Charlson-Deyo score 
      ≥3), age ≥80 years, and markers of surgical complexity (e.g., skull base/orbit 
      involvement, flap reconstruction, neck dissection) in predicting serious 
      complications, nonhome discharge, length of stay, and hospital costs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Frailty appears to have a stronger and more consistent association with adverse 
      outcomes and increased resource utilization after sinonasal cancer surgery than age 
      or comorbidity index. This information may be used in surgical risk stratification 
      and can guide strategies to prevent or mitigate adverse events in this high-risk 
      group. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 130:290-296, 2020.

      move from complexity to simplicity?
PG  - 237-239
LID - 10.1007/s40520-017-0887-4 [doi]
AB  - Due to aging of the world population, older patients accessing health services are 
      becoming continuously more frequent. This has increased the interest in assessing 
      frailty and vulnerability in all specialties and general medicine. Although the term 
      frailty has been recognized for over 30 years, there is not yet a universally 
      recognized definition, and different care providers assess frailty and vulnerability 
      with dissimilar tools, from very complex to very simple validated scales. Being 
      treated with respect and dignity at the right time and place is the key message, as 
      well as after undergoing a global evaluation both in urgency/emergency and in 
      programmed surgery for all older surgical patients. Filling the gap will improve the 
      results of any clinical intervention, both medical and surgical. Anesthesiologists, 
      surgeons, hospitalists, and any member of the team of care providers must be trained 
      into geriatric syndromes.

      aneurysm repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists surrounding gender outcome disparity and abdominal 
      aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Previous reports have demonstrated worse outcomes for 
      women undergoing open aneurysm repair (OAR); however, these differences are less 
      evident with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Epidemiologic studies have 
      documented that women score higher on most frailty assessment scales but 
      paradoxically have longer life expectancy compared to men. The interaction of 
      gender/frailty and the influence on outcomes and practice patterns surrounding EVAR 
      and OAR is poorly described. This analysis characterizes the association of 
      frailty/sex interactions on mortality as well as patient selection surrounding 
      elective AAA repair in the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative. 
      METHODS: All elective infrarenal AAA (EVAR + OAR; 2003-2017) cases were queried from 
      the Vascular Quality Initiative database. Each patient was assigned a previously 
      published modified frailty index (mFI) score derived from comorbidity and 
      preoperative functional status data. Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for 
      statistically significant covariates, including procedural complexity, determined 
      associations within full models and sex-stratified models. RESULTS: A total of 
      20,750 elective AAA cases were analyzed (EVAR 15,893 [77%]; OAR 4857 [23%]). 
      Thirty-day mortality for EVAR and OAR was 0.7% (n = 115) and 3.5% (n = 169), 
      respectively. Patients who died were significantly more likely to be older (EVAR, 78 
      vs 73 years; OAR, 74 vs 69 years; P < .0001), have larger AAA diameters (EVAR, 59 vs 
      56 mm; P = .005; OAR, 62 vs 59 mm; P = .001), higher mFI scores (EVAR, 3.2 vs 2.4; 
      OAR, 3.1 vs 2.2; P < .0001), and be of female sex (EVAR hazard ratio = 1.66 [95% 
      confidence interval, 1.10-2.52]; P = .007; OAR-1.43 [1.02-1.99]; P = .003). 
      Significant differences in the gender distribution of frailty scores among EVAR 
      patients were evident (mean mFI: male 2.42 vs female 2.34; P = .02), but no 
      difference was detected for OAR (male 2.17 vs female 2.22; P = .38). The mFI was a 
      strong independent predictor of mortality (30 days: EVAR hazard ratio = 1.36 
      [1.22-1.53] and OAR 1.46 [1.32-1.60]; 1 year: EVAR 1.32 [1.25-1.39] and OAR-1.38 
      [1.28-1.48]). There was no interaction between mFI and gender on the association 
      with mortality. Across frailty strata, male patients were nearly twofold more likely 
      to undergo either elective EVAR or OAR for an AAA below recommended minimum diameter 
      thresholds (male, <5.5 cm; female, <5.0 cm). Greater mFI score did not alter OAR 
      selection but was associated with less frequent EVAR of small AAA. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Given the strong association between frailty and postoperative mortality, mFI can be 
      used as a predictive tool to aid in surgical planning of patients undergoing 
      elective AAA repair. While mFI can predict postoperative mortality for both men and 
      women, it does not account for the survival disparity between sexes, and further 
      research is warranted to explain this difference. There appear to be significant 
      gender differences in patient selection based on current Society for Vascular 
      Surgery-endorsed treatment thresholds that may have important implications on the 
      appropriateness of AAA care delivery nationally.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Frailty, a state of decreased physiological reserve, increases the risk 
      of adverse outcomes. There is no standard tool for frailty during perioperative 
      period. Autonomic dysfunction, an underlying process in frailty, could result in 
      hemodynamic fluctuations. Complexity, the physiological adaptability of a system can 
      quantify these fluctuations. The authors hypothesized that complexity could be a 
      marker for frailty and explored their relationship in cardiac surgical patients. 
      DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Single-center teaching hospital. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixty-four adult patients undergoing cardiac 
      surgery. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Preoperative 
      beat-to-beat systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) time 
      series were obtained. Complexity indices were calculated using multiscale entropy 
      (MSE) analysis. Frailty was assessed from: age >70 years, body mass index <18.5, 
      hematocrit <35%, albumin <3.4 g/dL, and creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. The association 
      between complexity indices and frailty was explored by logistic regression and 
      predictive ability by C-statistics. In total, 190 (52%) patients had frailty. The 
      complexity index (MSE(Σ)) median (quartile 1, quartile 3) of SAP and MAP time series 
      decreased significantly in frail patients (SAP: 8.32 [7.27, 9.24] v 9.13 [8.00, 
      9.72], p < 0.001 and MAP: 8.56 [7.56; 9.27] v 9.18 [8.26; 9.83], p < 0.001). MSE (Σ) 
      demonstrated a fair predictive ability of frailty (C-statistic: SAP 0.62 and MAP 
      0.64). CONCLUSION: Preoperative BP complexity indices correlate and predict frailty. 
      Impaired autonomic control is the underlying mechanism to explain this finding. A 
      simple automated measure of preoperative BP complexity in the surgeon's office has 
      the potential to reliably assess frailty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex 
      care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare 
      nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of 
      identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity 
      study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation 
      algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of 
      the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying 
      subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and 
      complexity appears to be most relevant. METHODS: The study will rely on a 
      prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of 
      individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients 
      of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals 
      free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC 
      assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. 
      Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups 
      will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate 
      the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve 
      to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and 
      complexity appears to be the most relevant. DISCUSSION: The expected results of the 
      fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity 
      scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by 
      homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the 
      health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting 
      the best care and quality of life for aged citizens. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

COIS- The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Relevant to this 
      statement is a clarification regarding the involvement of imad in the study. Imad is 
      domiciled in Canton Geneva, Switzerland; it is a public autonomous institution that 
      operates under the supervision of the State Council of Canton, Geneva. Cantonal 
      (LIMAD - k1 07, LSDOM - k1 06 and RSDom k1 06.01) and federal laws (LAMal) regulate 
      imad. Its basic financing is predominantly Swiss and public. Projects conducted at 
      imad are non-commercial and of public interest. Also relevant is the fact that the 
      interRAI RAI-HC instrument is used for research purposes, royalty free. Thus, no 
      conflict of interest with the interRAI Consortium exists.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to subject the clinical classification of frailty to 
      scrutiny through exploring, via a phenomenological lens, the lived experiences of 
      older people who meet the objective, or clinical, criteria of frailty. Drawing on a 
      range of published research that explores the heterogeneous experiences of embodied 
      ageing, the paper highlights the continuity of phenomenological structures of 
      experience across successful ageing, normal ageing and frailty, suggesting the 
      permeability and contestability of the boundaries between them and highlighting the 
      complexity of health and illness in old age. Such data suggests a need to question 
      the perception of frailty as something both apart from 'normal' ageing, and 
      constitutive of frailed or failed ageing, and challenges the construction of the 
      third age/fourth age polarity that underpins much of the meaning accorded to old age 
      today.

AB  - In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain 
      approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in 
      general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected 
      that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of 
      increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical 
      performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty 
      and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of 
      complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The 
      increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease 
      and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent 
      physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a 
      dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with 
      the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core 
      to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic 
      technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving 
      quality of care and quality of life is described.

TI  - Elderly with remaining teeth report less frailty and better quality of life than 
      edentulous elderly: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 526-536
LID - 10.1111/odi.12644 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess oral status and self-reported oral health in community-living 
      elderly and to determine differences between relevant subgroups of oral status 
      (remaining teeth, edentulous, implant-retained overdentures) and case complexity 
      (robust, frail, complex care needs). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      descriptive study, 1325 Dutch community-living elderly (≥75 years of age) were asked 
      to complete validated questionnaires on frailty, activities of daily living (ADL), 
      complexity of care needs, and QoL. Data on oral status, self-reported oral health, 
      dental care, general health, and medication use were assessed. Differences between 
      relevant subgroups were determined. RESULTS: Data of 1026 (77%) elderly (median 
      80 years, IQR 77-84) were analyzed: 39% had remaining teeth, 51% were edentulous, 
      and 10% had implant-supported overdentures. Elderly with complex care needs 
      (n = 225, 22%) and frail elderly (n = 217, 21%) were more often edentulous and 
      reported more oral problems than robust elderly (n = 584, 57%). Elderly persons with 
      remaining teeth were less frail, had better QoL and ADL, and used fewer medicines 
      than edentulous elderly. Elderly with implant-supported overdentures performed 
      better on frailty and QoL than edentulous elderly with conventional dentures. 
      CONCLUSION: Community-living elderly commonly suffer from oral health problems, in 
      particular elderly with complex care needs. QoL, ADL, and general health are higher 
      among community-living elderly with remaining teeth and implant-supported 
      overdentures than in edentulous elderly.

TI  - A Frailty-Based Risk Score Predicts Morbidity and Mortality After Elective 
      Endovascular Repair of Descending Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has expanded access to 
      descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA) repair particularly for elderly and frail 
      patients. This high-risk population has limited long-term overall survival, such 
      that appropriate patient selection is required to optimize patient benefit and 
      resource utilization. Our objective is to develop and validate a frailty-based, 
      procedure-specific risk score for patients undergoing elective TEVAR for DTAA. 
      METHODS: Patients undergoing nonemergent TEVAR for DTAA during 2005-2016 were 
      identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Those with 
      concurrent cardiac or open aortic surgery, abdominal visceral intervention, or Zone 
      0 deployment were excluded. Patients were randomly divided between derivation and 
      validation samples. The primary outcome was 30-day major adverse events (MAE), 
      including mortality and major systemic complications. Using the derivation cohort, 
      variables associated with MAE were identified by univariable analyses. Those with 
      P < 0.05 were included in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Independent 
      procedure-specific and frailty-related risk factors for MAE were used to develop a 
      pragmatic score to assess risk for TEVAR. RESULTS: Overall, 1,784 patients were 
      included. 14% of the derivation patients had MAE (14% major complications, 4% 
      mortality). Independent risk factors for MAE were primarily associated with markers 
      of frailty and TEVAR extent and complexity and included functional dependence (OR 
      2.9, 95% CI 1.6-5.4), pulmonary disease (1.6, 1.1-2.4), thoracoabdominal extent (2.2 
      (1.4-3.4), need for iliac access (2.1, 1.1-3.8), and Zone I or II deployment (OR 
      1.7, 1.1-2.5). According to their respective beta coefficients, each variable was 
      assigned a single point. Based on total points, patients were stratified as low- (0 
      points), intermediate- (1 point), or high-risk (≥2 points), with stepwise increases 
      in mortality (0%, 4%, and 9%) and major complications (7%, 11%, and 23%) between 
      strata. Validation patients had similar characteristics, risk strata distribution, 
      and outcomes as the derivation patients, and the risk model had similar performance 
      in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of frailty and procedure complexity strongly 
      predict MAE after TEVAR for DTAA and can improve patient selection by enabling 
      patient and procedure-specific risk stratification. While TEVAR is safe in low-risk 
      patients, intermediate-risk patients warrant careful discussion of the risks and 
      benefits of aortic intervention; under certain circumstances, high-risk patients may 
      not benefit. Further study is required to define the association between frailty and 
      long-term outcomes.

TI  - Pre-Frail Multicomponent Training Intervention project for complexity of biological 
      signals, functional capacity and cognition improvement in pre-frail older adults: A 
      blinded randomized controlled study protocol.
PG  - 684-689
LID - 10.1111/ggi.13672 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Frailty syndrome is related to decreased physiological complexity, functional 
      capacity and cognition. Physical exercise has been suggested to slow down and 
      reverse this syndrome. However, evidence of its effectiveness is not as 
      straightforward as conventionally admitted, as there is a lack of trials with 
      rigorous methodology. The purpose of this study was to describe the Pre-Frail 
      Multicomponent Training Intervention protocol. METHODS: Cardiovascular, motor 
      control and neuromuscular systems of pre-frail older adults will be assessed by 
      measuring the complexity of the output of these systems. Functional capacity and 
      cognition will be assessed by specific tools. A 16-week training protocol will be 
      carried out on three alternate days, with 60-min sessions, and combining aerobic, 
      muscle strength, flexibility and balance exercises. The objective of this 
      intervention is to improve the cardiovascular, motor control and neuromuscular 
      systems, as well as functional capacity and cognition of pre-frail older adults. The 
      assessment of these systems will be carried out using gold standard devices. 
      RESULTS: The results of the present study might allow clinical and functional 
      support for the evaluation of the variables analyzed. CONCLUSION: This protocol is 
      easily reproducible and requires low-cost materials, thus the Pre-Frail 
      Multicomponent Training Intervention could be a therapeutic strategy for pre-frail 
      older adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 684-689.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interhospital patient transfer (IHT) of patients is common and accounts 
      for a significant portion of health care costs, yet the variables driving 
      neurosurgical IHT have not been systematically described. We analyzed variables that 
      distinguished spine surgery patients who underwent IHT from patients who did not 
      undergo IHT to report on the effect of frailty on IHT. METHODS: A retrospective 
      chart review was performed to collect data on consecutive patients undergoing spinal 
      procedures during 2015-2017. IHT patients were identified and compared with 
      non-interhospital patient transfer (n-IHT) patients to identify factors that 
      distinguished the 2 patient groups using multivariate regression analysis. Studied 
      variables included case complexity, frailty (modified frailty index), age, insurance 
      status, and baseline demographic variables. Postoperative outcomes affected by 
      transfer status were identified in binary regression analysis. RESULTS: During 
      2015-2017, there were 595 n-IHT and 76 IHT spine surgery patients (N = 671). 
      Increased frailty (modified frailty index ≥3; odds ratio = 2.4, P = 0.01) and 
      increased spine surgery complexity (spine surgery complexity score ≥2; odds ratio = 
      2.57, P = 0.002) were independent risk factors associated with IHT. IHT was an 
      independent risk factor for increased hospital length of stay and increased 
      postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo scale; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IHT 
      patients comprise a more frail and surgically complex surgical spine population 
      compared with n-IHT patients. IHT was also an independent risk factor for increased 
      complications and length of stay after spine surgery. Patients' insurance status and 
      age did not distinguish between IHT and n-IHT groups. This is the first report in 
      any specialty to demonstrate increasing frailty is associated with IHT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the relationship between frailty and complicated 
      postoperative courses, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and non-home 
      discharge, in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (OC) undergoing primary 
      debulking surgery (PDS) for curative intent. METHODS: Patients were identified from 
      a retrospectively collected database at a single institution between 
      1/1/2003-12/31/2011. A frailty index was derived from 30 items representing 
      comorbidities and activities of daily living, each scored as 0, 0.5, or 1, and 
      calculated as the total summated score divided by the total number of non-missing 
      items. Frailty was defined as an index ≥0.15. Associations with binary outcomes were 
      assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 535 patients met inclusion 
      criteria. Frail patients were older, mean age 67.8 versus 63.2 years (p < 0.001), 
      but there was no difference in grade, stage, or serous histology. Almost half of the 
      frail patients (48.9%, 64/131) were admitted to the ICU compared to 20.5% (83/404) 
      of non-frail patients. Frailty remained an independent predictor of 30-day ICU 
      admission (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.20, 95% CI: 2.03-5.06) in a multivariable 
      model including age, preoperative albumin, surgical complexity, and residual 
      disease. Frail patients were also more likely to have a non-home discharge (24.2% 
      vs. 7.0%). Frailty independently predicted non-home discharge (aOR 2.58, 95% CI: 
      1.35-4.93) after adjusting for age, BMI, and stage. CONCLUSION: Frailty is a 
      measurable, objective clinical syndrome that has impact on postoperative outcomes in 
      advanced OC and should be considered when decision-making about treatments and 
      counseling patients.

AB  - The Reported Edmonton Frail Scale was used to describe the prevalence of frailty in 
      an acute general medical unit. The relationship between frailty, discharge 
      destination, mortality and length of hospital stay was explored. We found that age 
      was associated with frailty, and frailty correlated to an increasing length of 
      hospital stay. Significantly, frailty was associated with complexity in discharge, 
      and this process created a longer length of hospital stay.

AB  - Mechanisms of aging predispose to cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as to 
      aggregate health challenges. For older adults, CVD is likely to exist in combination 
      with comorbid conditions, disability, polypharmacy, falling risks, and body 
      composition changes. These other dimensions of health result in cumulative weakening 
      with greater clinical complexity that confound basic precepts of CVD presentation, 
      prognosis, and treatments. A convenient operational tool is needed to gauge this 
      age-related vulnerability such that it can be integrated in the evaluation and 
      treatment of CVD. Frailty is a concept that is neither disease- nor age-specific, 
      but is used to characterize the reserve that a person has available to tolerate 
      stresses associated with aging, disease, and even therapy. Frailty arises from 
      specific biological mechanisms in association with cumulative physiological 
      decrements, psychosocial stresses, and physical impairments. Performance-based and 
      survey tools have been developed and tested to measure frailty. Although different 
      frailty tools vary in practicality, measured domains, and precise applications, all 
      are useful in identifying risks that commonly accrue with age. Although comparisons 
      between frailty tools are ongoing and sometimes even controversial, the rationale to 
      integrate routine use of frailty screening as part of routine care is relatively 
      straightforward and easy to envision. Frailty assessment applied as a vital sign 
      (for standard maintenance and evaluation of new symptoms) enhances perspectives of 
      risk, decision-making, and opportunities for tailored CVD management.

TI  - Frailty Clinical Phenotype: A Physical and Cognitive Point of View.
PG  - 55-63
LID - 10.1159/000382061 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is recognized as a clinical geriatric syndrome used to describe the weakest 
      or most vulnerable older adults. Although the term frailty is commonly used in 
      clinical practice, and the theoretical phenomenon is well accepted, it remains an 
      evolving concept that lacks a universally accepted definition and specific 
      diagnostic criteria. Different perspectives on frailty have led to two distinct 
      viewpoints of this phenomenon in the literature. The first describes the phenomenon 
      based solely on physical attributes and capabilities. In contrast, more recent 
      perspectives describe the phenomenon in broader, multidimensional terms by 
      incorporating the concept of cognitive frailty. In support of this view, there is 
      increasing evidence that consideration of both cognitive and physical factors can 
      better improve the ability to predict adverse health outcomes among frail older 
      adults over physical factors alone. The recent recognition of the importance of 
      cognitive factors has increased the complexity of this phenomenon and difficulty in 
      developing a consensus definition. To add to this challenge, frailty can present in 
      different stages of severity (from mild to severe), and there appears to be a 
      dynamic relationship between these stages. Despite these challenges, a consensus on 
      an international definition of frailty including physical and cognitive criteria is 
      essential in order to advance research and treatment of this condition.

TI  - Multimorbidity: will it stand the test of time?
PG  - 6-8
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afx159 [doi]
AB  - The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its 
      use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have 
      more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The 
      motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is 
      to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
      multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas 
      that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical 
      problems.However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four 
      reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, 
      focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, 
      (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards 
      promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds 
      little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large 
      segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We 
      argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better 
      with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing 
      health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and 
      researchers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adaptive postural control can be impaired in the presence of frailty 
      syndrome, given that this condition causes homeostatic dysregulation in 
      physiological systems. OBJECTIVES: To compare the center of pressure (CoP) 
      displacements of non-frail, pre-frail, and frail elderly subjects in the standing 
      position before and after postural transition of sitting and rising from a chair, 
      using linear and nonlinear methods. METHODS: Forty-two elderly subjects were divided 
      into 3 groups: non-frail (n=15), pre-frail (n=15), and frail (n=12). The CoP 
      displacements in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) direction in the 
      orthostatic position, 30s before and after sitting down and rising from a chair, 
      were evaluated by means of linear measurements (root mean square (RMS), amplitude, 
      and total average speed) and nonlinear measurements (corrected approximate entropy - 
      CApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and complexity index (CI) and its normalized 
      versions. RESULTS: After sitting and rising, there was an increase in RMS in the ML 
      direction in all groups and in the AP direction in the non-frail and frail groups. 
      The frail group showed no reduction in entropy values in either direction, and the 
      pre-frail group showed no reduction in the ML direction. CONCLUSIONS: The results of 
      this study indicate that, in the presence of frailty syndrome, the organization of 
      CoP displacements does not show less regularity after sitting and rising from a 
      chair, reflecting a possible impairment of the integration of the systems involved 
      in postural control.

TI  - Health-Related Problems and Changes After 1 Year as Assessed With the Geriatric ICF

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence, severity, and change in health-related problems 
      in a sample of older adults who received individual care and support from Embrace, 
      for the whole sample, per subgroup based on complexity of care needs and frailty, 
      and for those who had at baseline a health-related problem. DESIGN: A 
      pretest-posttest study with assessments at baseline and after 12 months. SETTING: 
      Community. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults aged 75 years and older (N=136) who are frail 
      (n=56) or who have complex care needs (n=80). INTERVENTION: Participants received 
      care and support by Embrace, a person-centered and integrated care service for 
      community-living older adults supporting them to age in place. A multidisciplinary 
      team provided care and support, with intensity depending on the older adults' risk 
      profile. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Health-related problems as perceived by older adults 
      and measured with the Geriatric International Classification of Functioning, 
      Disability and Health Core Set. RESULTS: Health-related problems were related to 6 
      coherent clusters: (1) Mental Functions; (2) Physical Health; (3) Mobility; (4) 
      Personal Care; (5) Nutrition; and (6) Support. The most prevalent and most severe 
      problems at baseline were related to Mental Functions and Mobility. Changes in the 
      prevalence of problems after 12 months varied. Severity scores decreased or remained 
      stable, except for Mobility items which showed a varying changing pattern in 
      participants with complex care needs. Prevalence and severity of problems for those 
      with a problem at baseline decreased after 12 months. Frail participants with a 
      problem had higher baseline severity scores than those with complex care needs 
      experiencing a problem, but differences in changes between individuals who are frail 
      and those with complex care needs were small. CONCLUSIONS: The results are 
      encouraging and may indicate that individual, person-centered and integrated care 
      and support from Embrace offers a route to counteracting the decline in physical, 
      cognitive and social functioning associated with aging.

TI  - Frailty: a review of the first decade of research.
PG  - 422-32
LID - 10.1177/1099800412462866 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased 
      vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, 
      hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and 
      operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty 
      development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of 
      conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put 
      forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated 
      pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and 
      exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes 
      of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere 
      length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and 
      metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, 
      lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive 
      decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological 
      approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for 
      future methodological and physiological inquiry.

TI  - Towards a multidimensional healthy ageing phenotype.
PG  - 418-426
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is great interest in developing tools to measure healthy 
      ageing and to identify early stages of health impairment, which may guide the 
      implementation of interventions to prevent or delay the development of disease, 
      disability, and mortality. Here, we review the most recent developments directed to 
      operationalize, and test, definitions of healthy ageing. RECENT FINDINGS: There is 
      lack of consensus about how to define healthy ageing and, unsurprisingly, diversity 
      in the instruments for its measurement. However, progress is being made in 
      describing and in devising tools to capture the healthy ageing phenotype. Attempts 
      to measure healthy ageing have relied primarily on cross-sectional data collected in 
      older people. More recent studies have assessed the healthy ageing phenotype using 
      markers of multiple functional domains and have used longitudinal data to model the 
      dynamics and trajectories of healthy ageing. SUMMARY: Given the complexity of the 
      ageing process, no single measure is able to predict the ageing trajectory. Current 
      attempts to operationalize the healthy ageing phenotype have relied on markers and 
      data from earlier cohort studies and are limited by the tools used to collect data 
      in those studies. Such data are often unsuitable to detect early subtle declines in 
      function and/or are inappropriate for use in younger old adults. Future studies 
      employing more objective and novel markers of healthy ageing are likely to offer 
      opportunities to define and operationalize the healthy ageing phenotype.

TI  - Medication Regimen Complexity In 8 Australian Residential Aged Care Facilities: 
      Impact Of Age, Length Of Stay, Comorbidity, Frailty, And Dependence In Activities Of 
      Daily Living.
PG  - 1783-1795

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore variation in medication regimen complexity in residential aged 
      care facilities (RACFs) according to resident age, length of stay, comorbidity, 
      dementia severity, frailty, and dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs), and 
      compare number of daily administration times and Medication Regimen Complexity Index 
      (MRCI) as measures of regimen complexity. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional 
      analysis of baseline data from the SImplification of Medications Prescribed to 
      Long-tErm care Residents (SIMPLER) cluster-randomized controlled trial. The SIMPLER 
      study recruited 242 residents with at least one medication charted for regular 
      administration from 8 RACFs in South Australia. Comorbidity was assessed using the 
      Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Dementia severity was assessed using the Dementia 
      Severity Rating Scale. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL-NH scale. Dependence in 
      ADLs was assessed using the Katz ADL scale. RESULTS: The median age of participants 
      was 87 years (interquartile range 81-92). Over one-third of participants (n=86, 36%) 
      had 5 or more daily medication administration times. The number of daily 
      administration times and MRCI scores were positively correlated with resident length 
      of stay (r(s)=0.19; 0.27), FRAIL-NH score (r(s)=0.23; 0.34) and dependence in ADLs 
      (r(s)=-0.21; -0.33) (all p<0.01). MRCI was weakly negatively correlated with CCI 
      score (r(s)=-0.16; p=0.013). Neither number of daily administration times nor MRCI 
      score were correlated with age or dementia severity. In multivariate analysis, 
      frailty was associated with number of daily administration times (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 
      1.03-1.24) and MRCI score (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.13-1.41). Dementia severity was 
      inversely associated with both multiple medication administration times (OR: 0.97, 
      95% CI: 0.94-0.99) and high MRCI score (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98). CONCLUSION: 
      Residents with longer lengths of stay, more dependent in ADLs and most frail had the 
      most complex medication regimens and, therefore, may benefit from targeted 
      strategies to reduce medication regimen complexity.

TI  - Complexity of knee extensor torque in patients with frailty syndrome: a 
      cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty syndrome is characterized by a marked reduction in physiological 
      reserves and a clinical state of vulnerability to stress. Torque complexity analysis 
      could reveal changes in the musculoskeletal systems that are the result of having 
      the syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the complexity of 
      submaximal isometric knee extensor torque in frail, pre-frail, and non-frail older 
      adults. A secondary aim was to analyze the torque complexity behavior in different 
      force levels in each group. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. 
      Forty-two older adults were divided into three groups: non-frail (n=15), pre-frail 
      (n=15), and frail (n=12). The data collected included body composition, five times 
      sit-to-stand test, walking speed, and isometric knee extensor torque at 15, 30, and 
      40% of maximal voluntary contraction. The knee extensor torque variability was 
      evaluated by coefficient of variation, and the torque complexity was evaluated by 
      approximate entropy and sample entropy. RESULTS: The frail group presented a 
      reduction in body mass and peak torque value compared to the non-frail group. Also, 
      the frail group showed worse physical performance (on the five times sit-to-stand 
      test and walking speed) compared to the pre-frail and non-frail groups. In addition, 
      the frail older adults showed reduced torque complexity compared to the non-frail 
      group. Finally, the association between torque complexity and force levels remained 
      similar in all groups. CONCLUSION: Torque complexity is reduced in the presence of 
      frailty syndrome.

TI  - Health promotion for mild frailty based on behaviour change: Perceptions of older 
      people and service providers.
PG  - 1333-1343
LID - 10.1111/hsc.12781 [doi]
AB  - Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with 
      health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing 
      progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best 
      and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of 
      this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion 
      based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We 
      conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who 
      received a pilot home-based behaviour change health promotion service, including a 
      dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service 
      in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed 
      and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most 
      participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. 
      Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback 
      were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and 
      knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen 
      by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people 
      with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal 
      setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying 
      proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach 
      to promote health and well-being. Further consideration is needed of the most 
      effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers 
      among people with cognitive impairment.

TI  - Self-reported oral health problems and the ability to organize dental care of 
      community-dwelling elderly aged ≥75 years.
PG  - 185

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear how many community-dwelling elderly (≥75 years) experience 
      oral health problems (e.g. pain, dry mouth, chewing problems) and how they manage 
      their dental care needs. This study aimed to assess self-reported oral health 
      problems in elderly who are frail or have complex care needs, and their ability to 
      organize dental care when reporting oral pain. METHODS: Three thousand five hundred 
      thirty-three community-dwelling elderly participating in the "Embrace" project were 
      asked to complete questionnaires regarding oral status and oral health problems. 
      Frailty was assessed with the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI). Intermed for 
      Elderly Self-Assessment (IM-E-SA) was used to determine complexity of care needs. 
      Next, elderly who reported oral pain were interviewed about their oral pain 
      complaints, their need for dental care, and their ability to organize and receive 
      dental care. For statistical analyses Chi(2)-tests and the one-way ANOVA were used. 
      RESULTS: One thousand six hundred twenty-two elderly (45.9%) completed the 
      questionnaires. Dry mouth (11.7%) and oral pain (6.2%) were most frequently 
      reported. Among the elderly reporting oral pain, most were registered at a local 
      dentist and could go there when needed (84.3%). Robust elderly visited the dentist 
      independently (87%), frail (55.6%) and complex (26.9%) elderly more often required 
      assistance from caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Dry mouth and oral pain are most reported 
      oral health problems among community-dwelling elderly. Elderly with complex care 
      needs report most oral health problems. In case an elderly seeks dental treatment to 
      alleviate an oral pain complaint, most elderly in this study were able to organize 
      dental care and transport to the dentist. Frail and complex elderly often need 
      assistance from caregivers to visit the dentist. Therefore caretakers should keep in 
      mind that when frailty progresses, visiting a dentist may become more and more 
      difficult and the risk for poor oral health increases.

AB  - Providing care to the elderly patient with syncope poses problems that are unusual 
      in their complexity. The differential diagnosis is broad, and sorting through it is 
      made more difficult by the relative lack of symptoms surrounding the faint. Indeed, 
      distinguishing faints from falls is often problematic. Many elderly patients are 
      frail and are at risk of trauma if they should have an unprotected faint or fall to 
      the ground. However, not all elderly patients are frail, and definitions of frailty 
      vary. Providing accurate, effective, and appropriate care for the frail elderly 
      patient who faints may require a multidisciplinary approach.

TI  - Inflammatory signatures in older persons with physical frailty and sarcopenia: The 
      frailty "cytokinome" at its core.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The construct of physical frailty and sarcopenia (PF&S) identifies an 
      age-related pre-disability condition defined by reduced physical performance and low 
      muscle mass. Whether PF&S is characterized by perturbations of the cytokine network 
      is presently unclear. Furthermore, the existence of gender-specific inflammatory 
      profiles of PF&S is unknown. This study was designed to explore the association 
      between a large panel of inflammatory biomolecules and PF&S in older adults through 
      a multivariate statistical approach. Gender-specific inflammatory patterns were also 
      explored. METHODS: One-hundred community-dwellers aged 70 years and older with PF&S 
      and 100 non-sarcopenic, non-frail controls (nonPF&S) were enrolled. A panel of 30 
      circulating inflammatory biomarkers was assayed. Partial least squares discriminant 
      analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to explore the relationship between inflammatory 
      molecules and PF&S. Separate PLS-DA models were built for the whole sample and the 
      two genders. Double cross-validation procedures were used to validate the predictive 
      ability of PLS-DA models. RESULTS: The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model built 
      on the whole sample was found to be four latent variables. The proportion of correct 
      classification was 75.6 ± 1.3% (82.3 ± 1.6% for enrollees with PF&S and 68.7 ± 2.5% 
      for nonPF&S controls). The inflammatory profile of people with PF&S was defined by 
      higher levels of P-selectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interferon γ-induced 
      protein 10. NonPF&S participants were characterized by higher levels of 
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin (IL) 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 
      (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 
      BB. Gender-specific PLS-DA allowed identifying a "core" inflammatory signature of 
      PF&S, composed by higher levels of CRP, and lower concentrations of MPO, IL8, MCP-1, 
      and PDGF-BB, with peculiar patterns of relationships for men and women. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A core inflammatory profile was identified in people with PF&S with a 
      gender-specific signature. The dissection of the PF&S "cytokinome" will provide 
      novel insights into the role played by inflammation in the disabling cascade and 
      allow designing personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older people with frailty (OPF) can experience reduced quality of care 
      and adverse outcomes due to poorly coordinated and fragmented care, making this 
      patient population a key target group for integrated care. This systematic review 
      explores service user, carer and provider perspectives on integrated care for OPF, 
      and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation, to draw out 
      implications for policy, practice and research. METHODS: Systematic review and 
      narrative synthesis of qualitative studies identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO 
      and Social Sciences Citation Index, hand-searching of reference lists and citation 
      tracking of included studies, and review of experts' online profiles. Quality of 
      included studies was appraised with The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for 
      qualitative research. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the synthesis. We 
      identified four themes related to stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for 
      OPF: different preferences for integrated care among service users, system and 
      service organisation components, relational aspects of care and support, and 
      stakeholder perceptions of outcomes. Service users and carers highlighted continuity 
      of care with a professional they could trust, whereas providers emphasised improved 
      coordination of care between providers in different care sectors as key strategies 
      for integrated care. We identified three themes related to factors facilitating and 
      hindering implementation: perceptions of the integrated care intervention and target 
      population, service organisational factors and system level factors influencing 
      implementation. Different stakeholder groups perceived the complexity of care needs 
      of this patient population, difficulties with system navigation and access, and 
      limited service user and carer involvement in care decisions as key factors 
      hindering implementation. Providers mainly also highlighted other organisational and 
      system factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation of integrated care 
      for OPF. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities and differences in lay and professional 
      stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF and factors perceived to 
      facilitate and hinder implementation were evident. Findings highlight the importance 
      of addressing organisational and system level components of integrated care and 
      factors influencing implementation for OPF. Greater attention needs to be placed on 
      collaboratively involving service users, carers and providers to improve the 
      co-design and implementation of integrated care programmes for this patient 
      population.

AB  - Frailty is defined as a decline in an organism's physiological reserves resulting in 
      increased vulnerability to stressors. In humans, a single continuous variable, the 
      so-called Frailty Index (FI), can be obtained by multidimensionally assessing the 
      biological complexity of an ageing organism. Here, we evaluate this variability in 
      dogs and compare it to the data available for humans. In dogs, there was a moderate 
      correlation between age and the FI, and the distribution of the FI increased with 
      age. Deficit accumulation was strongly related to mortality. The effect of age, when 
      combined with the FI, was negligible. No sex-related differences were evident. The 
      FI could be considered in epidemiological studies and/or experimental trials to 
      account for the potential confounding effects of the health status of individual 
      dogs. The age-related deficit accumulation reported in dogs is similar to that 
      demonstrated in humans. Therefore, dogs might represent an excellent model for human 
      aging studies.

AB  - The concept of risk assessment and the identification of surgical unfitness for 
      vascular intervention is a particularly controversial issue today as the minimally 
      invasive surgical population has increased not only in volume but also in complexity 
      (comorbidity profile) and age, requiring an improved pre-operative selection and 
      definition of high risk. A practical step by step (three steps, two points for each) 
      approach for surgical risk assessment is suggested in this review. As a general 
      rule, the identification of a "high risk" patient for vascular surgery follows a 
      step by step process where the risk is clearly defined, quantified (when too 
      "high"?), and thereby stratified based on the procedure, the patient, and the 
      hospital, with the aid of predictive risk scores. However, there is no standardized, 
      updated, and objective definition for surgical unfitness today. The major gap in the 
      current literature on the definition of high risk in vascular patients explains the 
      lack of sound validated predictive systems and limited generalizability of risk 
      scores in vascular surgery. In addition, the concept of fitness is an evolving tool 
      and many traditional high risk criteria and definitions are no longer valid. Given 
      the preventive purpose of most vascular procedures performed in elderly asymptomatic 
      patients, the decision to pursue or withhold surgery requires realistic estimates 
      not only regarding individual peri-operative mortality, but also life expectancy, 
      healthcare priorities, and the patient's primary goals, such as prolongation of life 
      versus maintenance of independence or symptom relief. The overall "frailty" and 
      geriatric risk burden, such as cognitive, functional, social, and nutritional 
      status, are variables that should be also included in the analyses for 
      stratification of surgical risk in elderly vascular patients.

PG  - 174-179

AB  - Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently 
      complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center 
      expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity 
      patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to 
      initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the 
      supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the 
      need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development 
      of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in 
      elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP 
      (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of 
      hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, 
      p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average 
      decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. 
      $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients 
      admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a 
      significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing 
      facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have 
      proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study 
      institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive 
      outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current 
      practice model.

TI  - Evaluation of bio-psycho-social frailty in older persons on the territory: the 
      method and the experience of the "Medesano Health House".
PG  - 389-395
LID - 10.23750/abm.v91i2.9628 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Frailty in older people is a situation of risk of 
      dependency caused by many factors. On this consideration, the Medesano  city started 
      a survey on the condition of fragility of people >75 aimed at building a monitoring 
      system for timely interventions on the factors of risk and implementation of 
      measures for preventing dependency. METHODS: The survey was conducted jointly by the 
      family doctor and the social worker in the City. The multidimensional assessment 
      considered logistic and housing conditions, disease, medications, basic and 
      instumental acitvities of daily living, neurological and psycological conditions. 
      RESULTS: The survey included 761 older people, with a following definition of 
      condition and levels of frailty both at social (loneliness, lack of supporting 
      network, etc..) and health level (complexity of the regimen, high and / or severe 
      comorbidity) was planned from the beginning as the basis on which developing a 
      continuous in time monitoring program for assessing the frailty, for a early taking 
      in charge by Health and Welfare services, boosting integrated health and welfare 
      interventions and promoting networks of solidarity and sociality. CONCLUSION: The 
      data seem to confirm that the methodology used is sufficiently adequate to intercept 
      frailty in > 75 years unknown to social services indicating that the monitoring on 
      the functionality of the subjects obtained from the surveys by the General 
      Practitioners could be deemed as a privileged way for a survey on large populations. 
      After the survey was activated continuous monitoring of patients with social and 
      clinical frailty.

TI  - Vulnerability in the elderly: frailty.
PG  - 593-601
AB  - In scenarios that predict the future of health service delivery in the Western 
      world, the rapid increase in frail elderly patients is seen as one of the major 
      challenges of health care in addition to the care of the chronic medically ill. In 
      this article the relation between age, frailty, comorbidity, and disability is 
      elaborated further, a method to detect frail patients quickly is introduced, and its 
      relation to complexity is explored. An argument for patient-tailored integrated care 
      in frail elderly patients is made. At the same time, the argument will be made that 
      standard evidence-based care can be delivered for patients who have a negative 
      screen on frailty.

TI  - Sharing Frailty-related information in perioperative care: an analysis from a 
      temporal perspective.
PG  - 105

AB  - BACKGROUND: Especially patients older than 65 years undergoing surgery are prone to 
      develop frailty-related complications that may go far beyond the index 
      hospitalization (e.g., cognitive impairment following postoperative delirium). 
      However, aging-relevant information are currently not fully integrated into 
      hospitals' perioperative processes. METHODS: We introduce a temporal perspective, 
      which focuses on the social construction of time, to better understand existing 
      barriers to the exchange of frailty-related data, targeting complexity research. Our 
      chosen context is perioperative care provided by a tertiary hospital in Germany that 
      has implemented a special track for patients over 65 years old undergoing elective 
      surgery. The research followed a participatory modelling approach between domain and 
      modelling experts with the goal of creating a feedback loop model of the relevant 
      system relationships and dynamics. RESULTS: The results of the study show how 
      disparate temporal regimes, understood as frameworks for organizing actions in the 
      light of time constraints, time pressure, and deadlines, across different clinical, 
      ambulant, and geriatric care sectors create disincentives to cooperate in 
      frailty-related data exchanges. Moreover, we find that shifting baselines, meaning 
      continuous increases in cost and time pressure in individual sectors, may 
      unintentionally reinforce - rather than discourage - disparate temporal regimes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results may (1) help to increase awareness of the 
      importance of frailty-related data exchanges, and (2) impel efforts aiming to 
      transform treatment processes to go beyond sectoral boundaries, taking into account 
      the potential benefits for frail patients arising from integrated care processes 
      using information technology.

TI  - Treatment considerations for elderly and frail patients with neuropathic pain.
PG  - S26-32
LID - 10.4065/mcp.2009.0646 [doi]
AB  - Currently, an estimated 38 million individuals 65 years or older live in the United 
      States, and more than 11 million of these individuals are 80 years or older. Older 
      people are at high risk of neuropathic pain because many diseases that cause 
      neuropathic pain increase in incidence with age. Depending on their underlying 
      health, older adults with neuropathic pain may have to cope with multiple coexisting 
      diseases, polypharmacy, and impaired functional ability. The objective of this 
      article is to review how aging and frailty affect the treatment of older adults with 
      neuropathic pain. Specific topics reviewed include the complexity of treatment 
      decisions in older patients due to aged heterogeneity, multimorbidity, and 
      polypharmacy; selection of treatment in an effort to maximize patients' functional 
      abilities in addition to relieving their pain; more careful dosing (usually lower) 
      and monitoring of pharmacotherapy relative to younger patients due to age-related 
      changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; and underrepresentation of older 
      adults in clinical trials of neuropathic pain treatments, which further compromises 
      physicians' ability to make informed treatment decisions.

AB  - Aging together with multimorbidity, polymedication and various social factors are 
      some of the determinants that lead to increasing complexity of care in the elderly, 
      thus making it difficult for health systems to meet their needs. To approach this 
      new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal health and social care 
      systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing specialists trained to 
      address the needs of older people from a perspective of comprehensive care, both for 
      healthy aging, and for the different health problems of this population group, 
      characterized by the consequences of aging and chronicity, towards dependence, and 
      develop the powers established by law in the framework of an interdisciplinary team, 
      for those who have been trained and accredited, thus adding value to the response 
      that health systems have to provide for this growing problem of the 
      'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.

AB  - Geriatric medicine has an encyclopaedic sweep, reflecting the complexity of both the 
      ageing process and of our patient group. Keeping up with, and making sense of, the 
      relevant scientific literature is challenging, especially as ageing has increased in 
      prominence as a focus of research across many branches of the sciences and the 
      humanities. This review of research published in 2012 in generalist, geriatric 
      medicine and gerontology journals has been compiled with a view to extracting those 
      aspects of research into ageing which could be considered relevant not only to the 
      practice of geriatric medicine, but also to our understanding of the ageing process 
      and the relationship of geriatric medicine to other medical specialties and public 
      health. The research discussed includes new insights into global ageing and the 
      compression of morbidity; nosological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of dementia; 
      an innovative study on the microbiome and ageing; epidemiological perspectives into 
      multi-morbidity; an overview of the impact of the first waves of Baby Boomers; fresh 
      thinking on geriatric syndromes such as orthostatic hypotension, kyphosis, urinary 
      incontinence after stroke, frailty and elder abuse; an update of the Beers criteria 
      and the first stirrings of recognition of the longevity dividend in the biomedical 
      literature.

TI  - The Importance of Evaluating Frailty and Social-behavioral Factors for Managing 
      Drugs and Dialysis Prescription in Elderly Patients.

AB  - Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of complexity, which is an essential 
      condition for making the organism capable of keeping homeostasis. Thus, senile loss 
      of complexity makes old individuals frail: a syndrome characterized by the presence 
      of shrinking (sarcopenia), weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low 
      physical activity. Moreover, renal ageing progressively leads to a glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) reduction, one of the main pharmacokinetic senile changes, 
      which is not detectable by simply evaluating serum urea or creatinine values but 
      measuring or calculating patient's GFR. Finally, current epidemiology has documented 
      that detrimental social-behavioral factors such as low education level, poor 
      financial-resource, depression, and isolation, also influence the onset and 
      progression of chronic diseases, and even overall mortality, particularly in the 
      elderly. Thus, we propose that these 3 variables: frailty phenotype, senile GFR, and 
      detrimental social-behavioral factors, should be considered at time of prescribing 
      drugs or medical procedures in the elderly. Additionally, they should also be 
      considered for following patient's response to prescribed therapies in elderly 
      patients suffering from chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, 
      etc.), or on organ replacement treatments (dialysis and transplantation).

TI  - Predicting postoperative complications in patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion 
      by using the modified five-item frailty index and nutritional status.
PG  - 1717-1722
LID - 10.1302/0301-620X.102B12.BJJ-2020-0874.R1 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: As the population ages and the surgical complexity of lumbar spinal surgery 
      increases, the preoperative stratification of risk becomes increasingly important. 
      Understanding the risks is an important factor in decision-making and optimizing the 
      preoperative condition of the patient. Our aim was to determine whether the modified 
      five-item frailty index (mFI-5) and nutritional parameters could be used to predict 
      postoperative complications in patients undergoing simple or complex lumbar spinal 
      fusion. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 584 patients who had undergone lumbar 
      spinal fusion for degenerative lumbar spinal disease. The 'simple' group (SG) 
      consisted of patients who had undergone one- or two-level posterior lumbar fusion. 
      The 'complex' group (CG) consisted of patients who had undergone fusion over three 
      or more levels, or combined anterior and posterior surgery. On admission, the mFI-5 
      was calculated and nutritional parameters collected. RESULTS: Complications occurred 
      in 9.3% (37/396) of patients in the SG, and 10.1% (19/167) of patients in the CG. In 
      the SG, the important predictors of complications were age (odds ratio (OR) 1.036; p 
      = 0.002); mFI-5 (OR 1.026 to 2.411, as score increased to 1 ≥ 2 respectively; p = 
      0.023); albumin (OR 11.348; p < 0.001); vitamin D (OR 2.185; p = 0.032); and total 
      lymphocyte count (OR 1.433; p = 0.011) . In the CG, the predictors of complications 
      were albumin (OR 9.532; p = 0.002) and vitamin D (OR 3.815; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: 
      The mFI-5 and nutritional status were effective predictors of postoperative 
      complications in the SG, but only nutritional status was successful in predicting 
      postoperative complications in the CG. The complexity of the surgery, as well as the 
      preoperative frailty and nutritional status of patients, should be considered when 
      determining if it is safe to proceed with lumbar spinal fusion. Cite this article:

TI  - Frailty and activation of the inflammation and coagulation systems with and without 
      clinical comorbidities: results from the Cardiovascular Health Study.
PG  - 2333-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The biological basis of frailty has been difficult to establish owing to 
      the lack of a standard definition, its complexity, and its frequent coexistence with 
      illness. OBJECTIVE: To establish the biological correlates of frailty in the 
      presence and absence of concurrent cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. 
      METHODS: Participants were 4735 community-dwelling adults 65 years and older. Frail, 
      intermediate, and nonfrail subjects were identified by a validated screening tool 
      and exclusion criteria. Bivariate relationships between frailty level and 
      physiological measures were evaluated by Pearson chi2 tests for categorical 
      variables and analysis of variance F tests for continuous variables. Multinomial 
      logistic regression was performed to evaluate multivariable relationships between 
      frailty status and physiological measures. RESULTS: Of 4735 Cardiovascular Health 
      Study participants, 299 (6.3%) were identified as frail, 2147 (45.3%) as 
      intermediate, and 2289 (48.3%) as not frail. Frail vs nonfrail participants had 
      increased mean +/- SD levels of C-reactive protein (5.5 +/- 9.8 vs 2.7 +/- 4.0 
      mg/L), factor VIII (13 790 +/- 4480 vs 11 860 +/- 3460 mg/dL), and, in a smaller 
      subset, D dimer (647 +/- 1033 vs 224 +/- 258 ng/mL) (P< or =.001 for all, chi2 test 
      for trend). These differences persisted when individuals with cardiovascular disease 
      and diabetes were excluded and after adjustment for age, sex, and race. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings support the hypothesis that there is a specific physiological basis 
      to the geriatric syndrome of frailty that is characterized in part by increased 
      inflammation and elevated markers of blood clotting and that these physiological 
      differences persist when those with diabetes and cardiovascular disease are 
      excluded.

TI  - Multidisciplinary interventions for reducing the avoidable displacement from home of 
      frail older people: a systematic review.
PG  - e030687

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To synthesise existing literature on interventions addressing a new 
      concept of avoidable displacement from home for older people with multimorbidity or 
      frailty. The review focused on home-based interventions by any type of 
      multidisciplinary team aimed at reducing avoidable displacement from home to 
      hospital settings. A second objective was to characterise these interventions to 
      inform policy. DESIGN: A systematic search of the main bibliographic databases was 
      conducted to identify studies relating to interventions addressing avoidable 
      displacement from home for older people. Studies focusing on one specific condition 
      or interventions without multidisciplinary teams were excluded. A narrative 
      synthesis of data was conducted, and themes were identified by using an adapted 
      thematic framework analysis approach. RESULTS: The search strategy was performed 
      using the following electronic databases: the American National Library of Medicine 
      and the National Institutes of Health (PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane Library (Central 
      and CDRS), CINAHL, Social Care Online, Web of Science as well as the database of the 
      Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. The database search was 
      done in September 2018 and completed in October 2018. Overall 3927 articles were 
      identified and 364 were retained for full text screening. Fifteen studies were 
      included in the narrative review. Four themes were identified and discussed: (1) 
      types of interventions, (2) composition of teams, (3) intervention effectiveness and 
      (4) types of outcomes. Within intervention types, three categories of care types 
      were identified; transitional care, case-management services and hospital at home. 
      Each individual article was assessed in terms of risk of bias following Cochrane 
      Collaboration guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The review identified some potential 
      interventions and relevant topics to be addressed in order to develop effective and 
      sustainable interventions to reduce the avoidable displacement from home of older 
      people. However the review was not able to identify robust impact evidence, either 
      in terms of quantity or quality from the studies presented. As such, the available 
      evidence is not sufficiently robust to inform policy or interventions for reducing 
      avoidable displacement from home. This finding reflects the complexity of these 
      interventions and a lack of systematic data collection. PROSPERO REGISTRATION

TI  - Unravelling the differences between complexity and frailty in old age: findings from 
      a constructivist grounded theory study.
PG  - 67-73

AB  - UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but 
      there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important 
      if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in 
      society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study 
      into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and 
      operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded 
      theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses 
      and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the 
      relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within 
      the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand 
      important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to 
      describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has 
      resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity 
      means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has 
      implications for nursing practice that require further study.

TI  - The "Metabolic biomarkers of frailty in older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus" 
      (MetaboFrail) study: Rationale, design and methods.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading cause of disability globally. Frailty 
      is a high-impact geriatric condition that increases the risk of negative health 
      outcomes and imposes remarkable health and social burden. Both frailty and T2DM show 
      multifaceted pathophysiology, phenotypic heterogeneity, and fluctuating 
      manifestations that challenge their management, especially when the two conditions 
      co-occur. Muscle wasting and its correlates (e.g., metabolic perturbations and 
      functional decline) that underlie frailty may exacerbates clinical manifestations of 
      T2DM in older people, resulting in worse prognosis. The intrinsic complexity of 
      frailty and T2DM has hampered the identification of clinically meaningful biomarkers 
      to track the clinical progression of the two conditions over time and to monitor the 
      efficacy of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions. Here, we propose an 
      innovative approach for biomarker identification that couples multi-platform 
      analytical determinations with chemometric modeling strategies. This novel 
      multi-marker discovery process is described in the context of the "Metabolic 
      biomarkers of frailty in older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus" (MetaboFrail) 
      study that aimed at identifying metabolic biomarkers of frailty in functionally 
      limited older persons with T2DM.

TI  - Mortality, Geriatric, and Nongeriatric Surgical Risk Factors Among the Eldest Old: A 
      Prospective Observational Study.
PG  - 1329-1336
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000002389 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative risk and postoperative outcomes among the elderly are the 
      subject of extensive debate. However, the eldest old, that is, the fastest-growing 
      and most vulnerable group, are insufficiently studied; even their mortality rate is 
      unclear. This prospective observational study was performed with the aim of 
      determining the mortality rate of this population and establishing which 
      preoperative conditions were predictors of which postoperative outcomes. The study 
      was undertaken between 2011 and 2015 in a major tertiary care university hospital. 
      METHODS: All patients aged ≥85 years undergoing any elective procedure during the 
      study period were included. Patients were followed up for 30 days 
      postoperatively.The preoperative conditions studied were demographic data, grade of 
      surgical complexity (1-3), preoperative comorbidities, and some characteristically 
      geriatric conditions (functional reserve, nutrition, cognitive status, polypharmacy, 
      dependency, and frailty). The outcome measures were 30-day all-cause mortality 
      (primary end point), morbidity, prolonged length of stay, and escalation of care in 
      living conditions. RESULTS: Of 139 eligible patients, 127 completed follow-up. The 
      30-day mortality was 7.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.2-12.6. It had 3 
      predictors: malnutrition (odds ratio [OR], 15; 95% CI, 3-89), complexity 3 (OR, 9.1; 
      CI, 2-52), and osteoporosis/osteoporotic fractures (OR, 14.7; CI, 2-126). 
      Significant predictors for morbidity (40%) were ischemic heart disease (OR, 3.9; CI, 
      1-11) and complexity 3 (OR, 3.6; CI, 2-9), while a nonfrail phenotype (OR, 0.3; CI, 
      0.1-0.8) was found to be protective. Only 2 factors were found to be predictive of 
      longer admissions, namely complexity 3 (OR, 4.4; CI, 2-10) and frailty (OR, 2.7; CI, 
      2-7). Finally, risk factors for escalation of care in living conditions were slow 
      gait (a surrogate for frailty, OR, 2.5; CI, 1-6), complexity 3 (OR, 3.2; CI, 1-7), 
      and hypertension (OR, 2.9; CI, 1-9). CONCLUSIONS: The eldest old is a distinct group 
      with a considerable mortality rate and their own particular risk factors. Surgical 
      complexity and certain geriatric variables (malnutrition and frailty), which are 
      overlooked in American Society of Anesthesiologists and most other usual scores, are 
      particularly relevant in this population. Inclusion of these factors along with 
      appropriate comorbidities for risk stratification should guide better decision 
      making for families and doctors alike and encourage preoperative optimization of 
      patients.

TI  - Identification of a Circulating Amino Acid Signature in Frail Older Persons with 
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Results from the Metabofrail Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu12010199 [doi]
LID - 199
AB  - Diabetes and frailty are highly prevalent conditions that impact the health status 
      of older adults. Perturbations in protein/amino acid metabolism are associated with 
      both functional impairment and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the present 
      study, we compared the concentrations of a panel of circulating 37 amino acids and 
      derivatives between frail/pre-frail older adults with T2DM and robust non-diabetic 
      controls. Sixty-six functionally impaired older persons aged 70+ with T2DM and 30 
      age and sex-matched controls were included in the analysis. We applied a partial 
      least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-based analytical strategy to 
      characterize the metabotype of study participants. The optimal complexity of the 
      PLS-DA model was found to be two latent variables. The proportion of correct 
      classification was 94.1 ± 1.9% for frail/pre-frail persons with T2DM and 100% for 
      control participants. Functionally impaired older persons with T2DM showed higher 
      levels of 3-methyl histidine, alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, ethanolamine 
      sarcosine, and tryptophan. Control participants had higher levels of ornithine and 
      taurine. These findings indicate that a specific profile of amino acids and 
      derivatives characterizes pre-frail/frail older persons with T2DM. The dissection of 
      these pathways may provide novel insights into the metabolic perturbations involved 
      in the disabling cascade in older persons with T2DM.

TI  - Physiological complexity, aging, and the path to frailty.
PG  - pe16
AB  - Healthy physiological processes require the complex interaction of multiple control 
      systems operating over multiple time scales. The output of these processes (for 
      example, heart rate, blood pressure, hormonal rhythms, or postural sway) 
      demonstrates complex variability that can be quantified using the concept of 
      fractals, derived from the field of nonlinear dynamics. Complex physiological 
      dynamics enable an organism to rapidly respond to the internal and external 
      perturbations of everyday life. Aging and disease are associated with a loss of 
      complexity in the dynamics of many physiological systems. This loss of complexity 
      may reduce the ability to adapt to stress and lead to the syndrome of frailty.

TI  - The hormonal pathway to frailty in older men.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - Frailty, which is a state of high vulnerability that imparts a high risk of 
      developing adverse health outcomes, affects many elderly subjects, especially men 
      and women aged 80 yr and older (1). Although many different definitions of frailty 
      have been proposed (2), a large portion of the recent literature has focused on the 
      definition developed by L. Fried et al. (1) using the data from the Cardiovascular 
      Health Study. Although this definition has not been officially recognized as the 
      "gold standard" for the diagnosis of frailty, nonetheless most of the studies on 
      frailty in the last 5 yr have used this definition. Several mechanisms have been 
      hypothesized to have an important role in the development of frailty, including 
      inflammation, coagulation and oxidative stress (3). Many authors implicate 
      age-related hormonal changes to be directly or indirectly involved in the 
      development of the frailty syndrome (4). Alterations in hypothalamic- 
      pituitary-testicular, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and GH-IGF-I axes that 
      accompany aging have been associated with single components of frailty, such as 
      reduced muscle strength, bone strength or poor mobility (5, 6). However, most of 
      these studies have focused on single hormonal changes rather than evaluating the 
      parallel effect of aging on multiple hormonal axes. In addition, no interventional 
      studies have specifically targeted frail older subjects (7). Since frailty by 
      definition is a multi-system disorder, it is unlikely that changes in one axis 
      (leading to a change in a single hormone) will explain the complexity of the 
      dysregulation leading to frailty. Therefore, global measures of endocrine 
      dysregulation that can discriminate between specific endocrine diseases and 
      endocrine senescence should be developed. Observational and interventional studies 
      will be needed to better define the role of "hormonal dysregulation", alone and in 
      combination with other pathways, in the development of frailty in older men.

TI  - Complementing chronic frailty assessment at hospital admission with an electronic 
      frailty index (FI-Laboratory) comprising routine blood test results.
PG  - E3-E8
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.190952 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acutely ill and frail older adults have complex social and health care 
      needs. It is important to understand how this complexity affects acute outcomes for 
      admission to hospital. We validated a frailty index using routine admission 
      laboratory tests with outcomes after patients were admitted to hospital. METHODS: In 
      a prospective cohort of older adults admitted to a large tertiary hospital in the 
      United Kingdom, we created a frailty index from routine admission laboratory 
      investigations (FI-Laboratory) linked to data comprising hospital outcomes. We 
      evaluated the association between the FI-Laboratory and total days spent in 
      hospital, discharge to a higher level of care, readmission and mortality. RESULTS: 
      Of 2552 admissions among 1750 older adults, we were able to generate FI-Laboratory 
      values for 2254 admissions (88.3% of the cohort). More than half of admitted 
      patients were women (55.3%) and the mean age was 84.6 (SD 14.0) years. We found that 
      the FI-Laboratory correlated weakly with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS; r (2) = 
      0.09). An increase in the CFS and the equivalent of 3 additional abnormal laboratory 
      test results in the FI-Laboratory, respectively, were associated with an increased 
      proportion of inpatient days (rate ratios [RRs] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      1.35-1.52; and 1.47, 95% CI 1.41-1.54), discharge to a higher level of care (odd 
      ratios [ORs] 1.39, 95% CI 1.27-1.52; and 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.47) and increased 
      readmission rate (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.37; and 1.18, 95% CI 
      1.11-1.26). Increases in the CFS and FI-Laboratory were associated with increased 
      mortality HRs of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28-1.51) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.37-1.54), respectively. 
      INTERPRETATION: We determined that FI-Laboratory, distinct from baseline frailty, 
      could be used to predict risk of many adverse outcomes. The score is therefore a 
      useful way to quantify the degree of acute illness in frail older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between frailty and postoperative discharge 
      destination after different types of commonly performed urologic procedures in older 
      patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the American College of Surgeons 
      National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) from 2011 to 2013, we 
      identified commonly performed inpatient urologic procedures among patients aged 65 
      and older. We then assessed the effect of frailty, measured by the NSQIP Frailty 
      Index (NSQIP-FI), on discharge to a skilled or assisted living facility using 
      logistic regression and assessed the heterogeneity of this effect across procedures 
      using 2-level random effects modeling. RESULTS: Overall, 1144 out of 20,794 (5.5%) 
      urologic cases, representing 19 different procedures, resulted in discharge to a 
      skilled or assisted living facility. Cystectomy and large transurethral resection of 
      bladder tumor had the highest percentage (16.3%). Twenty-five percent of patients 
      undergoing urology procedures were frail (NSQIP-FI 0.18+), including 9.8% of 
      patients discharged to a facility. Even after adjustment for year, age, race, type 
      of anesthesia, smoking status, recent weight loss, and whether or not the procedure 
      was elective, frailty was strongly associated with discharge to a facility (adjusted 
      odds ratio 3.1 [96% confidence interval 2.5, 3.8] for NSQIP-FI 0.18+ compared to 
      NSQIP FI 0). This finding was consistent across most procedures of varying 
      complexity with an overall effect of odds ratio 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.5, 
      2.0). CONCLUSION: Increasing frailty is associated with discharge to a skilled or 
      assisted living facility across most inpatient urologic procedures evaluated, 
      regardless of complexity. This information is important for preoperative counseling 
      with patients undergoing urologic surgery.

AB  - There are a growing number of older patients who are retaining their natural teeth. 
      Though the majority of these patients remain independent, many are affected by 
      frailty, multi-morbidity or dementia. The complexities associated with dementia have 
      led to guidelines being produced by the FGDP, Dementia friendly dentistry, although 
      other features of ageing can similarly increase the risk of dental disease and the 
      consequent complexity, safety and suitability of providing treatment. Prevention of 
      dental disease is crucial for older patients as the features of ageing may make the 
      risk of treatment greater than that of younger patients. Conscious sedation or 
      general anaesthesia, typically provided by a specialist dental service, may be 
      required to facilitate treatment, though these approaches may have significant short 
      and long-term impacts on older patients. Clinical guidelines and legislation are 
      available to assist in decision-making for patients who may lack mental capacity, 
      yet for patients who are able to consent for treatment, a comprehensive discussion 
      as part of an informed consent process remains crucial to determine the most 
      appropriate approach to care provision.

TI  - Attributes of person-centred communication: A qualitative exploration of 
      communication with older persons in home health care.
PG  - e12284
LID - 10.1111/opn.12284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research points to challenges related to the home healthcare of 
      older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although person-centred care 
      has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to 
      enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons. 
      AIM: The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication 
      between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home. METHODS: A 
      descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the 
      COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between 
      registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative 
      thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the attributes of 
      person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older 
      persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness 
      on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated 
      when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' 
      views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions. CONCLUSION: The nurses' 
      attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication 
      with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve 
      older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. Implication 
      for practice The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred 
      approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included 
      in education and training.

LID - 10.1016/j.jgo.2016.07.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the commonest primary malignant brain tumour 
      amongst the adult population. Incidence peaks in the 7th and 8th decades of life and 
      as our global population ages, rates are increasing. GBM is an almost universally 
      fatal disease with life expectancy in the range of 3-5months amongst the elderly. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The assessment of elderly GBM patients prior to treatment 
      decisions is poorly researched and unstandardised. In order to begin tackling this 
      issue we performed a cross-sectional survey across all UK based consultant 
      neuro-oncologists to review their current practice in assessing elderly GBM 
      patients. RESULTS: There were 56 respondents from a total of 93 recipients (60% 
      response rate). All respondents confirmed that at least some patients aged 70 or 
      over were referred to their clinics from the local multidisciplinary team meeting 
      (MDT). Only 18% of consultants routinely performed a cognitive or frailty screening 
      test at initial consultation. Of those who performed a screening test, the majority 
      reported that the results of the test changed their treatment decision in 
      approximately 50% of cases. Participants ranked performance status as the most 
      important factor in determining treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the 
      heterogeneity of this patient population, we argue that performance status is a 
      crude measure of vulnerability within this cohort. Elderly GBM patients represent a 
      unique clinical scenario because of the complexity of distinguishing neuro-oncology 
      related symptoms from general frailty. There is a need for specific geriatric 
      assessment models tailored to the elderly neuro-oncology population in order to 
      facilitate treatment decisions.

TI  - Frailty and the degradation of complex balance dynamics during a dual-task protocol.
PG  - 1304-11
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glp113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Balance during quiet stance involves the complex interactions of 
      multiple postural control systems, which may degrade with frailty. The complexity of 
      center of pressure (COP) dynamics, as quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE), 
      during quiet standing is lower in older adults, especially those with falls. We 
      hypothesized that COP dynamics from frail elderly individuals demonstrate less 
      complexity than those from nonfrail elderly controls; complexity decreases when 
      performing a dual task; and postural complexity during quiet standing is independent 
      of other conventional correlates of balance control, such as age and vision. 
      METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based study of community-dwelling older 
      adults. Frailty phenotype (nonfrail, prefrail, or frail) was determined for 550 
      participants (age 77.9 +/- 5.5 years). COP excursions were quantified for 10 trials 
      of 30 seconds each. Participants concurrently performed a serial subtraction task in 
      half of the trials. Complexity of balance dynamics was quantified using MSE. 
      Root-mean-square sway amplitude was also computed. RESULTS: Of the 550, 38% were 
      prefrail and 9% were frail. Complexity of the COP dynamics in the anteroposterior 
      direction was lower in prefrail (8.78 +/- 1.91 [mean +/- SD]) and frail (8.38 +/- 
      2.13) versus nonfrail (9.20 +/- 1.74) groups (p < .001). Complexity reduced by a 
      comparable amount in all three groups while performing the subtraction task (p < 
      .001). Quiet standing complexity was independently associated with frailty after 
      adjusting for covariates related to balance while sway amplitude was not. 
      CONCLUSION: Cognitive distractions during standing may further compromise balance 
      control in frail individuals, leading to an increased risk of falls.

TI  - Considerations in the surgical management of ovarian cancer in the elderly.
PG  - 12-21
LID - 10.1007/s11864-012-0216-2 [doi]
AB  - Elderly patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer present a complex treatment 
      dilemma. On the one hand, patients can be treated with primary debulking surgery to 
      achieve the ideal oncologic outcomes but at the expense of risk of surgical 
      morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, they can be treated with alternative, 
      less morbid approaches, reducing toxicity, but sacrificing the survival benefits of 
      low residual disease by surgical cytoreduction. Retrospective studies have attempted 
      to identify risk factors for poor surgical outcome. Although there is no consensus 
      to define "elderly" or "frail," current evidence identifies age, performance status, 
      nutritional status, and surgical complexity as major risk factors for surgical 
      morbidity. Accepting the shortcomings of these retrospective data, candidates for 
      primary debulking surgery can be assessed for risk of surgical morbidity. Age is 
      likely a contributor to morbidity, particularly in the face of comorbid conditions. 
      Clinicians should strive to treat elderly patients with a standard approach of 
      primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy when healthy and in the absence 
      of other risk factors. Elderly patients with the following are poor surgical 
      candidates and an alternative treatment approach should be considered: poor 
      nutritional status (characterized by serum albumin <3.0 g/dL), or poor performance 
      status (ASA ≥3), and stage IV disease. Several of these factors are modifiable by 
      treating the underlying cancer. These patients should be treated with two to three 
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and reassessed for surgical debulking. Patients 
      with improvement in their nutritional or performance status can undergo interval 
      debulking with the goal to resect all visible disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Measures of frailty (Groningen Frailty Indicator, GFI) and case 
      complexity (INTERMED for the Elderly, IM-E-SA) may assist healthcare professionals 
      to allocate healthcare resources. Both instruments have been evaluated with good 
      psychometric properties. Limited evidence has been published about their predictive 
      validity. Thus, our aim is to evaluate the predictive validity of both instruments 
      on healthcare costs. METHODS: Multivariate linear regression models were developed 
      to estimate associations between the predictors frailty (GFI) and/or case complexity 
      (IM-E-SA) and the healthcare costs (in € log transformed) in the following year. All 
      models were adjusted for demographics and the presence of morbidity. RESULTS: In the 
      multivariate regression analyses the continuous scores of the GFI and IM-E-SA 
      remained significant predictors for total healthcare costs. Adjusted βs for GFI and 
      IM-E-SA were respectively 0.14 (95% CI 0.10-0.18) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.07). The 
      corresponding explained variance (R(2)) for both models was 0.40. Frailty remained a 
      significant predictor of long-term care costs (adjusted β 0.13 [95% CI 0.09-0.16]), 
      while case complexity was a significant predictor of curative care costs (adjusted β 
      0.03 [95% CI 0.02-0.05]). CONCLUSIONS: The GFI and IM-E-SA both accurately predict 
      total healthcare costs in the following year.

TI  - Personalized surgical management of colorectal cancer in elderly population.
PG  - 3762-77
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i14.3762 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) in the elderly is extremely common but only a few clinicians 
      are familiar with the complexity of issues which present in the geriatric 
      population. In this phase of the life cycle, treatment is frequently suboptimal. 
      Despite the fact that, nowadays, older people tend to be healthier than in previous 
      generations, surgical undertreatment is frequently encountered. On the other hand, 
      surgical overtreatment in the vulnerable or frail patient can lead to unacceptable 
      postoperative outcomes with high mortality or persistent disability. Unfortunately, 
      due to the geriatric patient being traditionally excluded from randomized controlled 
      trials for a variety of factors (heterogeneity, frailty, etc.), there is a dearth of 
      evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of these patients. The 
      objective of this review was to summarize the most relevant clinical studies 
      available in order to assist clinicians in the management of CRC in the elderly. 
      More than in any other patient group, both surgical and non-surgical management 
      strategies should be carefully individualized in the elderly population affected by 
      CRC. Although cure and sphincter preservation are the primary goals, many other 
      variables need to be taken into account, such as maintenance of cognitive status, 
      independence, life expectancy and quality of life.

AB  - Frailty is a syndrome that leads to practical harm in the lives of elders, since it 
      is related to increased risk of dependency, falls, hospitalization, 
      institutionalization, and death. The objective of this systematic review was to 
      identify the socio-demographic, psycho-behavioral, health-related, nutritional, and 
      lifestyle factors associated with frailty in the elderly. A total of 4,183 studies 
      published from 2001 to 2013 were detected in the databases, and 182 complete 
      articles were selected. After a comprehensive reading and application of selection 
      criteria, 35 eligible articles remained for analysis. The main factors associated 
      with frailty were: age, female gender, black race/color, schooling, income, 
      cardiovascular diseases, number of comorbidities/diseases, functional incapacity, 
      poor self-rated health, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, body mass index, 
      smoking, and alcohol use. Knowledge of the complexity of determinants of frailty can 
      assist the formulation of measures for prevention and early intervention, thereby 
      contributing to better quality of life for the elderly.

TI  - Regulation of Cardiac Autonomic Nervous System Control across Frailty Statuses: A 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 3-15
LID - 10.1159/000431285 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that leads to impairment in interrelated 
      physiological systems and progressive homeostatic dysregulation in physiological 
      systems. OBJECTIVE: The focus of the present systematic review was to study the 
      association between the activity of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) and 
      frailty. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple 
      databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov; the last search was performed in March 2015. Inclusion criteria 
      were: (1) that the studied population was classified for frailty according to a 
      standard definition, such as Fried's criteria; (2) that the study had a nonfrail 
      control group, and (3) that heart rate (HR) and/or heart rate variability (HRV) were 
      parameters of interest in the study. RESULTS: Of the 1,544 articles screened, 54 
      were selected for full-text review and 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. 
      Assessment of HRV using different standard time domain, frequency domain, and 
      nonlinear domain approaches confirmed the presence of an impaired cardiac ANS 
      function in frail compared to nonfrail participants. Furthermore, HR changes while 
      performing a clinical test (e.g., the seated step test or the lying-to-standing 
      orthostatic test) were decreased in the frail group compared to the nonfrail group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic review provides evidence that the cardiac ANS is 
      impaired in frail compared to nonfrail older adults, as indicated by a reduction in 
      the complexity of HR dynamics, reduced HRV, and reduced HR changes in response to 
      daily activities. Four out of 6 included articles recruited only female 
      participants, and in the other 2 articles the effect of gender on impairment of 
      cardiac ANS was insufficiently investigated. Therefore, further studies are required 
      to study the association between cardiac ANS impairments and frailty in males. 
      Furthermore, HRV was studied only during static postures such as sitting, or without 
      considering the level of activity as a potential confounder. Accordingly, 
      simultaneous measurement of both physiological (i.e., HRV) and kinematic (e.g., 
      using wearable sensor technology) information may provide a better understanding of 
      cardiac ANS impairments with frailty while controlling for activity.

TI  - Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?
PG  - 1459-62
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13512 [doi]
AB  - The academic geriatrics community has provided outstanding leadership in addressing 
      frailty and complexity in older adults, but a minority of older adults are frail. 
      Although resources to treat older adults are limited, and it is appropriate to focus 
      clinical efforts on those with frailty and multimorbidity, there is also important 
      expertise that can be brought to bear on the health of ALL older adults. A review of 
      the literature suggests that attention to healthy or successful aging has failed to 
      keep pace with the focus on frailty. By providing leadership to promote successful 
      aging, the quality of life of older adults across the spectrum can be improved and 
      transitions to frailty reduced. The template that leaders have established in 
      understanding frailty-defining and operationalizing it, understanding outcomes, 
      identifying pathophysiology-can be used as an approach to successful aging. Several 
      community-based programs have been successful in promoting successful aging. These 
      are potentially highly scalable and could have a substantial effect on the aging 
      population, but their essential components need to be better understood. The 
      geriatrics community is uniquely positioned to take on this role. This is a critical 
      time to work together to make the lives of all older adults as healthy and 
      fulfilling as possible.

TI  - Caring for frail older patients in the last phase of life : Challenges for general 
      practitioners in the integration of geriatric and palliative care.
PG  - 763-769
LID - 10.1007/s00391-019-01668-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The best possible care for frail older patients at the end of life can 
      require the integration of geriatric and palliative approaches, possibly with 
      different accentuations at different times. General practitioners (GP) are 
      particularly important in this context: they provide patients with low-threshold 
      primary care close to their homes and provide both general palliative care and 
      geriatric services. OBJECTIVE: What are the challenges for GPs in caring for frail 
      older patients at the end of their lives? MATERIAL AND METHODS: A secondary data 
      analysis of 52 qualitative interviews was carried out, which were serially obtained 
      at 4 points in time over a period of 18 months with 14 family doctors. In addition, 
      one focus group with five GPs took place. The analysis was carried out according to 
      the principles of grounded theory. RESULTS: The results show that GPs see the care 
      of frail older patients at the end of their lives through a) the growing number of 
      older people, b) multimorbidity and complexity of the problem areas, c) the 
      integration of geriatric and palliative approaches, d) the high average age of 
      general practitioners and the lack of junior staff and e) the problem of ensuring 
      care in rural areas as a major challenge. The practical transition between geriatric 
      and palliative care is considered by GPs to be fluid and there is a desire for more 
      integration of both disciplines. CONCLUSION: In this study GPs perceived a large 
      overlap between geriatric and palliative care. Both approaches should be offered for 
      a selection of patients as a combined service. In the future a systematic network 
      between GPs and geriatricians in practices, clinics, and day clinics will be 
      necessary.

TI  - Simple Method of Screening for Frailty in Older Adults Using a Chronometer and Tape 
      Measure in Clinic.
PG  - 157-160
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15204 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Detecting frailty in older adults scheduled for surgery is important to 
      predict the occurrence of adverse outcomes, but because of its complexity, frailty 
      screening is not commonly performed. The objective of the current study was to 
      assess whether frailty can be screened for using automatically measured usual gait 
      speed (UGS) and mid-arm circumference (MAC) in the outpatient clinic. DESIGN: 
      Prospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Geriatric center of a tertiary 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Outpatients aged 65 and older (N = 113). MEASUREMENTS: 
      Frailty status was evaluated according to a multidimensional frailty score (MFS) 
      using a comprehensive geriatric assessment, and participants were classified into 5 
      categories. UGS was evaluated by having participants walk through the clinic using 
      an automated laser-gated chronometer. MAC was recorded using a tape measure on a 
      blood pressure cuff. Correlations between these two physical measurements and MFS 
      were assessed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 93 participants who successfully 
      underwent UGS evaluation was 75.8 ± 4.7; 35 were male. In this population, the mean 
      Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2.2 ± 1.4, mean MFS was 4.1 ± 2.0, and 20 
      participants were considered to be at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. 
      Mean UGS was 0.75 ± 0.16 m/s, and mean MAC was 31.2 ± 1.9 cm); both physical 
      parameters were correlated with MFS (UGS: standardized beta = -0.420, P < .001; MAC: 
      standardized beta = -0.457, P < .001). Using UGS and MFS, the area under curve of 
      receiver operating curve for determining which participants were at high risk of 
      experiencing adverse outcomes was 0.809 (P < .001). CONCLUSION: UGS and MAC are 
      viable methods of clinically screening for frailty.

TI  - Comparing the case-mix of frail older people at home and of those being admitted 
      into residential care: a longitudinal study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to optimize interventions and services in the community, it is 
      important to identify the profile of persons who are able to stay at home and of 
      those who are being admitted into residential care. Understanding their needs and 
      their use of resources is essential. The main objective of the study is to identify 
      persons who are likely to enter residential care based upon their needs and resource 
      utilization, so that care providers can plan interventions effectively and optimize 
      services and resources to meet the persons' needs. METHODS: This is a longitudinal 
      quasi-experimental study. The data consists of primary data from the community 
      setting collected every six months during the period of 2010-2016. Interventions had 
      the goal of keeping older people longer at home. Participants were at least 65 years 
      old and were living in the community. The interRAI Resource Utilization Group system 
      (RUG-III) was used to calculate the case-mix indexes (CMI) of all participants. 
      Comparisons were made between the case-mix of those who were still living at home 
      and those who were admitted into residential care at follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 
      10,289 older persons participated in the study (81.2 ± 7.1 yrs., 69.1% female). From 
      this population, 853 participants (8.3%) were admitted into residential care. The 
      CMI of the persons receiving night care at home were the highest (1.6 at baseline 
      and 1.7 at the entry point of residential care), followed by persons receiving 
      occupational therapy (1.5 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential 
      care) and persons enrolled in case management interventions with rehabilitation (1.4 
      at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care). The CMIs at follow-up 
      were significantly higher than at baseline and the linear regression model showed 
      that admission to residential care was a significant factor in the model. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the RUG-III system offers possibilities for 
      identifying persons at risk of institutionalization. Interventions designed to avoid 
      early nursing home admission can make use of the RUG-III system to optimize care 
      planning and the allocation of services and resources. Based on the RUG-III 
      case-mix, resources can be allocated to keep older persons at home longer, bearing 
      in mind the complexity of care and the availability of services in the community.

TI  - Kinematics and dynamic complexity of postural transitions in frail elderly subjects.
PG  - 6118-21
AB  - The aim of this study was to propose a methodology allowing a detailed 
      characterization of body sit-to-stand/stand-to-sit postural transition. Parameters 
      characterizing the kinematics of the trunk movement during sit-to-stand (Si-St) 
      postural transition were calculated using one initial sensor system fixed on the 
      trunk and a data logger. Dynamic complexity of these postural transitions was 
      estimated by fractal dimension of acceleration-angular velocity plot. We concluded 
      that this method provides a simple and accurate tool for monitoring frail elderly 
      and to objectively evaluate the efficacy of a rehabilitation program.

TI  - Inflammatory mediators in the elderly.
PG  - 687-99
AB  - Ageing is accompanied by 2-4-fold increases in plasma/serum levels of inflammatory 
      mediators such as cytokines and acute phase proteins. A wide range of factors seems 
      to contribute to this low-grade inflammation, including an increased amount of fat 
      tissue, decreased production of sex steroids, smoking, subclinical infections (e.g. 
      asymptomatic bacteriuria), and chronic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, there is some evidence that ageing is associated 
      with a dysregulated cytokine response following stimulation. Several inflammatory 
      mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 have the potential 
      to induce/aggravate risk factors in age-associated pathology, providing a positive 
      feedback mechanism. Thus, it is possible that inflammatory mediators constitute a 
      link between life style factors, infections and physiological changes in the process 
      of ageing on the one hand and risk factors for age-associated diseases on the other. 
      Consistent with this, inflammatory mediators are strong predictors of mortality 
      independently of other known risk factors and co-morbidity in elderly cohorts. A 
      direct pathogenetic role of inflammatory mediators would be highly likely if 
      longevity was shown to be associated with cytokine polymorphisms regulating cytokine 
      production. Several studies support indeed this hypothesis but, unfortunately, 
      findings in this area are conflicting, which probably reflects the complexity of the 
      effect of cytokine polymorphisms and their interaction with the lifestyle and sex.

AB  - Although the evolutionary theories of aging are quite well established, our 
      knowledge about how we age is still very limited. The abundance and heterogeneity of 
      available mechanistic theories of aging implicitly suggest that this phenomenon is 
      overly complex and unlikely to be explained by a single pathway. Moreover, although 
      aging remains a unique process, it is characterized by heterogeneous manifestations, 
      not only determining inter-individual variations, but even intra-individual 
      diversities. Such heterogeneity renders the inner nature of the aging process of 
      difficult evaluation in older persons due to the potential biases introduced by 
      multiple age-related social, biological, and clinical factors (and responsible for 
      the evidence-based issue in geriatrics). Moving from the difficulties in translating 
      anti-aging preclinical interventions into clinical trials, an alternative approach 
      is illustrated. We encourage moving to a holistic evaluation of aging by adopting 
      specific and consequent modifications in the design and conduction of clinical 
      research. Such approach is today commonly applied in the clinical setting where the 
      complexity of older patients often requires multidimensional interventions to 
      adequately target the geriatric syndromes. Consistently, interventions targeting the 
      aging process may result ineffective if too focused on a single underlying causal 
      mechanism and/or failing to capture the complexity of the phenomenon. In this 
      context, frailty (a geriatric syndrome characterized by age-related declines 
      occurring across multiple physiologic systems) may indeed represent a clinically 
      relevant threshold throughout the continuum of the aging process and a promising 
      benchmark to test multidomain interventions against age-related conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: People 65 years and older represent the fastest growing segment of the 
      surgical population. Older age is associated with doubling of risk when undergoing 
      emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures and often coexists with medical 
      complexity and considerations of end-of-life care, creating prognostic and 
      decisional uncertainty. Combined with the time-sensitive nature of EGS, it is 
      challenging to gauge perioperative risk and ensure that clinical decisions are 
      aligned with the patient values. Current preoperative risk prediction models for 
      older EGS patients have major limitations regarding derivation and validation, and 
      do not address the specific risk profile of older patients. Accurate and externally 
      validated models specific to older patients are needed to inform care and decision 
      making. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will derive, internally and externally validate a 
      multivariable model to predict 30-day mortality in EGS patients >65 years old. Our 
      derivation sample will be individuals enrolled in the National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Program (NSQIP) database between 2012 and 2016 having 1 of 7 core EGS 
      procedures. Postulated predictor variables have been identified based on previous 
      research, clinical and epidemiological knowledge. Our model will be derived using 
      logistic regression penalised with elastic net regularisation and ensembled using 
      bootstrap aggregation. The resulting model will be internally validated using k-fold 
      cross-validation and bootstrap validation techniques and externally validated using 
      population-based health administrative data. Discrimination and calibration will be 
      reported at each step. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics for NSQIP data use was 
      obtained from the Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board; external validation will 
      use routinely collected anonymised data legally exempt from research ethics review. 
      The final risk score will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to 
      further disseminate the model as an online calculator or application for clinical 
      use. Future research will be required to test the clinical application of the final 
      model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The capacity of TAVI-programs and numbers of sites performing TAVI has 
      rapidly increased. This necessitated the initiation of the Rotterdam TAVI Care & 
      Cure Program, aiming to improve patient-centered care during the TAVI pathway. 
      METHODS: Consenting patients with severe aortic stenosis and an indication for TAVI 
      will be included. The TAVI Care & Cure program will facilitate prognostic 
      contributions to improve outcomes, patient satisfaction and quality of life in 
      patients with valvular heart disease who are treated with a transcatheter aortic 
      valve implantation in collaboration with the departments of cardiology, 
      cardio-thoracic surgery, anesthesiology and geriatrics. CONCLUSION: With a single 
      center observational registry, we aim to assess the TAVI patient clinical pathway, 
      focusing on pre, peri and post interventional variables including functional status 
      and HRQoL. We will evaluate the patient's complexity by applying an extended 
      multidisciplinary approach, which includes a systematic application of geriatric 
      assessments of frailty and cognitive function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes. We aimed to 
      test the performance of a prospectively validated frailty measure, the Risk Analysis 
      Index (RAI) in patients who underwent vascular surgery and delineate the additive 
      impact of procedure complexity on surgical outcomes. METHODS: We queried the 
      2007-2013 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 
      database to identify 6 major elective vascular procedure categories (carotid 
      revascularization, abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA] repair, suprainguinal 
      revascularization, infrainguinal revascularization, thoracic aortic aneurysm [TAA] 
      repair, and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm [TAAA] repair). We trained and tested 
      logistic regression models for 30-day mortality, major complications, and prolonged 
      length of stay (LOS). The first model, "RAI," used the RAI alone; "RAI-Procedure 
      (RAI-P)" included procedure category (e.g., AAA repair) and procedure approach 
      (e.g., endovascular); "RAI-Procedure Complexity (RAI-PC)" added outpatient versus 
      inpatient surgery, general anesthesia use, work relative value units (RVUs), and 
      operative time. RESULTS: The RAI model was a good predictor of mortality for 
      vascular procedures overall (C-statistic: 0.72). The C-statistic increased with the 
      RAI-P (0.78), which further improved minimally, with the RAI-PC (0.79). When 
      stratified by procedure category, the RAI predicted mortality well for infrainguinal 
      (0.79) and suprainguinal (0.74) procedures, moderately well for AAA repairs (0.69) 
      and carotid revascularizations (0.70), and poorly for TAAs (0.62) and TAAAs (0.54). 
      For carotid, infrainguinal, and suprainguinal procedures, procedure complexity 
      (RAI-PC) had little impact on model discrimination for mortality, did improve 
      discrimination for AAAs (0.84), TAAs (0.73), and TAAAs (0.80). Although the RAI 
      model was not a good predictor for major complications or LOS, discrimination 
      improved for both with the RAI-PC model. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty as measured by the RAI 
      was a good predictor of mortality overall after vascular surgery procedures. 
      Although the RAI was not a strong predictor of major complications or prolonged LOS, 
      the models improved with the addition of procedure characteristics like procedure 
      category and approach.

TI  - Exploring biologically relevant pathways in frailty.
PG  - 975-9
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glr061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a late-life syndrome of vulnerability to adverse health 
      outcomes characterized by a phenotype that includes muscle weakness, fatigue, and 
      inflammatory pathway activation. The identification of biologically relevant 
      pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the 
      necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with 
      longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically 
      relevant pathways that contribute to frailty. METHODS: Based on current 
      understanding of the physiological basis of frailty, we hypothesize that variation 
      in genes related to inflammation and muscle maintenance would associate with 
      frailty. One thousand three hundred and fifty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      were genotyped across 134 candidate genes using the Illumina Genotyping platform, 
      and the rank order by strength of association between frailty and genotype was 
      determined in a cross-sectional study. RESULTS: Although no single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism reached study-wide significance after controlling family-wise 
      false-discovery rate at 0.05, single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the 
      5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), Caspase 8 (CASP8), 
      CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), and 
      beta-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) loci were among those strongly associated 
      with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: The apoptosis- and transcription regulation-related 
      pathways highlighted by this preliminary analysis were consistent with prior gene 
      expression studies in a frail mouse model and provide useful etiological insights 
      for future biological studies of frailty.

TI  - FRAIL-HF, a study to evaluate the clinical complexity of heart failure in 
      nondependent older patients: rationale, methods and baseline characteristics.
PG  - 725-32
LID - 10.1002/clc.22345 [doi]
AB  - The clinical scenario of heart failure (HF) in older hospitalized patients is 
      complex and influenced by acute and chronic comorbidities, coexistent geriatric 
      syndromes, the patient's ability for self-care after discharge, and degree of social 
      support. The impact of all these factors on clinical outcomes or disability 
      evolution is not sufficiently known. FRAIL-HF is a prospective observational cohort 
      study designed to evaluate clinical outcomes (mortality and readmission), functional 
      evolution, quality of life, and use of social resources at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months 
      after admission in nondependent elderly patients hospitalized for HF. Clinical 
      features, medical treatment, self-care ability, and health literacy were 
      prospectively evaluated and a comprehensive geriatric assessment with special focus 
      on frailty was systematically performed in hospital to assess interactions and 
      relationships with postdischarge outcomes. Between May 2009 and May 2011, 450 
      consecutive patients with a mean age of 80 ± 6 years were enrolled. Comorbidity was 
      high (mean Charlson index, 3.4 ± 2.9). Despite being nondependent, 118 (26%) had 
      minor disability for basic activities of daily living, only 76 (16.2%) had no 
      difficulty in walking 400 meters, and 340 (75.5%) were living alone or with another 
      elderly person. In addition, 316 patients (70.2%) fulfilled frailty criteria. Even 
      nondependent older patients hospitalized for HF show a high prevalence of clinical 
      and nonclinical factors that may influence prognosis and are usually not considered 
      in routine clinical practice. The results of FRAIL-HF will provide important 
      information about the relationship between these factors and different postdischarge 
      clinical, functional, and quality-of-life outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to stressors, associated 
      to poor health outcomes. The aim of this study was to design and introduce a Frailty 
      Index (FI; according to the age-related accumulation of deficit model) in a large 
      cohort of hospitalized older persons, in order to benefit from its capacity to 
      comprehensively weight the risk profile of the individual. METHODS: Patients aged 65 
      and older enrolled in the REPOSI register from 2010 to 2016 were considered in the 
      present analyses. Variables recorded at the hospital admission (including 
      socio-demographic, physical, cognitive, functional and clinical factors) were used 
      to compute the FI. The prognostic impact of the FI on in-hospital and 12-month 
      mortality was assessed. RESULTS: Among the 4488 patients of the REPOSI register, 
      3847 were considered eligible for a 34-item FI computation. The median FI in the 
      sample was 0.27 (interquartile range 0.21-0.37). The FI was significantly predictive 
      of both in-hospital (OR 1.61, 95%CI 1.38-1.87) and overall (HR 1.46, 95%CI 
      1.32-1.62) mortality, also after adjustment for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: The FI 
      confirms its strong predictive value for negative outcomes. Its implementation in 
      cohort studies (including those conducted in the hospital setting) may provide 
      useful information for better weighting the complexity of the older person and 
      accordingly design personalized interventions.

TI  - Older women, intimate partner violence and mental health: a consideration of the 
      particular issues for health and healthcare practice.
PG  - 2177-2191
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13490 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history 
      of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. 
      BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and 
      well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate 
      partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has 
      not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to 
      address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's 
      experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health 
      issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic 
      synthesis of qualitative evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and 
      PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end 
      of December 2015. RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence 
      exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner 
      violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the 
      boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within 
      the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of 
      intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence 
      of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who 
      experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner 
      violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service 
      providers need to be aware of these. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and 
      healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management 
      and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they 
      are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of 
      abuse and this includes older women.

TI  - Lower Frailty Is Associated with Successful Cognitive Aging Among Older Adults with 
      HIV.
PG  - 157-163
LID - 10.1089/AID.2016.0189 [doi]
AB  - Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of 
      neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and 
      predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. 
      One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the 
      Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination 
      antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. 
      SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits 
      in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and 
      motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of 
      daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to 
      HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity 
      (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of 
      deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of 
      participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA 
      participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and 
      were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, 
      p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with 
      the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to 
      apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to 
      better appreciate the complexity of their health status.

TI  - The integration of frailty into clinical practice: preliminary results from the 
      Gérontopôle.
PG  - 714-20
LID - 10.1007/s12603-012-0391-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disability is commonly considered as an irreversible condition of 
      advanced age. Therefore, preventive actions need to be taken before the disabling 
      cascade is fully established, that is in the pre-disability phase defined "frailty 
      syndrome". The complexity and heterogeneity of frailty requires a clinical approach 
      based on multidimensionality and multidisciplinary. In this paper, we present the 
      main characteristics of the newborn Platform for Evaluation of Frailty and 
      Prevention of Disability (Toulouse, France). INTERVENTION: Persons aged 65 years and 
      older screened for frailty by general practitioners in the Toulouse area are invited 
      to undergo a multidisciplinary evaluation at the Platform. Here, the individual is 
      multidimensionality assessed in order to preventively detect potential risk factors 
      for disability. At the end of the comprehensive evaluation, the team members propose 
      the patient (in agreement with the general practitioner) a preventive intervention 
      program specifically tailored to the his/her needs and resources. RESULTS: Mean age 
      of our population is 82.7 years, with a large majority aged 75 years and older. Most 
      patients are women (61.9%) Approximately two thirds of patients received any kind of 
      regular help. Regarding level of frailty, 65 patients (41.4%) were pre-frail, and 83 
      (52.9%) frail. For what concerns the functional status, 83.9% of patients presented 
      slow gait speed, 53.8% were sedentary, and 57.7% had poor muscle strength. Only 
      27.2% of patients had a SPPB score equal to or higher than 10. Autonomy in ADL was 
      quite well preserved (mean ADL score 5.6 ± 0.8) as expected, suggesting that the 
      patients of the platform have not yet developed disability. Consistently, IADL 
      showed a marginal loss of autonomy reporting a mean score of 6.0 ± 2.3. About one 
      third of patients (33.1%) presented a MMSE score lower than 25. Dementia (measured 
      by the CDR scale) was observed in 11.6% of the platform population, whereas subjects 
      with mild cognitive impairment (that is CDR equal to 0.5) were 65.8%. New diagnosed 
      depressive disorders were relatively rare with only 3.2% of patients showing signs 
      of depression but some people were already treated. Numerous patients presented 
      vision problems with 10.4% having abnormal findings at the Amsler grid. Finally, it 
      is noteworthy that 9% of the platform population presented an objective state of 
      protein-energy malnutrition, 34% an early alteration of nutritional status, while 
      almost everyone (94.9%) had a vitamin D deficiency (partially explained by the 
      period of the year, that is winter-spring, of most of the measurements). CONCLUSION: 
      The Platform clinically evaluates and intervenes on frailty for the first time at 
      the general population-level. This model may serve as preliminary step towards a 
      wider identification of early signs of the disabling cascade in order to develop 
      more effective preventive interventions.

TI  - Frailty and geography: should these two factors be added to the ABCDE contemporary 
      guide to diabetes therapy?
PG  - 169-75
LID - 10.1002/dmrr.2762 [doi]
AB  - On the road towards personalized treatments for type 2 diabetes, we suggest here 
      that two parameters could be added to the ABCDE algorithm, 'F' for frailty and 'G' 
      for geography. Indeed, the progressive ageing of population is causing a 
      simultaneous increase of frailty worldwide. The identification of the optimal 
      therapeutic approach is often difficult in frail subjects because of the complexity 
      of 'frailty syndrome'. Nevertheless, given the relevance of diabetes in the 
      development and progression of frailty, a safe and effective cure of diabetes is 
      extremely important to guarantee a good medical outcome. There are few data about 
      diabetes treatment in this delicate category of patients, and the choice of the 
      appropriate therapy mostly remains a challenge. Moreover, type 2 diabetes affects 
      more than 382 million people of different countries, races and ethnicities. To face 
      the lack of solid evidence-based medicine for the treatment of diabetes in different 
      ethnic groups, it is extremely important to increase knowledge about the different 
      pathophysiology of diabetes according to ethnicity. In this way, a tailored approach 
      to treatment of various ethnic groups living in the same or different regions can 
      eventually be developed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Physiological complexity underlying heart rate dynamics and frailty status in 
      community-dwelling older women.
PG  - 1698-703
LID - 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01858.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess whether less physiological complexity underlying regulation of 
      heart rate dynamics, as indicated by lower approximate entropy for heart rate 
      (ApEn(HR)), is associated with frailty. For supporting validity, relationships 
      between frailty and traditional linear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were 
      also assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, a 
      community-based observational study, 1992 to 1995. PARTICIPANTS: Subset of 389 
      community-dwelling women aged years and older with moderate to severe disability 
      with ApEn(HR) data (convenience sampling). MEASUREMENTS: Electrocardiographic Holter 
      recordings obtained over 2- to 3-hour periods were processed for ApEn(HR) and HRV 
      measures. ApEn(HR) is a nonlinear statistic that quantifies the regularity of heart 
      rate fluctuations over time. Lower ApEn(HR) is characteristic of heart rate time 
      series containing a high proportion of repetitive patterns. Frailty was defined 
      according to validated phenotype criteria. RESULTS: Median ApEn(HR) was lower in 
      frail than in nonfrail subjects (P=.02). Lower ApEn(HR) (top quartile) was 
      associated with lower likelihood of frailty than higher ApEn(HR) (bottom three 
      quartiles) (odds ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.26-0.86), even after 
      adjustment for major confounders. Frailty was consistently associated with lower HRV 
      as assessed using time- and frequency-domain indices. CONCLUSION: This study 
      supports the notion that less physiological complexity marks frailty and provides an 
      empirical basis to the concept of frailty as a syndrome of homeostatic impairment. 
      Future research will determine whether noninvasive measures of physiological 
      complexity underlying heart rate dynamics might be useful for screening and 
      monitoring of clinical vulnerability in older adults.

TI  - Transforming emergency services for frail older people in hospital.
PG  - 18-9
LID - 10.7748/nm.22.3.18.s29 [doi]
AB  - Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a 
      difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the 
      likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve 
      services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with 
      more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is 
      an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of 
      this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ 
      to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop 
      effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.

TI  - An International Perspective on Chronic Multimorbidity: Approaching the Elephant in 
      the Room.
PG  - 1350-1356
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glx178 [doi]
AB  - Multimorbidity is a common and burdensome condition that may affect quality of life, 
      increase medical needs, and make people live more years of life with disability. 
      Negative outcomes related to multimorbidity occur beyond what we would expect from 
      the summed effect of single conditions, as chronic diseases interact with each 
      other, mutually enhancing their negative effects, and eventually leading to new 
      clinical phenotypes. Moreover, multimorbidity mirrors an accelerated global 
      susceptibility and a loss of resilience, which are both hallmarks of aging. Due to 
      the complexity of its assessment and definition, and the lack of clear evidence 
      steering its management, multimorbidity represents one of the main current 
      challenges for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The authors of this 
      article recently reflected on these issues during two twin international symposia at 
      the 2016 European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS) meeting in Lisbon, 
      Portugal, and the 2016 Gerontological Society of America (GSA) meeting in New 
      Orleans, USA. The present work summarizes the most relevant aspects related to 
      multimorbidity, with the ultimate goal to identify knowledge gaps and suggest future 
      directions to approach this condition.

TI  - Frequent Use of Emergency Departments by the Elderly Population When Continuing Care 
      Is Not Well Established.
PG  - e0165939
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0165939 [doi]
LID - e0165939
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The elderly, who suffer from multiple chronic diseases, represent a 
      substantial proportion of Emergency Department (ED) frequent users, thus 
      contributing to ED overcrowding, although they could benefit from other health care 
      facilities, if those were available. The aim of this study was to evaluate and 
      characterize hospital visits of older patients (age 65 or greater) to the ED of a 
      university teaching hospital in Rome from the 1st of January to the 31st of December 
      2014, in order to identify clinical and social characteristics potentially 
      associated with "elderly frequent users". MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective 
      study was performed during the calendar year 2014 (1st January 2014 - 31st December 
      2014) analyzing all ED admissions to the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata. 
      Variables collected included age, triage code, arrival data, discharge diagnosis, 
      and visit outcome. We performed a risk analysis using univariate binary logistic 
      regression models. RESULTS: A total number of 38,016 patients accessed the ED, 
      generating 46,820 accesses during the study period, with an average of 1.23 accesses 
      for patient. The elderly population represented a quarter of the total ED population 
      and had an increased risk of frequent use (OR 1.5: CI 1.4-1.7) and hospitalization 
      (OR 3.8: CI 3.7-4). Moreover, they showed a greater diagnostic complexity, as 
      demonstrated by the higher incidence of yellow and red priority codes compared to 
      other ED populations (OR 3.1: CI 2.9-3.2). DISCUSSION: Older patients presented 
      clinical and social characteristics related to the definition of "elderly frail 
      frequent users". The fact that a larger number of hospitalizations occurred in such 
      patients is indirect evidence of frailty in this specific population, suggesting 
      that hospital admissions may be an inappropriate response to frailty, especially 
      when continued care is not established. CONCLUSION: Enhancement of continuity of 
      care, establishment of a tracking system for those who are at greater risk of 
      visiting the ED and evaluating fragile individuals should be the highest priority in 
      addressing ED frequent usage by the elderly.

TI  - Considering Frailty in SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development: How Geriatricians Can Assist.
PG  - 731-738
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S295522 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted frail older adults, especially 
      residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. This has appropriately led to 
      prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care for them, 
      in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct 
      immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood through a 
      lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 
      vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally 
      tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being 
      implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not tested in Phase 1/2/3 
      clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. We argue that 
      geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to the development, 
      testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We discuss roles 
      for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development process, covering vaccine 
      design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment and interpretation of illness 
      definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of relevant health measures such as 
      frailty and function, analysis methods to account for frailty and differential 
      vulnerability, contributions in regulatory and advisory roles, post-marketing 
      surveillance, and program implementation and public health messaging. In presenting 
      key recommendations pertinent to each stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on 
      how to push the field of vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty. Making 
      vaccines that can benefit frail older adults will benefit everyone in the fight 
      against COVID-19.

TI  - Association of the clinical frailty scale with hospital outcomes.
PG  - 943-9
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcv066 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical frailty scale (CFS) was validated as a predictor of adverse 
      outcomes in community-dwelling older people. In our hospital, the use of the CFS in 
      emergency admissions of people aged ≥ 75 years was introduced under the 
      Commissioning for Quality and Innovation payment framework. AIM: We retrospectively 
      studied the association of the CFS with patient characteristics and outcomes. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective observational study in a large tertiary university National 
      Health Service hospital in UK. METHODS: The CFS was correlated with transfer to 
      specialist Geriatric ward, length of stay (LOS), in-patient mortality and 30-day 
      readmission rate. RESULTS: Between 1st August 2013 and 31st July 2014, there were 11 
      271 emergency admission episodes of people aged ≥ 75 years (all specialties), 
      corresponding to 7532 unique patients (first admissions); of those, 5764 had the CFS 
      measured by the admitting team (81% of them within 72 hr of admission). After 
      adjustment for age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index and history of dementia 
      and/or current cognitive concern, the CFS was an independent predictor of in-patient 
      mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.48 to 1.74, 
      P < 0.001], transfer to Geriatric ward (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.42, P < 0.001) 
      and LOS ≥ 10 days (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.23, P < 0.001). The CFS was not a 
      multivariate predictor of 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: The CFS may help predict 
      in-patient mortality and target specialist geriatric resources within the hospital. 
      Usual hospital metrics such as mortality and LOS should take into account measurable 
      patient complexity.

TI  - Dental Care in the Frail Older Adult: Special Considerations and Recommendations.
PG  - 363-8
AB  - Frail older adults disproportionately suffer from untreated dental problems. 
      Age-related biological changes to hard and soft dental tissues, existing medical 
      conditions, polypharmacy, diet and uncontrolled plaque exacerbate the problem. All 
      of these factors increase the complexity of treatment and will differ greatly from 
      standard treatment of younger adults. This article discusses the key considerations 
      and suggestions for risk assessment, disease management, treatment planning and 
      palliative care to maintain the patient's comfort and quality of life.

TI  - Reflection on the pharmaceutical service in nursing homes; understanding reality to 
      cover needs.
PG  - 302-15
LID - 10.7399/fh.2016.40.4.10430 [doi]
AB  - The increasing concern regarding chronic care, which is a consequence of the current 
      demographic progression, and the need to decrease the costs associated with its 
      care, places a focus on social care homes caring for highly dependent patients. 
      Simultaneously, the residential facilities are progressing in order to care for 
      fragile patients with increasingly complexity, even though, with some exceptions, it 
      is in parallel with the healthcare system. Within this reality, pharmaceutical care 
      is developing very differently in all the autonomic regions, and has become a reason 
      for controversy. In this sense, diverse factors related with the patient care 
      setting, but also linked to different pharmaceutical levels, make it difficult to 
      implement a patient care model. Faced with this scenario, it seems reasonable to 
      analyze the situation from the perspective of the healthcare requirements of the 
      institutionalized persons in these facilities, and in terms of the patient care that 
      we can and should provide; subsequently, and based on this, we should be able to 
      propose the basic guidelines for developing an efficient model of pharmaceutical 
      care integrated within this patient care setting.

TI  - The impact of medical issues in inpatient geriatric psychiatry.
PG  - 23-46
AB  - At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. 
      Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from 
      coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are 
      important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of 
      hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes 
      adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better 
      treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need 
      for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the 
      importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.

TI  - Ability of Emergency Department Physicians Using a Functional Autonomy-Assessing 
      Version of the Triage Risk Screening Tool to Detect Frail Older Patients Who Require 
      Mobile Geriatric Team Consultation.
PG  - 634-641
LID - 10.1007/s12603-020-1378-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frailty in older people associates with poor outcomes. Screening by ED 
      physicians would greatly facilitate detection of frail older patients but our 
      previous attempt to introduce routine ED-physician screening with Short Emergency 
      Geriatric Assessment (SEGA), a 13-item frailty tool that French geriatricians use to 
      identify frail patients, failed due to its length and complexity. A national 
      committee recently generated a new version of the fast and simple 5-item Triage Risk 
      Screening Tool (TRST) in which a subjective item ('nurse concern') was replaced by 
      an item assessing basic activities of daily living. The ability of ED physicians 
      using this French-TRST to accurately detect frail patients who require comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment was assessed. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study on 
      diagnostic accuracy relative to the gold standard, namely, geriatrician-administered 
      SEGA. SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital, France. SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS: The 
      participants were 498 ≥75-year-old patients who visited the ED in 2018-2019 and were 
      administered French-TRSTs by first ED physicians and then geriatricians, followed by 
      SEGA, all within 24 hours. Diagnostic accuracy variables were calculated. 
      Geriatrician-TRST was used to identify TRST items that associated with ED physician 
      misclassification of frail patients. RESULTS: Emergency-TRST was significantly less 
      sensitive than Geriatrician-TRST (88% vs. 93%; p=0.04) and tended to have lower 
      negative predictive value (66% vs. 77%; p=0.09). Emergency-TRSTs rated four 
      French-TRST items less well than Geriatrician-TRSTs. CONCLUSIONS: As a substitute 
      for SEGA in the ED, the French-TRST performed quite well overall but the ED 
      physicians detected frail patients less well than the geriatricians. Modifications 
      of the French-TRST that may improve the diagnostic performance of ED physicians are 
      discussed.

TI  - Co-designing Urban Living Solutions to Improve Older People's Mobility and 
      Well-Being.
PG  - 409-422
LID - 10.1007/s11524-018-0232-z [doi]
AB  - Mobility is a key aspect of active ageing enabling participation and autonomy into 
      later life. Remaining active brings multiple physical but also social benefits 
      leading to higher levels of well-being. With globally increasing levels of 
      urbanisation alongside demographic shifts meaning in many parts of the world this 
      urban population will be older people, the challenge is how cities should evolve to 
      enable so-called active ageing. This paper reports on a co-design study with 117 
      participants investigating the interaction of existing urban spaces and 
      infrastructure on mobility and well-being for older residents (aged 55 + years) in 
      three cities. A mixed method approach was trialled to identify locations beneficial 
      to subjective well-being and participant-led solutions to urban mobility challenges. 
      Spatial analysis was used to identify key underlying factors in locations and 
      infrastructure that promoted or compromised mobility and well-being for 
      participants. Co-designed solutions were assessed for acceptability or co-benefits 
      amongst a wider cross-section of urban residents (n = 233) using online and 
      face-to-face surveys in each conurbation. Our analysis identified three critical 
      intersecting and interacting thematic problems for urban mobility amongst older 
      people: The quality of physical infrastructure; issues around the delivery, 
      governance and quality of urban systems and services; and the attitudes and 
      behaviors of individuals that older people encounter. This identified complexity 
      reinforces the need for policy responses that may not necessarily involve design or 
      retrofit measures, but instead might challenge perceptions and behaviors of use and 
      access to urban space. Our co-design results further highlight that solutions need 
      to move beyond the generic and placeless, instead embedding specific locally 
      relevant solutions in inherently geographical spaces, populations and processes to 
      ensure they relate to the intricacies of place.

TI  - Psychological transition into a residential care facility: older people's 
      experiences.
PG  - 1159-68
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05280.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper is to discuss the complexity of admission into a 
      residential care facility from a psychological perspective for residents and their 
      relatives and the resulting implications for nursing care. BACKGROUND: Admission 
      into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well 
      as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful 
      involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is 
      important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. DATA SOURCES: The 
      background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into 
      nursing homes and psychological transitions. DISCUSSION: The concepts of transition 
      from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by 
      residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very 
      different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a 
      difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require 
      improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will 
      support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      NURSING: Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication 
      strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that 
      occurs when an older person is admitted into care. CONCLUSION: Improving the 
      psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal 
      for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal 
      constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a 
      more positive experience.

TI  - How general practitioners would deprescribe in frail oldest-old with polypharmacy - 
      the LESS study.
PG  - 169
LID - 10.1186/s12875-018-0856-9 [doi]
LID - 169
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many oldest-old (> 80-years) with multimorbidity and polypharmacy are at 
      high risk of inappropriate use of medication, but we know little about whether and 
      how GPs would deprescribe, especially in the frail oldest-old. We aimed to determine 
      whether, how, and why Swiss GPs deprescribe for this population. METHODS: GPs took 
      an online survey that presented case-vignettes of a frail oldest-old patient with 
      and without history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and asked if they would 
      deprescribe any of seven medications. We calculated percentages of GPs willing to 
      deprescribe at least one medication in the case with CVD and compared these with the 
      case without CVD using paired t-tests. We also included open-ended questions to 
      capture reasons for deprescribing and asked which factors could influence their 
      decision to deprescribe by asking for their agreement on a 5-point-Likert-scale. 
      RESULTS: Of the 282 GPs we invited, 157 (56%) responded: 73% were men; mean age was 
      56. In the case-vignette without CVD, 98% of GPs deprescribed at least one 
      medication (usually cardiovascular preventive medications) stating it had no 
      indication nor benefit. They would lower the dose or prescribe pain medication as 
      needed to reduce side effects. Their response was much the same when the patient had 
      a history of CVD. GPs reported they were influenced by 'risk' and 'benefit' of 
      medications, 'quality of life', and 'life expectancy', and prioritized the patient's 
      wishes and priorities when deprescribing. CONCLUSION: Swiss GPs were willing to 
      deprescribe cardiovascular preventive medication when it lacked indication but 
      tended to retain pain medication. Developing tools for GPs to assist them in 
      balancing the risks and benefits of medication in the context of patient values may 
      improve deprescribing activities in practice.

TI  - Geriatric oncology: a clinical approach to the older patient with cancer.
PG  - 870-80
AB  - Due to the ageing of the population and the sharp increase in life expectancy, 
      cancer in the older person has become an increasingly common problem in the Western 
      world. Although several authors have stressed that elderly cancer patients deserve 
      special attention as a target group for research efforts, older aged patients are 
      still less likely to be offered participation in clinical trials. The cellular and 
      molecular mechanisms regulating the physiological process of ageing and senescence 
      are far from understood, although inflammation is likely to play an important role, 
      at least in some cancers. In addition, the relationship between ageing and cancer 
      risk is also far from understood. One of the most intriguing aspects of ageing is 
      how different the ageing process is from person to person; the basis for this 
      variation is largely unknown. Population-based studies and longitudinal surveys have 
      shown that comorbidity and physical and mental functioning are important risk 
      factors; thus, a meaningful assessment of comorbidity and disability should be 
      implemented in clinical practice. Modern geriatrics is targeted towards patients 
      with multiple problems. Such patients are not simply old, but are geriatric patients 
      because of interacting psychosocial and physical problems. As a consequence, the 
      health status of old persons cannot be evaluated by merely describing the single 
      disease, and/or by measuring the response, or survival after treatment. Conversely, 
      it is necessary to conduct a more comprehensive investigation of the 'functional 
      status' of the aged person. A geriatric consultation provides a variety of relevant 
      information and enables the healthcare team to manage the complexity of health care 
      in the elderly; this process is referred to as the Comprehensive Geriatric 
      Assessment (CGA). The use of CGA is now being introduced into oncological practice. 
      The definition of frailty is still controversial and represents a major issue of 
      debate in clinical geriatrics. As the frail population increases, clinical trials in 
      frail persons are needed. The usefulness of these trials requires a consensus as to 
      the definition of frailty. Clearly, the management of older persons with cancer 
      requires the acquisition of special skills in the evaluation of the older person and 
      in the recognition and management of emergencies as well as experience in geriatric 
      case management.

AB  - Delirium is a common postoperative surgical complication associated with poor 
      outcomes. The complexity of delirium demands that each patient be assessed 
      individually and a tailored prevention and treatment regimen be put in place. 
      Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies are available to achieve this goal.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to develop a new predictive model to measure 
      complexity of patients in medical wards. SETTING: 29 Internal Medicine departments 
      in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort was made of 541 consecutive 
      patients hospitalized for any cause, aged more than 40 years and with at least two 
      chronic diseases. First, we applied a hierarchical cluster analysis and the 
      principal component analysis (PCA) to a panel of questionnaires [comorbidity 
      (Charlson, CIRS), clinical stability (MEWS), social frailty (Flugelman), cognitive 
      dysfunction (SPSMQ), depression (5-item GDS), functional dependence (ADL, IADL, 
      Barthel), risk of sore threats (Exton-Smith scale), nutrition (MNA), pain (NRPS), 
      adherence to therapy (Morisky scale)], in order to select domains informative for 
      the definition of complexity. The following step was to create the score(s) needed 
      to quantify it. RESULTS: Two main clusters were identified: the first includes 7 
      questionnaires whose common denominator is dependence and frailty, the second 
      consists of 3 questionnaires representative of comorbidity. Globally, they account 
      for about 70% of the total variance (55.2% and 13.8%, respectively). The first 
      principal component was simplified in "Complimed Score 1" (CS1) as a recalibrated 
      average between the Barthel Index and the Exton Smith score, whereas the second 
      cluster was approximated to "Complimed Score 2" (CS2), by using the Charlson score 
      only. CONCLUSIONS: Complexity is a two-dimensional clinical phenomenon. The 
      FADOI-Complimed Score(s) is a new tool useful for the routine evaluation of 
      complexity in medical patients, simple to use and taking around 10 minutes to 
      complete.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty has emerged as an important predictor of operative risk among 
      elderly surgical patients. However, the complexity of prospective frailty scores has 
      limited their widespread use. Our goal was to develop two frailty-based surgical 
      risk models using only routine preoperative data. Our hypothesis was that these 
      models could easily integrate into an electronic medical record to predict 30-day 
      morbidity and mortality. STUDY DESIGN: American College of Surgeons NSQIP 
      Participant Use Data Files from 2005 to 2010 were reviewed, and patients 65 years 
      and older who underwent elective lower gastrointestinal surgery were identified. Two 
      multivariate logistic regression models were constructed and internally 
      cross-validated. The first included simple functional data, a comorbidity index 
      based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, demographics, BMI, and laboratory data (ie, 
      albumin <3.4 g/dL, hematocrit <35%, and creatinine >2 mg/dL). The second model 
      contained only parameters that can directly autopopulate from an electronic medical 
      record (ie, demographics, laboratory data, BMI, and American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists score). To assess diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating 
      characteristic curves were constructed. RESULTS: There were 76,106 patients who met 
      criteria for inclusion. Thirty-day mortality was seen in 2,853 patients or 3.7% of 
      the study population and 18,436 patients (24.2%) experienced a major complication. 
      The c-statistic of the first expanded model was 0.813 for mortality and 0.629 for 
      morbidity. The second simplified model had a c-statistic of 0.795 for mortality and 
      0.621 for morbidity. Both models were well calibrated per the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that routine preoperative data can approximate 
      frailty and predict geriatric-specific surgical risk. The models' predicative powers 
      were comparable with that of established prospective frailty scores. Our calculator 
      could be used as a low-cost simple screen for high-risk individuals who might 
      require additional evaluation or specialized services.

TI  - Depression and disability in late life: directions for future research.
PG  - 102-12
AB  - The author reviews evidence from epidemiologic and clinical studies suggesting a 
      reciprocal, potentially spiraling, relationship between depression and disability in 
      older adults. The discussion outlines possible methodological and conceptual 
      explanations for this evidence and poses avenues for future research. An underlying 
      theme is the impact of how disability and depression are measured on the nature of 
      empirical evidence and its interpretation. Measures and corresponding analytic 
      strategies that capture the complexity of depression, disability, and their 
      relationship are expected to lead to the most fruitful approaches to reducing the 
      burden of depression and disability in the lives of older adults.

TI  - A comparison of the usability of a standard and an age-friendly smartphone launcher: 
      experimental evidence from usability testing with older adults.
PG  - 337-342
LID - 10.1097/MRR.0000000000000307 [doi]
AB  - Age-friendly smartphone launchers are tools designed to enhance smartphone handling 
      among older adults with cognitive and functional limitations. Although evidence 
      exists about the positive effects of age-friendly smartphone launchers on older 
      adults' usability performance in general, little is known about how the design and 
      interface complexity of these launchers affect their interface usability 
      effectiveness and efficiency compared with standard Android smartphone interfaces. 
      Thus, in this study, a randomized crossover experiment involving 50 older smartphone 
      users, aged 60 years and above, was guided by the principles of summative usability 
      testing to assess whether an age-friendly launcher performs better than a standard 
      Android launcher performs and to investigate the relationship between the user 
      interface complexity and usability performance of launchers. The results of 
      usability tests in which each participant solved 10 tasks on both launchers indicate 
      that the two tested launchers had comparable effectiveness (i.e. completeness with 
      which participants achieved the test tasks' goals), whereas the age-friendly 
      launcher marginally outperformed its standard Android counterpart in terms of 
      efficiency (i.e. the amount of time used by participants to solve the test tasks). 
      The results also demonstrate that lower user interface complexity is associated with 
      higher effectiveness and efficiency, suggesting that age-friendly smartphone 
      launchers might lead to higher adoption rates of smartphones among older adults if 
      interface designers could reduce their cognitive complexity by limiting the number 
      of steps and alternative paths for task completion.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the profile of patients evaluated by Nurse Care Management 
      in an Emergency Department and identify the type of alternative healthcare resource 
      assigned and report the results of clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Prospective follow-up, on admission to the Emergency Department in an acute hospital 
      and on discharge from the alternative healthcare resource, of patients assessed by 
      Nurse Care Management, from July to December 2015. The patient characteristics, 
      social environment and results of clinical practice were studied. RESULTS: 190 
      patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 (59.8%) cases from the 
      Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) 
      cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital 
      and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, 
      presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with 
      dementia, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and 
      cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before 
      emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative 
      healthcare resource (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with advanced age, 
      complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary 
      care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other 
      patients. After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional 
      capacity and present less polypharmacy.

TI  - Frailty and impaired cardiac autonomic control: new insights from principal 
      components aggregation of traditional heart rate variability indices.
PG  - 682-7
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glp013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age-related deterioration in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms leads to 
      decreased complexity in their output. For example, the degradation of cardiac 
      autonomic control results in loss of complexity in the heart rate signal. Frailty is 
      a state of critically impaired homeostasis that results in heightened vulnerability 
      to stressors. We propose a new measure of heart rate variability (HRV) to capture 
      the impairment in cardiac autonomic control associated with frailty. METHODS: 
      Traditional time and frequency domain indices of HRV were obtained from 2-hour 
      ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 276 women (65-101 years old) in the Women's 
      Health and Aging Study-I. Principal components analysis was conducted on the 
      correlation matrix of HRV indices. Frailty was defined using a validated instrument. 
      Regression models were used to evaluate associations of HRV measures with age, 
      frailty, and 5-year mortality. RESULTS: The first two principal components (PCs), 
      PC1 and PC2, explained 90% of the variance in HRV indices. PC1 is the mean of 
      log-transformed HRV indices. PC2 is a linear combination of log-transformed indices, 
      with positive weights for very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and standard 
      deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), and negative weights for high frequency (HF), 
      root-mean-squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and proportion of 
      all N-N intervals that are larger than 50 ms (pNN50). Decreases in SDNN, VLF, LF, 
      and LF/HF were associated with an increased risk of frailty. PC2 was more strongly 
      associated with age (beta = -.23, p < .001) and frailty (beta = -.73, p < 10(-5)) 
      than were the individual HRV indices and LF/HF. PC2 was also the best predictor of 
      5-year mortality (beta = -.60, p < 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac autonomic control, 
      as reflected by HRV, is impaired in frailty. A new measure derived from PC 
      aggregation of traditional HRV indices provides a compact summary of this 
      impairment.

TI  - Psychiatric comorbidity in the frail patient.
PG  - 139-42
AB  - The psychopathological syndromes associated with the organic disease in the frail 
      patient are put in the focus of our studies. In the frail patient, mood disorders 
      show a multifacet appearance often associated to the invalidating pathologies or 
      determined by the interaction between the diseases and the individual personality 
      traits. A psychotic break can worsen the evolution of the clinical status. In the 
      clinical practice with the frail elderly, the diagnostic and therapeutic phases 
      change to some extent. The psychiatric diagnosis based upon the DSM-IV-TR shall 
      include a multiaxial approach, with the general medical conditions coded on axis 
      III. The therapeutic planning must be based on rules taken from the field of 
      sciences of complexity; in the field of complexity, the evolution of the clinical 
      status is not expectable and the points of discontinuity are the rule. The 
      difficulties to reach a "secure base" makes the therapeutic dynamics be attracted 
      from areas of stability in the mid of chaos, named "chaotic attractors".

TI  - A Distinct Pattern of Circulating Amino Acids Characterizes Older Persons with 
      Physical Frailty and Sarcopenia: Results from the BIOSPHERE Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu10111691 [doi]
LID - 1691
AB  - Physical frailty and sarcopenia (PF&amp;S) are hallmarks of aging that share a 
      common pathogenic background. Perturbations in protein/amino acid metabolism may 
      play a role in the development of PF&amp;S. In this initial report, 68 
      community-dwellers aged 70 years and older, 38 with PF&amp;S and 30 non-sarcopenic, 
      non-frail controls (nonPF&amp;S), were enrolled as part as the "BIOmarkers 
      associated with Sarcopenia and Physical frailty in EldeRly pErsons" (BIOSPHERE) 
      study. A panel of 37 serum amino acids and derivatives was assayed by UPLC-MS. 
      Partial Least Squares⁻Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to characterize the 
      amino acid profile of PF&amp;S. The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found 
      to be three latent variables. The proportion of correct classification was 76.6 ± 
      3.9% (75.1 ± 4.6% for enrollees with PF&amp;S; 78.5 ± 6.0% for nonPF&amp;S). Older 
      adults with PF&amp;S were characterized by higher levels of asparagine, aspartic 
      acid, citrulline, ethanolamine, glutamic acid, sarcosine, and taurine. The profile 
      of nonPF&amp;S participants was defined by higher concentrations of α-aminobutyric 
      acid and methionine. Distinct profiles of circulating amino acids and derivatives 
      characterize older people with PF&amp;S. The dissection of these patterns may 
      provide novel insights into the role played by protein/amino acid perturbations in 
      the disabling cascade and possible new targets for interventions.

PG  - 61-81
LID - 10.1177/1074840710394855 [doi]
AB  - Older adults and their family caregivers face numerous decisions about hospital 
      discharge, including where they will go and how they will receive care. Older adults 
      who account for nearly 37% of all hospital discharges often need care and support of 
      family members at the time of hospital discharge. This study examines decisions made 
      by hospitalized older adults, families, and health care team members (HCTMs) about 
      hospital discharge. The sample included older adults (n = 13, average age 84), 
      family members (n = 12, average age 71), and HCTMs (n = 7, average age 47). Findings 
      revealed the complexity of hospital discharge planning for older adults through five 
      themes as follows: (a) home, (b) staying independent, (c) "advocating for them," (d) 
      deciding what to tell, and (e) changing the plan.

      hospitalized older adults.
PG  - 129

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) provides detailed information 
      on clinical, functional and cognitive aspects of older patients and is especially 
      useful for assessing frail individuals. Although a large proportion of hospitalized 
      older adults demonstrate a high level of complexity, CGA was not developed 
      specifically for this setting. Our aim was to evaluate the application of a CGA 
      model for the clinical characterization and prognostic prediction of hospitalized 
      older adults. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study including 746 
      patients aged 60 years and over who were admitted to a geriatric ward of a 
      university hospital between January 2009 and December 2011, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
      The proposed CGA was applied to evaluate all patients at admission. The primary 
      outcome was in-hospital death, and the secondary outcomes were delirium, nosocomial 
      infections, functional decline and length of stay. Multivariate binary logistic 
      regression was performed to assess independent factors associated with these 
      outcomes, including socio-demographic, clinical, functional, cognitive, and 
      laboratory variables. Impairment in ten CGA components was particularly 
      investigated: polypharmacy, activities of daily living (ADL) dependency, 
      instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) dependency, depression, dementia, 
      delirium, urinary incontinence, falls, malnutrition, and poor social support. 
      RESULTS: The studied patients were mostly women (67.4%), and the mean age was 
      80.5±7.9 years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the following 
      independent factors associated with in-hospital death: IADL dependency (OR=4.02; 
      CI=1.52-10.58; p=.005); ADL dependency (OR=2.39; CI=1.25-4.56; p=.008); malnutrition 
      (OR=2.80; CI=1.63-4.83; p<.001); poor social support (OR=5.42; CI=2.93-11.36; 
      p<.001); acute kidney injury (OR=3.05; CI=1.78-5.27; p<.001); and the presence of 
      pressure ulcers (OR=2.29; CI=1.04-5.07; p=.041). ADL dependency was independently 
      associated with both delirium incidence and nosocomial infections (respectively: 
      OR=3.78; CI=2.30-6.20; p<.001 and OR=2.30; CI=1.49-3.49; p<.001). The number of 
      impaired CGA components was also found to be associated with in-hospital death 
      (p<.001), delirium incidence (p<.001) and nosocomial infections (p=.005). 
      Additionally, IADL dependency, malnutrition and history of falls predicted longer 
      hospitalizations. There were no significant changes in overall functional status 
      during the hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: CGA identified patients at higher risk of 
      in-hospital death and adverse outcomes, of which those with functional dependence, 
      malnutrition and poor social support were foremost.

TI  - Fidelity and moderating factors in complex interventions: a case study of a 
      continuum of care program for frail elderly people in health and social care.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/1748-5908-7-23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies measuring fidelity of complex interventions have mainly 
      evaluated adherence, and not taken factors affecting adherence into consideration. A 
      need for studies that clarify the concept of fidelity and the function of factors 
      moderating fidelity has been emphasized. The aim of the study was to systematically 
      evaluate implementation fidelity and possible factors influencing fidelity of a 
      complex care continuum intervention for frail elderly people. METHODS: The 
      intervention was a systematization of the collaboration between a nurse with 
      geriatric expertise situated at the emergency department, the hospital ward staff, 
      and a multi-professional team with a case manager in the municipal care services for 
      older people. Implementation was evaluated between September 2008 and May 2010 with 
      observations of work practices, stakeholder interviews, and document analysis 
      according to a modified version of The Conceptual Framework for Implementation 
      Fidelity. RESULTS: A total of 16 of the 18 intervention components were to a great 
      extent delivered as planned, while some new components were added to the model. No 
      changes in the frequency or duration of the 18 components were observed, but the 
      dose of the added components varied over time. Changes in fidelity were caused in a 
      complex, interrelated fashion by all the moderating factors in the framework, i.e., 
      context, staff and participant responsiveness, facilitation, recruitment, and 
      complexity. DISCUSSION: The Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity was 
      empirically useful and included comprehensive measures of factors affecting 
      fidelity. Future studies should focus on developing the framework with regard to how 
      to investigate relationships between the moderating factors and fidelity over time.

TI  - Nonlinear multisystem physiological dysregulation associated with frailty in older 
      women: implications for etiology and treatment.
PG  - 1049-57
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glp076 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty in older adults, defined as a constellation of signs and 
      symptoms, is associated with abnormal levels in individual physiological systems. We 
      tested the hypothesis that it is the critical mass of physiological systems abnormal 
      that is associated with frailty, over and above the status of each individual 
      system, and that the relationship is nonlinear. METHODS: Using data on women aged 
      70-79 years from the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and II, multiple analytic 
      approaches assessed the cross-sectional association of frailty with eight 
      physiological measures. RESULTS: Abnormality in each system (anemia, inflammation, 
      insulin-like growth factor-1, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, hemoglobin A1c, 
      micronutrients, adiposity, and fine motor speed) was significantly associated with 
      frailty status. However, adjusting for the level of each system measure, the mean 
      number of systems impaired significantly and nonlinearly predicted frailty. Those 
      with three or more systems impaired were most likely to be frail, with odds of 
      frailty increasing with number of systems at abnormal level, from odds ratios (ORs) 
      of 4.8 to 11 to 26 for those with one to two, three to four, and five or more 
      systems abnormal (p < .05 for all). Finally, two subgroups were identified, one with 
      isolated or no systems abnormal and a second (in 30%) with multiple systems 
      abnormal. The latter group was independently associated with being frail (OR = 2.6, 
      p < .05), adjusting for confounders and chronic diseases and then controlling for 
      individual systems. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings indicate that the 
      likelihood of frailty increases nonlinearly in relationship to the number of 
      physiological systems abnormal, and the number of abnormal systems is more 
      predictive than the individual abnormal system. These findings support theories that 
      aggregate loss of complexity, with aging, in physiological systems is an important 
      cause of frailty. Implications are that a threshold loss of complexity, as indicated 
      by number of systems abnormal, may undermine homeostatic adaptive capacity, leading 
      to the development of frailty and its associated risk for subsequent adverse 
      outcomes. It further suggests that replacement of any one deficient system may not 
      be sufficient to prevent or ameliorate frailty.

TI  - Mortality and Functional Outcomes After Minor Urological Surgery in Nursing Home 
      Residents: A National Study.
PG  - 909-915
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15302 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine outcomes of minor urological surgery in frail older adults. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: U.S. nursing homes (NHs). PARTICIPANTS: 
      NH residents aged 65 and older undergoing minor inpatient urological surgery 
      (cystoscopy, bladder biopsy, transurethral resection of bladder tumor, prostate 
      biopsy, transurethral resection of prostate, removal of ureteral obstruction, 
      suprapubic tube placement) in the United States between 2004 and 2012 (N=34,605). 
      MEASUREMENTS: One-year mortality and changes in functional status before and after 
      surgery using the Minimum Data Set Activity of Daily Living (MDS-ADL) summary scale. 
      RESULTS: Overall 1-year mortality was 50%, and on average, residents had a 1.9-point 
      worsening in their MDS-ADL score at 1 year, whereas the most highly functional 
      residents (baseline quartile of MDS-ADL scores (0-12)) had a 4.7-point worsening in 
      their MDS-ADL scores at 1 year. Functional decline in residents 1 year after surgery 
      was associated with decline in function in the 6 months before surgery (adjusted 
      hazard ratio (aH)=2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.29-2.49), emergency 
      procedures (aHR=1.37, 95% CI=1.31-1.43), older age (≥85 vs 65-74, aHR=1.17, 95% 
      CI=1.11-1.23), and baseline cognitive impairment (aHR=1.15, 95% CI=1.11-1.20). 
      CONCLUSION: Despite the low complexity of minor urological procedures, NH residents 
      experience high mortality and many demonstrate sustained functional decline up to 
      1-year postoperatively.

TI  - Palliative care for frail older adults: "there are things I can't do anymore that I 
      wish I could . . . ".
PG  - 2245-53
AB  - Frailty in older adults is increasingly a recognized syndrome of decline, sometimes 
      subtle, in function and health that may be amenable to available approaches to care. 
      Frailty manifests the following core clinical features: loss of strength, weight 
      loss, low levels of activity, poor endurance or fatigue, and slowed performance. The 
      presence of 3 or more of these features is associated with adverse outcomes 
      including falls, new or worsened function impairment, hospitalization, and death. In 
      this article, we use the case of Mrs K to describe the challenges of recognizing 
      frailty in clinical practice, common problems and symptoms that frail older adults 
      experience, and approaches to these issues that clinicians may incorporate into 
      their practices. We discuss the importance of advance care planning, 
      provider-patient communication, and appropriate palliative care and hospice referral 
      for frail older adults. Frailty is associated with symptomatic long-term disease, 
      decline in function, and abbreviated survival. Therefore, when frailty is severe, 
      delivery of palliative care focused on relief of discomfort and enhancement of 
      quality of life is highly appropriate. The application of multidisciplinary, 
      team-based palliative approaches and of up-to-date geriatrics knowledge is 
      beneficial for treating these patients because of the complexity of their coexisting 
      social, psychological, and medical needs.

TI  - Single versus multicomponent intervention in frail elderly: simplicity or complexity 
      as precondition for success?
PG  - 319-22
AB  - Research on geriatric syndromes has helped to clarify risk factors and established 
      effective intervention strategies, yet the results based on this evidence have 
      mostly failed to translate into clinical practice. The translation of geriatric 
      syndrome research into practice faces unique challenges, which may heighten the 
      barriers to evidence-based implementation. The British Medical Research Council 
      framework (MRC) for development and evaluation of complex interventions, turns out 
      to be very valuable in developing and evaluating interventions in the complex 
      clinical reality of geriatrics. This paper illustrates the different phases of this 
      framework on the basis of examples from geriatric research projects in The 
      Netherlands. The discussed barriers in complex interventions can be mapped using the 
      different phases in the MRC-framework and thus become feasible challenges for good 
      quality research.

TI  - A review of the association between congestive heart failure and cognitive 
      impairment.
PG  - 171-4
AB  - Heart failure is a growing epidemic with an estimated 5 million Americans suffering 
      from this condition. Several clinical trials have demonstrated a high correlation 
      between congestive heart failure (CHF) and cognitive impairment. The severity of 
      cognitive impairment correlates positively with the degree of CHF. The underlying 
      mechanism for cognitive impairment remains unclear but appears to be related to 
      cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired cerebral reactivity with selective impairment of 
      verbal memory and attention domains. Furthermore, cognitive dysfunction represents 
      one aspect of frailty, a novel concept that encompasses a range of clinical 
      conditions that results in functional impairment in patients with heart failure. In 
      addition, frailty independently predicts mortality in CHF patients. Cognitive 
      impairment is a common and predictable effect of CHF that contributes with social 
      and behavioral problems to decreased compliance to prescribed therapy and increased 
      hospital readmissions. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to deal with the 
      complexity of this clinical syndrome.

      Phenotype Among Older Adults: Findings From the SABE Study.
PG  - 190-212
LID - 10.1177/0898264316671228 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze gender differences in incidence and determinants of the 
      components of the frailty phenotype. METHOD: A total of 1,413 older adults were 
      selected in 2006. To estimate the incidence of each frailty component, only 
      individuals who did not exhibit a given component at baseline (independently of the 
      presence of other components) were included in the study. The variables of interest 
      were socioeconomic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric factors and physical 
      performance. The incidence of each component in 2010 was the outcome. RESULTS: 
      Unintentional weight loss and slowness were more incident in men up to 74 years of 
      age. The other frailty components were more incident in women at all age groups, 
      except weakness. Besides age, the determinants of incidence of the components of 
      frailty were different between genders. DISCUSSION: Strategies for preventing or 
      delaying the installation of frailty need to address gender differences, considering 
      the greater complexity in the network determinants among women.

AB  - To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand 
      the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to 
      introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct 
      a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults 
      with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom 
      management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom 
      Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors 
      that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It 
      accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within 
      the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its 
      interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some 
      limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability 
      Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it 
      encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate 
      for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of 
      rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health 
      status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a 
      guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the 
      functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

TI  - A systematic review of predictors and screening instruments to identify older 
      hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline.
PG  - 46-57
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly 
      instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at 
      risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially 
      considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of 
      existing screening instruments are investigated. BACKGROUND: Functional decline is a 
      common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in 
      quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people 
      develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital 
      stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing 
      home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not 
      only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, 
      the impact on health-care costs is also high. RESULTS: Age, lower functional status, 
      cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily 
      life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of 
      functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at 
      risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission 
      Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity 
      Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease 
      of use in the clinical setting were not well described. CONCLUSION: These three 
      instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for 
      functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are 
      identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe 
      and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in 
      this process.

      frail elderly patients.
PG  - 67-79
AB  - Nutrition is an important determinant of health in persons over the age of 65. 
      Malnutrition in the elderly is often underdiagnosed. Careful nutritional assessment 
      is necessary for both the successful diagnosis and development of comprehensive 
      treatment plans for malnutrition in this population. The purpose of this article is 
      to provide clinicians with an educational overview of this essential but often 
      underecognized aspect of geriatric assessment. This article will review some common 
      issues in nutrition for the elderly in both hospital and community settings. The 
      complexity and impact of multiple comorbidities on the successful nutritional 
      assessment of elderly patients is highlighted by using case scenarios to discuss 
      nutritional issues common to elderly patients and nutritional assessment tools. 
      Three case studies provide some context for an overview of these issues, which 
      include the physiology of aging, weight loss, protein undernutrition, impaired 
      cognition, malnutrition during hospitalization, screening procedures, and general 
      dietary recommendations for patients 65 years of age and older.

TI  - Characteristics and Outcomes of Older Patients Attending an Acute Medical Assessment 
      Unit.
PG  - 210-1
AB  - The care of older persons accounts for an increasing proportion of the unscheduled 
      care workload for acute hospitals. The recent development of acute medical 
      assessment units (AMAU) has provided an alternative model for acute unscheduled care 
      for all medical patients. Screening instruments have been developed to capture the 
      higher levels of clinical complexity and medical comorbidities that older patients 
      present with. The aim of this study was to report on the characteristics and 
      outcomes for older patients reviewed in the AMAU of a tertiary referral university 
      teaching hospital. Data on 3071 patients attending the unit over one year was 
      prospectively collected and information on characteristics and outcomes for older 
      patients retrieved. Older patients represented over one third (1066/3071, 35%) of 
      those attending AMAU, and had an admission rate of nearly twice that of younger 
      patients (60.5% vs 32%), highlighting the increased complexity of this group. 
      Gerontologically attuned AMAUs have great potential to enhance care for frail older 
      patients from the time of their acute presentation to hospital.

TI  - Supporting elderly dependent people at home.
PG  - 1290-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relation between the dependency of elderly people and the 
      assistance they receive from others by using a detailed but simple measure of 
      dependency. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a survey of people aged 70 and 
      over. SETTING: Two general practices in south Wales. SUBJECTS: 1280 people aged 70 
      and over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependency on others to perform essential 
      functions; detailed data on who assists with those functions. RESULTS: Increasing 
      dependency was associated with increased use of more than one member of the family 
      or friends and an increase in the provision of statutory services. CONCLUSION: The 
      complexity of the relation between dependency and those who care for dependent 
      people has previously been underestimated. The presence of providers of statutory 
      services at the household of elderly dependent people suggests that these services 
      can be developed further to help those caring for elderly people at home.

TI  - A community virtual ward model to support older persons with complex health care and 
      social care needs.
PG  - 985-993
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S130876 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally the older population is increasing rapidly. As a result there 
      is an increase in frail older persons living within the community, with increased 
      risks of a hospital admission and higher mortality and morbidity rates. Due to 
      complexity of care, health care professionals face challenges in providing effective 
      case management and avoiding unplanned admissions to hospital. A community virtual 
      ward (CVW) model was developed to assist health care professionals to support older 
      persons at home during periods of illness and/or functional decline. METHODS: A 
      quantitative observational study was conducted to examine if a CVW model of care 
      reduced unplanned hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations in 
      54 patients over a 12-month period. The sign-rank test examined matched data on bed 
      days, ED presentations, and unplanned hospital admissions pre- and post-CVW 
      implementation. Other risk factors for admission to hospital were examined using the 
      Mann-Whitney test pre-and post-CVW admission, including falls, living alone, and 
      cognition. Correlations between hospital admission avoidances and unplanned hospital 
      admissions and ED presentations were tested using Spearman's ρ test. RESULTS: There 
      was a reduction in ED presentations post-CVW admission (P<0.001), and median 
      unscheduled admissions were reduced (P=0.001). Those living alone had a lower number 
      of ED presentations (median 0.5, interquartile range 0-1) prior to admission in 
      comparison to those living with a caregiver, with no differences observed during 
      admission to CVW. For those who experienced a fall during CVW admission, the odds 
      ratio (OR) of requiring long-term care doubled for each extra fall (OR =2.24, 95% CI 
      1.11 to 4.52, P=0.025). Reduced cognition was associated with an increased risk of 
      ED presentations (ρ=0.292, P<0.05) but not associated with increased risks of 
      unplanned hospital admissions (ρ=0.09, P=0.546). There were no significant 
      correlations seen between admission avoidance and the number of unplanned hospital 
      admissions or ED presentations. CONCLUSION: Through an integrated approach to care, 
      a CVW model in the care of older persons can reduce ED presentations and unplanned 
      hospital admissions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased 
      risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, 
      an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving 
      individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and 
      long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case 
      manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates 
      cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications 
      regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale 
      had not hitherto been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which the 
      interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into 
      healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the 
      benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. DESIGN: A process evaluation was 
      conducted using a mixed methods design. SETTINGS: Six GP practices in the south of 
      the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Practice nurses (n=7), GPs (n=12), occupational 
      therapists (n=6) and physical therapists (n=20) participated in the process 
      evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (≥ 70 years) were 
      included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were 
      confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to 
      communicate in Dutch were excluded. METHODS: Quantitative data (logbooks and 
      evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 
      13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, 
      data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured 
      interviews and four focus group discussions. RESULTS: Although some parts of the 
      protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older 
      people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for 
      the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive 
      treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and 
      experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the 
      interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of 
      the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the 
      protocol need special attention.

AB  - The sustainability of healthcare systems worldwide is threatened by the absolute and 
      relative increase in the number of older persons. The traditional models of care 
      (largely based on a disease-centered approach) are inadequate for a clinical world 
      dominated by older individuals with multiple (chronic) comorbidities and mutually 
      interacting syndromes. There is the need to shift the center of the medical 
      intervention from the disease to the biological age of the individual. Thus, 
      multiple medical specialties have started looking with some interest at concepts of 
      geriatric medicine in order to better face the increased complexity (due to 
      age-related conditions) of their average patient. In this scenario, special interest 
      has been given to frailty, a condition characterized by the reduction of the 
      individual's homeostatic reserves and increased vulnerability to stressors. Frailty 
      may indeed represent the fulcrum to lever for reshaping the healthcare systems in 
      order to make them more responsive to new clinical needs. However, the dissemination 
      of the frailty concept across medical specialties requires a parallel and careful 
      consideration around the currently undervalued role of geriatricians in our daily 
      practice.

TI  - The use of case management for community-dwelling older people: the effects on 
      loneliness, symptoms of depression and life satisfaction in a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 889-901

AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for 
      community-dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated 
      contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms 
      and life satisfaction. DESIGN: A two-armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial 
      with repeated follow-ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an 
      intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. METHOD: Inclusion criteria were 
      the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance 
      in two or more self-reported activities of daily living, having at least two 
      hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to 
      enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of 
      general case management, general information, specific information and continuity 
      and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) 
      being conducted per month. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the 
      primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along 
      with complete case and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: During the trial period n = 12 
      died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups 
      at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary 
      outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in any significant effects 
      for the primary outcomes at any of the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete 
      case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention 
      regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 
      0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in 
      clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that 
      case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity 
      of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

TI  - Frail old patients as a target population for cancer trials.
PG  - 31-3
AB  - The recent distinction between co-morbidity and multi-morbidity well stresses the 
      difficulty of managing old patients with cancer whose complexity is not captured by 
      a list of diagnoses or biological burden alone. The most adequate answer found by 
      oncologists and geriatricians was to work together for better evaluating the 
      physiological age and body reserve of the patient. The gold standard tool to assess 
      old patient with cancer is named Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. Its systematic 
      application needs geriatric competences and time. In this context, a great number of 
      cancer patients are considered as "frail" because they have reduced available 
      physiological reserves. They might not withstand stress when challenged. Oncologists 
      and geriatricians have imagined an innovative process to change the screening 
      procedure of these patients, determine the prognosis, adapt the treatment strategy, 
      to increase the patient's survival and his/her quality of life. The internet website 
      "www.clinicaltrials.com" only lists 8 studies focused on frail elders with cancer. 
      Six of them are focused on specific cancers or specific treatments, one was applied 
      to all kind of cancers and the last was an opinion overview from oncologists and 
      geriatricians. The selection criteria of frail patients are very diverse and 
      probably include cancer patients who are not comparable. It is now time to try to 
      identify new practical, reliable and accurate tools to facilitate the inclusion of 
      the same kind of patients suffering from the same kind of cancer to be able to give 
      more appropriate care and at the same time to constitute a valuable data base. 
      Existing tools are reviewed and analyzed.

TI  - Complexity in caring for an ageing heart failure population: concomitant chronic 
      conditions and age related impairments.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further 
      complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age 
      related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in 
      activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, 
      lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, 
      outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by 
      putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on 
      how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by 
      applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure 
      population.

TI  - Mapping the road to resilience: novel math for the study of frailty.
PG  - 677-9
LID - 10.1016/j.mad.2008.09.007 [doi]
AB  - Frailty stands at the nexus of geriatrics and gerontology, and requires both basic 
      biology and clinical knowledge for its analysis. Understanding frailty difficulties 
      much more than simply adding another outcome measure in epidemiological studies. The 
      major challenge is the identification of multiple feed-forward and feed-back 
      signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of biological homeostasis in complex 
      organisms that may fail with aging. The cause of frailty and loss of resilience is 
      probably a progressive loss of redundancy in these response patterns and 
      connections. Advances toward the development of a theoretical model that can 
      potentially embrace the complexity of frailty should be highly encouraged, 
      especially models designed to explain the biology of aging which can promote a 
      better integration and communication between scientists who study this problem from 
      different perspectives.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diabetes in older adults is increasing in its prevalence and complexity. 
      To date, little research has been done to inform current diabetes management, 
      including education and support, in older adults in Canada. The objective of this 
      interactive national workshop was to develop key research priorities for future 
      research related to diabetes in older adults. METHODS: Workshop participants 
      comprised interprofessional healthcare providers, decision makers and policy makers 
      from across Canada. Approximately 30 individuals attended an interactive 2-day 
      meeting that included expert presentations and group consensus building using an 
      electronic meeting system as well as nominal group techniques. RESULTS: The results 
      of the 2-day meeting found more than 50 ideas that were summarized into 5 overall 
      themes, with 14 subquestions, reflecting areas such as 1) identifying relevant 
      outcomes for patients, providers and decision makers; 2) diabetes prevention; 3) the 
      impact of diabetes on older adults and informal caregivers; 4) risk assessment tools 
      and 5) effective models of care across a variety of healthcare settings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To date, this workshop is the first of its kind and follows suit with 
      other international working groups and associations. The research priorities 
      developed through consensus from this workshop set forward a research agenda for 
      diabetes in older adults in Canada.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly -- a geriatrician's perspective.
PG  - 113-37
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different 
      populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of 
      complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for 
      cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now 
      that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also 
      prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the 
      world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early 
      detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the 
      increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is 
      this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting 
      the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail 
      elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and 
      aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on 
      dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of 
      CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its 
      complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly 
      succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire 
      dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for 
      those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly 
      with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? 
      The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality of 
      life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital 
      aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by 
      each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men 
      being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of 
      CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize emergency department (ED) use by nursing home residents 
      in the United States. DESIGN: Analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical 
      Care Survey. SETTING: U.S. EDs from 2005 to 2008. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals visiting 
      U.S. EDs stratified according to nursing home residency. MEASUREMENTS: All ED visits 
      by nursing home residents were identified. The demographic and clinical 
      characteristics and ED resource utilization, length of stay, and outcomes of nursing 
      home residents and nonresidents were compared. RESULTS: During 2005 to 2008, nursing 
      home residents accounted for 9,104,735 of 475,077,828 U.S. ED visits (1.9%; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-2.1%). The annualized number of ED visits by nursing 
      home residents was 2,276,184. Most nursing home residents were older (mean age 76.7, 
      95% CI = 75.8-77.5), female (63.3%), and non-Hispanic white (74.8%). Nursing home 
      residents were more likely to have been discharged from the hospital in the prior 
      7 days (adjusted odds ratio (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9), to present with fever 
      (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5-2.4) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg, 
      aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5-2.2), and to receive diagnostic tests (OR = 1.9, 95% 
      CI = 1.6-2.2), imaging (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3-1.7), or procedures (OR = 1.6, 95% 
      CI = 1.4-1.7) in the ED. Almost half of nursing home residents visiting the ED were 
      admitted to the hospital. Nursing home residents were more likely to be admitted to 
      the hospital (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.6-2.0) and to die (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6-3.3). 
      CONCLUSION: Nursing home residents account for more than 2.2 million ED visits 
      annually in the United States. Nursing home residents have greater medical acuity 
      and complexity. These observations highlight the national challenges of organizing 
      and delivering ED care to nursing home residents in the United States.

TI  - Satisfaction with the care-managed support of older people: an empirical analysis.
PG  - 31-42
AB  - Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in monitoring 
      some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer perceptions and 
      experiences of services and involvement of users/carers in assessment and review. 
      Using data from the study Evaluating Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of 
      physically and/or mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales 
      receiving community care services, this investigation examines three crucial aspects 
      of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction with the assessment 
      process and help provided by social services; also two measures obtained from a six 
      month follow-up, namely satisfaction with service levels and with the experience of 
      social services. Examination of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial 
      picture, due to their association with both user characteristics and the effect of 
      life satisfaction. This association was therefore examined firstly by considering 
      each characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each 
      satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant effect, 
      using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping warm and an inner 
      city location were all characteristics associated with reduced satisfaction, while 
      most resource inputs, including social work involvement, were positively related to 
      satisfaction. General life satisfaction was also associated with increased 
      satisfaction levels. The role of life satisfaction as a predictor was further 
      investigated through examining its dependence on case characteristics. While older 
      users were more frequently satisfied with life, those with greater functional 
      impairment and below average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. 
      Findings from this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data 
      and suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need to be 
      aware of both the potential and pitfalls associated with using them as a means of 
      assessing the quality of social services for older people.

TI  - Relationship between dual-task related gait changes and intrinsic risk factors for 
      falls among transitional frail older adults.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gait changes in dual-task conditions have been associated with 
      an increased risk of falling in older adults, and become more important in 
      increasingly frail older adults. We studied the relationship between commonly known 
      intrinsic risk factors for falls and dual-task related gait changes among 
      transitional frail older adults. METHODS: Walking time and number of steps were 
      measured while walking alone and while walking with counting backward on a 10-m 
      walkway in 66 transitional frail older adults (mean age 83.6+/-6.1, 84.9% women). 
      Uni- and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to explore the 
      relationship between dual-task related gait changes (walking time and number of 
      steps) and age over 85 years, polymedication, psychoactive drugs, poor distance 
      vision, abnormal mobility and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Compared with walking 
      alone, both walking time and number of steps increased significantly while counting 
      backward (p<0.001). Polymedication and abnormal mobility were associated with a 
      significant increase of walking time and number of steps (p<0.01 for unadjusted 
      change, p<0.05 for adjusted change). CONCLUSIONS: Dual-task related gait changes 
      were closely correlated with polymedication and impaired mobility in our sample of 
      transitional frail older adults. These findings give some insight into the 
      complexity of performing attention-demanding tasks while walking and accentuate the 
      need for multi-factorial, personalized intervention strategies, to prevent decline 
      in dual-task performance in this fall-prone population.

TI  - Encountering the older confused patient: professional carers' experiences.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - THE STUDY'S RATIONALE: Confusion is a common condition among older patients and 
      often a fearful experience. Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for 
      confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost 
      as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 
      study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with 
      older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected 
      from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the 
      care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach 
      was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with 
      older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research 
      Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles 
      were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter 
      providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the 
      interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff 
      health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been 
      changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused 
      patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the 
      patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. 
      The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the 
      unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging 
      professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the 
      confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and 
      the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. 
      Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the 
      professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.

TI  - Clinical profile of acute confusion in the long-term care setting.
PG  - 145-58
AB  - Aspects of acute confusion (AC) including risk factors, behavior patterns, and 
      outcomes are not well documented in long-term care (LTC) residents. The purpose of 
      this prospective study was to describe the clinical profile of AC in LTC including 
      risk factors, behavior patterns, etiologies, and 3-month outcomes. Seventy-four 
      elderly LTC residents were assessed for AC, depression, and global cognitive 
      impairment. Risk factors associated with AC included hearing deficits, depression, 
      pulmonary disorders, and abnormal serum sodium or potassium levels. Behavior 
      patterns of acutely confused residents included hyperactive (n = 9, 31%), hypoactive 
      (n = 8, 28%), and mixed (n = 7, 24%). In the majority of the AC cases, the etiology 
      was multIfactorial infections and dehydration were the most common causes. Residents 
      with AC had very poor 3-month outcomes. Thirty-four percent (n = 10) of the 
      residents with AC died within 3 months of the evaluation. This study highlights the 
      complexity and serious nature of AC in this frail population.

TI  - Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty: development of a measure 
      based on clinical judgment.
PG  - 1560-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To expand the ability to assess physical frailty by developing a 
      Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty (CGIC-PF) instrument. 
      DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. SETTING: Academic 
      centers. PARTICIPANT: s Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 
      caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: Literature review and structured group processes with 
      experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains 
      and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty 
      were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. 
      Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot 
      tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. RESULTS: The 
      CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, 
      nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical 
      complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of 
      daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four 
      clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to 
      markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based 
      cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 
      10 minutes or less. CONCLUSION: The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in 
      physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, 
      reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one 
      criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.

TI  - Violence in nursing homes: perceptions of female caregivers.
PG  - 1660-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02196.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence. 
      BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and 
      injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, 
      few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence. METHODS: Forty-one female 
      caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a 
      situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The 
      reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The main 
      finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the 
      beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, 
      ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes. CONCLUSION 
      AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the perception of violence is subjective, 
      there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as 
      over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined 
      operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also 
      indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. 
      To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how 
      caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.

TI  - Caring for a dying spouse at the end of life: 'It's one of the things you volunteer 
      for when you get married': a qualitative study of the oldest carers' experiences.
PG  - 421-6
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afw047 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: older people aged 80 and over are increasingly providing end-of-life 
      care to spouses at home and often do so for long periods of time, while also trying 
      to manage their own illnesses and disabilities. Little of the research on older 
      spousal carers has focussed on the oldest carers; hence, the needs of this 
      particular population are not fully known. OBJECTIVE: to explore the experiences of 
      the 'oldest carers' in caring for a dying spouse at home. METHODS: secondary 
      analysis was undertaken on a subset of data from a larger qualitative interview 
      study; this dataset comprised 17 interviews from participants aged 80 or over. 
      Framework analysis methods were used, with items derived from the thematic analysis 
      of the main study. RESULTS: the oldest carers in this subset demonstrated high 
      levels of resilience and the ability to adapt to their caring role. Caring until 
      death was accepted as an integral part of the commitment made to their partner as 
      part of the 'wedding contract'. Carers felt they benefitted from the support 
      provided by family, friends and care services; however, their own care needs were 
      not always recognised by health and social care services. CONCLUSIONS: these 
      findings underscore the complexity of the oldest carers' experiences and challenges 
      in times of illness and end of life. Healthcare professionals should be alerted to 
      the myriad ways caregiving is enacted in serious illness and seek opportunities for 
      developing supportive interventions specifically for older carers.

AB  - Drug treatment is often an essential part in treatment and prevention of diseases in 
      older people, but there is much concern about inappropriate medication use. This 
      paper aims to describe the complexity of medication safety issues and clinical 
      judgments when optimizing prescribing in older individuals. It uses the case of Mrs. 
      Hansen, an aged nursing home resident, to illustrate the facilitators and barriers 
      of this process. With decreasing life expectancy, medication use should shift from 
      cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment to increase the patient's 
      well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of (potentially) dangerous medications 
      were reduced, and non-pharmacological alternatives were considered. There were some 
      medicines added, as underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. 
      Deprescribing long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family 
      as "giving up hope". More clinical evidence and practical communication tools are 
      needed to guide deprescribing decisions, taking medical and patient-centered 
      priorities into account. Studies evaluating such interventions should select outcome 
      measures that are particularly relevant for frail old individuals.

TI  - Self-reported aging-related fatigue: a concept description and its relevance to 
      physical therapist practice.
PG  - 1403-13
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20130011 [doi]
AB  - Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by older people, both with 
      and without chronic disease. It is unpleasant and distressing and can affect 
      functioning and quality of life. Fatigue also may inhibit an older person from 
      participating optimally in a physical therapy program aimed at rehabilitation or the 
      promotion of better health. However, confusion surrounds the concept of 
      self-reported aging-related fatigue, not only because of the complexity of the 
      problem itself but also because of lack of clarity of definition and the use of the 
      term "fatigue" to describe a range of different concepts. This article aims to 
      provide clarification of the concept in the context of physical therapist clinical 
      practice. The intention is to increase awareness of the issue among physical 
      therapists, promoting their assessment and consideration of the problem when 
      planning health interventions involving functioning, physical activity, and exercise 
      for older people.

TI  - Dynamics of stability: the physiologic basis of functional health and frailty.
PG  - B115-25
AB  - Under basal resting conditions most healthy physiologic systems demonstrate highly 
      irregular, complex dynamics that represent interacting regulatory processes 
      operating over multiple time scales. These processes prime the organism for an 
      adaptive response, making it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. 
      When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given set of boundary conditions, 
      most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively 
      short periods of time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently 
      alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response mode, which is denoted 
      "reactive tuning." Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in 
      resting dynamics and maladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in 
      the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline and frailty. 
      Nonlinear mathematical techniques that quantify physiologic dynamics may predict the 
      onset of frailty, and interventions aimed toward restoring healthy dynamics may 
      prevent functional decline.

TI  - A comprehensive grid to evaluate case management's expected effectiveness for 
      community-dwelling frail older people: results from a multiple, embedded case study.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s12877-015-0069-1 [doi]
LID - 67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Case management is a type of intervention expected to improve the 
      quality of care and therefore the quality of life of frail, community-dwelling older 
      people while delaying institutionalisation in nursing homes. However, the 
      heterogeneity, multidimensionality and complexity of these interventions make their 
      evaluation by the means of classical approaches inadequate. Our objective was 
      twofold: (i) to propose a tool allowing for the identification of the key components 
      that explain the success of case management for this population and (ii) to propose 
      a typology based on the results of this tool. METHODS: The process started with a 
      multiple embedded case study design in order to identify the key components of case 
      management. Based on the results of this first step, data were collected among 22 
      case management interventions, in order to evaluate their expected effectiveness. 
      Finally, multiple correspondence analyses was conducted to propose a typology of 
      case management. The overall approach was informed by Wagner's Chronic Care Model 
      and the theory of complexity. RESULTS: The study identified a total of 23 
      interacting key components. Based on the clustering of response patterns of the 22 
      case management projects included in our study, three types of case management 
      programmes were evidenced, situated on a continuum from a more "socially-oriented" 
      type towards a more "clinically-oriented" type of case management. The type of 
      feedback provided to the general practitioner about both the global geriatric 
      assessment and the result of the intervention turned out to be the most discriminant 
      component between the types. CONCLUSION: The study design allowed to produce a tool 
      that can be used to distinguish between different types of case management 
      interventions and further evaluate their effect on frail older people in terms of 
      the delaying institutionalisation, functional and cognitive status, quality of life 
      and societal costs.

TI  - Predictors of overall quality of care provided to vulnerable older people.
PG  - 1705-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prior research shows that the quality of care provided to vulnerable 
      older persons is suboptimal, but little is known about the factors associated with 
      care quality for this group. In this study, the influences of clinical conditions, 
      types of care processes, and sociodemographic characteristics on the quality of care 
      received by vulnerable older people were evaluated. DESIGN: Observational cohort 
      study. SETTING: Two senior managed care plans. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred sixty-two 
      community-dwelling patients aged 65 and older identified as vulnerable by the 
      Vulnerable Elder Survey (VES-13). OUTCOME VARIABLE: patients' 
      observed-minus-expected overall quality score. PREDICTOR VARIABLES: types of care 
      processes, types and number of clinical conditions, sex, age, VES-13 score 
      (composite score of function and self-rated health), income, education, mental 
      health status, and number of quality indicators triggered. RESULTS: Patients whose 
      conditions required more history-taking, counseling, and medication-prescribing care 
      processes and patients with diabetes mellitus received lower-than-expected quality 
      of care. A greater number of comorbid conditions was associated with 
      higher-than-expected quality of care. Age, sex, VES-13 score, and other 
      sociodemographic variables were not associated with quality of care. CONCLUSION: 
      Complexity, vulnerability, and age do not predispose older persons to receive 
      poorer-quality care. In contrast, older patients whose care requires time-consuming 
      processes such as history taking and counseling are at risk for worse quality of 
      care and should be a target for intervention to improve care.

TI  - Complexity of the decision-making process of ambulance staff for assessment and 
      referral of older people who have fallen: a qualitative study.
PG  - 44-50
LID - 10.1136/emj.2009.079566 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people who fall commonly present to the emergency ambulance 
      service, and approximately 40% are not conveyed to the emergency department (ED), 
      despite an historic lack of formal training for such decisions. This study aimed to 
      understand the decision-making processes of emergency ambulance staff with older 
      people who have fallen. METHODS: During 2005 ambulance staff in London tested a 
      clinical assessment tool for use with the older person who had fallen. Documented 
      use of the tool was low. Following the trial, 12 staff participated in 
      semistructured interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic 
      analysis was carried out. RESULTS: The interviews revealed a similar assessment and 
      decision-making process among participants: Prearrival: forming an early opinion 
      from information from the emergency call. Initial contact: assessing the need for 
      any immediate action and establishing a rapport. Continuing assessment: gathering 
      and assimilating medical and social information. Making a conveyance decision: 
      negotiation, referral and professional defence, using professional experience and 
      instinct. CONCLUSIONS: An assessment process was described that highlights the 
      complexity of making decisions about whether or not to convey older people who fall 
      and present to the emergency ambulance service, and a predominance of informal 
      decision-making processes. The need for support for ambulance staff in this area was 
      highlighted, generating a significant challenge to those with education roles in the 
      ambulance service. Further research is needed to look at how new care pathways, 
      which offer an alternative to the ED may influence decision making around 
      non-conveyance.

TI  - Insights from students following an educational rotation through dental geriatrics.
PG  - 1368-76
AB  - Little is known about how dental students respond to dental geriatrics. This article 
      describes a qualitative analysis of reflective journals submitted over two years by 
      ninety-two senior students who participated in a brief clinical rotation in 
      long-term care facilities. We used an inductive interpretive approach to analyze the 
      journals. Eight themes emerged from the analysis: 1) complexity of the institutional 
      environment; 2) heterogeneity of the resident population; 3) multidisciplinary 
      environment; 4) record keeping; 5) interactions with residents; 6) the difficulty of 
      oral health care for frail residents; 7) bridging the gap between theory and 
      practice; and 8) the emotional impact of the clinical experiences. Apparently, the 
      students appreciated the opportunity to witness the complexity of care in a 
      multidisciplinary context and to observe a practical program of oral health care. 
      They described the rotations as unique and emotionally challenging but very 
      worthwhile. Overall, they wrote positively about their experiences with the elderly 
      residents, acknowledged the contribution of the rotation as important to their 
      clinical maturation, and reported that the experience enhanced their appreciation of 
      a dentist's professional responsibilities.

TI  - Expert knowledge elicitation using computer simulation: the organization of frail 
      elderly case management as an illustration.
PG  - 534-43
LID - 10.1111/jep.12101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various elderly case management projects have been implemented in 
      Belgium. This type of long-term health care intervention involves contextual factors 
      and human interactions. These underlying complex mechanisms can be usefully informed 
      with field experts' knowledge, which are hard to make explicit. However, computer 
      simulation has been suggested as one possible method of overcoming the difficulty of 
      articulating such elicited qualitative views. METHODS: A simulation model of case 
      management was designed using an agent-based methodology, based on the initial 
      qualitative research material. Variables and rules of interaction were formulated 
      into a simple conceptual framework. This model has been implemented and was used as 
      a support for a structured discussion with experts in case management. RESULTS: The 
      rigorous formulation provided by the agent-based methodology clarified the 
      descriptions of the interventions and the problems encountered regarding: the 
      diverse network topologies of health care actors in the project; the adaptation time 
      required by the intervention; the communication between the health care actors; the 
      institutional context; the organization of the care; and the role of the case 
      manager and his or hers personal ability to interpret the informal demands of the 
      frail older person. CONCLUSION: The simulation model should be seen primarily as a 
      tool for thinking and learning. A number of insights were gained as part of a 
      valuable cognitive process. Computer simulation supporting field experts' 
      elicitation can lead to better-informed decisions in the organization of complex 
      health care interventions.

TI  - Competence thresholds for the use of inhalers in people with dementia.
PG  - 83-6
AB  - METHODS: the ability to learn three inhaler techniques of increasing levels of 
      complexity was studied in 50 normal and demented inhaler-naive elderly people (mean 
      age 81 years) with stable 10-point mini-mental test scores (MTS). There were 10 
      subjects in each of the following groups: MTS 8-10 (non-demented), MTS 7 
      (borderline), MTS 6 (mild dementia), MTS 5 and MTS 4 (2 moderate dementia groups). 
      The techniques were taught on one day and reassessed on the following day on 
      consecutive days in ascending order of complexity. RESULTS: those with an MTS of 4 
      were unable to learn any of the techniques, while all the non-demented people could 
      learn all three techniques. For the five-stage technique (standard metered dose 
      inhaler) the 0% threshold (i.e. when none of the subjects was able to learn) was MTS 
      6, the 50% threshold (at least half but not all could learn) MTS 7 and the 100% 
      threshold (all could learn) MTS 8. For the four-stage technique (inhaler with large 
      spacer) the 0% threshold was MTS 5, the 50% threshold MTS 6 and the 100% threshold 
      MTS 8. For the three-stage technique (inspiration-triggered inhaler) the 0% 
      threshold was MTS 4, the 50% threshold MTS 5 and the 100% threshold MTS 7. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MTS can be used to determine the likelihood of a mild or moderately 
      demented patient being able to learn a multiple-stage inhaler technique.

TI  - Parkinson's disease (PD) in the elderly: an example of geriatric syndrome (GS)?
PG  - 242-6
LID - 10.1016/j.archger.2011.03.002 [doi]
AB  - PD is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects as many as 1-2% of 
      persons aged 60 years and older. In the latest decade, the approach to PD was 
      dramatically changed. In fact, although for many years PD has been considered only 
      "a disease that affects walking", with a key role of the neurotransmitter dopamine, 
      recently the neurological approach has been substantially modified. The approach for 
      this disease is not only a neurological issue. Given the complexity of its clinical 
      aspects, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, sleep disorder, pneumonia 
      dysfagia-related and malnutrition, a multidisciplinary evaluation and not just a 
      neurological evaluation is needed. We suggest a n multidisciplinary approach for 
      this old actor, underlying a subtle link between neurophatological stages of the 
      disease (Braak's classification) and clinical aspects (Braak's stages 1 and 2 
      associated with the premotor phase; Braak's stages 3-4 associated with the motor 
      symptoms and Braak's stages 5-6 associated with cognitive impairment). In addition, 
      we emphasize the usefulness of geriatric evaluation for the identification of frail 
      "in situ", frail, and disable status for improving care and treatment in this 
      multifaceted disease.

TI  - Complexity theory: a long-term care specialty practice exemplar for the education of 
      advanced practice nurses.
PG  - 84-7
AB  - This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported 
      gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to 
      managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), 
      which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the 
      faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included 
      advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal 
      of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach 
      evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the 
      practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, 
      reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes 
      included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex 
      geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design 
      and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility 
      outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation interventions are frequently cited as key in supporting 
      frail older people's recovery following periods of decompensation and acute 
      ill-health. Clinicians are required to make decisions about a patient's potential to 
      respond to rehabilitation. 'Rehabilitation potential' decisions can determine access 
      to services. In acute settings clinicians have limited time to assess and work with 
      patients, families and carers. The complexities of ageing, recovery, rehabilitation 
      and frailty may not be fully appreciated. This study aimed to explore multiple 
      perspectives of the concept of rehabilitation potential and how it is assessed in 
      older people living with frailty in the acute healthcare setting. METHODS: Five 
      focus groups with a purposive sample of 28 participants which included clinicians 
      and members of the public were conducted. Analysis comprised a thematic approach 
      using the Framework method. RESULTS: Rehabilitation potential was found to 
      encapsulate a complex decision-making process where clinicians judged an 
      individual's ability to benefit from and participate in targeted rehabilitation. 
      They asked, "Will it work?", "Is it wanted?" and "Is it available?" In order to 
      predict who would benefit from rehabilitation interventions, clinicians assessed a 
      range of holistic clinical and non-clinical factors. An iterative approach to 
      assessment delivered by a multi-disciplinary team, centred around patient and carer 
      needs and wants was needed to accommodate complexity. Participants believed that 
      everyone had some form of potential but this was dependent on availability of 
      rehabilitation resources and conceptualisations of frailty and rehabilitation. 
      Tensions between iterative approaches to rehabilitation potential assessment and the 
      realities of rapid decision making in the acute hospital setting were found. 
      CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation potential decisions involve a complex process of 
      multidisciplinary decision-making and prognostication on the likely outcome and 
      benefit from rehabilitation programmes. These findings lay the foundation for 
      developing structured approaches to rehabilitation potential decision making tools 
      and guidance.

TI  - Circles of care: home care and community support for rural older adults.
PG  - 22-33
AB  - Rural dwelling, frail older adults are a vulnerable population owing to the 
      complexity of health problems superimposed upon limited health care resources. Home 
      care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued 
      independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail 
      older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A 
      major theme identified was "Circles of Care." Grounded in rural culture, the circles 
      assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, 
      maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.

TI  - An investigation of the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely 
      ill hospitalized older patients with coincidental dementia: a multi-method design.
PG  - 1127-36
AB  - The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the 
      components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly 
      people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the 
      problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design 
      comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived 
      from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently 
      combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and 
      older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of 
      elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer 
      from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey 
      revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were 
      more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. 
      No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had 
      items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. 
      A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were 
      invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to 
      the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of 
      the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between 
      documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within 
      each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care 
      is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. 
      Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide 
      nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by 
      the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method 
      research.

TI  - Making mobility-related disability better: a complex response to a complex problem.
PG  - 121
LID - 10.1186/1741-7015-10-121 [doi]
AB  - Mobility disability in older adults can arise from single system problems, such as 
      discrete musculoskeletal injury. In frail older adults, however, mobility disability 
      is part of a complex web of problems. The approach to their rehabilitation must take 
      that complexity into account, as is reported by Fairhall et al. First, their overall 
      health state must be assessed, which is achieved by a comprehensive geriatric 
      assessment. The assessment can show how a particular patient came to be disabled, so 
      that an individualized care plan can be worked out. Whether this approach works in 
      general can be evaluated by looking at group differences in mean mobility test 
      scores. Knowing whether it has worked in the individual patient requires an 
      individualized measure. This is because not every patient starts from the same 
      point, and not every patient achieves success by aiming for the same goal. For one 
      patient, walking unassisted for three metres would be a triumph; for another it 
      would be a tragedy. Unless we understand the complexity of the needs of frail older 
      adults, we will neither be able to treat them effectively nor evaluate our efforts 
      sensibly.Please see related article http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/120.

AB  - Aged care health professionals in Australia are increasingly referred patients whose 
      standard of cleanliness and self-care has deteriorated to levels resulting in public 
      health concern. This paper describes three illustrative case studies of people 
      referred to an Australian Aged Care Assessment Service who present with 'Diogenes 
      Syndrome'. The diversity and complexity of these cases reflect variable underlying 
      diagnoses. Symptoms of self-neglect, hoarding and domestic squalor and combinations 
      thereof may provide a more useful classification system of the older person who 
      presents in such circumstances than the frequently used term Diogenes syndrome. 
      Practical guidelines are required for appropriate assessment and management of these 
      conditions.

TI  - Rehabilitation for elderly patients with cancer asthenia: making a transition to 
      palliative care.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - The transition from curative to palliative care for elderly patients with 
      cancer-related asthenia presents complex challenges to oncologists. A result of this 
      complexity is a lack of regard for the maintenance of physical and mental function. 
      This study examined the effects of comprehensive, multidisciplinary, inpatient 
      rehabilitation on the physical and mental function of elderly cancer patients with 
      asthenia. We found that both physical and mental function improved following 
      inpatient rehabilitation. However, it is difficult to predict which patients benefit 
      most from rehabilitation. Nevertheless, functional improvement following 
      rehabilitation may allow medical caregivers to better distribute the type and 
      intensity of care, and reduce the caregiver burden experienced by family members in 
      the home.

AB  - The concept of physical resilience may help geriatric medicine objectively assess 
      patients' ability to 'bounce back' from future health challenges. Indicators 
      putatively forecasting resilience have been developed under two paradigms with 
      different perspectives: Critical Slowing Down and Loss of Complexity. This study 
      explored whether these indicators validly reflect the construct of resilience in 
      geriatric inpatients. Geriatric patients (n = 121, 60% female) had their heart rate 
      and physical activity continuously monitored using a chest-worn sensor. Indicators 
      from both paradigms were extracted from both physiological signals. Measures of 
      health functioning, concomitant with low resilience, were obtained by questionnaire 
      at admission. The relationships among indicators and their associations with health 
      functioning were assessed by correlation and linear regression analyses, 
      respectively. Greater complexity and higher variance in physical activity were 
      associated with lower frailty (β = -0.28, p = .004 and β = -0.37, p < .001, 
      respectively) and better ADL function (β = 0.23, p = .022 and β = 0.38, p < .001). 
      The associations of physical activity variance with health functioning were not in 
      the expected direction based on Critical Slowing Down. In retrospect, these 
      observations stress the importance of matching the resilience paradigm's assumptions 
      to the homeostatic role of the variable monitored. We present several lessons 
      learned.

TI  - Transitions in health care use and expenditures among frail older adults by 
      payor/provider type.
PG  - 550-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess whether transitions in health care expenditures differed over 
      time by payor/provider type: Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), Medicaid-Medicare, and 
      Medicare HMO. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: A large, nonprofit healthcare 
      system in San Diego, California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 frail older people who 
      responded to the baseline and follow-up surveys and who survived the 18-month study 
      period. MEASUREMENTS: Measures included three total expenditure categories for each 
      6-month period: low users (< $4000); medium users ($4000-$19,999); or high users 
      ($20,000+). Seven conceptually meaningful expenditure trajectories over time were 
      identified: (1) consistently low expenditures, (2) consistently medium expenditures, 
      (3) consistently high expenditures, (4) decreasing expenditures, (5) increasing 
      expenditures, (6) U-shaped expenditures, and (7) inverted U-shaped expenditures. 
      MAIN RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed that HMO enrollees were about 
      twice as likely as Medicaid-Medicare beneficiaries to have consistently low 
      expenditures, but no differences were found between the FFS and HMO groups on this 
      trajectory. Other expenditure patterns showed no significant differences by 
      payor/provider group. Significant interactions among payor/provider type, 
      low/medium/ high expenditure status, and time were observed for inpatient hospital 
      care, skilled nursing/rehabilitation care, and home health care. CONCLUSION: This 
      study illustrates the complexity of frail older people with respect to their health 
      care expenditures and service use. Expanded efforts to control health care 
      expenditures for frail older people should focus first on those who are 
      dually-enrolled. In addition, because mean medical expenditures for high users 
      enrolled in different payor/ provider groups were surprisingly similar, the data 
      suggest that containing expenditures for individuals in the highest usage group 
      ($20,000+) presents challenges for physicians practicing in an era of healthcare 
      reform, regardless of payor/ provider setting.

TI  - Treatment of cancer in old age, shortcomings and challenges.
PG  - 259-66
AB  - The burden of cancer in old age is increasing as a result from both the expanding 
      number of older persons in the population and the high and still increasing cancer 
      incidence in this group. The goal of this article is to outline the shortcomings and 
      challenges of the management of cancer in the elderly. Several factors contribute to 
      the complexity of this management, such as the enormous heterogeneity in this 
      population, increased co-morbidity, reduced functional status, increased frailty and 
      different treatment goals from those in younger patients. Other problems include the 
      lack of data on the efficacy and toxicity of cancer treatment in this age group, the 
      lack of awareness of life-expectancy and the lack of an easy applicable and 
      validated frailty scale. Improvement of the quality of oncological care in this age 
      group could be achieved by initiation of clinical trials specifically directed at 
      the elderly, in which a frailty scale is implemented. The results of these trials 
      may lead to more evidence-based decision making in cancer treatment in the elderly.

TI  - Supporting the long-term residential care needs of older homeless people with severe 
      alcohol-related brain injury in Australia: the Wicking Project.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - For years, community service providers have been frustrated with the lack in 
      availability of long-term, specialized supported accommodation for older people, 
      particularly older homeless people, with severe acquired brain injury (ABI) and 
      challenging behaviors. Although the incidence of ABI (particularly alcohol-related 
      brain injury) is far wider than being confined to the homeless population, it is 
      frequently misdiagnosed and very often misunderstood Wintringham is an independent 
      welfare company in Melbourne, Australia, that provides secure, affordable, long-term 
      accommodation and high quality services to older homeless people. The high incidence 
      of alcohol abuse among the resident population has led us to adapt our model ofcare 
      to accommodate a complexity of need. However, there are some individuals with 
      severely affected behaviors that continue to challenge Wintringham's capacity to 
      provide adequate support. The deficiency in highly specialized, long-term supported 
      accommodation for older people with severe alcohol-related brain injury (ARBI) is 
      the driving force behind this project. We aim to further develop and improve the 
      current Wintringham model of residential care to better support people with these 
      complex care needs. We will report on the synthesis of this project which aims to 
      test a specialized model that can be reproduced or adapted by other service 
      providers to improve the life circumstances of these frequently forgotten people.

      workers' decisions regarding frail elders' autonomy.
PG  - 19-37
AB  - Little attention has been given to the ethical dimensions of social work practice in 
      the growing field of home health care. This descriptive, exploratory study examined 
      the influence of frail elders' cognitive status, safety, and caregiver burden on 
      social workers' support for autonomy. The major findings of this study were that all 
      three factors were significantly related to support for autonomy. Especially 
      important was the emergence of a ranking of the relative importance of these three 
      factors in social workers' decision making: the first factor considered was 
      cognitive status, the second was safety, and the third was caregiver burden.

AB  - The Better Elder Services Today (BEST) Project helps frail elders maintain healthy, 
      independent living through partnership with their formal and informal caregivers. 
      This article reports on achieving one particular project goal: the development of 
      community forums in which elders engaged in problem-solving with health care 
      professionals and policy makers. The methodology involved community assessment and 
      qualitative analysis of themes in 102 elders' responses to the question, "What has 
      it been like for you trying to remain as independent as possible in the community?" 
      Five predominant themes emerged: safety; problems communicating with health care 
      providers; dissatisfaction with hospital services; complexity in access to community 
      services; and fears about losses.
