AB  - Our aging population is rapidly growing and accounts for 46% of critical care 
      patients and 60% of medical-surgical patients in the hospital. These acutely ill 
      patients are challenging to frontline nurses because they frequently have multiple 
      chronic conditions. This article provides a tool kit of resources and clinical 
      skills to develop safe, quality, and accountable care plans for positive patient 
      outcomes; it presents several resources to assist in individualized care, the 
      complexity of care, and the issues of transitions of care. This article empowers 
      frontline nurses to develop gerontological skills and meet the unique needs of our 
      aging population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to incorporate information about older people in 
      pre-licensure nursing programs, there are inconsistent results from studies 
      examining student nurses' perceptions towards the aging population. There is 
      research suggesting that healthcare settings and nursing practice is perpetuating 
      negative perspectives towards older people. OBJECTIVE: To gain an understanding of 
      how social contexts are influencing student nurses' experiences when learning to 
      work with older people. DESIGN: Descriptive case study guided by the theoretical 
      framework of social learning theory. SETTING: A university in Western Canada that 
      offers a pre-licensure nursing program. PARTICIPANTS: 28 student nurses and 13 
      faculty in the nursing program. METHODS: Participant interviews and focus groups 
      were conducted with nursing faculty and students. RESULTS: Key findings from this 
      study are that students' previous experiences with older people, through family or 
      work experiences, and their first clinical experience in long- term care negatively 
      influenced their perceptions about working with older people. Clinical nurses and 
      faculty influenced students' perceptions about nursing practice with older people, 
      sometimes in subtle ways, underscoring that students are learning from what they see 
      and hear in practice. Students were ill-prepared for the complexity of the aging 
      population, particularly those with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Learning 
      activities that engage students in active learning, such as simulation, providing 
      students with a positive lexicon of how to describe older patients, and more overt 
      attention to the perspectives students and faculty bring to the learning environment 
      need to be carefully explored. Meaningful learning experiences with older people in 
      multiple contexts are needed to thoughtfully plan how to disrupt negative 
      perceptions that might emerge through the nursing education program.

AB  - Evidence suggests that delivery of good nursing care in long-term care (LTC) 
      facilities is reflected in nurses' descriptions of the factors and structures that 
      affect their work. Understanding the contemporary nature of nursing work in aged 
      care will influence policies for improving current work structures in this practice 
      setting. The current review aims to present a contemporary perspective of RNs' work 
      in LTC facilities. A comprehensive search and purposeful selection of the literature 
      was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. 
      Nine studies were eligible for review. Common themes revealed that nursing work in 
      aged care settings is characterized by RNs providing indirect care tasks-primarily 
      care coordination, engaging in non-nursing activities, and having an expanded and 
      overlapping role. As care providers, aged care RNs do not always provide direct care 
      as part of their nursing work. The scope of RN work beyond its clinical nature or 
      performance of non-nursing tasks adds complexity in clarifying RN work roles in aged 
      care. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 43(11), 41-49.].

AB  - According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients age 65 and 
      older account for 43% of hospital days. The complexity of caring for older adults 
      affords nursing students opportunities to assess, prioritize, intervene, advocate, 
      and experience being a member of an interdisciplinary health care team. However, 
      these multifaceted hospital experiences are not consistently available for all 
      students. Nursing clinical simulation (NCS) can augment or replace specific clinical 
      hours and provide clinically relevant experiences to practice management and 
      leadership skills while caring for older adults. This article describes a geriatric 
      management and leadership NCS.

AB  - Aging together with multimorbidity, polymedication and various social factors are 
      some of the determinants that lead to increasing complexity of care in the elderly, 
      thus making it difficult for health systems to meet their needs. To approach this 
      new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal health and social care 
      systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing specialists trained to 
      address the needs of older people from a perspective of comprehensive care, both for 
      healthy aging, and for the different health problems of this population group, 
      characterized by the consequences of aging and chronicity, towards dependence, and 
      develop the powers established by law in the framework of an interdisciplinary team, 
      for those who have been trained and accredited, thus adding value to the response 
      that health systems have to provide for this growing problem of the 
      'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.

TI  - Pleural effusion: nursing care challenge in the elderly.
PG  - 348-52; quiz 353
AB  - Pleural effusion is excess collection of fluid in the pleural cavity. It is a 
      frequent complication of pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and carcinomas of the 
      lung, breast, and ovaries. Regardless of the cause, pleural effusion produces 
      significant effects on the respiratory system, especially when considering the 
      normal age-related changes that compromise the respiratory system. Pleural effusion 
      and the complexity of diagnosis and treatment make planning and delivering care 
      challenging. The article describes the pathophysiology of pleural effusion, its 
      management, and related nursing care priorities.

TI  - Measuring the impact of informal elderly caregiving: a systematic review of tools.
PG  - 1059-92
LID - 10.1007/s11136-015-1159-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To classify and identify the main characteristics of the tools used in 
      practice to assess the impact of elderly caregiving on the informal carers' life. 
      METHODS: A systematic review of literature was performed searching in Embase, 
      MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, IBECS, LILACS, SiiS, SSCI and Cochrane Library from 2009 
      to 2013 in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, and in reference lists of 
      included papers. RESULTS: The review included 79 studies, among them several in 
      languages other than English. Their inclusion increased the variety of identified 
      tools to measure this impact (n = 93) and allowed a wider analysis of their 
      geographical use. While confirming their overlapping nature, instruments were 
      classified according to the degree of integration of dimensions they evaluated and 
      their specificity to the caregiving process: caregiver burden (n = 20), quality of 
      life and well-being (n = 11), management and coping (n = 21), emotional and mental 
      health (n = 29), psychosocial impact (n = 10), physical health and healthy habits (n 
      = 2), and other measures. A high use in practice of tools not validated yet and not 
      caregiver-specific was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The great variety and 
      characteristics of instruments identified in this review confirm the complexity and 
      multidimensionality of the effects of elderly caregiving on the informal carer's 
      life and explain the difficulties to assess these effects in practice. According to 
      the classification provided, caregiver burden and emotional and mental health are 
      the most evaluated dimensions. However, further work is required to develop 
      integrated and caregiving focused procedures that can appraise this complexity 
      across different countries and cultures.

TI  - CNA Training Requirements and Resident Care Outcomes in Nursing Homes.
PG  - 501-508
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnw049 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To examine the relationship between certified nursing 
      assistant (CNA) training requirements and resident outcomes in U.S. nursing homes 
      (NHs). The number and type of training hours vary by state since many U.S. states 
      have chosen to require additional hours over the federal minimums, presumably to 
      keep pace with the increasing complexity of care. Yet little is known about the 
      impact of the type and amount of training CNAs are required to have on resident 
      outcomes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Compiled data on 2010 state regulatory requirements 
      for CNA training (clinical, total initial training, in-service, ratio of clinical to 
      didactic hours) were linked to 2010 resident outcomes data from 15,508 NHs. Outcomes 
      included the following NH Compare Quality Indicators (QIs) (Minimum Data Set 3.0): 
      pain, antipsychotic use, falls with injury, depression, weight loss and pressure 
      ulcers. Facility-level QIs were regressed on training indicators using generalized 
      linear models with the Huber-White correction, to account for clustering of NHs 
      within states. Models were stratified by facility size and adjusted for case-mix, 
      ownership status, percentage of Medicaid-certified beds and urban-rural status. 
      RESULTS: A higher ratio of clinical to didactic hours was related to better resident 
      outcomes. NHs in states requiring clinical training hours above federal minimums 
      (i.e., >16hr) had significantly lower odds of adverse outcomes, particularly pain 
      falls with injury, and depression. Total and in-service training hours also were 
      related to outcomes. IMPLICATIONS: Additional training providing clinical 
      experiences may aid in identifying residents at risk. This study provides empirical 
      evidence supporting the importance of increased requirements for CNA training to 
      improve quality of care.

TI  - Caring for the older person with cognitive impairment in hospital: Qualitative 
      analysis of nursing personnel reflections on fall events.
PG  - 1346-1353
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14724 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore nurse and nursing assistant reflections on the care 
      of older patients with cognitive impairment who have experienced a fall. BACKGROUND: 
      While there are evidence-based clinical guidelines for the prevention and management 
      of falls and for the care of older people with cognitive impairment, the falls rates 
      for older people with cognitive impairment are three times as high as those without. 
      DESIGN: Critical incident technique. METHODS: Eleven registered and two enrolled 
      nurses and four assistants in nursing working in one subacute and two acute wards 
      within two hospitals of a tertiary level health service in south-east Queensland. 
      Individual semistructured interviews focused on two past events when a patient with 
      cognitive impairment had fallen in hospital: one when there was minimal harm and the 
      second when there was significant harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken. The COREQ 
      checklist was followed. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from 23 reflective accounts of 
      fall events: "direct observation is confounded by multiple observers" and "knowing 
      the person has cognitive impairment is not enough," and "want to rely on the 
      guideline but unsure how to enact it." While participants were aware of the falls 
      prevention policy and techniques available to prevent falls, the implementation of 
      these was challenging due to the complexity of care required by the older person 
      with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Falls prevention for older people with 
      cognitive impairment is complex and belies the simple application of policy. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: To reduce falls, nurses can involve the family to 
      support "knowing the patient" to enable prediction of impulsive actions; shift the 
      focus of in-service from lectures to specific case presentations, with collaborative 
      analysis on person-focused strategies to prevent falls in older people with 
      cognitive impairment; and reconsider the sitter role from simple observer to 
      assistant, focused on ambulation and supporting independence in activities of daily 
      living.

TI  - Care of nursing home residents by advanced practice nurses. A review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 177-85
AB  - The complexity of care in nursing homes has steadily increased during the past 
      several years. Many nursing homes now provide care for both short-stay and long-stay 
      patients who range in age from young to very old. At the same time, there has been a 
      shortage of primary care physicians to provide care while nursing homes have been 
      under intense scrutiny and pressure to improve the quality of care provided. 
      Advanced practice nurses (APNs) are increasingly evident members of the nursing home 
      workforce, providing both primary care to individual residents in collaboration with 
      physicians and consultative services to nursing homes. This article reviews the 
      research that documents the relationship between APNs and improved quality of care 
      and begins a discussion of what constitutes APN best practices in the nursing home 
      setting.

TI  - Gerontological care in nursing education programmes.
PG  - 139-48
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05160.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to identify the coverage of 
      gerontological care in baccalaureate nursing education programmes. BACKGROUND: 
      Although in recent years the average age of patients has increased, nurses do not 
      always have the knowledge, competencies, and attitudes necessary to care for older 
      people. Its complexity is not recognized. METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional mail 
      survey of 17 baccalaureate nursing education programmes in Flanders, Belgium, was 
      performed in 2007. FINDINGS: While there was great variability among nursing 
      education programmes in terms of gerontology courses, clinical placements, and 
      number of experts, it was encouraging that most programmes had integrated 
      gerontology content into non-gerontology courses, all programmes offered gerontology 
      clinical placements, and many nursing educators were considered to be experts in 
      gerontology. Lack of interest in care for older people in general, lack of 
      gerontology-related competencies within curricula, and a negative image of 
      gerontological care were reported as the most frequently-encountered barriers to 
      incorporating gerontological care aspects into curricula. CONCLUSION: Because a 
      minority of nursing students choose the gerontology specialist option, gerontology 
      content in basic nursing curricula should be increased. A minimum standard 
      curriculum and specific competencies for care of older people should be formulated 
      for all baccalaureate nursing education programmes. Strengthening educators' 
      expertise and investing in role models remain important priorities for the nursing 
      profession.

TI  - Patient-related complexity of care: a challenge or overwhelming burden for nurses - 
      a qualitative study.
PG  - 204-212
LID - 10.1111/scs.12449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-related complexity of nursing care in acute care hospitals has 
      increased in recent years, in part due to shorter hospital stays and the increase in 
      multimorbid patients. However, little research has been conducted on how nurses 
      experience complex nursing care situations. AIMS: The aim of this study was to gain 
      a better understanding of how nurses experience complex nursing care situations in 
      Swiss acute care hospitals. METHODS: This qualitative study utilised focus group 
      interviews and thematic analysis. Focus groups facilitate different perspectives of 
      the topic. Thematic analysis is suitable for the analysis of everyday stories. 
      Participants were 24 Registered Nurses with experience in their field, from four 
      Swiss hospitals. The evaluation was performed in six steps according to themes. 
      Participation was voluntary. This study was part of a multicentre research project 
      that had been approved by the responsible ethics committees. RESULTS: Three main 
      themes regarding the experience of complex nursing care situations were found: 
      complexity as a challenge, complexity as an overwhelming burden and mediating 
      factors. Mediating factors included time resources and teamwork and 
      interprofessional collaboration as contextual conditions. Additionally, nurses' 
      individual characteristics such as their professional experience and expertise, as 
      well as their personal and professional values and beliefs were considered as 
      mediating factors. These mediating factors may determine whether complex nursing 
      care situations are experienced as challenging or overwhelming. LIMITATIONS: The 
      findings from this study are limited as only experienced nurses participated in the 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are ambivalent with regard to how they experience complex 
      nursing care situations. The contextual conditions and the nurses' personal 
      characteristics play a key role in whether nurses perceive complex nursing care 
      situations as positive challenges or overwhelming burdens. These findings are 
      important for managers, as they can support nurses to master complex nursing care 
      situations.

TI  - Stroke patients in nursing homes: eating, feeding, nutrition and related care.
PG  - 498-509
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore eating, feeding and nutrition among stroke 
      patients in nursing homes as described by their nurses and by assessments. 
      Registered Nurses were interviewed about an individual stroke patient's state of 
      health, care needs and nursing care received and nursing records were reviewed. 
      Information on eating, feeding and nutrition was extracted from the interviews and 
      nursing records. A comprehensive instrument, the Resident Assessment Instrument, was 
      also used to assess these patients' state of health. The domains of eating, feeding 
      and nutrition were focused on in this study. Manifest content analysis was used. The 
      results showed that more than 80% of the stroke patients in nursing homes were 
      assessed as having some sort of dependence in eating. According to the Registered 
      Nurses, 22 out of 40 patients demonstrated different eating disabilities. The number 
      of eating disabilities in individual patients ranged from 1 to 7, which emphasized 
      the complexity of eating disabilities in stroke patients. Dysphagia was reported in 
      almost one-fourth of the patients and 30% were described and/or assessed as having a 
      poor food intake or poor appetite. The Registered Nurses' descriptions of the eating 
      disabilities, nutritional problems and their care were often vague and unspecific. 
      Only six weights were documented in the nursing records and there were no 
      nutritional records. The findings highlight the importance of making careful 
      observations and assessments, and of maintaining documentation about eating and 
      nutrition early after a patient's arrival in the nursing home to enable appropriate 
      care and promotion of health.

TI  - Nurse to nurse: consultation in geriatric nursing practice.
PG  - 38-43
AB  - The complexity of clients in today's health care environment requires a close, 
      collaborative working relationship among disciplines. However, nurses, who are often 
      key decision-makers in the planning, management, and movement of clients throughout 
      the health care system, may not use the expertise of their best allies: nurses in 
      other settings, institutions, and specialty areas. Many care problems-at home or in 
      the hospital, nursing home, or rehabilitation center-can be effectively resolved by 
      nurse-to-nurse consultation. The importance and benefit of nurses relying on their 
      own profession to answer nursing care questions are illustrated with vignettes that 
      apply a model of consultation to the practice of geriatric nursing.

TI  - The development and testing of a questionnaire to measure complexity of nursing work 
      performed in nursing homes: NCCQ-NH.
PG  - 90-8
AB  - The quality of care in nursing homes has improved over the last 2 decades; however 
      serious problems persist. Although staffing levels are a primary concern, studies 
      show that ineffective management structures may be a contributing factor to poor 
      quality care. Evidence suggests that the complexity of work performed within the 
      organization is an important consideration in developing effective management 
      structures. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and initial 
      testing of an instrument to measure the complexity of nursing work in nursing homes. 
      A sample of 168 nursing personnel (RNs, LPNs, CNAs) from 7 nursing homes 
      participated in the study. The results of measures to determine the reliability and 
      validity were generally acceptable for a new scale. A modified version of the 
      original scale can be used to provide scientific evidence on which to base the 
      design of management structures in nursing homes.

TI  - The impact of medical issues in inpatient geriatric psychiatry.
PG  - 23-46
AB  - At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. 
      Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from 
      coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are 
      important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of 
      hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes 
      adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better 
      treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need 
      for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the 
      importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.

TI  - Nursing home nurses' perceptions of emergency transfers from nursing homes to 
      hospital: A review of qualitative studies using systematic methods.

LID - S0197-4572(15)00222-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.gerinurse.2015.06.001 [doi]
AB  - The aim is to describe nursing home nurses' perceptions around emergency transfers 
      to hospital. Transfers are costly and traumatic for residents, and efforts are 
      underway to avoid hospitalization. Nurses play a key role in transfers, yet their 
      views are underreported. A systematic review of qualitative studies was undertaken, 
      guided by Joanna Briggs Institute methods. From seven reviewed studies, it was clear 
      nursing home nurses are challenged by the complexity of the transfer process and 
      understand their need for appropriate clinical knowledge, skills and resources. 
      Communication is important, yet nurses often use persuasive and targeted 
      communication. Ambiguity, strained relationships and negative perceptions of 
      residents' experiences around hospitalization contribute to conflict and 
      uncertainty. Nurses are more confident when there is a plan. Transferring a resident 
      is a complex process and special skills, knowledge and resources are required, but 
      may be lacking. Efforts to formalize the transfer process and improve communication 
      and collaboration amongst all stakeholders is needed and would be well received.

TI  - Person-centered caregiving instruction for geriatric nursing assistant students: 
      development and evaluation.
PG  - 23-31; quiz 32-3
AB  - This research describes the development and evaluation of a 2-hour program that 
      taught geriatric nursing assistant students person-centered caregiving skills. The 
      person centeredness of caregiving skills among students who completed the training, 
      as well as those who did not, was evaluated by coding their videotaped interactions 
      with a standardized long-term care resident. Residents reported more satisfaction 
      with students who had completed the special training, although there was little 
      difference between the actual behavior of students in the intervention and control 
      conditions. Students' interpersonal cognitive complexity was associated with their 
      ability to provide care in person-centered ways.

TI  - A concept analysis of individualized aging.
PG  - 185-92
AB  - AIM: This analysis sought to define the concept of individualized aging. BACKGROUND: 
      The growing older adult population and shortage of health professionals with 
      adequate knowledge of their specialized needs will strain the health care system. 
      The National League for Nursing's Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACES) 
      project has addressed this challenge. The ACES framework identifies three unique 
      concepts integral to delivering high quality care. Clarification of these concepts 
      is needed for educational and research purposes. METHOD: Rogers and Knafl's 
      evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS: The analysis identified 
      two antecedents (past experiences and biological aging processes), three attributes 
      (heterogeneity, living with age-related changes and multiple chronic conditions, and 
      risk for complications), and two consequences (complexity of care over time and 
      variability in health outcomes). CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the antecedents, 
      attributes, and consequences of individualized aging will allow health care 
      providers to improve the care of older adults.

TI  - Keeping nursing home residents hydrated.
PG  - 392-406; discussion 407-18
AB  - The purpose of this research is to ascertain nursing home (NH) staffs' perspectives 
      of the problem of dehydration in NHs (skilled nursing facilities) and have them 
      identify clinically practical interventions to ensure that NH residents consistently 
      take adequate fluids. Four focus groups with 28 NH staff members in attendance are 
      held in three NHs in metropolitan Los Angeles. The majority of participants are 
      certified nursing assistants; however, licensed vocational nurses, registered 
      nurses, and other NH staff also attend the groups. Content analytic techniques are 
      used to analyze the data. Three themes emerge focusing on residents' reasons for not 
      drinking, signs and symptoms of dehydration, and strategies for improving hydration 
      in NH residents. NH staff members identify the complexity of providing adequate 
      hydration that was influenced by the resident's relationship with family and NH 
      staff and communication between staff members.

TI  - Transforming emergency services for frail older people in hospital.

LID - 10.7748/nm.22.3.18.s29 [doi]
AB  - Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a 
      difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the 
      likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve 
      services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with 
      more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is 
      an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of 
      this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ 
      to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop 
      effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.

TI  - Complexity of Care: A Concept Analysis of Older Adult Health Care Experiences.
PG  - 108-113
LID - 10.5480/14-1362 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To define the term complexity of care. BACKGROUND: The aging population and 
      lack of gerontological preparation in pre-licensure nursing programs are pressing 
      issues. The NLN Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACE.S) project developed a 
      framework to facilitate faculty and student understanding of older adults' care 
      needs. Integral to the framework is the concept of complexity of care. METHOD: 
      Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS: The 
      analysis identified three antecedents (focus on treatment and cure of disease, 
      multiple comorbidities, and life experiences and culture), five attributes 
      (polypharmacy, use of advanced technologies, novel care models, a fragmented health 
      care system, and the relational nature of caregiving), and two consequences (impact 
      on quality of life and impact on quality of care). CONCLUSION: Defining the concept 
      of complexity of care will facilitate student understanding of the unique health 
      care needs of older adults.

TI  - Screening instruments for use in a complete geriatric assessment.
PG  - 201-7
AB  - The rapid population growth of individuals 65 years and older in the United States 
      is predicted to continue through 2050. As people age, the complexity of their 
      healthcare needs increase and can be attributed to the normal aging process as well 
      as an increased frequency of chronic illness with associated morbidity. There are 
      many geriatric assessment instruments that can be used to evaluate the complex 
      health needs of the older adult, but there is a need for a geriatric screening 
      assessment process that can address the domains of the aging individual in a 
      practical, holistic, and cost-effective manner. There are multiple quality-of-life 
      instruments that can be used for this screening of health needs in the aging 
      population, and 3 will be discussed, the LEIPAD instrument, the Medical Short 
      Form-36, and the WHOQOL-BREF. The rationale for introducing a screening assessment 
      into the clinical practice of the clinical nurse specialist for positive patient 
      outcomes will be examined.

TI  - Fostering student interest in geriatric nursing: impact of senior long-term care 
      experiences.
PG  - 190-3
AB  - Preparing nurses to meet the care needs of an expanding aging population is a 
      challenge for nursing. Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to 
      initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, 
      challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing 
      roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current 
      vacancies. This article describes the integration of long-term care experiences into 
      senior year community health practicums and reports on a qualitative analysis to 
      evaluate the project's impact on student attitudes and intentions toward geriatric 
      nursing roles.

TI  - Supporting quality improvement in care homes for older people: the contribution of 
      primary care nurses.
PG  - 115-20
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2007.00838.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This paper discusses how health and social care can work together 
      collaboratively to improve the quality of care for older people resident in care 
      homes, using Essence of Care benchmarking as an example. BACKGROUND: There is an 
      increasing interest in how care is provided in care homes, including its impact on 
      quality-of-life and end-of-life care. Care standards and government policy have 
      emphasized the need for primary care to work more closely with care home staff. 
      EVALUATION: The available evidence on older people's health care needs, and how 
      primary health care and nursing work in care homes was evaluated. Case studies and 
      descriptive reports on Essence of Care benchmarking were also used to identify the 
      facilitators and barriers to using it as a means to improve the quality of care for 
      older people in care homes. KEY ISSUES: The key issues relate to the differences in 
      the working cultures of health and social care, and the complex health care needs of 
      older people living in care homes that do not have onsite nursing support. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Structured tools such as benchmarking can potentially be used to 
      improve the quality of care for older people in care homes, but care home staff need 
      adequate support to adapt this approach to their working environment. IMPLICATIONS 
      FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Primary care nurses need to be more proactive in the way 
      that they work with older people in care homes. Structured tools such as 
      benchmarking can help them to recognize the range and complexity of resident's 
      health needs, and work with care home staff in ways that acknowledge their expertise 
      and improve the overall care of older people in these settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An undergraduate nurse's attitude toward older adults or their 
      perception of working with older adults can influence the quality of care provided 
      and their career choice, respectively. As such, it is important to conduct research 
      that contributes to the evaluation of attitudes and perceptions. In the conduct of 
      comprehensive and rigorous research, it is necessary to make the right choice of an 
      instrument to measure outcomes. The identification of a valid and reliable 
      instrument to suit a specific research question is a complex process. OBJECTIVE: In 
      order to deal with this complexity, this paper reviews instruments that have been 
      used to measure undergraduate nurse attitudes toward older adults and their 
      perceptions of working with older adults. DATA SOURCES: Data were sourced from 
      Medline, CINAHL, Healthsource/Academic Edition, PsycINFO and PubMed for the years 
      2008-2013. RESULTS: Eight readily available instruments were identified and their 
      characteristics analyzed for their purpose, number of items, design, reliability and 
      validity. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the instruments and recent use are 
      also discussed. CONCLUSION: The choice of a suitable instrument is likely to be 
      critical to the testing of intervention strategies such as curriculum activities, 
      which target attitude improvements to enhance the quality and effectiveness of 
      nursing care provided to older adults.

TI  - Orchestrating care: nursing practice with hospitalised older adults.
PG  - 252-62
LID - 10.1111/opn.12075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased incidence of health challenges with aging means that 
      nurses are increasingly caring for older adults, often in hospital settings. 
      Research about the complexity of nursing practice with this population remains 
      limited. OBJECTIVE: To seek an explanation of nursing practice with hospitalised 
      older adults. METHODS: Design. A grounded theory study guided by symbolic 
      interactionism was used to explore nursing practice with hospitalised older adults 
      from a nursing perspective. Glaserian grounded theory methods were used to develop a 
      mid-range theory after analysis of 375 hours of participant observation, 35 
      interviews with 24 participants and review of selected documents. RESULTS: The 
      theory of orchestrating care was developed to explain how nurses are continuously 
      trying to manage their work environments by understanding the status of the 
      patients, their unit, mobilising the assistance of others and stretching available 
      resources to resolve their problem of providing their older patients with what they 
      perceived as 'good care' while sustaining themselves as 'good' nurses. They 
      described their practice environments as hard and under-resourced. Orchestrating 
      care is comprised of two subprocesses: building synergy and minimising strain. These 
      two processes both facilitated and constrained each other and nurses' abilities to 
      orchestrate care. CONCLUSIONS: Although system issues presented serious constraints 
      to nursing practice, the ways in which nurses were making meaning of their work 
      environment both aided them in managing their challenges and constrained their 
      agency. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses need to be encouraged to share their 
      important perspective about older adult care. Administrators have a role to play in 
      giving nurses voice in workplace committees and in forums. Further research is 
      needed to better understand how multidisciplinary teams influence care of 
      hospitalized older adults.

TI  - The complexity of pain assessment in older people.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.7748/nop.27.8.16.e738 [doi]
AB  - Pain is common in older people and its assessment is an important part of the 
      nurse's role. Asking people about their pain is considered the most accurate and 
      reliable assessment because of the subjective nature of pain. A number of simple and 
      easy-to-administer self-rating scales are available to measure pain intensity. To 
      rate their pain, however, people need to understand the request, as well as recall 
      and interpret the painful signal. Observing specific behaviours associated with pain 
      is advocated when communication and cognitive function are impaired, for example, in 
      people with advanced dementia. A number of pain assessment tools have been developed 
      that involve observation of some or all of the behaviours. The aim of this article 
      is to highlight the importance of pain assessment, discuss the various pain 
      assessment scales and tools available and identify some of the factors that can make 
      comprehensive assessment of pain in older people and those with cognitive impairment 
      complex.

AB  - Individualized nursing care, a form of person-centered care delivery, is accepted as 
      best practice, yet its implementation into actual care is far from complete. 
      Appropriate measures of this elusive concept are needed to better understand 
      barriers to implementation. This study explored and tested the convergent validity 
      and the reliability of 2 individualized nursing care measures. A cross-sectional 
      survey design was used to collect data using the Individualized Care Scale and the 
      Individualized Care Instrument (ICI) from a sample of nurses (n = 263, response rate 
      71%) working in older peoples' care settings in Finland, and the data were analyzed 
      statistically. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the ICI scales (.63-.80) and ICS-A 
      and B subscales (both α = .91) demonstrated only moderate correlation between the 2 
      instruments (r = -.39 to .50) and possibly the complexity of measuring 
      "individualized care." The study acknowledges the latent influence of culture and 
      care approach to the conceptualization of individuality. It concludes that the 
      concept may best be measured at this point with the use of other factors in addition 
      to instruments to capture its multiple domains.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent and complexity of the morbidity burden in 
      85-year-olds; identify patterns within multimorbidity; and explore associations with 
      medication and healthcare use. Participants. 710 men and women; mean (SD) age 85.5 
      (0.4) years. METHODS: Data on 20 chronic conditions (diseases and geriatric 
      conditions) ascertained from general practice records and participant assessment. 
      Cluster analysis within the multimorbid sample identified subgroups sharing 
      morbidity profiles. Clusters were compared on medication and healthcare use. 
      RESULTS: 92.7% (658/710) of participants had multimorbidity; median number of 
      conditions: 4 (IQR 3-6). Cluster analysis (multimorbid sample) identified five 
      subgroups sharing similar morbidity profiles; 60.0% (395/658) of participants 
      belonged to one of two high morbidity clusters, with only 4.9% (32/658) in the 
      healthiest cluster. Healthcare use was high, with polypharmacy (≥5 medications) in 
      69.8% (459/658). Between-cluster differences were found in medication count (p = 
      0.0001); hospital admissions (p = 0.022); and general practitioner (p = 0.034) and 
      practice nurse consultations (p = 0.011). Morbidity load was related to medication 
      burden and use of some, but not all, healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The majority 
      of 85-year-olds had extensive and complex morbidity. Elaborating participant 
      clusters sharing similar morbidity profiles will help inform future healthcare 
      provision and the identification of common underlying biological mechanisms.

TI  - Patient management in the subacute unit.
PG  - 231-41
AB  - Social and economic forces have driven the health care industry to devise new venues 
      and models of care for the growing number and medical complexity of elderly 
      patients. One such venue is the subacute unit in skilled nursing facilities, which 
      was designed to provide comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and skilled nursing, 
      medical, and rehabilitative care to the elderly patient with potential for return to 
      his or her previous level of function. The challenges in these units are to prevent 
      iatrogenic consequences and prolonged, expensive stays for the patient. Gerontologic 
      nurse practitioners with their advanced clinical skills and knowledge of geriatric 
      primary care are uniquely suited to meet these challenges. This article describes 
      the process of care in the subacute unit and the role of the nurse practitioner to 
      lead the interdisciplinary team in achieving effective and timely outcomes for this 
      fragile population.

LID - 10.1016/j.nepr.2009.11.013 [doi]
AB  - Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to improve patient care and 
      outcomes. Guideline implementation is often stymied by the complexity of patients' 
      conditions, complex care environments, and limited advanced clinical training of 
      nursing staff. To translate key elements of heart failure guidelines into practice 
      in a nursing home, the Connected Learning Model was developed based on the diffusion 
      of innovations framework. An advanced practice nurse in geriatrics fostered greater 
      interaction and collaboration among key administrative, medical, and nursing staff 
      to promote awareness of heart failure guidelines and to translate key practices from 
      those guidelines into the nursing home setting. Direct care staff skills for early 
      recognition and reporting of signs and symptoms of acute heart failure were enhanced 
      through a learner-centered educational program which included classroom and 
      unit-based instruction and bedside clinical teaching. The Connected Learning Model 
      is a promising method to mobilize advanced nursing expertise to bridge 
      research/practice gaps through implementation of clinical practice guidelines that 
      are systematically adapted to accommodate diverse health care contexts.

AB  - AIM: To review contemporary literature on quality of life for people with dementia. 
      BACKGROUND: One of the consequences of population ageing is the predicted increase 
      in the incidence of dementia. While we can as yet do little to affect the course of 
      the disease, health care professionals are well-placed to intervene to affect 
      quality of life and quality of care for people with dementia. RESULTS: Research into 
      quality of life for people with dementia has grown markedly over the last decade, in 
      line with evolving conceptual and theoretical understandings of this complex 
      concept. While much of the literature continues to focus on assessment and 
      measurement of quality of life, emerging areas of interest are noted, including 
      dialogue associated with personhood; dignity; and dining and mealtime experiences. 
      CONCLUSION: Literature on quality of life for people with dementia is as diverse as 
      the concept itself. Established and emerging areas of research suggest that this 
      diversity will continue into the future as we strive to better understand quality of 
      life for people with dementia in all its complexity.

TI  - Defying gravity and fear: the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older 
      adults.
PG  - 254-61
AB  - In older adults, falls represent a very common and dangerous problem. Older adults 
      lack the normal overlap or redundancy of cognitive, sensory, and musculoskeletal 
      mechanisms that help younger people avoid falling while remaining active. Many of 
      the risk factors for falls in older adults are modifiable and deserve aggressive 
      attention. Successful prevention of falls, fall-related injuries, and fear of 
      falling is complicated by the multifactorial nature of the problem. Advanced 
      practice nurses' comprehensive health assessment skills, holistic orientation, and 
      willingness to collaborate with healthcare providers from a range of disciplines are 
      helpful in dealing with the complexity of balance problems and falls. Nurse 
      practitioners can be effective case managers for older adults at risk for falling. 
      Older adults need accurate information, and sometimes counseling, to realize that 
      falls, fall-related injuries, and fear of falls are warning signs that can provide 
      direction and motivation for change and prevention.

TI  - Onco-geriatric approach for the management of older patients with cancer.
PG  - 153-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jamda.2010.06.008 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: The number of older cancer patients is increasing with 
      global aging of the population. A close interaction between oncologists and 
      geriatricians becomes necessary to (1) better evaluate the elders' health status, 
      (2) determine their residual clinical/biological reserves, and (3) optimize the 
      provided medical care. In fact, aggressive antineoplastic managements are often 
      denied to older patients, possibly because of the common misconception suggesting 
      older age and/or clinical complexity as absolute contraindications to advanced 
      treatments. METHODS: The primary aim of the presented project is to assess whether 
      assigning a geriatrician to provide daily medical care to older cancer patients 
      (aged 65 years and older) admitted to an oncology ward increases the number of 
      patients eligible for a chemotherapeutic and/or surgical intervention. The project 
      is articulated in 2 phases: (1) a retrospective phase based on analysis of data 
      collected over the 2 years before the beginning of the study, and (2) a prospective 
      2-year intervention. Additional information about clinical conditions, biological 
      parameters, adverse drug reactions, body composition, physical function, and 1-year 
      health-related events will also be recorded. OUTCOMES: The combination of expertise 
      from oncologists and geriatricians is likely to result in (1) an improved selection 
      of candidates for interventions aimed at increasing disability-free life expectancy 
      and/or overall survival, and (2) a more rational exclusion of patients at higher 
      risk of toxicity or with poor prognosis. In this article, the development of an 
      onco-geriatric unit aimed at the evaluation, management, and treatment of older 
      women with gynecological cancer is also described.

TI  - Clinical nurse specialist practice within the Acute Care for Elders 
      interdisciplinary team model.
PG  - 248-51
AB  - As the complexity of care increases for hospitalized older adults, the clinical 
      nurse specialist is essential for ongoing development of nursing practice and care 
      standards. This article describes the Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) model for 
      interdisciplinary management of older adults and clinical specialist 
      responsibilities within this interdisciplinary team. Within the model, clinical care 
      specialists utilize clinical expertise and consultation skills reflecting three 
      spheres of practice related to care of high-risk community-dwelling older adults 
      admitted an acute medical unit. The goal for this patient group is to achieve 
      medical stability while preserving maximum functioning. The Acute Care of the 
      Elderly team members include primary nurses (staff nurses), physicians, clinical 
      care specialists, therapies, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, and a 
      discharge planner. Under the leadership of the primarily nurse, the team develops a 
      comprehensive care and discharge plan, implemented across a care continuum. Using 
      protocols and working together, the team delivers cost-effective, coordinated care 
      that promotes process improvement resulting in practice that is in alignment with 
      current standards of care.

TI  - Restraints or alternatives: safety work in care of older persons.
PG  - 11-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2010.00244.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine the factors and complexity that account for physical restraints use 
      and their alternatives as nurses' protect the safety of older adults. BACKGROUND: 
       Research on physical restraints has repeatedly shown the human, financial and work 
      costs associated with their use, but their use continues to be a major quality issue 
      across hospitals and across countries for older persons. METHOD: Interviews with 
      medical surgical nurses in a Midwestern hospital in the United States were recorded 
      and interpreted using grounded theory. RESULTS: Using data that described the 
      complexity of initiating, maintaining, or discontinuing restraints, we captured the 
      density of these processes and showed how nurses made decisions about restraint use. 
      The tasks carried out to protect the older person's safety often involved using 
      restraints or their alternatives and these tasks then set in motion a cascade of 
      other types of tasks or work, e.g., diagnostic, comfort, articulation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study extended the work on chronic illness trajectories and formulated a 
      framework for understanding the complexity of the use of restraints and their 
      alternatives. Using a tracing approach we were able to predict the types of 
      situations that would most likely result in the initiation, maintenance and 
      discontinuation of restraints or the use of alternative procedures. RELEVANCE TO 
      PRACTICE: The study has identified a process of 'safety work' that identified the 
      risk associated with the problem, the work to cope with the problem and risk, the 
      conditions that influenced the process and the consequences or outcomes of the work 
      strategies to maintain the older person's safety.

TI  - A holistic approach to the promotion of older hospital patients' health.
PG  - 73-80
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe how nurses interpreted health promotion related to older 
      patients in a medical hospital ward and the presuppositions for this work. METHODS: 
      The study had a descriptive and explorative design. Data were created through 
      participant observation of five nurses and informal dialogues with four nurses 
      working in an infection unit in a small hospital in Norway. The nurses where 
      followed during a period of 6 months. The observations and dialogues were 
      interpreted and transformed into text. This text was analysed with qualitative 
      content analysis and interpreted hermeneutically on three levels: (1) reading the 
      text to get an overview of the themes; (2) systematically separating central 
      patterns; and (3) highlighting the patterns with examples. FINDINGS: The nurses' 
      interpretation of health promotion was closely connected to their interpretation of 
      health and holistic nursing. Two main aspects were uncovered in the informal 
      dialogues: a biomedically oriented nursing view and a holistically oriented nursing 
      view. The observations showed that presuppositions, such as waiting for something or 
      somebody, constantly changing situations, complexity and diversity in patient cases, 
      influenced the nurses' work in general and also their focus on health promotion. The 
      nurses balanced between the biomedical and the holistic approach. It seemed to be 
      important for the nurses to be the masters of walking on a tightrope and to have 
      professional clinical competence. CONCLUSION: It was difficult to find a clear focus 
      on health promotion. The most visible focus was on diagnosis and treatment, while 
      the more complex and comprehensive situations related to health promotion of older 
      patients seemed to be underprioritized. The phenomenon of 'waiting' may be an 
      important issue for further research.

TI  - Caring for older patients at an emergency department -- emergency nurses' reasoning.
PG  - 601-8
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to use the experiences of emergency nurses to 
      illuminate what constitutes good nursing care for patients 75 years or older 
      transferred to emergency departments. BACKGROUND: Emergency departments have a 
      medical technical character and the number of visits there increases dramatically as 
      people age. Older patients require increased healthcare services in terms of nursing 
      care, interventions and hospitalizations due to an increased complexity of their 
      problems. For these reasons it is important to study what good nursing care of the 
      older patients consists of at an emergency department from the emergency nurses' 
      point of view. METHOD: Ten emergency nurses from a university hospital emergency 
      department in Sweden were interviewed. A thematic content analysis was performed. 
      RESULTS: The study showed that it was necessary to be knowledgeable, to be 
      understanding of the older patients' situation and to take responsibility for them 
      in order to be able to provide good nursing care. The emergency nurses shifted focus 
      from describing the central aspect of good nursing care to describing what hinders 
      the provision of it. Their experience was that prioritizing medical procedures, 
      everyday tasks and routines threatens good nursing care of older patients in 
      emergency departments. The emergency nurses held that the older patient is often 
      sent to an emergency department where the level of care is not appropriate to their 
      needs. CONCLUSIONS: The result can be seen as a challenge for the organization and 
      the nurses in the future; to prioritize differently, thereby maintaining a balance 
      between good nursing and medical/technical tasks when treating older patients. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The present day healthcare system is not organized 
      to appropriately meet the needs of the older patients. Nurses themselves hold they 
      can better serve the older patient. By sharing their experiences, both can be 
      accomplished.

TI  - Leadership role of Consultant Nurses working with Older People: a co-operative 
      inquiry.
PG  - 147-58
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2007.00843.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the co-operative enquiry undertaken was to explore how the 
      leadership component of the Consultant Nurse for Older People role was reflected in 
      day-to-day working. BACKGROUND: Leadership is one of the four key elements of the 
      Consultant Nurse role and is the key mechanism for achieving and embedding 
      transformation in practice. However, within the role of the Consultant Nurse this 
      area has not been explored in detail. METHODS: A 6-month co-operative inquiry 
      approach was used to develop insights into leadership strategies of Consultant 
      Nurses for Older People and involved the five authors of the paper, four Consultant 
      Nurses in Older People nursing and the lead author who was also an experienced 
      Consultant Nurse and practice-based researcher from a different nursing specialism. 
      RESULTS: Through the analysis of the stories shared by the co-authors/participants, 
      two key themes emerged relating to complexity and pathway. These themes provided a 
      major focus for the Consultant Nurses in their leadership role. The outcome of the 
      study is a framework that describes the triggers and enabling factors that precede 
      the use of leadership strategies at the clinical and organizational level and 
      associated outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In defining how leadership is reflected by 
      Consultant Nurses for Older People, a complex picture emerges that is multifaceted 
      and multidimensional. Consultant Nurses need support to make visible the valuable 
      contribution they make to enabling healthcare teams, organizations and work places. 
      Consultant Nurses for Older People are key in ensuring the quality agenda within 
      their organizations as they are well placed to provide leadership at both a 
      strategic and clinical level, while providing influence to operational development. 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Within the context of the literature this area 
      is under investigated. Understanding how leadership is reflected in the role of 
      Consultant Nurses is complex as Consultant Nurses work across traditional interfaces 
      and between different levels within organizations. Consultant Nurses have been 
      'challenged' to identify the 'difference' they are making; to do this it is 
      important to understand how leadership (as one element) is reflected in a highly 
      complex, multidimensional role and the links between leadership and enabling, 
      quality person-centred ways of working with Older People within rapidly changing, 
      pressurized healthcare settings.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To present three converging myths that underlie the perception 
      that nursing care for older persons in hospital is simple in comparison with its 
      actual complexity. BACKGROUND: Literature provides strong evidence indicating that 
      the myths we discuss inherently arise from ageism, the social value of older 
      patients and the economic burden of being an older patient in hospital. These 
      powerful social discourses promote harm to older patients. Harm emerges from both 
      the omission of gerontological nursing knowledge and skill and the commission of 
      acts that unintentionally harm. A corresponding ethical challenge results for acute 
      care nurses. DESIGN: A discursive paper. METHODS: We illuminate gerontological 
      issues by discussing three myths. In myth one, we detail four clusters of 
      distinguishing characteristics in older hospitalised people. In the second myth, we 
      challenge the idea that the role of the acute care hospital is to attend only to 
      acute medical concerns. Finally, in the third myth, we address the issue of 
      incorporating functional assessment into the acute care nursing assessment. We argue 
      that functional assessment is poorly integrated and becomes acceptable only as long 
      as the medical regimen is managed appropriately. CONCLUSION: Safe quality care in 
      hospital for older adults requires a hybrid practice that integrates acute care 
      specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing knowledge and skill. Clinical 
      reasoning that integrates this type of nursing knowledge can prevent harm. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Integrating key elements of acute care nursing specialty 
      knowledge with gerontological nursing principles aids to prevent the omission of 
      care that is known to be harmful to older people. Conversely, the commission of 
      gerontologically sensitive acute care can enhance safety and promote quality care in 
      hospital.

TI  - Psychosocial assessment of nursing home residents via MDS 3.0: recommendations for 
      social service training, staffing, and roles in interdisciplinary care.
PG  - 190.e9-190.e15
LID - 10.1016/j.jamda.2011.07.005 [doi]
AB  - The Minimum Data Set 3.0 has introduced a higher set of expectations for assessment 
      of residents' psychosocial needs, including new interviewing requirements, new 
      measures of depression and resident choice, and new discharge screening procedures. 
      Social service staff are primary providers of psychosocial assessment and care in 
      nursing homes; yet, research demonstrates that many do not possess the minimum 
      qualifications, as specified in federal regulations, to effectively provide these 
      services given the clinical complexity of this client population. Likewise, social 
      service caseloads generally exceed manageable levels. This article addresses the 
      need for enhanced training and support of social service and interdisciplinary staff 
      in long term care facilities in light of the new Minimum Data Set 3.0 assessment 
      procedures as well as new survey and certification guidelines emphasizing quality of 
      life. A set of recommendations will be made with regard to training, appropriate 
      role functions within the context of interdisciplinary care, and needs for more 
      realistic staffing ratios.

TI  - Gerontological nursing roles within the Southeastern Regional Geriatric Program.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - This paper looks at the varied roles of Registered Nurses (RNs) within the 
      Southeastern Regional Geriatric Program (SERGP) and how these nursing roles 
      influence client care across the continuum of services. More specifically, this 
      paper describes the clinical services of the SERGP, the roles of RNs within these 
      services, and the principles and dimensions of geriatric nursing assessment, 
      treatment, and rehabilitation. The aim of this article is to promote recognition of 
      the complex and stimulating work of RNs in gerontology. Eliopoulos (1997) states the 
      following that reflects this excitement and complexity: Gerontological nurses help 
      older individuals to achieve a sense of wholeness by guiding them in understanding 
      and finding meaning and purpose in life, facilitating harmony of the mind, body, and 
      spirit, mobilizing their internal and external resources, and promoting self-care 
      behaviours.

TI  - Team social cohesion, professionalism, and patient-centeredness: Gendered care work, 
      with special reference to elderly care - a mixed methods study.
PG  - 381
LID - 10.1186/s12913-017-2326-9 [doi]
LID - 381
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare organisations are facing large demands in recruiting 
      employees with adequate competency to care for the increasing numbers of elderly. 
      High degrees of turnover and dissatisfaction with working conditions are common. The 
      gendered notion of care work as 'women's work', in combination with low salaries and 
      status, may contribute to negative work experiences. There is abundant information 
      about the negative aspects of elderly care health services, but little is known 
      about positive aspects of this work. The study aim was to investigate work 
      satisfaction from a gender perspective among Swedish registered nurses, 
      physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, focusing specifically on healthcare 
      services for the elderly. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was adopted in which we 
      combined statistics and open-ended responses from a national survey with qualitative 
      research interviews with healthcare professionals in elderly care organisations. The 
      survey was administered to a random sample of 1578 registered nurses, 
      physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. Qualitative interviews with 17 
      professionals were conducted in six elderly care facilities. Qualitative and 
      quantitative content analyses, chi(2) and constructivist grounded theory were used 
      to analyse the data. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in 
      overall work satisfaction between those who worked in elderly care and those who did 
      not (64 and 74,4% respectively, p <0.001). Nine themes were derived from open-ended 
      responses in the questionnaire. The qualitative interviews revealed four prominent 
      storylines: 'Team social cohesion', 'Career development and autonomy', 
      'Client-centeredness', and 'Invisible and ignored power structures'. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results show the complexity of elderly care work and describe several aspects 
      that are important for work satisfaction among health professionals. The results 
      reveal that work satisfaction is dependent on social interrelations and cohesion in 
      the work team, in possibilities to use humour and to have fun together, and in the 
      ability to work as professionals to provide client-centered elderly care. Power 
      relations such as gendered hierarchies were less visible or even ignored aspects of 
      work satisfaction. The storylines are clearly linked to the two central discourses 
      of professionalism and gender equality.

TI  - Aging: adding complexity, requiring skills.
PG  - 47-69
AB  - The role of systems in addressing the needs of elderly and chronically ill 
      populations remains a far from universal way of thinking, much less practice, in 
      health care. Re-engineering the current fragmented system to align providers, 
      patients and payment models to facilitate proactive management of conditions 
      associated with advanced age and/or one or more chronic diseases - rather than 
      responding to costly consequences of a health care system optimized for acute care 
      conditions - will be a major challenge for all stakeholders. There are, however, 
      promising success stories that are taking place in the United States today that may 
      provide a model for improvement. The authors define the issues faced by the health 
      care providers and payers that arise when providing care for the elderly and those 
      with chronic conditions - issues that threaten to overwhelm the financial and human 
      health care resources that exist to serve these populations. They define innovative 
      ways of thinking about systems of care, and provide examples of unique systems that 
      have applied theory into practice. These successful leaders may offer lessons in 
      proactively managing complex health conditions, overcoming communication barriers 
      and using technology to complement the necessary human touch that is essential to 
      health care delivery.

TI  - Medication management for nurses working in long-term care.
PG  - 128-49
AB  - In long-term care (LTC), the complexity of residents' conditions and their treatment 
      requirements present challenges for nurses managing medications. The purpose of this 
      qualitative descriptive study was to explore medication management as described by 
      licensed nurses working in LTC. A total of 22 licensed nurses from 2 LTC facilities 
      located in the Canadian province of Ontario participated in 4 focus groups. Thematic 
      content analysis was used to organize data into themes and a conceptual model was 
      developed. The overarching theme was that nurses are "racing against time" to manage 
      medications and 3 subthemes described how they coped with this important care 
      process: preparing to race, running the race, and finishing the race. Barriers to 
      safe medication management included time restraints, knowledge limitations, 
      interruptions and distractions, and poor communication. The findings can be used to 
      better inform health-care providers and to guide future research. They also have the 
      potential to directly impact outcomes related to safe medication management in LTC.

TI  - Complexity in geriatric home healthcare.
PG  - 34-43
AB  - The aging population and the associated rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions 
      suggest that the home health population is increasingly complex and challenging to 
      manage. The purpose of this study was to use national administrative data (Outcome 
      and Assessment Information Set assessments of persons discharged in 2004 and 2005) 
      to examine the clinical complexity of older adults admitted to home healthcare. Our 
      descriptive analyses confirm that multiple chronic conditions and cognitive 
      impairment are common and result in longer lengths of stay. The findings support the 
      need for geriatric home healthcare practices that effectively address multiple 
      morbidities and cognitive function.

TI  - Triaging seniors in health crisis in the emergency department: a three-year summary.
PG  - 8-11
AB  - The "geriatric triage" approach for management of the most complex frail older adult 
      population by geriatric nurses in the emergency department setting was a benefit to 
      the patient/family and the health care system. The patients, through assessment and 
      individualized plans of care, received the right care in the right setting. Seniors 
      were assessed and their care planned by health care professionals who had geriatric 
      knowledge, understood the complexity of their problems, and acted as their advocate. 
      Geriatric triaging resulted in benefits across the health care system. Resources 
      were used effectively. Patients received care in the most appropriate and 
      cost-efficient setting. This new and creative approach served as a catalyst for 
      improvement in services and care for the senior population. Health care workers in 
      the hospitals as well as the community increased their knowledge of geriatrics 
      through consultation with this service. The community and hospitals had a formal 
      linkage, which provided an opportunity for collaboration and continuity of care. The 
      hospital system experienced decreased competition for scarce acute care beds due to 
      diverted admissions. The emergency department had consultants to assist with the 
      decision-making for this high-risk population and decreased the number of patients 
      held in emergency department awaiting an inpatient bed. The community system 
      received patients with a comprehensive plan of care that provided creative and 
      innovative care management strategies. Home care adapted its service to respond with 
      immediate services to assist with health crises in addition to what had been 
      traditionally available. The finding of this study supports a new approach to care 
      of the elderly and chronically ill population who present to the emergency 
      department in health crisis. Creative strategies are required to meet the needs of 
      the aging population in these times of fiscal restraint. The nursing geriatric 
      triage service is one strategy that holds merit.

TI  - Parkinson's disease, palliative care and older people: Part 2.
PG  - 22-6; quiz 28
AB  - In the second of two articles on palliative care for people with Parkinson's 
      disease, the authors consider other aspects of care relevant to this complex stage. 
      They conclude that better understanding of its complexity, its innate variability 
      and the roles extended team members can play help to improve the care given to 
      patients.

TI  - Negotiating the care-giving role: family members' experience during critical 
      exacerbation of COPD in Norway.
PG  - 612-620
LID - 10.1111/hsc.12350 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare policies often state that complex conditions are to be treated outside 
      hospital in various forms of public-private partnership. Chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive illness that includes episodes of serious 
      acute exacerbations characterised by extreme breathlessness. There is limited 
      knowledge about COPD exacerbations from the perspective of family caregivers and 
      implications of the changing boundary between hospital care and care at home. In 
      this paper, we explore how caregivers negotiate their role as caregivers with 
      patients and healthcare professionals during acute exacerbations. We conducted 10 
      qualitative interviews with family caregivers of COPD patients in 2011, all were 
      spouses over the age of 60. The participants were recruited through the patient pool 
      of ambulatory pulmonary services of two hospitals in Oslo, Norway. Data were 
      interpreted using thematic analysis. The caregivers described a lack of 
      understanding and support from health professionals in some situations. They 
      shouldered considerable responsibility, but were not always acknowledged as 
      competent carers by professionals. Caregivers had to balance their involvement. They 
      noted that they could lose the professionals' co-operation if their involvement was 
      perceived as interfering or preventing the professionals from exercising their 
      expertise. However, by not sharing their personalised knowledge about the patients, 
      they risked that the professionals would not understand the severity of the 
      exacerbation, which could undermine their own ability to maintain a sense of safety 
      and control. The negotiations caregivers participated in and the uncertainty they 
      experienced shed new light on the complexity of their role, and the discrepancy 
      between practice and ideals in healthcare policy regarding collaboration of care. It 
      is crucial to develop further knowledge about structural, interactional and 
      communicational facilitators and barriers for reaching shared understandings and 
      facilitating mutual trust in these demanding situations.

TI  - CONNECT for quality: protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial to improve 
      fall prevention in nursing homes.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/1748-5908-7-11 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality improvement (QI) programs focused on mastery of content by 
      individual staff members are the current standard to improve resident outcomes in 
      nursing homes. However, complexity science suggests that learning is a social 
      process that occurs within the context of relationships and interactions among 
      individuals. Thus, QI programs will not result in optimal changes in staff behavior 
      unless the context for social learning is present. Accordingly, we developed 
      CONNECT, an intervention to foster systematic use of management practices, which we 
      propose will enhance effectiveness of a nursing home Falls QI program by 
      strengthening the staff-to-staff interactions necessary for clinical problem-solving 
      about complex problems such as falls. The study aims are to compare the impact of 
      the CONNECT intervention, plus a falls reduction QI intervention (CONNECT + FALLS), 
      to the falls reduction QI intervention alone (FALLS), on fall-related process 
      measures, fall rates, and staff interaction measures. METHODS/DESIGN: Sixteen 
      nursing homes will be randomized to one of two study arms, CONNECT + FALLS or FALLS 
      alone. Subjects (staff and residents) are clustered within nursing homes because the 
      intervention addresses social processes and thus must be delivered within the social 
      context, rather than to individuals. Nursing homes randomized to CONNECT + FALLS 
      will receive three months of CONNECT first, followed by three months of FALLS. 
      Nursing homes randomized to FALLS alone receive three months of FALLs QI and are 
      offered CONNECT after data collection is completed. Complexity science measures, 
      which reflect staff perceptions of communication, safety climate, and care quality, 
      will be collected from staff at baseline, three months after, and six months after 
      baseline to evaluate immediate and sustained impacts. FALLS measures including 
      quality indicators (process measures) and fall rates will be collected for the six 
      months prior to baseline and the six months after the end of the intervention. 
      Analysis will use a three-level mixed model. DISCUSSION: By focusing on improving 
      local interactions, CONNECT is expected to maximize staff's ability to implement 
      content learned in a falls QI program and integrate it into knowledge and action. 
      Our previous pilot work shows that CONNECT is feasible, acceptable and appropriate.

TI  - The Trajectory of Tolerance for Wandering-related Boundary Transgression: An 
      Exploration of Care Staff and Family Perceptions.
PG  - 451-460
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnv136 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to explore the experience of living with and 
      caring for a person with dementia who wanders and transgresses boundaries into 
      out-of-bounds and potentially hazardous areas (wandering-related boundary 
      transgression [BT]), from the perspective of family members and care staff. DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: This descriptive qualitative study utilized four focus groups with care 
      staff (n = 28), one with family members (n = 4), and individual interviews (n = 8) 
      with family members. Content analysis generated key concepts that formed the basis 
      of the development of a theoretical understanding of the experience. RESULTS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Care staff and families described wandering-related BT as a common 
      dementia-related behavior in residential aged care (RAC). Drawing on the generated 
      concepts, a complex theoretical trajectory of tolerance for BT was developed. At one 
      end of the trajectory, BT was perceived as being beyond the control of the 
      individual and when unwitnessed by others, having little or no impact. Tolerance for 
      BT shifted when the BT was witnessed by others, and potentially unsafe consequences 
      for the person who wanders or their coresidents were experienced. Under the latter 
      circumstances, BT was perceived as a troubling behavior that needed more effective 
      management. Underpinning the complexity of this behavior was a constantly shifting 
      perception of how hazardous this behavior might be, a factor that appeared to 
      contribute to the challenges faced by families and care staff.

TI  - Encountering the older confused patient: professional carers' experiences.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - THE STUDY'S RATIONALE: Confusion is a common condition among older patients and 
      often a fearful experience. Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for 
      confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost 
      as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 
      study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with 
      older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected 
      from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the 
      care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach 
      was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with 
      older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research 
      Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles 
      were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter 
      providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the 
      interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff 
      health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been 
      changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused 
      patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the 
      patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. 
      The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the 
      unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging 
      professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the 
      confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and 
      the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. 
      Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the 
      professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.

TI  - Complexity theory: a long-term care specialty practice exemplar for the education of 
      advanced practice nurses.
PG  - 84-7
AB  - This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported 
      gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to 
      managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), 
      which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the 
      faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included 
      advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal 
      of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach 
      evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the 
      practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, 
      reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes 
      included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex 
      geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design 
      and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility 
      outcomes.

      living with dementia to access and derive benefit from the service. BACKGROUND: In 
      the light of international ageing demographics and strategy towards social 
      inclusion, it is anticipated that demand for generic day care services for clients 
      living with and without dementia will increase. DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive 
      qualitative design utilised three focus groups for data collection. Community 
      psychiatric nurses (n = 4), day centre mangers (n = 4) and social workers (n = 12) 
      participated in the study. Data analysis informed a narrative description of the 
      approaches that support adults living with dementia in day care. FINDINGS: An 
      exhaustive description is encapsulated in five key themes. These are "easing the 
      transition to day care," "proactively managing supervision and complexity of need," 
      "sustaining the person and family carer," making the best of what we have" and 
      "encountering a need for change," The data conveyed a sensitivity to the life story 
      and needs of clients with dementia. Whilst the data revealed deficits in the 
      physical environment of the centres, there were indications of the generation of a 
      positive social environment. CONCLUSIONS: A generic day care service that provides 
      an integrated blend of care and treatment and social and recreational support to 
      older adults, irrespective of whether they have or have not dementia, is realistic 
      and manageable. The routine of day centre attendance may have value in sustaining 
      clients with dementia and family care-giving relationships. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: Approaches to support the attendance of clients with dementia at day care 
      include home visits, life story work, proactive supervision and careful planning of 
      social groupings and recreational activities.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to explore the barriers that the uninsured elderly 
      population encounter when accessing health care in the United States. These barriers 
      include, but are not limited to lack of transportation, insurance, or family 
      support; the daunting complexity of the health care system; poverty; culture; poor 
      patient-health care provider communications; race/ethnicity; and lack of health care 
      professionals such as nurses and doctors with adequate geriatric preparation, or 
      generalists who are undereducated in geriatrics. The number of health care 
      professionals currently available to treat elderly persons in the United States is 
      inadequate. The Federal government should take steps to develop solutions to improve 
      access to health care and decrease health disparities for older adults. As a nation, 
      we should be proactive in addressing these concerns instead of waiting for new 
      barriers to arise that further limit access to health care for elderly patients and 
      their families. In this article, we provide an assessment of the barriers that limit 
      access to health care in the uninsured elderly population and suggest 
      recommendations and possible solutions to eliminate or reduce these barriers.

      collaboration.
PG  - 43-55

AB  - AIM: This paper is a report of a study identifying the care issues experienced by 
      older people in the acute setting that could be improved through a collaborative 
      approach to action. BACKGROUND: Actively involving consumers in the governance of 
      healthcare organizations is viewed positively, although there is less agreement on 
      how to do this. Co-operative inquiry is a useful approach to involve consumers and 
      clinicians in structured dialogue about understanding and changing care, whereas 
      traditional quality improvement methodologies are often singular in their dimensions 
      of change. METHOD: Using a co-operative inquiry approach, five workshops were 
      facilitated over a 4-month period in 2008 with four volunteer older people, four 
      clinicians and three facilitators (n=11). All participants were actively involved in 
      generating ideas and actions using a range of facilitation techniques and data 
      collection methods. FINDINGS: There was increased awareness, understanding and 
      acceptance of clinicians' and consumers' experiences and expectations of care. The 
      complexity behind changing so-called simple care (providing warm drinks, appetizing 
      food), which were the key concerns for consumers, relied on the active management 
      and broader transformation of the system, including teamwork, communication 
      processes and organizational and individual values and beliefs. CONCLUSION: 
      Consumers and clinicians put different emphasis on perspectives related to improving 
      care of older people in the acute hospital setting. The disconnect between what 
      consumers viewed as 'simple' organizational behaviours to change and what the 
      clinicians viewed as complex, led to a recognition that the approach to 
      organizational change needs to be reconceptualized.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly -- a geriatrician's perspective.
PG  - 113-37
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different 
      populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of 
      complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for 
      cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now 
      that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also 
      prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the 
      world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early 
      detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the 
      increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is 
      this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting 
      the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail 
      elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and 
      aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on 
      dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of 
      CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its 
      complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly 
      succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire 
      dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for 
      those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly 
      with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? 
      The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality of 
      life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital 
      aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by 
      each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men 
      being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of 
      CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.

TI  - Employers, home support workers and elderly clients: identifying key issues in 
      delivery and receipt of home support.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - The Nexus Home Care Project examines the experiences of employers, home support 
      workers and elderly clients and their family members in the delivery and receipt of 
      home support services. The primary purpose of this research is to identify salient 
      issues in the delivery and receipt of home support services to elderly individuals 
      from the perspective of employers, home support workers and clients. The data for 
      this study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, are derived from 
      in-depth interviews with home support employers (n=11), home support workers (n=32) 
      and elderly clients (n=14) in British Columbia. Employers emphasized recruitment and 
      retention and the increasing complexity of client needs, and raised questions 
      regarding the appropriateness of home support as a part of the healthcare continuum. 
      Home support workers stressed scheduling and time demands, the tension in providing 
      intimate ongoing care at an emotional distance and the balance between tasks 
      outlined in the care plan and the needs and wants of elderly clients. Elderly 
      clients indicated an ongoing need to prepare for and manage services and expressed a 
      need for companionship. Findings are discussed as they inform and extend our 
      understanding of the key tensions in home support. Strategies for addressing these 
      tensions are also identified.

TI  - Nurses' ethical reasoning in cases of physical restraint in acute elderly care: a 
      qualitative study.
PG  - 983-91
LID - 10.1007/s11019-012-9455-z [doi]
AB  - In their practice, nurses make daily decisions that are ethically informed. An 
      ethical decision is the result of a complex reasoning process based on knowledge and 
      experience and driven by ethical values. Especially in acute elderly care and more 
      specifically decisions concerning the use of physical restraint require a thoughtful 
      deliberation of the different values at stake. Qualitative evidence concerning 
      nurses' decision-making in cases of physical restraint provided important insights 
      in the complexity of decision-making as a trajectory. However a nuanced and refined 
      understanding of the reasoning process in terms of ethical values is still lacking. 
      A qualitative interview design, inspired by the Grounded Theory approach, was 
      carried out to explore nurses' reasoning process in terms of ethical values. We 
      interviewed 21 acute geriatric nurses from 12 hospitals in different regions in 
      Flanders, Belgium in the period October 2009-April 2011. The Qualitative Analysis 
      Guide of Leuven was used to analyse interview data. Nurses' decision-making is 
      characterized as an ethical deliberation process where different values are 
      identified and where the process of balancing these values forms the essence of 
      ethical deliberation. Ethical decision-making in cases of physical restraint implies 
      that nurses have to choose which values receive priority in the process, which 
      entails that not all values can be respected to the same degree. As a result, 
      decision making can be experienced as difficult, even as a dilemma. Driven by the 
      overwhelming goal of protecting physical integrity, nurses took into account the 
      values of dignity and justice more implicitly and less dominantly.

TI  - Elders adapting to a chronic diagnosis within a nursing refuge.
PG  - 131-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1744-6198.2011.00255.x [doi]
AB  - The increasing numbers of people seeking care for chronic disease has placed 
      unparalleled demands on nurses who journey with them as they grasp the meaning of 
      their altered health status. The complexity of the newly diagnosed chronic disease 
      can be overwhelming. Newly diagnosed elder patients need a refuge in which to 
      explore the uncertainties and challenges in managing a chronic illness. Reactions to 
      a new diagnosis are uniquely shaped by the elder person's culture, age, life 
      circumstances, and previous coping strategies. Six dichotomous response pairs are 
      posed: relief versus devastation, courage versus cowardice, disease obsession versus 
      disease aversion, rational thinking versus intuition, reawakening versus stuck, and 
      self-reliance versus dependence. Nurses can create a sanctuary for elderly patients 
      with protected space, presence, partnership, past to future orientation, and 
      perspective on life. Nurses who embrace this mission may find themselves returning 
      to the reasons they sought a nursing career, to support and strengthen elderly 
      people in the most vulnerable moments of their lives.

TI  - Staff views on the Resident Assessment Instrument, RAI/MDS, in nursing homes, and 
      the use of the Cognitive Performance Scale, CPS, in different levels of care in 
      Stockholm, Sweden.
PG  - 642-53
AB  - Multidimensional functional assessment is the basis of individualized care. It is 
      especially important in the care of elderly, with the complexity of symptomatology 
      and often with cognitive impairment present. An assessment instrument for elderly 
      persons, used in this study, is the Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set 
      (RAI/MDS) and its incorporated MDS Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS). The purposes 
      of the study were to demonstrate the cognitive performance in elderly persons in 
      different levels of care by using the CPS and to elicit the views of staff on use of 
      the RAI/MDS. Cognitive impairment was found in 1276 elderly persons in six levels of 
      care studied, an important factor to consider when organizing care of elderly. An 
      intervention study was carried out for 1 year in three nursing home wards, with 
      training and supervision in implementation of the RAI/MDS including individualized 
      and documented care. Part of a questionnaire was used to evaluate staff (n = 50) 
      views on using the instrument. A majority of the staff thought that the RAI/MDS 
      could contribute to the improvement of quality of care, documentation in nursing 
      records, and in co-operation and engagement. Further research is necessary to elicit 
      more knowledge on the usefulness and benefits of the instrument.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aging population is a globally recognized challenge for the health 
      care service. The growing number of older people will probably lead to increased 
      demands for nurses working in elderly care. Clinical practice has been shown to have 
      an impact on how student nurses perceive a particular field of nursing. OBJECTIVES: 
      To compare perceptions of the clinical learning environment in nursing homes among 
      students considering a career in aged care or not, and to examine the difference in 
      age, gender and previous working experience as health care assistants in elderly 
      care between the two groups. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study using the 
      Swedish version of the Clinical Learning Environment and Nurse Teacher evaluation 
      scale. METHODS: Consecutive sampling was performed over three semesters from 
      September 2011 to December 2012. The survey was conducted with 183 student nurses. 
      Mann-Whitney U-test was used to examine differences in relation to two groups namely 
      student nurses who did or did not consider to work in elderly care. A chi-square 
      test of independence was performed to examine the difference in age, gender and 
      previous working experience between the two groups. RESULTS: The analysis leaned 
      towards an overall positive evaluation of the clinical learning environment with 
      more positive values for students considering a career. There were no significant 
      differences between younger students (18-23) and older students (24-50) regarding 
      willingness to work in elderly care or not. Neither was any significant difference 
      displayed between students, based on gender nor for previous work experience. 
      CONCLUSION: Age, gender and previous work experiences as health care assistants did 
      not impact on students' willingness to work in elderly care. Future studies need to 
      acknowledge the complexity of why student nurses choose a particular pathway in 
      nursing by longitudinal studies following cohorts of students during the course of 
      the nursing programme.

TI  - Multidisciplinary assessment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 113-28
AB  - The complexity of AD necessitates that multiple disciplines interface effectively in 
      the assessment of patient, caregiver, and family. This multidisciplinary effort 
      should not be focused on the mere exchange of data. As this article emphasized, just 
      from the perspective of nursing, it is critical that the various disciplines 
      involved know about the purpose, focus, and process of assessment approaches used by 
      each in the convergent effort to comprehensively evaluate the disease and its 
      possible changes, as well as its impact on function, cognition, behavior, and 
      emotion. From this article, it should be apparent that effective multidisciplinary 
      assessment is not exchange of data but rather purposive interchange of clinical 
      information to achieve the clinical goals of assessment, diagnosis, explanation, 
      intervention, prognosis, and evaluation.

TI  - Nurse home visit programs for the elderly.
PG  - 157-78
AB  - Nurses are the largest professional provider of health care services in the home 
      setting. However, nurse home visit programs are diverse. The purpose of this review 
      was to examine the many factors that influence the effectiveness of nurse home visit 
      programs for older adults. Donebedian's Quality Assessment Model was used to 
      organize the review using the components of structure, process, and outcome. A total 
      of 60 home visit studies were identified that met the following criteria: (1) nurses 
      were a major or only provider of the intervention, (2) the intervention was 
      delivered by home visits, and (3) the study included a comparison group. This review 
      demonstrates the complexity of variables that determine the effectiveness of home 
      visit interventions. Many studies demonstrated lower overall health care costs for 
      the intervention group with either improved or at least no change in clinical 
      outcomes.

AB  - Determination of a patient's capacity for medical decision making can be simple or 
      complex, depending on the issue being considered; likewise, the degree of capacity 
      required to make decisions varies with the complexity of the situation. A capacity 
      examination is a focused and impartial evaluation of mental status and medical, 
      surgical, psychiatric, and psychosocial histories. The examination is composed of 
      several basic steps, beginning with an assessment of the patient's ability to 
      communicate, followed by determination of his or her understanding of the proposed 
      care, followed by the patient's rationale for decisions about that care. When a 
      patient is deemed to lack capacity, mechanisms should be in place to ensure the 
      patient receives the care needed. This article provides an overview of the concept 
      of capacity, how it is determined, and how to proceed when the patient is found to 
      lack it.

TI  - Safe withdrawal from acute alcohol abuse in the aged.
PG  - 281-3
AB  - It is imperative to consider chronic and acute alcoholism as possibly underlying 
      problems that aged persons may exhibit. The potential exacerbation of organ 
      dysfunctions, the complexity of medication regimens, and negative interactions of 
      these are all more likely to create problems in the treatment of the elderly 
      alcoholic patient. The nurse, the social worker, the nutritionist, the physician, 
      and the pharmacologist must work as a team to treat these patients properly. The 
      nurse focuses on maintaining patient safety and function, continually assessing, 
      observing, and reassessing. On the basis of these data the pharmacologist 
      collaborates with the physician to manage medications and titrate dosages properly. 
      Malnutrition is a prevalent problem among the aged, particularly older alcoholic men 
      who live alone. The nutritionist must assess dietary deficiencies and recommend 
      therapeutic vitamins, minerals, and foods as needed. It is imperative to evaluate 
      serum levels of folic acid, cyanocobalamin, thiamine, magnesium, and to monitor 
      periodically potassium. Before discharge the social worker assists the patient in 
      beginning an appropriate alcoholic treatment plan. The situation of the acutely ill 
      alcoholic patient requires ongoing and precise collaboration of the team to achieve 
      acceptable outcomes.

TI  - Measuring quality of care with an inpatient elderly population. The geriatric 
      resource nurse model.
PG  - 8-18
AB  - Nurses provide health services to an increasing number of older adults in acute care 
      settings. Acute care nurses are committed to giving patients the highest quality 
      care while recognizing the importance of delivering care in a cost-effective manner. 
      In this study, a unit-based, nurse-centered geriatric program is evaluated. The 
      program is designed to enhance the knowledge and skill of staff nurses in providing 
      care to elderly patients. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to 
      assess geriatric resource nurses' (GRNs) influence on quality and cost outcomes of 
      the elderly participants. Patients age 65 years and older were randomly selected 
      from two general medical units of a major academic tertiary care center in the 
      southeastern United States. Data were collected during an 18-month period in 1996 
      and 1997. A total of 129 participants provided data for quantitative analysis. A 
      subset of 34 participants (17 from the unit where GRNs were on staff and 17 from a 
      control unit) was interviewed about their experience during hospitalization. This 
      information was analyzed for common themes and trends using appropriate qualitative 
      techniques. Demographic variables and common measures of illness severity and 
      complexity showed comparable patient populations on the two units. However, results 
      of quantitative analyses indicated significant differences between groups on 
      admission for several of the health status measures. Participants on the unit 
      without GRNs were found to have more problems with pain, incontinence, and mobility. 
      Administrative measures showed the number of patients readmitted to the hospital 
      within 31 days of discharge and the length of stay associated with this initial 
      readmission were significantly lower on the unit with GRNs. The use of vest-type 
      physical restraints was also less frequent on this unit. Elderly patients in both 
      groups indicated they have special needs related to normal aging changes and chronic 
      illnesses, resulting in higher levels of fragility and decreased energy reserves. 
      They identified specific functional areas for which help was needed. These include 
      assistance with bathing, eating, sleeping, mobility, and elimination. Fewer 
      participants on the intervention unit reported decline in activities of daily living 
      (ADL) function during hospitalization than did control participants. Participants in 
      both groups stressed the importance of nurses' demonstrating understanding and 
      caring when working with older individuals.

TI  - Locating ICT's benefits in elderly care.
PG  - 297-308
AB  - The impact of information and communication technology (ICT) is indirect and depends 
      on redesign of practices and structures also outside health care. Improvements will 
      only be realized if all parties involved can coordinate their efforts to take 
      advantage of new technology. A 'package' of changed work practices and structures 
      extending across organizational boundaries needs to be designed and implemented. 
      This is very different from the common conception of introducing new ICT tools. 
      Calls for 'evaluation of benefits' before new ICT systems are introduced need to 
      recognize this complexity. This article investigates how analysis and economic 
      evaluations can be used to improve decision-making when new applications are 
      proposed. This is done by drawing parallels with experiences from other industries. 
      We conclude that the entire 'change package' should be analysed for its consequences 
      on the well-being of care recipients, and the requirements it presents for capital 
      investments and changed labour inputs, in particular changed competence needs. Some 
      concepts and structures are suggested for such evaluations.

TI  - Expert knowledge elicitation using computer simulation: the organization of frail 
      elderly case management as an illustration.
PG  - 534-43
LID - 10.1111/jep.12101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various elderly case management projects have been implemented in 
      Belgium. This type of long-term health care intervention involves contextual factors 
      and human interactions. These underlying complex mechanisms can be usefully informed 
      with field experts' knowledge, which are hard to make explicit. However, computer 
      simulation has been suggested as one possible method of overcoming the difficulty of 
      articulating such elicited qualitative views. METHODS: A simulation model of case 
      management was designed using an agent-based methodology, based on the initial 
      qualitative research material. Variables and rules of interaction were formulated 
      into a simple conceptual framework. This model has been implemented and was used as 
      a support for a structured discussion with experts in case management. RESULTS: The 
      rigorous formulation provided by the agent-based methodology clarified the 
      descriptions of the interventions and the problems encountered regarding: the 
      diverse network topologies of health care actors in the project; the adaptation time 
      required by the intervention; the communication between the health care actors; the 
      institutional context; the organization of the care; and the role of the case 
      manager and his or hers personal ability to interpret the informal demands of the 
      frail older person. CONCLUSION: The simulation model should be seen primarily as a 
      tool for thinking and learning. A number of insights were gained as part of a 
      valuable cognitive process. Computer simulation supporting field experts' 
      elicitation can lead to better-informed decisions in the organization of complex 
      health care interventions.

TI  - An investigation of the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely 
      ill hospitalized older patients with coincidental dementia: a multi-method design.
PG  - 1127-36
AB  - The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the 
      components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly 
      people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the 
      problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design 
      comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived 
      from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently 
      combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and 
      older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of 
      elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer 
      from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey 
      revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were 
      more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. 
      No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had 
      items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. 
      A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were 
      invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to 
      the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of 
      the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between 
      documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within 
      each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care 
      is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. 
      Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide 
      nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by 
      the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method 
      research.

TI  - Association between continuing education and job satisfaction of nurses employed in 
      long-term care facilities.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this descriptive, correlational study was to investigate 
      the relationship between continuing education and job satisfaction among RNs and 
      licensed practical nurses (LPNs) employed in long-term care facilities. METHOD: 
      Herzberg's Motivational-Hygiene Theory was used as a framework to guide the design 
      of the study. The Professional Educational Activities Scale and the 
      McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale were completed by 110 nurses employed in 
      long-term care facilities. RESULTS: No difference was found between type of 
      employment status (full-time versus part-time) on the level of professional 
      educational activities. However, RNs participated in more continuing education 
      activities than LPNs. Nurses who reported higher family incomes also had greater 
      participation in educational activities. Registered nurses reported greater job 
      satisfaction than LPNs. No significant difference was found between the degree of 
      job satisfaction for Black and White nurses. The results of this study indicated 
      nurses who participated in more continuing education activities scored higher on the 
      job satisfaction scale. CONCLUSION: As the elderly population increases, a critical 
      need exists for nurses to be knowledgeable about current research-based information, 
      including the economic and psychosocial effects of illness in later life. To provide 
      the most effective care for the elderly population, nurses in long-term care must be 
      knowledgeable about the complexity and specific characteristics of chronic 
      illnesses. Continuing education activities are an important way to access this 
      information.

TI  - Specialist nurses to evaluate elderly in-patients referred to a department of 
      geriatric medicine.
PG  - 401-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of elderly patients are admitted to hospital. 
      Ensuring that they are given appropriate and timely access to the range of hospital 
      and community medical, rehabilitation and social care facilities has become more 
      difficult due to the complexity of management options now available, and limited 
      senior medical staff time. METHODS: We established a scheme in which specialist 
      nurses made first assessments of all inter-departmental referrals to a hospital 
      department of geriatric medicine. We evaluated the scheme prospectively using 
      process and outcome data. RESULTS: 2825 new patients were seen by two nurses in the 
      first two years, an average of 5.4 per weekday (range 0-17). Mean time from 
      admission to referral was 9 days. Most referrals were seen within 1 day. Mean total 
      length of hospital stay was 43 days (range 1-351). Seven percent died on the 
      referring ward, and 31% were discharged directly from the referring ward. Almost 
      half were accepted for in-patient rehabilitation. Sixty percent of these were 
      discharged home. Thirteen percent were transferred to an acute geriatric medical or 
      stroke ward. One-quarter of these died. Senior medical review was requested in 8% of 
      cases. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses could select patients suitable for rehabilitation, 
      identify those requiring on-going acute in-patient care, and make arrangements for 
      supported direct discharges where appropriate. This model facilitated access to a 
      wide array of discharge and community support schemes, and supported the efficient 
      use of consultant time.

TI  - Participation in physical activity: influences reported by seniors in the community 
      and in long-term care facilities.
PG  - 36-43
AB  - This qualitative study identified influences on participation in physical activity 
      among seniors living in the community and in long-term care facilities. A total of 
      24 seniors participated in individual face-to-face interviews. Through thematic 
      analysis, the overarching theme identified that past experiences, life transitions, 
      and future concerns influence seniors' participation in physical activity. This 
      overarching theme helps explain the complexity of physical activity participation in 
      later life. The subthemes included intergenerational influences, establishment of 
      early physical activity patterns, family transitions over the life course, changing 
      health status over the life course, and future health concerns. A greater 
      understanding of an individual's life history is paramount for nurses to help 
      increase participation in physical activity among seniors.

TI  - Differentiated nursing assessment of depressive symptoms in community-dwelling 
      elders.
PG  - 407-16
AB  - Because of the complexity in assessing elders for depressive symptoms, we recommend 
      that nurses use a differentiated approach as an adjunct to clinical judgment and 
      other assessment strategies. Based on our research and clinical experience, we 
      advocate the joint use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Dementia 
      Mood Assessment Scale, and propose a two-tiered assessment process. The first 
      differentiation in this process is made by means of a cut-off score to determine 
      whether or not depressive symptoms exist. If depressive symptoms are present, a 
      second system of differentiation may be employed to identify discrete symptom 
      factors. Application of this differentiated approach will enable the nurse to better 
      understand and design interventions for each elder's specific presentation of 
      depressive symptoms.

TI  - Can gerontological nursing survive?
PG  - 47-8
AB  - By the year 2041, 11 million individuals 65 and over will reside in Canada. This 
      drastic demographic change, coupled with the increasing acuity and complexity of the 
      health care needs of seniors, creates an immense demand for nurses specialized in 
      gerontology. But can gerontological nursing survive as a specialty and respond to 
      this demand?

TI  - Risk factors for an untoward medication event among elders in community-based 
      nursing caseloads in Australia.
PG  - 36-44
AB  - This study sought to develop and test a set of criteria to distinguish elders at 
      high risk of an untoward medication event within community nursing caseloads. A 
      descriptive correlational design was used to identify relevant risk factors for 
      elders. Data on medication knowledge, regime, management abilities, and adherence 
      were obtained from 111 elders receiving community nursing care. Four predictors--12 
      or more doses of medications per day, more than one prescriber, caregiver available, 
      and sometimes forgetting to take medications--of complexity (R2 explaining 39% of 
      the variance) and adherence (R2 explaining 49% of the variance) were identified as 
      potential factors that subsequently confirmed a discrete group of high risk elders. 
      The use of these four risk factors or screening criteria is recommended for older 
      people within community nursing caseloads.

TI  - Health risks and health promotion for older women: utility of a health promotion 
      diary.
PG  - 62-72
AB  - Elderly women require health screening and health promotion services from nurses and 
      other health care providers. Nurses serving this population require knowledge of 
      age-specific health screening and health promotion services. A case study from a 
      geriatric nurse practitioner's practice demonstrates the complexity of these 
      activities. A diary of such services can help nurses focus on elderly women's needs 
      for health promotion interventions.

TI  - Non-equilibrium systems theory: some applications for gerontological nursing 
      practice.
PG  - 24-31
AB  - 1. In terms of NEST, aging can be understood as a process of formative change toward 
      increasing disorder and order in form, pattern, or structure. The person moves 
      toward greater complexity through self-organization processes. 2. Over time, 
      self-organization processes result in increasingly unique perceptions and behavior. 
      As an older person becomes more unique, he or she becomes more different from other 
      older persons. 3. Self-organization processes are an appropriate focus of concern 
      for nursing when NEST is used as a practice framework. The nurse tries to understand 
      older persons' behaviors as outcomes of self-organization processes (attempts to 
      bring order out of disorder).
