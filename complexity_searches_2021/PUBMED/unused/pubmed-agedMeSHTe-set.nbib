TI  - Palliative care in dementia: literature review of nurses' knowledge and attitudes 
      towards pain assessment.
PG  - 400-7
LID - 10.12968/ijpn.2015.21.8.400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is prevalent among older people, yet is often under-recognised and 
      undertreated in people with dementia. The nurse has a central role in identifying 
      and appropriately assessing pain in order to provide effective treatment. Research 
      however suggests there are significant deficits in this area. AIM: To explore the 
      evidence on nurses' knowledge and attitudes to pain assessment in older people with 
      dementia. DESIGN: A systematic narrative review of peer-reviewed articles published 
      between 2000 and 2014. DATA SOURCES: Seven electronic data bases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, 
      PsycInfo, Wiley, Pubmed, ProQuest and OVID) were searched and articles focusing on 
      nurses knowledge and attitudes on pain assessment towards people with dementia. 
      METHODS: Research participants within the studies reviewed were to include 
      registered nurses involved in the assessment and management of pain in older adults 
      with dementia from across all healthcare settings (e.g. dementia units, nursing 
      homes, community and acute settings). RESULTS: Data were systematically analysed 
      from 11 papers. Using an inductive approach for thematic content analysis informed 
      by the theory of planned behaviour, five themes were identified. These included: 1) 
      Challenges in diagnosing pain in dementia 2) Inadequacies of pain assessment tools 
      3) Time constraints and workload pressures 4) Lack of interdisciplinary teamwork and 
      communication 5) Training and education. CONCLUSION: Nurses play a key role in the 
      effective management of pain through the use of pain assessment tools, behavioural 
      observation, and analgesic choice. Pain assessment in dementia remains challenging 
      for nurses due to the complexity and individualisation of pain behaviours. The 
      accessibility of appropriate training, workforce stability and a standardised 
      approach to pain assessment are key to the successful management of pain in older 
      people with dementia.

TI  - Caring for patients with dementia in the acute care setting.
PG  - 358-362
LID - 10.12968/bjon.2018.27.7.358 [doi]
AB  - This article highlights the vulnerability of people with dementia in the acute 
      hospital setting, where they are more likely to experience clinical incidents such 
      as falls, contract infections and be prescribed neuroleptic drugs. This patient 
      group has a significantly longer length of hospital stay and higher mortality rate 
      following discharge compared with those without dementia. As many as one third are 
      discharged to institutionalised care. The article explores the knowledge gap 
      concerning the complexity of caring for a person with dementia and highlights 
      factors that can lead to staff detaching themselves from engaging in meaningful 
      communication with patients. It also discusses the syndrome of 'cascade 
      iatrogenesis' in relation to patients' physical and cognitive decline. More emphasis 
      needs to be placed on addressing these issues to ensure the safety and welfare of 
      people with dementia in hospitals. A case study from the author's clinical practice 
      is used to illustrate the issues.

AB  - Our aging population is rapidly growing and accounts for 46% of critical care 
      patients and 60% of medical-surgical patients in the hospital. These acutely ill 
      patients are challenging to frontline nurses because they frequently have multiple 
      chronic conditions. This article provides a tool kit of resources and clinical 
      skills to develop safe, quality, and accountable care plans for positive patient 
      outcomes; it presents several resources to assist in individualized care, the 
      complexity of care, and the issues of transitions of care. This article empowers 
      frontline nurses to develop gerontological skills and meet the unique needs of our 
      aging population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors related to the occurrence of urinary tract infection 
      associated with urinary catheter use. METHOD: A longitudinal, retrospective cohort 
      study carried out by analyzing the electronic medical records of patients admitted 
      to an intensive care unit of a high-complexity hospital from July 2016 to June 2017. 
      Demographic and clinical data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical analysis. 
      RESULTS: The incidence density of urinary tract infection related to urinary 
      catheter use was 4.8 per 1000 catheters/day, the majority (80.6%) with no indication 
      for catheter use, and there was no prescription for insertion and/or maintenance in 
      86.7%. The mean time between catheter insertion and infection diagnosis was 11.3 ± 
      6.3 days (6 to 28 days). Statistically significant factors (p < 0.001) related to 
      urinary infection linked to catheter use were hospitalization time in the unit (16.7 
      ± 9 days), catheter permanence time (12.7 ± 6.9 days), and the use of antimicrobials 
      in the intensive care unit (8.6 ± 6.3 days). CONCLUSION: The association of 
      indication absence and the record of the need for maintenance possibly potentiated 
      the occurrence of urinary tract infection associated to catheter use.

TI  - The impact of aspiration pneumonia and nasogastric feeding on clinical outcomes in 
      stroke patients: A retrospective cohort study.
PG  - e235-e241
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13922 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine presence of clinical complications related to 
      dysphagia and to explore their operational outcomes. BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a 
      common complication of stroke. The management of poststroke dysphagia is 
      multidisciplinary with nurses playing a key role in screening for dysphagia risk, 
      monitoring tolerance of food and fluids and checking for the development of 
      complications such as fever, dehydration and change in medical status. Dysphagia 
      often results in further complications including aspiration pneumonia and the need 
      for nasogastric feeding. Dysphagia-related complications have been shown to have a 
      significant impact on morbidity and mortality, length of stay and cost of admission. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 110 patients presenting with 
      an ischaemic stroke were chart-audited. RESULTS: Aspiration pneumonia poststroke was 
      found to be significantly associated with increased overall length of stay, poorer 
      functional outcomes poststroke as well as being associated with a high risk of 
      mortality. The presence of a nasogastric tube was also associated with reduced 
      functional outcomes poststroke and increased risk of death. CONCLUSION: High 
      prevalence and cost of complications associated with stroke highlight the complexity 
      of providing nursing and allied health care to this patient population. This 
      provides a snapshot of dysphagia-related complications experienced by stroke 
      patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper highlights that poststroke 
      complications can significantly impact on patient outcomes and operational factors 
      such as cost of admission; therefore, poststroke care requires a multidisciplinary 
      approach to management. Furthermore, preventing and managing complications 
      poststroke is a key element of nursing care and has the potential to significantly 
      reduce incidence of mortality, length of stay and cost of hospital admission.

TI  - Who often feels lonely? A cross-sectional study about loneliness and its related 
      factors among older home-dwelling people.
LID - 10.1111/opn.12162 [doi]
AB  - AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of individuals who often feel 
      lonely among a sample of Norwegian older home-dwelling people aged ≥65 years old, as 
      well as to identify any possible factors explaining their loneliness. BACKGROUND: 
      Loneliness is known to be common among older people. To identify those older adults 
      who are lonely, and to acquire knowledge about the complexity of their loneliness, 
      is important to provide them with adequate help and support. DESIGN: This study 
      employed a cross-sectional design. METHOD: A questionnaire was mailed to a 
      randomised sample of 6,033 older home-dwelling persons aged ≥65 years. A total of 
      2,052 persons returned the questionnaire and were included in the study. The 
      questionnaire consisted of questions asking whether the subjects often felt lonely 
      or not, as well as health-related and background questions and instruments to 
      measure the participants' sense of coherence, mental problems, nutritional screening 
      and self-care ability. The data were analysed using univariate and multivariate 
      statistical methods. RESULTS: A total of 11.6% of the participants reported often 
      feeling lonely. Six factors emerged to be independently associated with often 
      feeling lonely among the respondents: Living alone, not being satisfied with life, 
      having mental problems, a weak sense of coherence, not having contact with 
      neighbours and being at risk for undernutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that 
      often feeling lonely among older home-dwelling persons is a health-related problem 
      that includes social, psychological and physical aspects. Moreover, these persons 
      have limited resources to overcome feelings of loneliness. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: Lasting loneliness among older home-dwelling persons requires an overall, 
      person-centred and time-consuming approach by nurses. Nurses with advanced knowledge 
      on geriatric nursing may be required to offer appropriate care and support. 
      Healthcare leaders and politicians should offer possibilities for adequate 
      assessment, support and help.

TI  - Care coordination to target patient complexity and reduce disparities in primary 
      care.
PG  - 451-460
LID - 10.1111/phn.12606 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe our Activation and Coordination 
      Team (ACT) model for interprofessional care coordination in primary care and examine 
      feasibility of using ACT medical and social complexity criteria to categorize 
      patients into Quadrants that determine resource utilization. Research questions 
      were: (a) Are there significant differences in demographic, medical, and social 
      characteristics by Quadrant; (b) Do patients with combined high medical and social 
      complexity differ from those with either high medical or social complexity; and (c) 
      Is there an association between initial screening risk level and ACT Complexity 
      Quadrant placement? DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive. SAMPLE: Patients (N = 167) 
      aged 18-65 enrolled in an urban Medicaid managed care network. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Screening and comprehensive health risk assessment questionnaires and clinical data 
      collection from electronic health records. RESULTS: Patient characteristics differed 
      significantly by Quadrant. Combined medical and social complexity produced greater 
      impact than additive effects. Patients who initially screened low risk nevertheless 
      met ACT criteria for medical and/or social complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Greater effects 
      for individuals with medical and social issues are due to interactions among 
      factors. Traditional screening may miss patients with complex needs who need care 
      coordination. Care coordination skills should be incorporated into population health 
      curricula.

TI  - Hyperglycemia and Cancer: A State-of-the-Science Review.
PG  - 459-472
LID - 10.1188/19.ONF.459-472 [doi]
AB  - PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: Hyperglycemia can increase the risk for adverse events and 
      outcomes in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. The purposes of this 
      state-of-the-science review were to explore the complexity of hyperglycemia in 
      patients with cancer and to analyze physiologic mechanisms and outcomes in 
      individuals with or at risk for cancer. LITERATURE SEARCH: PubMed® and the Cochrane 
      Library databases were searched, and 95 articles were included. Findings were 
      evaluated for their methods and analyses. Studies assessed as methodologically 
      flawed were not included. DATA EVALUATION: The synthesis of the articles provided 
      the evidence for describing normal and glycemic pathways. Hyperglycemia in patients 
      with cancer was explored through chronic inflammatory mechanisms that lead to 
      increased risks for adverse events and outcomes. SYNTHESIS: This article discusses 
      normal glucose regulation and hyperglycemic pathways, hyperglycemia in patients with 
      cancer, hyperglycemia and cancer-related inflammation, and outcomes (e.g., 
      infections, mortality, symptoms). IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Understanding the 
      contributors to and consequences of hyperglycemia can guide the development of 
      screening tools to predict which individuals are at the greatest risk for 
      hyperglycemic episodes prior to starting cancer therapies. Research can lead to 
      glycemic guidelines specific to patients with cancer for better outcomes.

TI  - Implementing Posthospital Interprofessional Care Team Visits to Improve Care 
      Transitions and Decrease Hospital Readmission Rates.
PG  - 264-271
LID - 10.1097/NCM.0000000000000284 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Today's health care climate is composed of patients who 
      experience complex conditions with multiple comorbidities, requiring higher 
      utilization of acute care services. It is imperative for acute care and primary care 
      landscapes to bridge silos and form collaborative relationships to ensure safe and 
      effective transitions of care from hospital to home. An interprofessional, 
      posthospital follow-up clinic (Discharge Clinic) is one approach that can be used to 
      improve transitions of care and decrease preventable hospital readmissions. The 
      purpose of the Discharge Clinic is to improve transitions of care and decrease 
      30-day hospital readmission rates. The clinic's objective is to utilize an 
      interprofessional care team to improve transitions of care posthospital, for complex 
      care patients. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: The posthospital Discharge Clinic is an 
      innovative, interprofessional clinic located in a large western state that was 
      initiated to improve transitions of care for its patients discharged from an acute 
      care setting. The interprofessional care team consists of a certified family nurse 
      practitioner, a clinical pharmacist, a nurse case manager, and a social worker. 
      FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: In 2013, Medicare and private coverage data reveal 30-day 
      readmission rates of 17.3% and 8.6%, respectively (). From February 2016 to 
      September 2016, Discharge Clinic project participants achieved a 30-day readmission 
      rate of 2.7%. The Discharge Clinic enrolled 75 patients in the project (n = 75). The 
      30-day readmission rate achieved by the Discharge Clinic represents a significant 
      decrease compared with national benchmark data. Two patients enrolled in the project 
      were readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge. For fiscal year 2015, the 
      medical group's estimated cost of readmissions was $7,156,800 and 30-day all-cause 
      readmission rate was 12.3%. This equated to the Discharge Clinic's estimated impact 
      in reducing readmissions at 9.63% and an estimated savings of $689,199.84. The 
      Discharge Clinic estimated its operating costs at $354,000, which gave a total 
      estimated net savings of $335,199.84. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: The 
      current health care landscape is composed of an aging population, rising in 
      complexity. New approaches are needed to bridge gaps between acute care and primary 
      care settings. The Discharge Clinic serves as an innovative model that health 
      systems throughout the country can replicate to improve transitions of care for 
      complex patients. The interprofessional care team model can be implemented to 
      advance and bridge the management of acute and ambulatory care patient populations.

TI  - Patients' Perceptions of a Pressure Ulcer Prevention Care Bundle in Hospital: A 
      Qualitative Descriptive Study to Guide Evidence-Based Practice.
PG  - 385-393
LID - 10.1111/wvn.12226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers place a significant burden on patients and hospitals. 
      Our team developed and tested a pressure ulcer prevention care bundle (PUPCB) in a 
      cluster randomized trial. As part of the process evaluation conducted alongside the 
      trial, we explored patients' perceptions of the intervention. AIMS: To identify 
      patients' perceptions and experiences of a PUPCB in hospital. METHODS: This 
      qualitative descriptive study explored the perceptions of a subset of patients who 
      participated in a trial testing the PUPCB across four intervention hospitals. A 
      trained interviewer conducted semistructured interviews, which were digitally 
      recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Nineteen 
      patients were interviewed across the four hospitals. Three main themes emerged: (a) 
      importance of personal contact in PUPCB delivery; (b) understanding pressure ulcer 
      prevention (PUP) enhances participation; and (c) individual factors impact patients' 
      engagement in PUP. DISCUSSION: The extent to which patients adopted the intervention 
      appeared to be influenced by the complexity of education materials, compatibility 
      with patients' existing knowledge and beliefs, and perceived advantage of the 
      intervention; ability for human interaction; and patient-related facilitators and 
      barriers to participating in PUP care. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This study found 
      patients accepted a PUPCB that encouraged participation in care, particularly as it 
      involved personal and positive interactions with nurses and provision of information 
      that was easy to understand and resonated with patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of burden of treatment and multimorbidity on the 
      relationship between baseline characteristics and oral oncolytic agent (OOA) 
      temporary stoppages. SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: 272 patients newly prescribed OOAs at six 
      National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers. METHODS &AMP; 
      VARIABLES: Patients were randomly assigned to an adherence and symptom management 
      group or a usual care/control group. Temporary OOA stoppages, symptom interference, 
      OOA regimen complexity, and multimorbidities were explored. Data were collected at 
      four-week intervals for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Burden of treatment variables and 
      multimorbidity had no significant effect on OOA temporary stoppages. Women and those 
      prescribed kinase inhibitors were significantly more likely to experience a 
      temporary stoppage. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Oncology nurses are in a crucial 
      position to educate patients on self-management of OOAs and symptoms. Nurses should 
      be aware of patients who may be more susceptible to severe symptoms, including those 
      with multimorbidities. Future research is needed to better understand OOA stoppages 
      and factors associated with preventing stoppages.

      performance and biopsychosocial and health system aspects among hospitalized elderly 
      with or without cognitive decline. METHOD: quantitative, cross-sectional and 
      analytical study in which was used the INTERMED method and cognitive and functional 
      screening scales. We investigated 384 elderly patients admitted to a medical and 
      surgical clinic of a University Hospital located in São Paulo/SP. RESULTS: cognitive 
      decline was present in 40.1% of the sample, most of them were longer-lived elderly 
      individuals with less schooling and income, more dependent in activities of daily 
      living and had greater vulnerability in different domains of INTERMED. After 
      adjustments, the elderly with cognitive decline presented greater vulnerability in 
      the psychological domain. CONCLUSION: the relationship between cognitive decline and 
      psychological vulnerability highlights the need to adopt long-term care based on 
      involvement of the family, health team and different services, thereby maximizing 
      the quality of care.

AB  - Evidence suggests that delivery of good nursing care in long-term care (LTC) 
      facilities is reflected in nurses' descriptions of the factors and structures that 
      affect their work. Understanding the contemporary nature of nursing work in aged 
      care will influence policies for improving current work structures in this practice 
      setting. The current review aims to present a contemporary perspective of RNs' work 
      in LTC facilities. A comprehensive search and purposeful selection of the literature 
      was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. 
      Nine studies were eligible for review. Common themes revealed that nursing work in 
      aged care settings is characterized by RNs providing indirect care tasks-primarily 
      care coordination, engaging in non-nursing activities, and having an expanded and 
      overlapping role. As care providers, aged care RNs do not always provide direct care 
      as part of their nursing work. The scope of RN work beyond its clinical nature or 
      performance of non-nursing tasks adds complexity in clarifying RN work roles in aged 
      care. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 43(11), 41-49.].

LID - 10.12968/bjon.2019.28.4.242 [doi]
AB  - This article describes the management of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant 
      Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-Ab) at an acute NHS Foundation Trust. The outbreak 
      affected two respiratory wards and the initial outbreak lasted 9 months, with the 
      first patient (index case) being identified in April 2015 and the final, tenth case, 
      in September 2015. The outbreak was declared closed in January 2016, but a further 
      two cases were identified in July and August 2016. Of the 12 identified patients, 
      eight were colonised with the bacterium and four were infected. The four infections 
      were of the respiratory tract with MDR-Ab, of identical variable number tandem 
      repeat, isolated from sputum in all cases. All 12 patients were decolonised and this 
      continued throughout the outbreak. Some negative rescreening results were achieved. 
      At the time of the outbreak, decolonisation using octenidine had not been reported 
      in any guidelines. The sensitivity of MDR-Ab to octenidine was microbiologically 
      tested and antibacterial action of octenidine against this organism was 
      demonstrated. The use of octenidine appeared to be one element in helping to control 
      this testing situation. This report seeks to demonstrate not only the complexity of 
      managing and containing an outbreak of MDR-Ab but also how, with the use of a range 
      of effective infection prevention measures, the spread of this pathogen can be 
      successfully controlled. It is hoped that this article will increase awareness among 
      healthcare providers and infection prevention and control (IPC) teams of the threat 
      posed by this organism in the healthcare environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relation between patient complexity and 
      nursing care of total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients. To improve patient care and 
      hospital logistics, the aim of this study is to gain insight into the relation 
      between patient complexity and the nursing staff's actual and perceived workload at 
      an orthopedic ward during admission for a THA. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 
      45 THA patients in the year 2014. Duration and type of nursing care activities were 
      recorded during the first postoperative morning. A questionnaire was used to analyze 
      the perceived workload of the nursing staff. Both actual and perceived workload were 
      analyzed for their relation with patient complexity, expressed in the American 
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), Katz 
      Activities of Daily Life score (Katz-ADL) and Body Mass Index (BMI). RESULTS: No 
      relation was found between actual workload and measures for patient complexity. The 
      perceived workload of the nursing staff was related to two complexity measures: ASA 
      (r=0.71; p<0.001) and CCI (r=0.65; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Patient comorbidity is 
      related to the perceived workload of the nursing staff during admission for a THA. 
      Patient complexity is not related to actual workload. This study gives a first 
      insight into the relation between patient comorbidity and nursing staff workload, to 
      try to improve staffing numbers at the ward as well as patient care in the process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the concept of patient participation has been discussed for a 
      number of years, there is still no clear definition of what constitutes the 
      multidimensional concept, and the application of the concept in an intermediate care 
      (IC) context lacks clarity. Therefore this paper seeks to identify and explore the 
      attributes of the concept, to elaborate ways of understanding the concept of patient 
      participation for geriatric patients in the context of IC. METHODS: Walker and 
      Avant's model of Concept analysis [1] based on a literature review. RESULTS: Patient 
      participation in the context of IC can be defined as a dynamic process emphasizing 
      the person as a whole, focusing on the establishment of multiple alliances that 
      facilitate individualized information and knowledge exchange, and ensuring a 
      reciprocal engagement in activities within flexible and interactive/dynamic 
      organizational structures. CONCLUSION: Patient participation in IC means involving 
      patients and their relatives in holistic interdisciplinary collaborative 
      decision-making. The results highlight the complexity of patient participation and 
      contribute to a greater understanding of the influence of organizational structure 
      and management. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The present study may provide a practical 
      framework for researchers, policy makers and health professionals to facilitate 
      patient participation in IC services.

LID - 10.1080/10376178.2018.1480399 [doi]
AB  - Older people living in residential aged care often experience complex persistent 
      pain because of the presence of multiple comorbidities and geriatric syndrome. 
      Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional 
      burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain 
      management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration needs 
      to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population can be 
      improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary suffering.

AB  - As many as 233,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer each 
      year. Most diagnoses are of low-grade, localized disease, which tends to be slow 
      growing and is rarely lethal, even in the absence of intervention. The amount and 
      complexity of the information men receive at diagnosis may be overwhelming and 
      difficult to process, particularly given the weight of a new cancer diagnosis and 
      the potential for long-term, life-altering adverse effects from treatment. This 
      review examines the multiple options available for men with newly diagnosed, 
      low-risk, localized prostate cancer and explains how nurses can help these men and 
      their partners make treatment decisions that are appropriate for their particular 
      circumstances.

TI  - A Narrative Care approach for persons living with dementia in institutional care 
      settings.
PG  - e12278
LID - 10.1111/opn.12278 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We will provide insights in the theoretical background and key 
      concepts of a Narrative Care approach, such as narrative cultures, narrative 
      curiosity, narrative co-composition and narrative reflective practice. BACKGROUND: 
      Care understood as narrative practice underscores the importance of experiences and 
      how these shape identities. Important to the quality of care in institutional care 
      settings is the ability of care providers to cope with complexities and 
      uncertainties in older adults' stories, which can be realised by attending to ways 
      that foster and co-compose evolving and forward-looking narratives. Recognising 
      these ongoing co-compositions means that persons living in institutional care 
      settings and care providers live, tell, retell and relive their experiences. A 
      change in the current institutional culture is necessary to implement care as 
      narrative practice. To support such a change, approaches are needed that foster a 
      focus on experiences and relationships and make relational ethics central to care. 
      METHODS: The proposed Narrative Care approach is the result of an iterative 
      development process involving a literature review, interviews with, and observations 
      of, care providers, dialogues with an advisory committee, and consultation with 
      experts. MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS: The proposed Narrative Care approach aims to help care 
      providers (a) to recognise the importance of curiosity in a person's verbal and 
      embodied narratives-especially for those living with dementia; (b) to take note of 
      individual experiences in all of their complexity and uncertainty; (c) to respect 
      these narratives; (d) to open up spaces to co-compose new narratives; and (e) to 
      allow care providers to engage in narrative reflective practices that shape who they 
      are and are becoming. CONCLUSION: The introduced approach responds to the need of 
      implementing strategies to think and work narratively in institutional care 
      settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Narrative Care has the potential to reshape 
      task-oriented, technical notions of care. Concepts such as embodied narratives, 
      relational ethics, narrative co-composition and narrative reflective practice must 
      be integrated in the education of all care providers.

AB  - Nurses should be familiar with and equipped to address the challenges that arise 
      when caring for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer-identified (LGBTQ) 
      patients. LGBTQ individuals have increased rates of certain physical diseases and 
      are at greater risk of suffering from stress-sensitive mental health issues. 
      Negative social attitudes, widespread discrimination and stigma, physical and 
      psychological victimization, and less social support with aging contribute to the 
      complexity of care for these individuals. Open communication, welcoming and 
      accepting attitudes and environments, and sensitivity to unique multidimensional 
      issues improve care to LGBTQ patients with serious advanced illness. Nursing can 
      reach this vulnerable minority and positively impact the quality of care.

TI  - Breast health awareness in an Arabic culture: A qualitative exploration.
PG  - 1713-1722
LID - 10.1111/jan.14003 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore breast health awareness and the early diagnosis and detection 
      methods of breast cancer from the perspective of women and primary healthcare 
      providers in Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND: A high incidence of advanced breast cancer 
      exists in Saudi Arabia, particularly among younger women. This is due to poor 
      awareness of breast cancer and its management, social customs and poor breast health 
      awareness among healthcare providers. DESIGN: Qualitative exploratory study. 
      METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in eight states across the Jizan 
      region of Saudi Arabia. Purposive sampling was used to recruit Saudi women (N = 24), 
      general practitioners (N = 20), and nurses (N = 20). Semi-structured interviews were 
      conducted from November 2015-February 2016. Inductive thematic analysis was 
      undertaken. RESULTS: Overarching themes centred on culture, religion, and resources. 
      Novel key findings from this study confirm that Saudi women require more health 
      education about breast cancer and breast cancer screening. The study has provided 
      important new knowledge in relation to Islamic concept of preserving health, social 
      barriers, cultural taboos, misconceptions, and myths that currently exist 
      surrounding breast cancer in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: This study provides new 
      evidence on the complexity of poor breast health awareness and lack of resources in 
      Saudi Arabia. Additional resources are needed to remove such barriers and provide 
      targeted health education and services. IMPACT: This research informs breast cancer 
      service provision for Muslim or Arab women internationally as they share cultural 
      resources or Islamic principles to follow a healthy lifestyle and help promote the 
      uptake of breast cancer screening services.

TI  - Relationships Between Subjective Cognitive Impairment and Personality Traits: A 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 27-34
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20190111-04 [doi]
AB  - This systematic review examined the relationships between personality traits and 
      subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) in older adults without dementia. A 
      comprehensive literature search conducted according to PRISMA guidelines identified 
      empirical investigations of SCI and at least one of the big five personality traits 
      among adults age 60 or older. All articles were critically appraised using the 
      weight of evidence framework and findings were compared, contrasted, and synthesized 
      across studies. Sixteen of the 797 studies initially identified met eligibility 
      criteria. A higher level of SCI was associated with higher neuroticism in 88% of the 
      studies reviewed. In addition, a consistent negative association was identified 
      between conscientiousness and SCI (57% of studies). No consistent relationships 
      between openness, extraversion, or agreeableness and SCI were identified. Overall, 
      this review supports the oft-cited association between higher neuroticism and 
      greater self-reports of cognitive problems; however, the complexity of the 
      relationship between SCI and personality is not yet fully understood. Future 
      research should examine the extent to which different personality traits predispose 
      individuals to report symptoms versus those traits that are associated with 
      increased sensitivity to early indicators of pathological change. [Journal of 
      Gerontological Nursing, 45(2), 27-34.].

TI  - Perspectives of nurse managers on information communication technology and 
      e-Leadership.
PG  - 1554-1562
LID - 10.1111/jonm.12845 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We sought nurse managers' perspectives on challenges and opportunities with 
      technology and how it may influence communication and leadership. BACKGROUND: 
      e-Leadership is a conceptual framework used to understand and teach organisational 
      leaders about the application of technology to leadership. Technology is integral to 
      leadership, yet little is understood about how nurse managers may use this 
      technology and how they negotiate the complexity of the multiple communication 
      systems currently in use. METHODS: Sixteen nurse managers from individual hospitals 
      within a large US healthcare system participated in qualitative open-ended 
      interviews and focus groups. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the qualitative data 
      regarding the nurse managers' perspectives of e-Leadership and their use of 
      information and communication technologies: (a) Can't live without it, (b) Too much, 
      too many, (c) Poor onboarding education and (d) Difficulty maintaining virtual 
      relationships. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Effective and safe patient care 
      is dependent on multiple technology applications that require significant knowledge 
      and practice. Nursing leadership may consider the need for more supported 
      mentorship, and engaging programs to educate nurse managers about the dozens of 
      applications required to effectively manage and lead. For technology to be used to 
      its full potential it should be designed with nursing involvement.

TI  - Care Complexity Individual Factors Associated With Hospital Readmission: A 
      Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 411-421
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12393 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of care complexity individual factors documented 
      in the nursing assessment and to identify the risk factors associated with hospital 
      readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge. DESIGN: Observational analysis of 
      a retrospective cohort at a 700-bed university hospital in Barcelona, Spain. A total 
      of 16,925 adult patient admissions to a ward or intermediate care units were 
      evaluated from January to December 2016. Most patients were admitted due to 
      cardiocirculatory and respiratory disorders (29.3%), musculoskeletal and nervous 
      system disorders (21.8%), digestive and hepatobiliary conditions (17.9%), and kidney 
      or urinary disorders (11.2%). METHODS: Readmission was defined as rehospitalization 
      for any reason within 30 days of discharge. Patients who required hospital 
      readmission were compared with those who did not. The individual factors of care 
      complexity included five domains (developmental, mental-cognitive, psycho-emotional, 
      sociocultural, and comorbidity or complications) and were reviewed using the 
      electronic nursing assessment records. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed 
      to determine factors associated with readmission. FINDINGS: A total of 1,052 
      patients (6.4%) were readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge. Care 
      complexity individual factors from the comorbidity or complications domain were 
      found to be the most frequently e-charted (88.3%). Care complexity individual 
      factors from developmental (33.2%), psycho-emotional (13.2%), mental-cognitive 
      (7.2%), and sociocultural (0.7%) domains were less frequently documented. 
      Independent factors associated with hospital readmission were old age (≥75 years), 
      duration of first hospitalization, admission to a nonsurgical ward, major chronic 
      disease, hemodynamic instability, immunosuppression, and relative weight of 
      diagnosis-related group. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of patients required 
      readmission within 30 days after discharge. The most frequent care complexity 
      individual factors recorded in the nursing assessment at index admission were 
      related to comorbidity or complications, developmental, and psycho-emotional 
      domains. Strategies related to transition of care that include clinical 
      characteristics and comorbidity or complications factors should be a priority at 
      hospital discharge and after leaving hospital, but other factors related to 
      developmental and psycho-emotional domains could have an important effect on the use 
      of healthcare resources. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nurses should identify patients with 
      comorbidity or complications, developmental, and psycho-emotional complexity factors 
      during the index admission in order to be able to implement an effective discharge 
      process of care.

TI  - The role of concealment and relationship quality on patient hospitalizations, care 
      strain and depressive symptoms in heart failure dyads.
PG  - 118-124
LID - 10.1177/1474515119863791 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization 
      among older adults and negatively influences person-reported outcomes of patients 
      and their care partners. Moreover, the majority of heart failure research examines 
      patients and care partners separately, ignoring the interdependent nature of the 
      heart failure dyad. AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the interpersonal 
      factors associated with depressive symptoms of heart failure patients and spouse 
      care partners, patient hospitalizations over the last 12 months and care strain. 
      METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used to examine 60 
      community-dwelling adults with heart failure and their spouse care partners. 
      Multilevel modeling controlled for the interdependent nature of the dyadic data. 
      RESULTS: Patients had significantly worse depressive symptoms than their spouse care 
      partners. More patient concealment (i.e. hiding concerns/worries) and worse 
      relationship quality were significantly associated with greater depressive symptoms 
      for patients, but not spouse care partners. Better relationship quality (reported by 
      spouse care partners) was significantly associated with lower levels of care strain, 
      whereas better relationship quality (reported by patients) was significantly 
      associated with worse care strain. Patients who had one or more hospitalizations 
      over the past 12 months were significantly more likely to report higher levels of 
      concealment; relationship quality was not associated with patient hospitalizations. 
      CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the interdependent nature of heart failure and the 
      complexity of the interpersonal context. Greater focus on how the heart failure dyad 
      navigates illness as a unit over time is needed to design and tailor innovative 
      lines of clinical intervention to optimize dyadic and individual health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complexity and difficulties involved in the development and 
      implementation of health innovations, such as advanced practice nursing roles, 
      result in slow and sporadic international acceptance. To manage this complexity, it 
      is advisable to deepen understanding of the context in which these innovation 
      processes take place. However, there is little research specifically concerned with 
      contextual factors that influence the implementation of advanced practice nursing 
      roles. PURPOSE: To integrate results and develop a comprehensive understanding of 
      the contextual factors that influence the development and implementation of advanced 
      practice nursing in two countries, Canada and Spain. METHODS: The research method 
      used was qualitative, descriptive, and explanatory. Different qualitative methods, a 
      novel data-collection process, and perspectives from participants in various 
      professional groups were used to triangulate the findings from both settings. 
      Participants with diverse perspectives on practice, organization, and health and 
      regulatory environments were engaged to participate in semistructured focus groups 
      in Catalonia and individual interviews in Quebec. Data gathered were to provide 
      information on a variety of context dimensions: understanding of advanced practice 
      nursing; perceived needs to develop the role; and perceived barriers and 
      facilitators present in the Catalan and Quebec contexts. Thematic analysis was 
      carried out based on the theoretical proposals from the framework and triangulated 
      for both sides. FINDINGS: Thirty interviews were conducted in Quebec and 44 in 
      Catalonia. Integration of findings reflected a vast predominance of convergent 
      themes despite differences in context and population characteristics. The study 
      identified common and divergent contextual factors in advanced practice development 
      and implementation in these settings. The same perceived barriers and facilitators 
      were prominent almost evenly across all groups, although organizational and 
      environmental themes were the most coded and discussed during interviews. 
      DISCUSSION: Understanding contextual factors will ultimately allow better 
      understanding of complex phenomena in health care. Further reporting of contextual 
      factors that influence the development and implementation of advanced practice 
      nursing roles in other countries is required to compare innovative processes.

TI  - Genetic Basis of Positive and Negative Symptom Domains in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 559-575
LID - 10.1177/1099800417715907 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder, the genetic etiology of which has been 
      well established. Yet despite significant advances in genetics research, the 
      pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder largely remain unknown. This gap has 
      been attributed to the complexity of the polygenic disorder, which has a 
      heterogeneous clinical profile. Examining the genetic basis of schizophrenia 
      subphenotypes, such as those based on particular symptoms, is thus a useful strategy 
      for decoding the underlying mechanisms. This review of literature examines the 
      recent advances (from 2011) in genetic exploration of positive and negative symptoms 
      in schizophrenia. We searched electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature using key words 
      schizophrenia, symptoms, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognition, genetics, 
      genes, genetic predisposition, and genotype in various combinations. We identified 
      115 articles, which are included in the review. Evidence from these studies, most of 
      which are genetic association studies, identifies shared and unique gene 
      associations for the symptom domains. Genes associated with neurotransmitter systems 
      and neuronal development/maintenance primarily constitute the shared associations. 
      Needed are studies that examine the genetic basis of specific symptoms within the 
      broader domains in addition to functional mechanisms. Such investigations are 
      critical to developing precision treatment and care for individuals afflicted with 
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Health Literacy in Older Latinos With Heart Failure: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 125-134
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0000000000000314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: By 2050, one-third of US residents will be Latino, with an incidence of 
      heart failure (HF) higher than other ethnicities. Culturally linked risk factors and 
      socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare disparities, 
      and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy (HL) and HF are 
      less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease management, or 
      preventative health strategies. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we analyzed 
      the literature studying older Latinos with HF and limited HL. METHOD: We searched 
      the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. Inclusion criteria were research 
      studies, Latinos, HF, and HL. RESULTS: Eight quantitative studies were identified 
      for final review. Inadequate HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL 
      was associated with more HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL 
      levels and higher medical complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses and advanced practice 
      nurses serve a pivotal role improving access and understanding of health 
      information. Before conducting intervention research affecting clinical outcomes, it 
      is essential to describe elderly Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. 
      Barriers identified confirm the need to alter research protocols for older adults 
      and ensure the availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older 
      Latinos with HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients 
      with limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF 
      knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be reliable 
      predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, and develop, 
      implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to develop a Navigation Program for cancer patients, based on the model 
      proposed by The GW Cancer Institute at George Washington University, adapted to the 
      reality of a Brazilian High Complexity Center in Oncology. METHOD: a convergent care 
      research applied in the development of a patient navigation care process, based on 
      the model proposed by George Washington University, adapted for a High Complexity 
      Center in Oncology in Brazil. Phases of the Convergent Assistance Research: 
      conception, instrumentation, scrutiny, analysis and interpretation. These were 
      correlated with the stages of the Program Development Cycle. Scale designed to 
      categorize patients into navigation levels, validated by the Delphi Technique, with 
      12 specialists. RESULTS: in the diagnosis, patients with head and neck cancer were 
      defined for inclusion in the Navigation Program. Planning and implementation took 
      place simultaneously, allowing the basic formatting of the program and its processes 
      to be designed. Navigation Needs Assessment Scale designed to select the patient to 
      join the Program and determine the recommended support. The scale validation had a 
      consensus index of 96.42%. Evaluation of the stages of the cycle occurred through 
      the adapted Plan/Do/Check/Act cycle. CONCLUSION: a Navigation Program was developed 
      adapted to the Brazilian reality, and attributions of the navigators were created.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of case management in terms of population 
      served, interventions, use of services and outcomes such as mortality, readmissions, 
      pressure ulcers, falls, drug problems and institutionalization. METHOD: Follow-up 
      study of a cohort, from the RANGECOM Multicentric Registry of Andalusia. The study 
      population were patients included in the case management services of Health Centres 
      and their family caregivers. RESULTS: Data from 835 patients with a mean age of 
      76.8years (SD:12.1), 50.24% women, are presented. They had an important comorbidity 
      (Charlson 3.1, SD:2.5) and high dependence (Barthel 37.5, SD:31.4). Sixty-two point 
      two percent of the interventions deployed by the case managers were grouped into 
      three domains: behavioural (26.0%), health system (20.2%) and safety (14.1%). 
      Mortality was 34.4% and hospital admissions 38.1%. Patients with more hospital 
      readmissions had more visits to the Emergency Department (OR:1.41; 95%CI: 
      1.22-1.63), more telephone interventions by case managers (OR:1.12; 95%CI: 
      1.02-1.24) and imaging tests (OR:1.37; 95%CI: 1.17-1.60), together with greater 
      caregiver burden (OR:1.31; 95%CI: 1.08-1.59), the presence of medical devices at 
      home (OR:1.69; 95%CI: 1.00-2.87) and received less "Case Management" intervention. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The patients who absorb the demand of case management nurses present 
      high complexity, for which they deploy behavioural interventions, navigation through 
      the health system and clinical safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the mechanism of action and nursing care of adults receiving 
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. DATA SOURCE: Peer reviewed articles 
      and pharmaceutical drug labels. CONCLUSION: CAR T-cell therapy is among the most 
      exciting therapies in the evolution of cancer treatment. The efficacy of research 
      with CAR T-cell therapy has shown promising results in hematologic malignancies as 
      well as in solid tumors. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Understanding the 
      complexity of care for these patients from the bedside to the outpatient setting is 
      vital for their survival and quality of care.

TI  - Who's Your Family?: African American Caregivers of Older Adults With Dementia.
PG  - 20-26
LID - 10.3928/19404921-20181212-04 [doi]
AB  - The nature and outcome of family caregiving is different for various racial and 
      ethnic groups. The purpose of the current study was to use qualitative methods to 
      examine and characterize family networks of African American family caregivers (N = 
      26) who provided care to family members with dementia (N = 18). Researchers used 
      data generated from a parent study that addressed family involvement in health 
      promotion activities for African American older adults with dementia. Data were 
      analyzed using sociograms and thematic analysis. Three themes that characterized 
      African American family caregiving networks were identified: (a) Complexity, (b) 
      Familism, and (c) Religiosity. Findings suggest that narrowly defining family 
      caregivers as a dyad of a caregiver and care recipient does not reflect how these 
      family networks function. A better understanding of the complex functioning of these 
      networks may help explain physical and psychological well-being outcomes for 
      individuals with dementia and their family members. [Res Gerontol Nurs. 2019;

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of developing perioperative lesions due to surgical 
      positioning in patients submitted to elective surgeries. METHODS: This is an 
      analytical and longitudinal study carried out with 45 patients in a public hospital 
      of medium and high complexity in the state of Piauí. The following data was used: 
      perioperative evaluation instrument, Numerical Visual Scale, Braden Scale and the 
      Risk Assessment Scale for the Development of Injuries from Surgical Positioning 
      (ELPO). RESULTS: Participants aged ≥ 46 years had a higher risk, and there were 
      33.4% of hypertensives among the 35.6% with comorbidities. The most prevalent 
      position, with 64.5% was supine, with only 2.2% cases of pre-surgical injury. 
      Regarding the risk for positional lesions, 68.9% presented low risk. CONCLUSIONS: 
      31.1% of the participants were at high risk for developing positional lesions, 
      related to age and comorbidities.

AB  - According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients age 65 and 
      older account for 43% of hospital days. The complexity of caring for older adults 
      affords nursing students opportunities to assess, prioritize, intervene, advocate, 
      and experience being a member of an interdisciplinary health care team. However, 
      these multifaceted hospital experiences are not consistently available for all 
      students. Nursing clinical simulation (NCS) can augment or replace specific clinical 
      hours and provide clinically relevant experiences to practice management and 
      leadership skills while caring for older adults. This article describes a geriatric 
      management and leadership NCS.

TI  - Attributes of person-centred communication: A qualitative exploration of 
      communication with older persons in home health care.
PG  - e12284
LID - 10.1111/opn.12284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research points to challenges related to the home healthcare of 
      older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although person-centred care 
      has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to 
      enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons. 
      AIM: The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication 
      between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home. METHODS: A 
      descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the 
      COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between 
      registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative 
      thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the attributes of 
      person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older 
      persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness 
      on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated 
      when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' 
      views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions. CONCLUSION: The nurses' 
      attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication 
      with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve 
      older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. Implication 
      for practice The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred 
      approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included 
      in education and training.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the influence of the variables sex, age, type of anesthesia, 
      occurrence of intraoperative complications, pain and surgical complexity on the 
      Aldrete-Kroulik Scoring System in patients in the immediate postoperative period, in 
      the post-anesthesia care unit. METHOD: Non-experimental, longitudinal study, with a 
      quantitative approach, conducted with 241 surgical patients. Descriptive analysis, 
      Student's t-test, Pearson and Spearman Correlation Indexes and multiple linear 
      regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Correlations between the 
      Aldrete-Kroulik Scoring System and pain (r=-0.13; p=0.05) and surgical complexity 
      (r=-0.12; p=0.05) were statistically significant. The type of anesthesia and pain 
      (p<0.01) influenced the decrease of the Aldrete-Kroulik System's scores. CONCLUSION: 
      Considering the vulnerability of patients in the immediate postoperative period, it 
      is essential for the nurse to know the factors that can influence the 
      Aldrete-Kroulik Scoring System to provide a safe and optimal post-anesthesia 
      recovery.

TI  - Factors influencing self-management priority setting and decision-making among 
      Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 700-710
LID - 10.1177/1474515119863178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Priority setting and decision-making in relation to self-management of 
      multiple conditions is particularly challenging for both patients and health 
      professionals. The aim of this study was to validate a conceptual model of 
      self-management priority setting and decision-making in multimorbidity and confirm 
      factors that influence self-management prioritizing and decision-making in a sample 
      of patients with acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This 
      was a qualitative study using deductive directed content analysis. A purposive 
      sample of 21 participants with acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      that were admitted to a Shanghai hospital were interviewed. RESULTS: Participants 
      provided evidence to confirm all but one of the factors from the conceptual model. 
      Internal factors influencing self-management predominated. Agreement with 
      recommended treatment, functional capacity and perceived synergies, antagonistic 
      effects, or interactions among the conditions and prescribed treatments, was 
      emphasized. The facilitators and barriers to priority setting and decision-making 
      were related to available resources, provider communication and, to a lesser extent, 
      confusion about recommendations, and treatment complexity. Some participants were 
      also concerned about treatment side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Internal factors (personal 
      beliefs, preferences, and attitudes) and facilitators and barriers (knowledge, 
      finances, social support, and transportation) were related to changes in priority 
      setting and decision-making and self-management behavior in this sample. Health 
      education, which includes case studies with shifting self-management priorities is 
      recommended, rather than a unique disease-specific focus. Further research, 
      exploring the relationship between these factors and changes in the dominant 
      condition and related management, using valid and reliable instruments that capture 
      these key factors, is recommended.

AB  - Objective To analyze the complexity of nursing care with use of the Perroca scale in 
      a Palliative Care Unit. Method Retrospective descriptive study of quantitative 
      analysis. Results Between 2008 and 2016, the total of 2,486 patients were 
      hospitalized, and their median length of hospital stay was 12 days. Of these 
      patients, 1,568 had at least one Perroca scale evaluation. Nine hundred and ten 
      patients (58%) were classified as minimal or intermediate care. Of these, 602 (66%) 
      were discharged. As semi-intensive and intensive care were classified 658 (42%) 
      patients, of whom 64% died and only 36% were discharged. Conclusion The Perroca 
      scale is a tool to identify patients with greater need for care and the possible 
      prognosis for hospitalized patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore research participants' 
      (adults, age 50-65) perceptions of receiving cardiovascular risk information. 
      METHODS: Five focus group interviews (N = 31) were performed with research 
      participants aged 50-65 who participated in the Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage 
      Study (SCAPIS). The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. 
      RESULTS: The categories; the complexity of cardiovascular risk; insufficient 
      presentation of test result; emotional responses; and health examinations provides 
      confirmation, emerged. The test results were written in medical terms and lacked 
      recommendations for further action which made it difficult for lay people to 
      understand and use, and for some, also caused unnecessary worry. CONCLUSION: There 
      was inadequate guidance concerning the implications of the test results, especially 
      for participants without clinical findings. In order to allow research participants 
      to obtain better cognitive and behavioral control, improvements are needed with 
      regard to how personal risk information is communicated in research projects 
      connected to health services. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The participants largely 
      relied on physical signs when assessing their own cardiovascular risk. Health 
      examinations are crucial for helping to add nuance to individuals' risk perceptions. 
      For personal health information to have any real value for individuals, it must be 
      designed from a user perspective.

PG  - 422-32
LID - 10.1177/1099800412462866 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased 
      vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, 
      hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and 
      operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty 
      development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of 
      conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put 
      forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated 
      pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and 
      exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes 
      of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere 
      length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and 
      metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, 
      lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive 
      decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological 
      approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for 
      future methodological and physiological inquiry.

TI  - Experiences from using eHealth in contact with health care among older adults with 
      cognitive impairment.
PG  - 380-389
LID - 10.1111/scs.12634 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Since health care is facing challenges, with fewer caregivers providing 
      care to more clients, eHealth plays a crucial role. Through eHealth, people are 
      expected to be more involved in their own care. On the part of health care users, 
      eHealth requires use of everyday technology such as telephones and computers, and 
      services through the Internet which might be challenging for older adults with 
      cognitive impairment. AIM: To investigate experiences of using eHealth in contact 
      with health care among older adults with cognitive impairment. METHOD: Individual, 
      semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine participants, aged 65-84 years, 
      with cognitive impairments of varying origins. A constructivist Grounded Theory 
      approach was used. Data collection and analysis were performed simultaneously using 
      a constant comparative method. ETHICAL ISSUES: Ethical approval (Dnr: 2014/906-32) 
      was obtained from the regional ethical committee, Stockholm. RESULTS: The core 
      category, the eHealth staircase supported by habits, is presented as a model that 
      visualises the result. The model includes three steps showing different ways of 
      being in contact with health care through the use of technological devices and 
      services that mirrors different levels of complexity of eHealth use as follows: (i) 
      Analogue use, (ii) One-way-use and (iii) Interactive use. The participants' location 
      on the eHealth staircase was affected by several aspects described in three 
      categories united by habits; A stable relationship with technology: a prerequisite 
      for use; The importance of interpersonal relationships within health care and Being 
      supported by significant others: a prerequisite in contact with health care. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with cognitive impairments seemed to prefer common and 
      less complex eHealth when contacting health care. Therefore, it is necessary that 
      health care providers offer different possibilities for patients to contact them, 
      that is, both through the Internet and by personal telephone service.

TI  - Packed Red Blood Cell Transfusion in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 39-46
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20171023-03 [doi]
AB  - Most packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion research focuses on younger patient 
      populations (younger than 65) given the complexity of care and presence of 
      comorbidities in older adults. The purpose of the current study was to critically 
      examine the current evidence related to PRBC transfusion among older adults (age 
      ≥65). PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched for randomized controlled trials that 
      evaluated blood transfusion in any manner (e.g., prevention, associated outcomes). 
      Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines, the search resulted in 10 studies focused on cardiac, orthopedic, and 
      gastrointestinal surgery patients. SQUIRE (Standards for QUality Improvement 
      Reporting Excellence) guidelines were used to evaluate studies for bias; the average 
      bias score was 13.0 (SD = 3.4), indicating a low level of bias. Greatest sources of 
      bias were methods to assess completeness/accuracy of data, details about missing 
      data, and costs associated with the study. Interventions to prevent PRBC transfusion 
      in older adults vary widely, and outcomes associated with PRBC transfusion in older 
      adults require further evaluation. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 44(3),

TI  - A Systematic Review of Genetic Influence on Psychological Resilience.
PG  - 61-71
LID - 10.1177/1099800418800396 [doi]
AB  - When exposed to adversity, some individuals are at an increased risk of 
      posttraumatic stress disorder, experiencing persistent biopsychosocial disturbances, 
      whereas others adapt well, described as resilience. Resilience is a complex 
      biopsychosocial phenomenon conceptualized as adaptation to adversity influenced by 
      an individual's genetic variants, epistasis, epigenetics, and gene-by-environment 
      interactions. Studies on psychological resilience have focused on behavioral and 
      psychosocial variables with far less examination of the genetic contributions. The 
      purpose of this review is to identify specific genetic variants contributing to the 
      biological capacity for psychological resilience. PubMed and PsycINFO were searched 
      using the following key words: psychological resilience AND genotype(s). Additional 
      articles were identified from the Human Genome Epidemiology Navigator using the term 
      resilience, psychological. Ten studies met the criteria. Six genes were empirically 
      associated with psychological resilience: serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic 
      region ( 5-HTTLPR), dopamine receptor D4, brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF), 
      corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1, oxytocin receptor and regulator of 
      G-protein signaling 2 . The findings of this systematic review suggest that the L/L 
      or L'/L' genotype of 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 in children/adolescents and the S/S or 
      S'/S' genotype in adults are most frequently related to resilience. Additionally, 
      the Val/Val genotype of rs6265 in BDNF in Caucasians was also associated with 
      resilience. There are numerous factors contributing to the complexity of determining 
      the genetic influence on resilience including analysis of rs25531, assumptions of 
      the mode of inheritance, operationalization of resilience, demographic and 
      population characteristics, sample size, and other types of genetic influence 
      including epistasis and epigenetics. While current evidence is supportive, further 
      investigation of the genetic influence on resilience is required.

AB  - Aging together with multimorbidity, polymedication and various social factors are 
      some of the determinants that lead to increasing complexity of care in the elderly, 
      thus making it difficult for health systems to meet their needs. To approach this 
      new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal health and social care 
      systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing specialists trained to 
      address the needs of older people from a perspective of comprehensive care, both for 
      healthy aging, and for the different health problems of this population group, 
      characterized by the consequences of aging and chronicity, towards dependence, and 
      develop the powers established by law in the framework of an interdisciplinary team, 
      for those who have been trained and accredited, thus adding value to the response 
      that health systems have to provide for this growing problem of the 
      'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.

TI  - ICA-EMA: A Tool for Assessing Nursing Complexity of Patients With Oncohematologic

PG  - 157-168

AB  - Inpatients with hematologic cancer (HC), particularly in an aging population, often 
      require levels of nursing care that feel very demanding. Therefore, it is important 
      to assess nursing complexity in this care environment. The purpose of this study is 
      to assess nursing complexity of inpatients with HC. A prospective observational 
      study was carried out on 131 patients admitted to an adult hematologic center in 
      northern Italy. The following variables were analyzed by means of the Index of 
      Caring Complexity (ICA): age, sex, diagnostic category, purpose of admission, 
      presence of transplant, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and length of stay. A total 
      sample of 131 patients were enrolled. Patients older than 65 years, with a history 
      of transplant, admitted for complications, and with a diagnosis of myeloma or 
      myelodysplasia had higher ICA scores. Therefore, patients in these groups are more 
      likely to exhibit a higher nursing complexity than other patients. The study results 
      can help health-care professionals identify, at an early stage, patients who need 
      higher levels of nursing care; promote a more efficient allocation of nursing staff 
      to the patient needs based on their group; and qualify the need for higher levels of 
      nursing care in order to improve nursing care quality and achieve higher standards 
      of care in Italian hematologic centers.

AB  - PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate evidence regarding the unmet supportive care 
      needs of men affected by penile cancer and their partners to create a holistic model 
      of care and inform clinical practice guidelines. METHODS: We searched CINAHL, 
      MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (CCRT and CDSR) controlled 
      trials databases and clinicaltrial.gov from 1990 to April 2020. This review was 
      reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: 18 articles were included, reporting the 
      results from 17 studies. Included reports used qualitative (seven studies) and 
      survey (ten studies). Across these studies, men reported that the diagnosis and 
      subsequent treatment of penile cancer affected physical, psychological and sexual 
      well-being with each facet impacting and being intertwined with the other at varying 
      degrees. There was varying complexity of unmet needs in men and partners 
      pre-surgery, post-surgery and into survivorship. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate evidence 
      exists that men affected by penile cancer experience a range of unmet supportive 
      care needs across the international literature. Further work to evaluate the impact 
      of penile cancer on partners is required.

      Self-Management.
PG  - 364-372
LID - 10.1097/NHH.0000000000000570 [doi]
AB  - Along with a variety of distressing symptoms, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM) 
      brings with it substantial physical, psychosocial, and financial costs. Research 
      shows that self-management is an effective means to manage FM and can lead to fewer 
      healthcare visits. Yet due to the complexity of this disorder, healthcare providers 
      need to be able to tailor treatment to individual patients by understanding 
      effective treatment interventions. Home healthcare nurses (HHNs) are in a unique 
      position to assess and implement effective treatment recommendations in the home 
      setting and as such could consider incorporating self-management strategies into the 
      home visit with the FM patient. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to use a 
      case study to describe the assessment of FM patient's functional ability and quality 
      of life and how the HHN may integrate self-management teaching into the established 
      home care visit. A review of the literature and discussion of self-management 
      interventions for the FM patient is presented. A summary of the case study and 
      proposed clinical implications is offered.

TI  - Exploring nursing competence to care for older patients in municipal in-patient 
      acute care: A qualitative study.
PG  - 3339-3352
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14914 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To identify critical aspects of nursing competence to care for older patients 
      in the context of municipal in-patient acute care. BACKGROUND: An increasingly 
      complex and advanced primary healthcare system requires attention to the extent of 
      nursing competence in municipal services. However, competence in complex and 
      advanced care settings must be explored using perspectives which acknowledge the 
      complexity of nurses' performance. DESIGN: A phenomenological hermeneutic, 
      qualitative approach with individual in-depth interviews was used. COREQ reporting 
      guidelines have been applied. METHODS: A sample of eight nurses and two physicians 
      employed in municipal in-patient acute care units (MAUs) were purposively recruited 
      to participate. Data were collected between May and June of 2017. Analysis and 
      interpretation were conducted systematically in three steps: naïve reading, 
      structural analysis and comprehensive understanding. FINDINGS: Two main themes were 
      revealed. The first was the following: "The meaning of the individual nursing 
      competence" including the themes "Having competence in clinical assessments, 
      decision-making, and performing interventions"; "Having competence to collaborate, 
      coordinate and facilitate"; and "Being committed." The second was the following: 
      "The meaning of environmental and systemic factors for nursing competence," included 
      the themes "Having professional leadership"; "Having a sufficiently qualified 
      staff"; and "Working in an open, cooperative and professional work environment." 
      CONCLUSION: Individual nursing competence in MAUs should include the capability to 
      detect patient deterioration and to care for older patients in a holistic 
      perspective. In addition, the professional environmental culture, supportive 
      leadership and systemic factors seemed to be crucial to success. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study illustrates the nurses' responsibility for older 
      patients' safety and quality of care in the MAUs. These findings can act as a 
      foundation for the development and adaptation of educational programmes to 
      accommodate requirements for nursing competence in MAUs. The broad perspective of 
      nursing competence can give directions for quality improvements in MAUs.

AB  - Healthy ageing is a multi-dimensional concept which appertains to all older adults. 
      This study reviewed the intervention characteristics, intervention content and 
      effectiveness of multi-dimensional healthy ageing interventions (MHAIs) addressing 
      physical, mental and social health among independent community-dwelling older 
      adults. A search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO for 
      studies published from Jan 2007 to October 2016. 18 publications were included, 
      accounting for 15 studies. The review reflected the complexity, variations and 
      methodological considerations of developing a comprehensive MHAI. It demonstrated 
      the possibility of integrating person-focused to environment-focused content topics 
      in future MHAIs, beyond the physical, mental and social health dimensions. Among the 
      reviewed studies, health education programs reported improvements in quality of life 
      and life satisfaction while health assessment and education programs promoted 
      positive health behaviors. Future MHAIs studies need to employ more robust research 
      methods and greater contextual information reports to build stronger evidence base.

TI  - Being a spectator in ambiguity-Family members' perceptions of assisted bodily care 
      in a nursing home.
PG  - e12289
LID - 10.1111/opn.12289 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to explore family members' perceptions of assisted 
      bodily care in a nursing home. BACKGROUND: Many older people living in nursing homes 
      need assisted bodily care, provided by assistant nurses. This means exposedness, as 
      the assistance is often provided under stress, but also brings pleasure. Family 
      members, who may wish to and often benefit from continuing to provide assisted 
      bodily care, are perceived as visitors and are expected to relinquish the assisted 
      bodily care to the assistant nurses. DESIGN: This study has a qualitative design 
      with a phenomenographic approach. METHODS: Data were collected through 
      semi-structured interviews (n = 13) with family members of older people who were 
      aged > 80, permanently living in a nursing home, suffering from multimorbidity, and 
      in daily need of assisted bodily care. The data were analysed using a 
      phenomenographic method. RESULTS: Three categories of description presenting an 
      increasing complexity were identified. The family members perceived that assisted 
      bodily care is built upon a respect for the older person's self-determination, 
      practically supported by assistant nurses, and complemented by family members. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the family members' perceptions, assisted bodily care signifies 
      ambiguity, as they find themselves balancing between the older persons' need for 
      self-determination and need for help, and, further, between their trust in the 
      assistant nurses' skills and their own perceived inadequacies in intimate assisted 
      bodily care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Policies that address the family members' 
      role in nursing homes are needed. Furthermore, time for collaboration is needed for 
      assistant nurses to inform and explain care decisions, become aware of the family 
      members' perceptions of their situation and learn from them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to incorporate information about older people in 
      pre-licensure nursing programs, there are inconsistent results from studies 
      examining student nurses' perceptions towards the aging population. There is 
      research suggesting that healthcare settings and nursing practice is perpetuating 
      negative perspectives towards older people. OBJECTIVE: To gain an understanding of 
      how social contexts are influencing student nurses' experiences when learning to 
      work with older people. DESIGN: Descriptive case study guided by the theoretical 
      framework of social learning theory. SETTING: A university in Western Canada that 
      offers a pre-licensure nursing program. PARTICIPANTS: 28 student nurses and 13 
      faculty in the nursing program. METHODS: Participant interviews and focus groups 
      were conducted with nursing faculty and students. RESULTS: Key findings from this 
      study are that students' previous experiences with older people, through family or 
      work experiences, and their first clinical experience in long- term care negatively 
      influenced their perceptions about working with older people. Clinical nurses and 
      faculty influenced students' perceptions about nursing practice with older people, 
      sometimes in subtle ways, underscoring that students are learning from what they see 
      and hear in practice. Students were ill-prepared for the complexity of the aging 
      population, particularly those with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Learning 
      activities that engage students in active learning, such as simulation, providing 
      students with a positive lexicon of how to describe older patients, and more overt 
      attention to the perspectives students and faculty bring to the learning environment 
      need to be carefully explored. Meaningful learning experiences with older people in 
      multiple contexts are needed to thoughtfully plan how to disrupt negative 
      perceptions that might emerge through the nursing education program.

TI  - Dignity as a guiding principle for family care partners in the care of an old 
      relative with dementia.
PG  - 87-95
LID - 10.1111/scs.12708 [doi]
AB  - AIM: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many family 
      care partners are involved in making help-seeking choices. The aim of this study was 
      to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the 
      name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still 
      maintaining their own dignity. METHODS: Data were collected in 2009-2010 in open 
      semi-structured interviews and follow-up contacts with seven family care partners 
      with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for 
      this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an 
      in-depth data analysis. RESULTS: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, 
      emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the 
      findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate 
      from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express 
      accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. CONCLUSION: This study provides an 
      important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it 
      contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the 
      care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs 
      more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and 
      in the follow-up of policy for older people.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of the fundamentals of care for 
      people with a cancer diagnosis, from diagnosis to after adjuvant treatment.

      acknowledging that there will be moments in the cancer journey where patients will 
      need "basic nursing care" to manage their symptoms and care pathways. DESIGN: 
      Secondary analysis of qualitative data. METHOD: Secondary thematic analysis of 
      interview data from 30 people with a diagnosis of breast (n = 10), colorectal 
      (n = 10) or prostate (n = 10) cancer was undertaken. RESULTS: The findings revealed 
      vivid descriptions of the fundamentals of care (i.e., basic needs) and participants 
      described physical, psychosocial and relational aspects of the delivery of care. 
      Both positive (e.g., supportive and kind) and negative (e.g., humiliating) 
      experiences related to the relationship with the healthcare professionals were 
      re-counted and affected the participants' experiences of the fundamentals of care. 
      Participants' accounts of their fundamental care needs were provided without them 
      identifying who, within the healthcare system, was responsible for providing these 
      needs. Specific nursing interventions were seldom described. CONCLUSION: Some people 
      with a cancer diagnosis have to strive for help and support from the nursing staff 
      to manage to regain control over their recovery. Nurses in cancer care need to focus 
      on the patients' fundamental care needs to optimise their patients' recovery. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Cancer patients require support with their 
      fundamental care needs and nurses need to be more aware of this and integrate it 
      into the caring relationship. It is imperative that the complexity of the 
      nurse-patient relationship is acknowledged and that models of care which honour this 
      complexity are used.

PG  - 11-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2010.00244.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine the factors and complexity that account for physical restraints use 
      and their alternatives as nurses' protect the safety of older adults. BACKGROUND: 
       Research on physical restraints has repeatedly shown the human, financial and work 
      costs associated with their use, but their use continues to be a major quality issue 
      across hospitals and across countries for older persons. METHOD: Interviews with 
      medical surgical nurses in a Midwestern hospital in the United States were recorded 
      and interpreted using grounded theory. RESULTS: Using data that described the 
      complexity of initiating, maintaining, or discontinuing restraints, we captured the 
      density of these processes and showed how nurses made decisions about restraint use. 
      The tasks carried out to protect the older person's safety often involved using 
      restraints or their alternatives and these tasks then set in motion a cascade of 
      other types of tasks or work, e.g., diagnostic, comfort, articulation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study extended the work on chronic illness trajectories and formulated a 
      framework for understanding the complexity of the use of restraints and their 
      alternatives. Using a tracing approach we were able to predict the types of 
      situations that would most likely result in the initiation, maintenance and 
      discontinuation of restraints or the use of alternative procedures. RELEVANCE TO 
      PRACTICE: The study has identified a process of 'safety work' that identified the 
      risk associated with the problem, the work to cope with the problem and risk, the 
      conditions that influenced the process and the consequences or outcomes of the work 
      strategies to maintain the older person's safety.

TI  - Caring for adults with congenital heart disease in a regional setting.
PG  - 441-446
LID - 10.1111/ajr.12446 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The number of adults with congenital heart disease has increased with 
      improvements in surgical and medical management, posing a challenge for regional and 
      rural settings, which might have difficulties accessing specialised professionals 
      with congenital heart disease services. This study aims to ascertain the 
      demographics and management of adults with congenital heart disease seen by a 
      cardiology practice in regional Australia to better understand the needs of regional 
      adults with congenital heart disease. DESIGN: A descriptive study using data from 
      clinical notes collected between April 2013 and April 2016. SETTING: A private 
      cardiology practice in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales. The practice has a treating 
      cardiologist, senior sonographer, visiting cardiothoracic surgeon and visiting 
      paediatric cardiologist. PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred-and-one adults with congenital 
      heart disease (age: 16-88 years; 55 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Congenital heart 
      disease defect, lesion severity, referral reason, past surgery, pulmonary 
      hypertension, cardiac surgery during the study, mortality, adherence with follow-up 
      plans and specialist referral. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients had simple congenital 
      heart disease, 24 had congenital heart disease of moderate complexity and 11 had 
      congenital heart disease of great complexity. Most were referred for surveillance, 
      seven were referred due to pregnancy and eight were new diagnoses. Six patients 
      died, nine had cardiac operations and five were treated for pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension. Overall adherence to the treating cardiologist's follow-up plans was 
      84%. All patients with congenital heart disease of great complexity were referred to 
      congenital heart disease specialists. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of patients 
      had complex pathology, new diagnoses or required surgery, highlighting the 
      importance of developing integrated services with the close support of outside 
      specialists in managing adults with congenital heart disease in regional settings.

TI  - Improving oral health in nursing home residents: A process evaluation of a shared 
      oral care intervention.
PG  - 3392-3402
LID - 10.1111/jocn.15373 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the process of implementing an oral care 
      intervention in nursing homes in a Danish municipality. BACKGROUND: Older people 
      with aged natural dentition require preventive and curative oral health care. An 
      intervention based on principles of situated learning was implemented to establish 
      closer cooperation between dental and nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to 
      improved oral hygiene in nursing home residents. DESIGN: An embedded multiple-case 
      study combined with principles of realist evaluation unfolded in three phases: 
      Formulation of initial programme theory, Testing and Refining the programme theory. 
      The COREQ checklist is followed in reporting. METHODS: Observations, six group 
      interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with dentists, dental practitioners, 
      nursing home managers, care professionals and residents were conducted in three 
      nursing homes (n = 41). RESULTS: Three main outcomes of a programme theory were 
      identified, relating to (a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) 
      interdisciplinary working, in the form of professional pride in performing 
      sufficient oral care; (c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased 
      interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the 
      creation of relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care 
      professionals as well as nursing home management taking responsibility for 
      structure, planning and knowledge sharing. CONCLUSION: The situated learning 
      perspective supported residents and care professionals' competencies in performing 
      sufficient oral care. The shared oral care intervention supports an individual and 
      multidisciplinary assessment of nursing home residents' ability to self-care 
      concerning oral care. Contextual factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms 
      influence the intervention's success. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding 
      the complexity within interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and 
      unravelling the necessary properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health 
      care are areas of improvement for care service in nursing homes.

TI  - Caring for the older person with cognitive impairment in hospital: Qualitative 
      analysis of nursing personnel reflections on fall events.
PG  - 1346-1353
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14724 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore nurse and nursing assistant reflections on the care 
      of older patients with cognitive impairment who have experienced a fall. BACKGROUND: 
      While there are evidence-based clinical guidelines for the prevention and management 
      of falls and for the care of older people with cognitive impairment, the falls rates 
      for older people with cognitive impairment are three times as high as those without. 
      DESIGN: Critical incident technique. METHODS: Eleven registered and two enrolled 
      nurses and four assistants in nursing working in one subacute and two acute wards 
      within two hospitals of a tertiary level health service in south-east Queensland. 
      Individual semistructured interviews focused on two past events when a patient with 
      cognitive impairment had fallen in hospital: one when there was minimal harm and the 
      second when there was significant harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken. The COREQ 
      checklist was followed. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from 23 reflective accounts of 
      fall events: "direct observation is confounded by multiple observers" and "knowing 
      the person has cognitive impairment is not enough," and "want to rely on the 
      guideline but unsure how to enact it." While participants were aware of the falls 
      prevention policy and techniques available to prevent falls, the implementation of 
      these was challenging due to the complexity of care required by the older person 
      with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Falls prevention for older people with 
      cognitive impairment is complex and belies the simple application of policy. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: To reduce falls, nurses can involve the family to 
      support "knowing the patient" to enable prediction of impulsive actions; shift the 
      focus of in-service from lectures to specific case presentations, with collaborative 
      analysis on person-focused strategies to prevent falls in older people with 
      cognitive impairment; and reconsider the sitter role from simple observer to 
      assistant, focused on ambulation and supporting independence in activities of daily 
      living.

TI  - The chaos of hospitalisation for patients with critical limb ischaemia approaching 
      major amputation.
PG  - 3530-3543
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14536 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To illuminate the hospital experience for patients and families 
      when major amputation has been advised for critical limb ischaemia (CLI). 
      BACKGROUND: CLI creates significant burden to the health system and the family, 
      particularly as the person with CLI approaches amputation. Major amputation is often 
      offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked deterioration of an 
      ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced mobility, intractable pain, 
      infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of clinical outcome data on CLI and 
      amputation exists internationally, little is known about the patient/family-centred 
      experience of hospitalisation to inform preservation of personhood and 
      patient-centred care planning. DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative study using 
      Heideggerian phenomenology. METHODS: Fourteen patients and 13 family carers provided 
      a semistructured interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation 
      followed, a second interview (6 months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients 
      and seven family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and 
      transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed. RESULTS: 
      Hospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of chaos, 
      characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile body and 
      fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift within 
      uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation and 
      unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages (multiple 
      stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful decision-making 
      in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic process occurring within 
      a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the care complexity and burden of 
      family advocacy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A coordinated, interprofessional 
      response should improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation 
      scheduling and discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a 
      sense of safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should 
      be actively facilitated.

AB  - In a context of economic crisis and policies to reduce the public deficit, the 
      budgets of the Catalan Health Institute (CHI) were cut by 15.33% between 2010 and 
      2014. OBJECTIVE: To assess the perceived impact on nurses' work conditions of 
      measures to contain health spending. METHOD: The study design was descriptive and 
      transversal. A sample of 1,760 nurses from the province of Barcelona answered a 
      questionnaire on the perceived impact of health spending containment measures 
      implemented in their workplace during the early years of the crisis. RESULTS: Among 
      the main aspects of the perceived impact of these measures, 86.6% of the nurses 
      identified a pay cut and an increase in the following relevant parameters of their 
      working conditions: number of hours worked (66.7%), final ratio of treated patients 
      (35.2%), task complexity and workload (75.3%), rotation through various departments 
      (31.5%), work shifts (21.4%) or work areas (23.4%), job insecurity (58.4%) and loss 
      of employment by dismissal (6.6%) or non-renewal of contract (9%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      perceived impact of the crisis showed a triple negative component: Pay cut, work 
      overload and job insecurity. As a combined effect of this multiple trend, the nurses 
      acknowledged a deterioration in their working conditions and quality of working 
      life.

TI  - Nursing staff stress from challenging behaviour of residents with dementia: a 
      concept analysis.
PG  - 507-16
LID - 10.1111/inr.12293 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Provide insight into the concept of stress in the context of challenging 
      behaviour of nursing home residents with dementia and its causes and consequences. 
      BACKGROUND: Challenging behaviour is frequent in residents with dementia, but 
      consequences for nursing staff are unclear. INTRODUCTION: Challenging behaviour of 
      residents can be enervating for nurses and may lead to stress. Although stress in 
      general is associated with negative outcomes, an overview of stress in this context 
      would be a welcome addition to the field. METHOD: Concept analysis according to 
      Walker and Avant. RESULTS: Identified antecedents of stress: physical and verbal 
      aggression, conflicts, excessive demands and being unresponsive (residents), age, 
      experience, tenure, nursing level and training (nursing staff). Defining attributes: 
      disturbed homoeostasis and the personal appraisal of the situation. Identified 
      consequences regard health, psychological aspects and behaviour. DISCUSSION: 
      Intervening in the identified factors may contribute to prevention of stress in 
      nursing staff. LIMITATIONS: Given a lack of strong empirical studies, our analysis 
      is not based on a high level of evidence and needs to be tested. Papers from before 
      1990 might have been missed. CONCLUSION: The concept analysis revealed that nursing 
      staff stress in the context of challenging behaviour may result from resident and 
      nursing staff factors. Besides health and psychological consequences, behavioural 
      consequences can enormously impact the well-being of residents. IMPLICATIONS: 
      Application in daily care to support teams in influencing resident and nursing staff 
      factors could prevent stress, for instance using behavioural management training or 
      recruiting higher educated nursing staff. Given the increasing complexity of care, 
      creating specialized units with specifically trained staff for different groups of 
      people with dementia may be desirable.

AB  - Ancient remedies in wound care have been used for millennia and are now being 
      rediscovered; in particular, the use of honey. The purpose of this study was to 
      capture and explore the meanings that participants assign to their lived experiences 
      when using medical-grade honey to treat wounds. Six participants were recruited from 
      a Lindsey Leg Club support group. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and the 
      verbatim transcriptions were analysed using interpretative phenomenological 
      analysis. Two themes were identified: experiences of using medical-grade honey and 
      perceptions of honey as a natural folkloric medicine. This study revealed the 
      complexity of using medical-grade honey to treat wounds and highlights patients' 
      experiences and perceptions. The findings are reviewed and discussed in relation to 
      the literature and implications for further research and clinical practice are 
      suggested.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the health/functioning of the older adult who consumes 
      psychoactive substances through the International Classification of Functioning, 
      Disability and Health, considering the theory of complexity. METHOD: Qualitative 
      case study, with 11 older adults, held between December 2015 and February 2016 in 
      the state of Rio Grande do Sul, using interviews, documents and non-systematic 
      observation. It was approved by the ethics committee. The analysis followed the 
      propositions of the case study, using the complexity of Morin as theoretical basis. 
      RESULTS: We identified older adults who consider themselves healthy and show 
      alterations - the alterations can be exacerbated by the use of psychoactive 
      substances - of health/functioning expected according to the natural course of aging 
      such as: systemic arterial hypertension; depressive symptoms; dizziness; tinnitus; 
      harmed sleep/rest; and inadequate food and water consumption. Final consideration: 
      The assessment of health/functioning of older adults who use psychoactive 
      substances, guided by complex thinking, exceeds the accuracy limits to risk the 
      understanding of the phenomena in its complexity.

TI  - Discussing potential recurrence after lung cancer surgery: Uncertainties and 
      challenges.
PG  - e12870
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12870 [doi]
AB  - Patients with lung cancer who undergo surgery may potentially be cured. The 
      resulting pathological staging gives an indication of 5-year survival and whether 
      further treatment is recommended. To date, there is little research evidence 
      regarding the way potential recurrence is communicated to patients by staff. This 
      qualitative research used case studies to explore how information disclosure about 
      possible recurrence was managed following lung cancer surgery and aimed to identify 
      practice implications for clinical teams. Twelve patients were recruited and first 
      postoperative surgical and subsequent oncology or follow-up consultations were 
      recorded and transcribed. The perspective of the professionals involved in these 
      clinics was ascertained through 30 in-depth interviews. Key themes in the data were 
      identified using Framework Analysis. Recurrence risk was communicated to patients in 
      a number of ways and levels of clarity and openness. Information provided by 
      participants about early warning signs of recurrence varied. Findings indicate 
      information provided was linked to the patient's prognosis and individual 
      professionals' underlying communication approach. This study provides a unique 
      insight into the views of lung cancer specialists regarding information disclosure 
      and reveals the challenging nature and complexity of discussing recurrence following 
      lung cancer surgery.

      people with dementia concerning the management of their care recipients' functional 
      disabilities, and their experiences and opinions of using mobile health (mHealth) 
      applications in health information seeking. BACKGROUND: Functional disability is a 
      significant problem among people with dementia and management can be challenging for 
      family carers. Evidence suggests that mHealth applications can support knowledge 
      needs of patients and families. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive exploratory study. 
      METHODOLOGY: In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of family 
      carers using a semi-structured interview guide. An inductive thematic analysis 
      method was used. The COREQ reporting guideline was followed. RESULTS: Five spousal 
      and five child carers participated in this study. Four key themes were identified: 
      (a) Challenges faced that contribute to psychological distress and burden; (b) 
      Essential role of support systems in dementia care; (c) Information and educational 
      needs of family carers, and (d) Experiences and attitudes of mHealth applications as 
      an educational and supportive resource. CONCLUSION: Providing functional care is 
      demanding, challenging and stressful, and leads to carer burden. The complexity of 
      dementia is a barrier in the organisation of functional care and access to a support 
      network is vital to care provision. The information needs of family carers can 
      potentially be addressed through an mHealth application. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: This study provides important information on family carers' needs, and the 
      barriers and challenges related to functional care for people with dementia. 
      Findings from this study can assist nurses and other health professionals in the 
      planning of educational and supportive programs for family carers. Furthermore, the 
      use of mHealth applications could positively contribute to the delivery of these 
      programs.

TI  - A narrative literature review of older people's cancer pain experience.
PG  - 2100-13
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12106 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To synthesise current evidence about the experience of older 
      people with cancer pain and consider how exploration of this may inform clinical 
      practice and research. BACKGROUND: Cancer is more prevalent in older age. Evidence 
      suggests that older people's pain is generally under-recognised and under treated. 
      Pain is a significant concern for many people living and dying with cancer and may 
      be of particular concern for older people who may have complex biopsychosocial 
      needs. There is mounting evidence that older people and their families experience 
      high level of unmet need generally and suboptimal pain in particular. DESIGN: 
      Narrative literature review. METHOD: A comprehensive search of five electronic 
      databases was undertaken between the years 1996-2010 inclusive. Inclusion criteria 
      were primary research papers relating older peoples' experiences of cancer pain, 
      incorporating the verbal report or narrative account of experience of cancer. 
      RESULTS: Seventeen papers met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Three major 
      themes emerged from the literature: (1) emotional experience identified by older 
      people with cancer pain, (2) effects of pain on life and living, and (3) how 
      communication affects the experience or expression of cancer pain including 
      subthemes of validating, trust and cultural effects on the communication of pain. 
      CONCLUSION: There is limited research about older people's cancer pain from the 
      perspective of the person experiencing the pain. This review highlights the need for 
      further research into living and dying with cancer pain which incorporates the 
      unique and individual experience of older people. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: 
      Understanding the complexity and nature of older people's cancer pain experience 
      should inform appropriate effective care that improves quality of life and promotes 
      independence and dignity. Culturally sensitive training in communication may enhance 
      understanding of the needs of older people with cancer pain.

TI  - Cognitive Reserve and Physical Function in Older African-Americans.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - This study examined the relationship between cognitive reserve and physicalfunction 
      in older African-Americans. The concept of cognitive reserve postulates that aspects 
      of life experience (e.g., education, occupational complexity, leisure activity, and 
      socioeconomic status) may provide cognitive reserve, in theform of a set of skills 
      or repertoires, that allow some people to cope better than others with illness and 
      alter the clinical expression of decline in functional status. This study used a 
      descriptive correlational design. Physicalfunction was assessed with the SF-36 
      (physicalfunction subscale). The mean scorefor the SF-36 PF subscale was 47 (SD = 
      10), indicating that the participants had good physical functioning. Physical 
      function was associated with occupational complexity, educational attainment, and 
      income. The study provides baseline data about the relationship between cognitive 
      reserve and physicalfunction.

TI  - Older women, intimate partner violence and mental health: a consideration of the 
      particular issues for health and healthcare practice.
PG  - 2177-2191
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13490 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history 
      of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. 
      BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and 
      well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate 
      partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has 
      not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to 
      address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's 
      experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health 
      issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic 
      synthesis of qualitative evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and 
      PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end 
      of December 2015. RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence 
      exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner 
      violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the 
      boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within 
      the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of 
      intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence 
      of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who 
      experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner 
      violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service 
      providers need to be aware of these. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and 
      healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management 
      and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they 
      are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of 
      abuse and this includes older women.

PG  - 157-164

AB  - The complexity and cost of diabetes care are barriers to a free health clinic 
      attempting to provide quality care to uninsured patients. The alphabet strategy 
      intervention was selected to increase the number of patients with diabetes receiving 
      care according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines because it is simple 
      and cost-effective. The project results revealed statistically significant increases 
      in clinic uptake of diabetes education, blood pressure interventions, proteinuria, 
      glucose control measurement and intervention, eye exams, and foot exams. The 
      findings may be useful to other free health clinics attempting to provide quality 
      care to their patients with diabetes.

TI  - Nurse Practitioners' Role in Improving Service for Elderly Trauma Patients.
PG  - 174-179
LID - 10.1097/JTN.0000000000000445 [doi]
AB  - Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently 
      complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center 
      expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity 
      patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to 
      initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the 
      supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the 
      need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development 
      of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in 
      elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP 
      (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of 
      hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, 
      p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average 
      decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. 
      $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients 
      admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a 
      significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing 
      facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have 
      proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study 
      institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive 
      outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current 
      practice model.

TI  - Elderly cancer survivorship: an integrative review and conceptual framework.
PG  - 233-42
LID - 10.1016/j.ejon.2011.03.008 [doi]
AB  - The intersection of ageing and cancer in the phase of post-treatment survivorship 
      represents a large and growing population with unique needs. PURPOSE: The goal of 
      this work is to review and integrate the current gerontology and oncology literature 
      relevant to elderly cancer survivorship, to identify knowledge gaps and research 
      opportunities and to propose a conceptual model to guide future research. The 
      long-term, global goal is the prevention of morbidity and mortality in elderly 
      cancer survivors by identification of vulnerable elders, maintenance of 
      independence, tailoring of treatment, establishing intervention guidelines and 
      planning for necessary resources within the entire trajectory of cancer survival for 
      older survivors. METHODS: Targeted and integrative review of selected literature 
      from multiple disciplines. Search engines included PubMed, article reference lists 
      and internet searches for epidemiological data (US Census, World Health 
      Organization, American Cancer Society, Canadian Cancer Cancer Society, etc). 
      RESULTS: A conceptual model that incorporates the gerontologic, oncologic and 
      personal characteristics of older cancer survivors is proposed that may provide a 
      comprehensive approach by which to frame elderly survivorship research. CONCLUSION: 
      Cancer survivorship among the elderly is quantitatively and qualitatively different 
      from cancer survivorship among other age groups. The current large numbers and 
      predicted increase in elderly cancer survivors in the near future mandate attention 
      to this population. Future research must consider the complexity of intersecting 
      needs in the gero-oncology population.

TI  - Cognitive Impairment Among Aging People Living With HIV on Antiretroviral Therapy: A 
      Cross-Sectional Study in Hunan, China.
PG  - 301-311
LID - 10.1097/JNC.0000000000000122 [doi]
AB  - Our cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of cognitive impairment among 
      people living with HIV (PLWH) aged 60 years or older. The sample, composed of 250 
      PLWH, was recruited from 2 clinics in Hunan, China. Structured questionnaires guided 
      face-to-face interviews, including items addressing demographic characteristics, 
      regimens of antiretroviral therapy, and cognitive status as measured by the Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment. Findings revealed cognitive function of this population was 
      significantly lower than that of uninfected individuals based on historical 
      comparisons; 87.2% (n = 218) of PLWH in our study had cognitive impairment. Global 
      cognitive function as well as the domains of language and orientation decreased with 
      age. Global cognitive function was associated with sex and education, but not with 
      antiretroviral therapy regimens. These findings support an urgent need to include 
      routine screening for cognitive function in older PLWH and the need to consider the 
      complexity of the evaluation process.

TI  - High complexity chronic heart failure management programmes: programme 
      characteristics and 12 month patient outcomes.
PG  - 319-26
AB  - Chronic heart failure management programmes (CHF-MPs) have been developed to 
      improve, clinical outcomes in response to the high burden of disease from chronic 
      heart failure (CHF). Programmes vary in model, duration, complexity of interventions 
      and incorporation of evidence-based guidelines for programme delivery. Few studies 
      have explored patient outcomes at 12 months from enrolment in a CHF. The aim of the 
      current study was to explore the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients 
      enrolled in four high complexity CHF-MPs at 12 months after initial enrolment. A 
      secondary aim was to explore the adoption of key evidence-based CHF management 
      strategies in these programmes. After ethics approval, a multisite mixed methods 
      design was implemented incorporating survey and chart audit. Programme 
      characteristics and interventions used in four CHF-MPs were surveyed in Stage 1. 
      Stage 2 involved a chart audit of patients enrolled in the programmes (N = 135) on 
      or after the 1/1/07. Primary endpoints were all-cause hospitalisation and/or 
      mortality at 12 months. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential 
      statistics. All programmes implemented a high complexity of evidence-based 
      interventions consistent with national guidelines. However, documentation of New 
      York Heart Association functional class was rare; limiting quantifiable evaluation 
      of response to therapy throughout programme enrolment. The majority of patients 
      (73%) had severe systolic heart failure with high co-morbidities reflected in a mean 
      Charlson's total co-morbidity score of 3 (± 2.1). The high rate of baseline 
      evidence-based, pharmacothe- rapy (beta-blocker: 86%, n = 112 and ACE inhibitor: 
      76%, n = 103) was maintained at 12 months (71% and 84% respectively). At 12 months 
      all cause hospitalisation and/or mortality was 57% (n = 77). The CHF-MPs in this 
      study implemented complex evidence-based interventions resulting in high rates of 
      key medication prescription. However, despite the implementation of several 
      evidence-based interventions, over a period of 12 months, more than half of the 
      patients were rehospitalised or died.

TI  - Experiences of Nephrology Nurses in Assessing and Managing Pain in Patients 
      Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem. The purpose of this 
      qualitative study was to describe nephrology nurses' experiences in assessing and 
      managing pain in patients who were receiving maintenance hemodialysis at outpatient 
      units within a tertiary care institution. Semi-structured interviews were conducted 
      with seven nurses, and a thematic analysis was used to analyze data. Themes emerged 
      related to the complexity of pain assessment and management in these patients, who 
      were often elderly. Nurses had to ascertain whether the pain was related to 
      hemodialysis treatment, renal failure, or comorbidities. Nurses described managing 
      pain within the context of the hemodialysis unit, and this required working as a 
      team. Nurses also described the need for a palliative approach in patient care.

TI  - Age discrimination in healthcare institutions perceived by seniors and students.
PG  - 443-459
LID - 10.1177/0969733017718392 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Old age-based discrimination is observed as the most tolerated prejudice 
      in society and has also been witnessed in healthcare institutions. AIMS: The aim of 
      this study is to explore age-based discrimination in healthcare institutions as 
      perceived by seniors and students of Medicine and Nursing. RESEARCH DESIGN: A 
      multi-method study design, by involving a triangulation design. PARTICIPANTS AND 
      RESEARCH CONTEXT: A purposeful sample of individuals aged 65+ (n = 80) and medical 
      and nursing students (n = 100) in the eastern region of Poland. ETHICAL 
      CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical approval of the research protocol was received from the 
      Ethics Committee at the Medical University of Lublin. FINDINGS: 'Old age' was 
      perceived by groups of participants based on three themes: (a) positive, (b) 
      negative and (c) neutral connotations. The negative connotations predominated. The 
      beginning of old age was defined by the metric of age and described by showing the 
      complexity of the ageing process involving subjective, objective and societal 
      aspects. Experience of age discrimination in healthcare institutions was reported by 
      24 (30%) seniors and witnessed by 47 (47%) students surveyed and for both groups 
      occurred mainly at the hospital level and by physicians. Only 48 students (48%) 
      declared a willingness to work with the older people in the future, and barriers 
      were reported at the personal and professional levels, and also in some visions of 
      older people. CONCLUSION: The conceptualization of old age as reported by seniors 
      and students mainly carried negative connotations, reflecting the profoundly based 
      stereotypes within society regarding the older people. Seniors have reported being 
      exposed to ageism and have witnessed ageism episodes in HCIs; also, students have 
      faced ageism episodes during their clinical education. There is a need for ethical 
      education within medical and nursing courses to shape positive attitudes towards the 
      older people. A positive vision of ageing should be promoted not only among young 
      people but also among adults and older people to avoid self-stereotyping of older 
      people and seeing old age from negative perspective.

TI  - The six dimensions of wellness and cognition in aging adults.
PG  - 195-204
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine how wellness in six dimensions (occupational, social, 
      intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual) protects cognition in aging 
      adults. BACKGROUND: cognitive impairment increases with age. Baby boomers represent 
      a significant percent of the population at risk for cognitive impairment. Cognitive 
      impairment has a negative impact on nursing resources, health care finances, patient 
      mortality, and quality of life. Wellness and prevention is one focus of Institute of 
      Medicine's vision for the future of nursing. METHOD: Literature was retrieved from 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and MEDLINE. Research that 
      examined the affect of wellness in each of the six dimensions on cognition in older 
      adults was included. RESULTS: One or more of the following may protect cognition in 
      aging: midlife occupation complexity, marriage, social networks, formal education, 
      intellectual activities, physical activity, healthy nutrition, motivational ability, 
      purpose in life, and spirituality. CONCLUSION: Wellness in one or more of the six 
      dimensions may protect cognition in aging. The cognitive protective benefits may 
      increase when wellness in more than one dimension is demonstrated. High wellness in 
      one dimension may protect cognition by compensating for low wellness in another 
      dimension. The interconnectedness of each of the dimensions signifies the importance 
      of evaluating older adults holistically. Wellness throughout the life span may 
      result in improved cognition in aging. APPLICATION: Future research is needed to 
      examine the relationship between the six dimensions of wellness and cognition, and 
      to determine if one dimension of wellness is a significant predictor of cognitive 
      health in aging adults.

TI  - Living With Dementia in Correctional Settings: A Case Report.
PG  - 180-184
LID - 10.1097/JFN.0000000000000194 [doi]
AB  - The prison population is aging at an alarming rate and many older persons have the 
      potential to develop dementia while in prison. This case report aims to explore the 
      needs of older people living with dementia in prison and discusses the interventions 
      that exist to address these needs. As the condition progresses, persons with 
      dementia become increasingly reliant on the support of others for their health and 
      well-being because of the increasing complexity of physical healthcare and 
      psychosocial needs. Very few interventions are cited in the research literature 
      regarding the use, acceptability, and/or effectiveness of programming for people 
      living with dementia in prison. To support the unique and complex needs of these 
      persons, research is needed to guide the development of evidence-informed dementia 
      programs and services as well as consideration of interdisciplinary collaboration 
      with community organizations.

TI  - Impact of Structured Nurse Leader Rounds on Satisfaction With Nursing Care Among 
      Patients With Cancer.
PG  - 526-536
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The patient satisfaction rate is considered a challenge for nurse 
      leaders, especially among patients with cancer, due to the complexity of the 
      disease, diagnostic procedures, and treatment. AIM: The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate the impact of structured nurse leader rounds (NLRs) on satisfaction with 
      nursing care among patients with cancer. Moreover, we assessed the relationship 
      among NLRs, patient satisfaction, and demographical variables. METHODS: A two-group 
      posttest design was used in four adult inpatient oncology units in a specialized 
      oncology center. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to select 169 
      patients for the experimental group (80 patients) and control group (89 patients). 
      Structured leader rounds were conducted by nurse leaders using a scripted nurse 
      leader tool to standardize the rounds in the experimental group, while the 
      unstructured leader round was conducted in the control group. Patient satisfaction 
      was measured using the Patient Satisfaction with Nursing Care Quality Questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: The findings revealed that there was a significant difference in total 
      score of patients' satisfaction between study groups (t = -9.213, p > .001). 
      Conversely, the structured leader round has a significant impact on the patient's 
      experience with nurse concern and caring (t = -2.054, p = .042). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Adoption of a structured NLR has a significant impact on improving patient 
      satisfaction in an oncology setting where patients receive care from many 
      disciplines, such as surgical, medical, radiotherapy, and radiology. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: Efficient structured NLRs of nursing professionals are important for 
      enhancing the quality of nursing care and patient satisfaction.

AB  - A paucity of research has explored the older adult's experience of falling in the 
      hospital. Understanding the central concepts associated with a fall while 
      hospitalized is essential for further fall prevention research and practice. The 
      purpose of this paper is to describe the process of selecting a theoretical 
      framework to guide a qualitative study exploring the older adult's experience of 
      falling while hospitalized. An analysis of six established illness self-management 
      theories and models from nursing and psychology was conducted using Walker and 
      Avant's framework for theory analysis. The Health Belief Model was selected as the 
      most appropriate theoretical framework, as it entails concepts applicable to the 
      experience of falling and captures the complexity of the phenomenon of inpatient 
      falls, which is important for nursing.

AB  - Individualized nursing care, a form of person-centered care delivery, is accepted as 
      best practice, yet its implementation into actual care is far from complete. 
      Appropriate measures of this elusive concept are needed to better understand 
      barriers to implementation. This study explored and tested the convergent validity 
      and the reliability of 2 individualized nursing care measures. A cross-sectional 
      survey design was used to collect data using the Individualized Care Scale and the 
      Individualized Care Instrument (ICI) from a sample of nurses (n = 263, response rate 
      71%) working in older peoples' care settings in Finland, and the data were analyzed 
      statistically. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the ICI scales (.63-.80) and ICS-A 
      and B subscales (both α = .91) demonstrated only moderate correlation between the 2 
      instruments (r = -.39 to .50) and possibly the complexity of measuring 
      "individualized care." The study acknowledges the latent influence of culture and 
      care approach to the conceptualization of individuality. It concludes that the 
      concept may best be measured at this point with the use of other factors in addition 
      to instruments to capture its multiple domains.

AB  - We examined whether women who had regular jobs throughout life performed better 
      cognitively than older adult housewives. Linear regression was used to compare 
      global cognitive performance scores of housewives (G1) and women exposed to work of 
      low (G2) and high (G3) complexity. The sample comprised 477 older adult Brazilian 
      women, 430 (90.4%) of whom had performed lifelong jobs. In work with data, the G2 
      group's cognitive performance scores were 1.73 points higher (p =.03), and the G3 
      group scored 1.76 points (p =.02) higher, than the G1. In work with things and with 
      people, the G3 scored, respectively, 2.04 (p <.01) and 2.21 (p <.01) cognitive test 
      points higher than the G1. Based on our findings we suggest occupation of greater 
      complexity is associated with better cognitive performance in women later in life.

TI  - The complexity of pain assessment in older people.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.7748/nop.27.8.16.e738 [doi]
AB  - Pain is common in older people and its assessment is an important part of the 
      nurse's role. Asking people about their pain is considered the most accurate and 
      reliable assessment because of the subjective nature of pain. A number of simple and 
      easy-to-administer self-rating scales are available to measure pain intensity. To 
      rate their pain, however, people need to understand the request, as well as recall 
      and interpret the painful signal. Observing specific behaviours associated with pain 
      is advocated when communication and cognitive function are impaired, for example, in 
      people with advanced dementia. A number of pain assessment tools have been developed 
      that involve observation of some or all of the behaviours. The aim of this article 
      is to highlight the importance of pain assessment, discuss the various pain 
      assessment scales and tools available and identify some of the factors that can make 
      comprehensive assessment of pain in older people and those with cognitive impairment 
      complex.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults are more susceptible to water imbalance and ensuring they 
      drink sufficiently is a complex and challenging issue for nurses. The factors that 
      promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older people from drinking 
      are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the complexity of 
      issues associated with the hydration and hydration care of older people. DESIGN: A 
      qualitative study using multiple methods. SETTINGS: Two healthcare sites providing 
      care for older people in the South West of England: a hospital ward in a major 
      hospital and a care home providing personal and nursing care. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Twenty-one older people aged 68-96 years, were recruited to the study from the 
      hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older people to participate 
      were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion criteria were being 
      unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or distressed to take part in 
      the study. The staff participants of nurses and health care assistants totalled 21. 
      The inclusion criterion for staff was any nurse or health care assistant providing 
      hydration care. Seven friends or relatives participated by making anonymous comments 
      via a suggestion box available to all friends and relatives. METHODS: Data were 
      collected via interviews with older people, focus group discussions involving staff, 
      suggestion box comments made by friends and relatives and twelve hours observation 
      of hydration practice. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 
      Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to promote drinking 
      including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in older people's hands 
      and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their experience of drinking was 
      diminished by a variety of factors including a limited aesthetic experience and a 
      focus on fluid consumption rather than on drinking as a pleasurable and social 
      experience. CONCLUSION: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with 
      drinking were lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social 
      interaction was underplayed in both settings. Hydration practice which supports the 
      individual needs of older people is complex and goes beyond simply ensuring the 
      consumption of adequate fluids.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk-stratified care management requires knowledge of the complexity of 
      chronic disease and comorbidity, information that is often not readily available in 
      the primary care setting. The purpose of this article was to describe a 
      population-based approach to risk-stratified care management that could be applied 
      in primary care. METHODS: Three populations (Medicaid, Medicare, and privately 
      insured) at a regional health plan were divided into risk-stratified cohorts based 
      on chronic disease and complexity, and utilization was compared before and after the 
      implementation of population-specific care management teams of nurses. RESULTS: 
      Risk-stratified care management was associated with reductions in hospitalization 
      rates in all three populations, but the opportunities to avoid admissions were 
      different. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of population complexity is critical to the 
      development of risk-stratified care management in primary care, and a complexity 
      matrix can help nurses identify gaps in care and align interventions to cohort and 
      population needs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Persons seeking cancer genetic counseling mainly aim to obtain 
      information and certainty about their medical situation. However, the information 
      that counselees receive often involves many uncertainties. To develop strategies to 
      enable optimal communication about uncertainties, the spectrum of uncertainty 
      expressed within cancer genetic counseling needs to be established. This study aimed 
      to gain insight into the uncertainties verbally expressed by counselors and 
      counselees. METHODS: Twenty-five consultations were audiotaped, transcribed and 
      qualitatively analyzed. A coding scheme identifying all uncertainties was developed 
      parallel to the coding of the transcripts. RESULTS: Several uncertainties were 
      identified varying in their source (i.e. the cause of uncertainty) and the issues 
      involved (i.e. the topic to which uncertainty pertained). The main sources of 
      uncertainty were the unpredictability of the future and a lack of knowledge. 
      Counselees also expressed uncertainty related to the amount and complexity of the 
      information. Counselors expressed uncertainties mainly related to scientific issues, 
      whereas counselees' uncertainty mainly related to personal and practical issues. 
      CONCLUSION: A wide range of uncertainties was expressed by both groups. Counselors 
      differ from counselees in the degree and types of uncertainty they express. PRACTICE 
      IMPLICATIONS: Counselors should address scientific uncertainties during genetic 
      counseling to increase awareness and understanding in counselees.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether seniors consolidate their home medications or if 
      there is evidence of unnecessary regimen complexity. METHODS: Face-to-face 
      interviews were conducted with 200 community-dwelling seniors >70 years in their 
      homes. Subjects demonstrated how they took their medications in a typical day and 
      the number of times a day patients would take medications was calculated. A 
      pharmacist and physician blinded to patient characteristics examined medication 
      regimens and determined the fewest number of times a day they could be taken by 
      subjects. RESULTS: Home medication regimens could be simplified for 85 (42.5%) 
      subjects. Of those subjects not optimally consolidating their medications, 53 
      (26.5%) could have had the number of times a day medications were taken reduced by 
      one time per day; 32 (16.0%) reduced by two times or more. The three most common 
      causes of overcomplexity were (1) misunderstanding medication instructions, (2) 
      concern over drug absorption (i.e. before meals), and (3) perceived drug-drug 
      interactions. CONCLUSION: Almost half of seniors had medication regimens that were 
      unnecessarily complicated and could be simplified. This lack of consolidation 
      potentially impedes medication adherence. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health care 
      providers should ask patients to explicitly detail when medication consumption 
      occurs in the home.

TI  - Perceptions of adults with overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain: An 
      interpretative phenomenological analysis.
PG  - e776-e786
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14178 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the lived experience of adults with 
      overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Knowledge gained will inform 
      healthcare professionals about the complexity of the weight-pain relationship and 
      enable more effective engagement with this population. BACKGROUND: Quantitative 
      studies show links between weight and pain. Adults with overweight/obesity are more 
      likely to experience comorbidity; however, qualitative research describing the 
      complexities of the relationship is limited. METHODS: A purposive sample of adults 
      with overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain participated in 
      face-to-face interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and 
      analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen adults (16 
      female) aged 29-71, body mass index ≥25-46, participated in this study. Three 
      superordinate themes emerged: "pain as a motivator and barrier to weight loss"; 
      "fear of weight causing more damage"; and "activity is positive." Pain motivates 
      some individuals to lose weight while simultaneously inhibiting weight loss efforts. 
      Participants' perception that extra pressure caused by their weight further damaged 
      joints contributed to fear and catastrophising. Fear is often exacerbated by 
      healthcare professionals' descriptions of musculoskeletal damage, or participants' 
      perception of healthcare professionals' attitude towards people with 
      overweight/obesity. Conversely, individuals acknowledged the benefits of increased 
      activity. CONCLUSION: Adults with overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal 
      pain in this study identified a bidirectional relationship between their weight and 
      pain that challenged their weight loss efforts. Overweight/obesity contributed to 
      fear and catastrophising, which resulted in avoidance of exercise that would have 
      assisted their weight loss. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals 
      need to understand the complex relationship between weight and pain, and their 
      patients' understanding of that relationship. Healthcare professionals should use 
      therapeutic communication to reduce the fear of weight causing damage, and thus 
      promote physical activities that will contribute to weight loss. It is also 
      important to ensure that the language used with this patient group does not 
      stigmatise individuals, or cause or exacerbate fear of normal movement.

TI  - Improved safeguarding of older people through inter-agency learning.
PG  - 14-8
AB  - Elder abuse remains a significant problem nationally and globally. Early definitions 
      of abuse, however, oversimplified the phenomena and while the complexity of elder 
      abuse, in nature and scale, has also been growing recently there remains some 
      confusion conceptually and in practice in terms of what is meant by and can be 
      identified as abusive practice. The lack of conceptual clarity is evident across 
      professional and agency boundaries. The authors suggest that a potential way forward 
      is through the development of interprofessional learning as an integral part of 
      education and training in respect of safeguarding older adults. This article 
      highlights a number of complexities in the context of safeguarding and raises areas 
      for further reflection and possible debate.

AB  - PURPOSE: In 2017 almost 25,000 Belgians between 40 and 60 years (38% of new 
      diagnoses) were diagnosed with cancer. With increasing life expectancy the chance 
      augments that these patients still have older parents alive. This implies that 
      oncology care should also take into account the impact cancer may have on (the 
      relationship with) older parents. The purpose of this study was to explore how 
      cancer patients communicate and deal with their older parents during the illness 
      trajectory. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 cancer 
      patients. Interview transcripts were analysed using the principles of the 
      constructivist Grounded Theory Approach. RESULTS: Depending on the situation, the 
      time frame and the person the patients are talking about, cancer patients oscillate 
      between perspectives (I, They and We). A common denominator in all three 
      perspectives is silence fuelled by different forms of solicitude (self-protection 
      and other-protection). This solicitude underpins the cancer patients' communicative 
      behaviours and ways of relating towards their parents. CONCLUSIONS: Present findings 
      underline the importance of health care providers considering the often hidden 
      complexity of giving information and talking about feelings. Nurses' strategies must 
      be designed not to harm the existing mechanism of solicitude and the diligent 
      management of the patients' relationship with their parents. Conversations about 
      functionality of avoiding certain topics and the impetus behind certain 
      communicative patterns should be put forward instead of consensually advising open 
      communication.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to better understand how beliefs influence medication 
      adherence in asthma. METHODS: All participants were prescribed an inhaled 
      corticosteroid for a diagnosis of asthma. Each participant completed a survey 
      consisting of: Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Brief-Illness Perception 
      Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). 
      Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids was elicited using the Medication Adherence 
      Report Scale (MARS). Multiple linear regression with interaction effects was used to 
      identify significant predictors of medication adherence and interactions between 
      beliefs. RESULTS: A total of 198 participants completed the survey. The mean(±SD) 
      MARS score was 19.2(±4.5). A multivariable model (adjusted R(2) = 0.39) predicted 
      adherence using: age, asthma hospitalisation, timeline (B-IPQ) subscale, necessity 
      and concern (BMQ) subscales, doctor (MHLCS) subscale and the two interaction effects 
      (concerns [BMQ] moderated by chance [MHLCS] and treatment control [B-IPQ] moderated 
      by understanding [B-IPQ]). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study contribute to a 
      better understanding of the role of beliefs in medication adherence in asthma. 
      Certain beliefs meaningfully interrelate and change the relationship they have with 
      medication adherence. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: If these beliefs are causally related 
      to medication adherence and can be intervened upon, the findings are useful for 
      providing targets to personalise adherence support.

TI  - "But this is a good cancer:" Patient perceptions of endometrial cancer in Denmark.
PG  - 245-256
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14615 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore endometrial cancer patients' perceptions of the 
      disease and the influence of favourable prognoses on their experiences. BACKGROUND: 
      Endometrial cancer is associated with favourable prognoses, which may imply that 
      patients experience distress to a lesser extent than other cancer patients with less 
      positive treatment outcomes. However, most people with cancer report reduced quality 
      of life and, despite endometrial cancer being prevalent worldwide, experiences of 
      the disease have been little explored. DESIGN: Ethnographic fieldwork with 
      participant observations and interviews. METHODS: Observations during clinical 
      consultations at two Danish hospitals and interviews with women with endometrial 
      cancer (n = 18) over a period of 6 months. The article adheres to the COREQ 
      guidelines for reporting qualitative research. RESULTS: We identify how patients 
      consider cancer in general very likely to be fatal, while clinicians in contrast 
      characterise endometrial cancer specifically as "good" because of favourable 
      prognoses. We employ the concept of bricolage to illustrate how bits and pieces of 
      biomedical knowledge and statistical evidence become intertwined with patients' past 
      experiences and subjective ways of knowing, suggesting that patients' perceptions of 
      endometrial cancer as a disease are somewhat dynamic. CONCLUSIONS: Public stories 
      and everyday life experiences of cancer provide a central framework for illness 
      perceptions. As a result, patients retain the idea of a close connection between 
      cancer and death, while also adopting the notion of endometrial cancer as "good". 
      This influenced how women responded to treatment and care. Framing endometrial 
      cancer as "good" is not always helpful, as the impact of a cancer diagnosis per se 
      is rarely favourable. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In providing women with 
      endometrial cancer with optimal support through diagnosis and treatment, clinicians 
      should attend to the complexity of patients' illness understandings and be aware 
      that assuring patients of a good prognosis not always has the expected impact.

TI  - Heart Failure Care Dyadic Typology: Initial Conceptualization, Advances in Thinking, 
      and Future Directions of a Clinically Relevant Classification System.
PG  - 159-165
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0000000000000548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) dyadic self-care science is advancing rapidly, as 
      evidenced by recent theoretical work, literature reviews, and multiple empiric 
      studies. Typologies, once considered archaic, are now viewed as person-oriented 
      classification systems that allow a whole-system view of information patterns. This 
      whole-system view is particularly needed to understand complex tasks like dyadic HF 
      self-care. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to review the initial 
      conceptualization of an HF care dyadic typology and the present advances in our 
      thinking and suggest future directions for this clinically relevant classification 
      system. CONCLUSIONS: Development and testing of the typology across 5 studies 
      resulted in a well-characterized, pragmatic and parsimonious, person-oriented 
      classification system for understanding how patients and informal caregivers conduct 
      patients' HF self-care at home. The 4 types are characterized as 2 individually 
      oriented types-type I, patient oriented; type II, caregiver oriented; and 2 
      relationally oriented types-type III, collaboratively oriented; and type IV, 
      incongruently oriented. We have devised a single-item measure of typology group that 
      can be assessed in the clinical setting. Once this information is ascertained, the 
      clinician can personalize the plan of care to the realities of the dyad. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Dyads that disagree on who is responsible for self-care may forego or 
      delay action, resulting in self-care failures with subsequent HF advancement, 
      hospitalization, and mortality. As the HF dyadic self-care science has advanced, we 
      have come to appreciate the complexity that arises when 2 individuals work together 
      on 1 complex task-HF self-care.

TI  - A concept analysis of individualized aging.
PG  - 185-92
AB  - AIM: This analysis sought to define the concept of individualized aging. BACKGROUND: 
      The growing older adult population and shortage of health professionals with 
      adequate knowledge of their specialized needs will strain the health care system. 
      The National League for Nursing's Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACES) 
      project has addressed this challenge. The ACES framework identifies three unique 
      concepts integral to delivering high quality care. Clarification of these concepts 
      is needed for educational and research purposes. METHOD: Rogers and Knafl's 
      evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS: The analysis identified 
      two antecedents (past experiences and biological aging processes), three attributes 
      (heterogeneity, living with age-related changes and multiple chronic conditions, and 
      risk for complications), and two consequences (complexity of care over time and 
      variability in health outcomes). CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the antecedents, 
      attributes, and consequences of individualized aging will allow health care 
      providers to improve the care of older adults.

TI  - Workplace Health and Safety Hazards Faced by Informally Employed Domestic Workers in 
      the United States.
PG  - 9-17
LID - 10.1177/2165079918785923 [doi]
AB  - Informally employed domestic workers encounter a range of workplace hazards, though 
      these have been poorly documented and are typically left unacknowledged. Safety 
      concerns include exposure to toxic cleaning products, a high prevalence of ergonomic 
      injuries, and inadequate access to medical care. Presenting the results of an 
      in-person survey of 2,086 informally employed nannies, housecleaners, and caregivers 
      in 14 U.S. cities, this article documents the range of common health and safety 
      hazards faced by domestic workers and suggests some interventions that could improve 
      their working conditions. The survey was conducted in nine languages and data were 
      collected from workers from 71 countries, including a substantial proportion with 
      irregular immigration status. We observed that substandard workplace health and 
      safety conditions are shaped by three aspects of domestic work: long-standing 
      exclusions from federal employment protections, the common disregard of the home as 
      a workplace, and the complexity of care work and the bonds of intimacy that often 
      form through caregiving. Together these factors have served to perpetuate 
      substandard working conditions. Regulatory reforms, as well as worker and employer 
      education, are necessary to improve health outcomes for domestic workers.

TI  - Characteristics and Correlates of Caregivers' Perceptions of Their Family Members' 
      Memory Loss.
PG  - 240-245
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0000000000000220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding caregiver's perceptions of their family member's memory 
      loss is a necessary step in planning nursing interventions to detect and address 
      caregiver burden. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize 
      caregivers' perceptions of their family members' memory loss and identify potential 
      correlates within Leventhal's common sense model (CSM). METHODS: This secondary 
      analysis used baseline data from a larger randomized controlled trial. Patients with 
      memory loss and their caregivers (N = 83 dyads) from the community were included. 
      The adapted Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) assessed caregivers' 
      illness perceptions. Eight additional instruments measured correlates within the 
      CSM. Responses were described; multiple linear regression was used to predict BIPQ 
      dimension scores, and logistic regression was used to predict dichotomized BIPQ 
      scores. RESULTS: Most caregivers were female, White, and spouses of the patients; 
      they reported a range of perceptions on the nine BIPQ dimensions. Patients' 
      cognitive function consistently emerged as a significant correlate of caregivers' 
      illness perceptions, explaining the most variance in caregivers' perceived 
      consequences, identity, and treatment control (p < .01). Caregivers' reactions to 
      patients' behavioral symptoms and caregivers' trait anxiety were associated with 
      perceived illness coherence (p < .01). Caregivers with higher severity of daily 
      hassles and White caregivers perceived that their family members' memory loss would 
      last longer (p < .001). DISCUSSION: Caregivers' perceptions of family members' 
      memory loss varied; distinct dimensions of caregivers' illness perception were 
      associated with a range of clinical and psychosocial factors. This exploratory study 
      demonstrates the complexity of applying the CSM to caregivers of persons with memory 
      loss.

AB  - Activity-limiting pain is common among older home care patients and pain management 
      is complicated by the high prevalence of physical frailty and multimorbidity in the 
      home care population. A comparative effectiveness study was undertaken at a large 
      urban home care agency to examine an evidence-based pain self-management program 
      delivered by physical therapists (PTs). This article focuses on PT training, methods 
      implemented to reinforce content after training and to encourage uptake of the 
      program with appropriate patients, and therapists' fidelity to the program. 
      Seventeen physical therapy teams were included in the cluster randomized controlled 
      trial, with 8 teams (155 PTs) assigned to a control and 9 teams (165 PTs) assigned 
      to a treatment arm. Treatment therapists received interactive training over two 
      sessions, with a follow-up session 6 months later. Additional support was provided 
      via emails, e-learning materials including videos, and a therapist manual. Program 
      fidelity was assessed by examining PT pain documentation in the agency's electronic 
      health record. PT feedback on the program was obtained via semistructured surveys. 
      There were no between-group differences in the number of PTs documenting program 
      elements with the exception of instruction in the use of imagery, which was 
      documented by a higher percentage of intervention therapists (p = 0.002). PTs felt 
      comfortable teaching the program elements, but cited time as the biggest barrier to 
      implementing the protocol. Possible explanations for study results suggesting 
      limited adherence to the program protocol by intervention-group PTs include the 
      top-down implementation strategy, competing organizational priorities, program 
      complexity, competing patient priorities, and inadequate patient buy-in. 
      Implications for the implementation of complex new programs in the home healthcare 
      setting are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed snapshot of the diversity of 
      social support networks of 95 independent-living older adults (mean age = 76). 
      Participants in the convenience sample were recruited from senior centers and a 
      retirement community. Using the Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule and 
      egocentric network analysis, participants' networks are described in terms of 
      patterns, density, size of positive networks (available and utilized), size of 
      negative networks (available and utilized), support need, and support satisfaction. 
      Each participant and the identified members of his or her network were considered a 
      complex adaptive system. Network boundary was 7 members; average network size was 
      6.22 members (SD = 1.50); network density was moderate (mean = 0.53, SD = 0.33); 
      positive interaction networks were larger than negative networks; and overall, 
      participants reported moderate support need (mean = 2.5, SD = 0.7) and high support 
      satisfaction (mean = 5.9, SD = 1.0).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and factors associated with constipation in adult 
      critical care patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Intensive care 
      unit (ICU) of a high-complexity hospital from November 2015 to October 2016. 
      PATIENTS: Adults who were hospitalized for at least 72h in the ICU were followed 
      from their admission to the ICU until their departure. INTERVENTIONS: None. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the 157 patients followed up, the incidence of 
      constipation was 75.8%. The univariate analysis showed that constipated patients 
      were younger, used more sedation and showed more respiratory and postoperative 
      causes for hospitalization, while non-constipated patients were hospitalized more 
      for gastrointestinal reasons. The use of vasoactive substances, mechanical 
      ventilation and haemodialysis was similar between the constipated and 
      non-constipated patients. Multivariate analysis, days of use of docusate+bisacodyl 
      (HR: .79; 95% CI: .65-.96) of omeprazole or ranitidine (HR: .80; 95%CI: .73-.88) and 
      lactulose (HR: .87; 95%CI: .76-.99) were independent protection factors for 
      constipation. CONCLUSION: Constipation has a high incidence among adult critical 
      care patients. Days of drug use acting on the digestive tract (lactulose, 
      docusate+bisacodyl and omeprazole and/or ranitidine) are able to prevent this 
      outcome.

TI  - Ongoing challenges responding to behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
PG  - 506-16
LID - 10.1111/inr.12180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mid- to late-stage dementia is often characterized by behavioural and 
      psychological symptoms, including, but not limited to physical and verbal 
      aggression. INTRODUCTION: Although there is a considerable research about the 
      prevalence, aetiology, and management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of 
      dementia, there is limited research about the experience of caring for people with 
      such symptoms in long-term aged care facilities. AIM: The aims of the study were to 
      describe: (i) nurses' experiences of caring for people with behavioural and 
      psychological symptoms of dementia in long-term aged care facilities, and (ii) 
      strategies nurses used to deal with these symptoms. METHODS: A qualitative 
      exploratory and descriptive design, involving focus group interviews with 30 nurses 
      from three long-term aged care units in Australia. The transcripts were analysed 
      using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The findings revealed five interrelated 
      themes: (i) working under difficult conditions, (ii) behavioural and psychological 
      symptoms of dementia: an everyday encounter, (iii) making sense of behavioural and 
      psychological symptoms of dementia, (iv) attempting to manage behavioural and 
      psychological symptoms of dementia, and (v) feeling undervalued. CONCLUSION: This 
      study highlighted the difficult conditions under which nurses worked and the 
      complexity of caring for individuals who have behavioural and psychological symptoms 
      of dementia. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Organizational efforts to 
      enhance the quality of care for individuals with behavioural and psychological 
      symptoms of dementia in long-term aged care facilities should extend beyond staff 
      education to heed nurses' concerns about organizational barriers to interpersonal 
      care.

TI  - Symptom trajectory and symptom burden in older people with multimorbidity, secondary 
      outcome from the RCT AGe-FIT study.
PG  - 2773-2783
LID - 10.1111/jan.13032 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of 
      community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on 
      symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment. BACKGROUND: Older community-dwelling people with 
      multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring 
      symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a 
      need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people 
      living with multimorbidity. DESIGN: Secondary outcome data from the randomized 
      controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT). 
      METHODS: Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom 
      Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 
      24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an 
      ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in 
      addition to usual care. RESULTS: Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and 
      stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. 
      Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly 
      prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and 
      numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No 
      differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding 
      prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Older community-dwelling 
      people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving 
      advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not 
      significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.

TI  - Identifying and assessing the needs of carers of patients with palliative care 
      needs: an exploratory study.
PG  - 503-509
LID - 10.12968/ijpn.2018.24.10.503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carers of patients with palliative care needs require careful assessment 
      and support to undertake their role effectively. The carer component of palliative 
      care is embedded in complex situations that necessarily focus on the patient. AIMS: 
      To explore experiences of specialist palliative care nurses in identifying, 
      assessing and planning care to support those looking after patients with palliative 
      care needs. RESULTS: Findings identified gaps in identifying carers and their role, 
      and in assessing carers' needs. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the complexity in 
      assessing carers' needs within the palliative care context, that practice gaps exist 
      and positive outcomes result when routine processes were adopted. Future research 
      should explore how to systematically make improvements in supporting carers in all 
      palliative care contexts, including specialist and non-specialist settings.

TI  - A Necessary Evil? Patients' Experiences Receiving Tube Feeding in Acute Care.
PG  - 516-525
LID - 10.1177/0884533617706390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tube feeding (TF) is frequently prescribed for adults admitted to acute 
      care facilities to prevent or ameliorate malnutrition, yet little is known about 
      patients' needs and experiences with receiving this therapy. Patients' perspectives 
      regarding the factors influencing their experiences, as well as their information 
      and support needs, are required to inform healthcare providers' (HCPs') 
      patient-centered practices. METHODS: Based on an interpretive description 
      qualitative approach, 12 unstructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 
      participants admitted to acute care hospitals in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. 
      RESULTS: Analysis of data revealed variations in participants' perceptions of the 
      necessity for TF and the discomfort resulting from this therapy. Perceived necessity 
      was influenced by interrelated themes: the meaning of TF (beyond necessity), the 
      trust held in HCPs, and the resilience of participants in response to all that they 
      were experiencing. Collectively, these findings are encompassed within the central 
      theme, phrased as a question, about the experience of TF: "A necessary evil?" 
      Participants' answers to this question revealed the nature of their overall response 
      throughout TF therapy (ie, indifferent, resistant, relieved, or tolerant). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The range of perceptions and the complexity of patients' experiences 
      during TF revealed in the data can inform HCPs' patient-centered approaches to TF 
      care. Assessing and incorporating patients' values, beliefs, needs, and goals into, 
      and exploring their choices in, nutrition care planning can promote resilience in 
      response to TF therapy. HCPs may then well enhance patients' comfort and overall 
      experience with TF therapy.

TI  - Urinary catheter-related visits to the emergency department and implications for 
      community services.
PG  - S4-S11
LID - 10.12968/bjon.2017.26.9.S4 [doi]
AB  - Thousands of patients live with urinary catheters and the potential complications 
      deriving from long-term use. Disjointed community services may result in patients 
      attending the emergency department (ED) to manage catheter complications. AIM: to 
      conduct a service review of catheterised patients attending the ED of a large London 
      hospital; to describe incidence, reasons for attendance and cost to inform future 
      planning for out-of-hospital care. METHOD: a catheter collaborative, consisting of 
      multidisciplinary health professionals and patients, formulated survey questions. 
      Patients were identified from the electronic patient record by searching for the 
      code 'urological complaint'. One month of clinical records were retrospectively 
      reviewed and analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 287 patients attended 
      the department with urological complaints: 41 (14%) had urinary catheter problems, 
      of these 24 (59%) patients were discharged and 17 (41%) were admitted for further 
      treatment. Stays in ED varied from 1 hour 13 minutes to 17 hours (mean = 4.8 hours). 
      A total of 9 patients (38%) were sent home during antisocial hours (9 pm to 7 am), 4 
      patients were discharged between midnight and 2 am. Patients admitted had mean stays 
      of 4.11 days. Most admissions were short term for intravenous (IV) treatments; 3 
      patients were hospitalised for 20 days. A total of 14 patients (34%) were diagnosed 
      with catheter-related infections: 11 (79%) had bladder infections and 3 (21%) had 
      septicaemia. All 14 patients (100%) had urine-culture-confirmed infections, mainly 
      from coliform, proteus and pseudomonas species. A total of 20 patients (49%) 
      received antibiotic treatment. The majority of patients received an initial IV dose 
      followed, where required, by oral treatment on discharge. CONCLUSIONS: many 
      catheterised patients had complex needs with high rates of urinary infections and 
      admissions for urosepsis. High attendance related less to old age but more to 
      complexity of history, such as neurological conditions and disability. Only a 
      proportion of these patients could be safely treated by district nurse teams. A 
      significant proportion would require more responsive community services with several 
      spells of short-term input (e.g. daily or more than once-daily visits) and access to 
      diagnostics, microbiology, pharmaceutical input and IV treatments.

TI  - Pain flare, complexity and analgesia in bone oligometastases treated with 
      stereotactic body radiation therapy.
PG  - e12915
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12915 [doi]
AB  - The aim of our study was to assess the incidence of pain flare and the effectiveness 
      of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in pain management of patients with bone 
      oligometastases. We evaluated 48 patients accounting for 54 treatments. The Edmonton 
      Classification System for Cancer Pain (ECS-CP) was applied to identify indicators of 
      treatment-resistant pain, in patients with active pain (NRS ≥ 2) at baseline. 
      Statistical analysis was performed to identify predictors of pain flare and pain 
      control. Pain flare occurred in 38% of treated patients (n = 18/48): No correlation 
      was found between pain flare and patient- or treatment-related variables. In the 
      subset of patients with active pain at baseline (n = 23), pain control was obtained 
      in 62% of patients at 1 year; median time to pain progression after SBRT was 
      29 months (CI95% 6-52 months). Presence of ≥2ECS-CP features was correlated with 
      earlier pain progression (4 vs. 30 months, p = 0.012). Pain flare occurred in 38% of 
      cases irrespectively of steroid premedication and dose regimen. In patient with 
      baseline active pain, durable pain control was obtained. Presence of ≥2 complexity 
      indicators at the ECS-CP assessment was correlated with impaired pain control and 
      may deserve future investigation in prospective studies.

TI  - The Experiences of Older Adults with Dual Diagnosis in an Inner Melbourne Community 
      Mental Health Service.
PG  - 420-426
LID - 10.1080/01612840.2017.1413458 [doi]
AB  - Less is known about the experiences of older adults (65+ years of age) with 
      co-occurring mental health and alcohol and other drug use disorders (dual diagnosis) 
      than is known about the experiences of their younger counterparts. This exploratory 
      qualitative study sought to interview individuals receiving case management from an 
      inner Melbourne community mental health service to determine their experiences of 
      living with dual diagnosis and explore their interactions with mental health and 
      addiction treatment, and general medical services alike. Six older adults with a 
      dual mental health and substance disorder agreed to participate in a semi-structured 
      interview process and provided their perspectives about living with complex mental 
      illness and alcohol and other drug use. Several key themes emerged throughout the 
      interview process, mirroring the notion of dual diagnosis being a complex phenomenon 
      involving a number of interrelated factors: these include medical complexity, poor 
      service engagement and long-term use of alcohol and other drugs. Interviews also 
      demonstrate the challenges inherent in providing care to this cohort, with the 
      participants frequently describing their experiences with services as being fraught 
      with difficulty. The increased understanding of the perspectives of older adults 
      with dual diagnosis provides the foundation for further research into this 
      population in addition to influencing future nursing care provided to this cohort.

TI  - Complexity of Care: A Concept Analysis of Older Adult Health Care Experiences.
PG  - 108-113
LID - 10.5480/14-1362 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To define the term complexity of care. BACKGROUND: The aging population and 
      lack of gerontological preparation in pre-licensure nursing programs are pressing 
      issues. The NLN Advancing Care Excellence for Seniors (ACE.S) project developed a 
      framework to facilitate faculty and student understanding of older adults' care 
      needs. Integral to the framework is the concept of complexity of care. METHOD: 
      Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. RESULTS: The 
      analysis identified three antecedents (focus on treatment and cure of disease, 
      multiple comorbidities, and life experiences and culture), five attributes 
      (polypharmacy, use of advanced technologies, novel care models, a fragmented health 
      care system, and the relational nature of caregiving), and two consequences (impact 
      on quality of life and impact on quality of care). CONCLUSION: Defining the concept 
      of complexity of care will facilitate student understanding of the unique health 
      care needs of older adults.

TI  - Dyadic Perceptions of the Decision Process in Families Living With Lung Cancer.
PG  - 108-115
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To use dyadic analyses to identify determinants of patients' and 
      family members' perceptions of the positive and negative aspects of the 
      decision-making process in families living with lung cancer.  . DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study.  . SETTING: Community setting in Greater Portland, Oregon. . 
      SAMPLE: 109 family care dyads (patient and family member) recruited from a statewide 
      cancer registry.  . METHODS: Surveys were completed in-person, separately, and 
      privately by each member of the family care dyad. Secondary analysis was completed 
      using multilevel modeling.  . MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Negative and positive aspects 
      of the decision process.  . FINDINGS: Level 1 data revealed significant variability 
      across care dyads' positive or negative perceptions of the decision-making process. 
      Level 2 results for negative perceptions of decision making indicated that patient 
      and family member perceptions were significantly associated with their own 
      depressive symptoms and feelings of not being listened to by others. Level 2 results 
      for positive perceptions of decision making indicated that patient and family member 
      perceptions were significantly inversely associated with their own feelings of not 
      being listened to and being in nonspousal relationships. In addition, family 
      members' perceptions were more positive when the patients were older.  . 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the complexity of the decision-making process in 
      families with lung cancer, and underscored the importance of the care dyad feeling 
      listened to by family members in the context of life-threatening illnesses.  . 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses assisting families with decisions about lung cancer 
      should be aware of the dynamics of the care dyad and how the decision process is 
      perceived by patients and their family members.

TI  - Transforming emergency services for frail older people in hospital.
PG  - 18-9
LID - 10.7748/nm.22.3.18.s29 [doi]
AB  - Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a 
      difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the 
      likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve 
      services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with 
      more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is 
      an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of 
      this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ 
      to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop 
      effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.

TI  - Chemotherapy at home: keeping patients in their "natural habitat".
PG  - 89-101
AB  - Escalating cancer rates and an increase in the complexity and duration of 
      chemotherapy regimens have brought the issue of cancer treatment at home to the 
      forefront. For the participants of this study, home chemotherapy was offered as a 
      potential treatment choice. Ten patients who accepted home chemotherapy were 
      interviewed using the methodology of interpretive description. They shared their 
      experiences of receiving chemotherapy at home, and identified home as being a 
      "natural habitat" in which they were better able to adapt to their circumstances. 
      Patients were able to redistribute their resources including time, energy, and 
      finances in ways that were meaningful to them. They felt the care provided was 
      enhanced and they were more receptive to teaching. Lastly, participants viewed 
      themselves as being less ill and better able to cope with their treatments. Given 
      the results of this study and other research available, chemotherapy at home should 
      be considered an option for patients with cancer.

PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20180111-01 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine the nature of teamwork in care 
      facilities and its impact on the effectiveness of care delivery to older adults and 
      job satisfaction among health care workers. A focused ethnography was conducted at 
      two care facilities where older adults reside. Analysis of interviews with 22 
      participants revealed perceptions of teamwork and understandings about facilitators 
      of and barriers to effective teamwork. Participants indicated that team 
      relationships impacted care provided and job satisfaction. Participants also 
      identified trust and reciprocity, communication, and sharing a common goal as 
      critical factors in effective teamwork. In addition, participants identified the 
      role of management as important in setting the tone for teamwork. Future research is 
      needed to understand the complexity of supporting teamwork in residential settings 
      given the challenges of culture, diversity, and individuals working multiple jobs.

TI  - Patient-related complexity of care: a challenge or overwhelming burden for nurses - 
      a qualitative study.
PG  - 204-212
LID - 10.1111/scs.12449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-related complexity of nursing care in acute care hospitals has 
      increased in recent years, in part due to shorter hospital stays and the increase in 
      multimorbid patients. However, little research has been conducted on how nurses 
      experience complex nursing care situations. AIMS: The aim of this study was to gain 
      a better understanding of how nurses experience complex nursing care situations in 
      Swiss acute care hospitals. METHODS: This qualitative study utilised focus group 
      interviews and thematic analysis. Focus groups facilitate different perspectives of 
      the topic. Thematic analysis is suitable for the analysis of everyday stories. 
      Participants were 24 Registered Nurses with experience in their field, from four 
      Swiss hospitals. The evaluation was performed in six steps according to themes. 
      Participation was voluntary. This study was part of a multicentre research project 
      that had been approved by the responsible ethics committees. RESULTS: Three main 
      themes regarding the experience of complex nursing care situations were found: 
      complexity as a challenge, complexity as an overwhelming burden and mediating 
      factors. Mediating factors included time resources and teamwork and 
      interprofessional collaboration as contextual conditions. Additionally, nurses' 
      individual characteristics such as their professional experience and expertise, as 
      well as their personal and professional values and beliefs were considered as 
      mediating factors. These mediating factors may determine whether complex nursing 
      care situations are experienced as challenging or overwhelming. LIMITATIONS: The 
      findings from this study are limited as only experienced nurses participated in the 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are ambivalent with regard to how they experience complex 
      nursing care situations. The contextual conditions and the nurses' personal 
      characteristics play a key role in whether nurses perceive complex nursing care 
      situations as positive challenges or overwhelming burdens. These findings are 
      important for managers, as they can support nurses to master complex nursing care 
      situations.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dancing activity based on 
      different dance styles, in groups as well as with a partner, on mobility 
      performance, quality of life and social engagement in a sample of older adults. One 
      hundred and sixty-three older adults (mean age, 70 years; SD = 4 years) participated 
      in a supervised dancing activity programme for 16 weeks. The dancing activity 
      included different dance routines and was progressive in terms of motor complexity. 
      Data on mobility, health-related quality of life and social engagement were 
      collected before and after a 16-week training period. Significant improvements in 
      mobility, quality of life and social engagement were noted in single as well as 
      dual-task performance after the intervention. Our results emphasise the benefit of a 
      16-week dance training on multidimensional features, including physical and 
      psychosocial domains, which are important for successful ageing.

TI  - Case Managers on the Front Lines of Opioid Epidemic Response: Advocacy, Education, 
      and Empowerment for Users of Medical and Nonmedical Opioids.
PG  - 256-263
LID - 10.1097/NCM.0000000000000309 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to examine how case managers, taking a 
      holistic, patient-centered approach that is grounded in advocacy, have a crucial 
      role to play in the opioid crisis response. This includes providing education, 
      support, and resources to prevent misuse of and addiction to opioids prescribed for 
      pain management and intervening with more resources to help combat the nonmedical 
      use of prescription opioids and heroin. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: In addition to 
      case managers in acute care, workers' compensation, and palliative care, who have 
      frequent contact with patients who are prescribed opioid medications for pain 
      management, all case managers may interact with patients and support 
      systems/families who are directly or indirectly impacted by opioid use, misuse, and 
      addiction. IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: The broad scope of the 
      opioid epidemic necessitates individualized interventions to address the multiple 
      needs of individuals. The case manager, particularly one who is board-certified, has 
      the expertise and knowledge to assess individual needs, identify treatment and other 
      resources, and provide education and support to the patient and family/support 
      system. In addition, given the complexity and life-or-death consequences associated 
      with the opioid crisis, a timely and comprehensive approach is essential, bringing 
      together multiple disciplines in health care, public health, addiction, pain 
      management, social work, mental health counseling, pharmacology, and case 
      management.

TI  - Use of a single parameter track and trigger chart and the perceived barriers and 
      facilitators to escalation of a deteriorating ward patient: a mixed methods study.
PG  - 175-85
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13104 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate nurses' use of a single parameter track and 
      trigger chart to inform implementation of the National Early Warning Scoring tool. 
      To report the characteristics of patients with triggers, the frequency of different 
      triggers, and the time taken to repeat observations. To explore the barriers and 
      facilitators perceived by nursing staff relating to patient monitoring. BACKGROUND: 
      Sub-optimal care of the deteriorating patient has been described for almost two 
      decades. Organisations have responded by implementing strategies that improve 
      monitoring and facilitate a timely response to patient deterioration. While these 
      systems have been widely adopted the evidence-base to support their use is 
      inconsistent. DESIGN: A mixed method service evaluation was carried out in an acute 
      University hospital. METHODS: Physiological triggers (n = 263) and characteristics 
      of triggering patients (n = 74) were recorded from surgical and medical wards. 
      Descriptive statistics were displayed. Questionnaires were distributed (n = 105) to 
      student nurses, health care assistants and registered nurses. Themes and sub-themes 
      were identified from content analysis. RESULTS: Hypotension was the most frequent 
      abnormality. There was variability in the time to repeat observations following a 
      trigger. A high proportion of triggers were identified in older patients, as was a 
      trend of longer time intervals between trigger and repeat observations. Nurses 
      reported a number of barriers and facilitators to monitoring patients including: 
      'workload', 'equipment', 'interactions between staff' and 'interactions with 
      patients'. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a number of barriers and facilitators 
      to monitoring and escalation of abnormal vital signs, highlighting the complexity of 
      the process and the need for a system-wide approach to a deteriorating patient. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The trend of longer delays following a trigger in 
      older patients has not been identified previously and could reflect a knowledge gap 
      of the physiological changes and response to acute illness in older people.

TI  - Visiting nurses' posthospital medication management in home health care: an 
      ethnographic study.
PG  - 222-232
LID - 10.1111/scs.12451 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication management is the most challenging component of a successful 
      transition from hospital to home, a challenge of growing complexity as the number of 
      older persons living with chronic conditions grows, along with increasingly 
      specialised and accelerated hospital treatment plans. Thus, many patients are 
      discharged with complex medication regimen instructions, accentuating the risk of 
      medication errors that may cause readmission, adverse drug events and a need for 
      further health care. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore visiting nurses' 
      medication management in home health care after hospital discharge and to identify 
      key elements in patient medication for improved patient safety. METHOD: Inspired by 
      the ethnographic research cycle, participant observations and informal interviews 
      were conducted at 12 initial visits by a nurse in a patient's home after hospital 
      discharge. Data consisted of field notes and photographs from the patients' homes, 
      medication lists and medical records. Field notes were analysed in four steps. 
      FINDINGS: The analysis showed 12 stages in medication management in which nurses 
      strove to adjust medication management to the patients' actual health status by 
      mediating on knowledge of the patient, information to the patient and on rules and 
      regulations and by establishing order in medication lists and medications in the 
      home. CONCLUSION: The nurse-patient relationship, the integration of care and the 
      context of care challenged patient safety in visiting nurses' medication management 
      in patients' homes after hospital discharge. The implications for practice were the 
      following: to ensure nurses' opportunities to continuously evolve their observation 
      skills and skills in making sound clinical judgements; to establish 
      interprofessional working processes which support the continuous assessment of 
      patients' needs and the adjustment of care and treatment; to clarify expectations to 
      nurses' responsibility and patients' privacy.

TI  - Helping Older Adults Improve Their Medication Experience (HOME) by Addressing 
      Medication Regimen Complexity in Home Healthcare.
PG  - 10-19
LID - 10.1097/NHH.0000000000000632 [doi]
AB  - In skilled home healthcare (SHHC), communication between nurses and physicians is 
      often inadequate for medication reconciliation and needed changes to the medication 
      regimens are rarely made. Fragmentation of electronic health record (EHR) systems, 
      transitions of care, lack of physician-nurse in-person contact, and poor 
      understanding of medications by patients and their families put patients at risk for 
      serious adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop and test the HOME 
      tool, an informatics tool to improve communication about medication regimens, share 
      the insights of home care nurses with physicians, and highlight to physicians and 
      nurses the complexity of medication schedules. We used human computer interaction 
      design and evaluation principles, automated extraction from standardized forms, and 
      modification of existing EHR fields to highlight key medication-related insights 
      that had arisen during the SHHC visit. Separate versions of the tool were developed 
      for physicians/nurses and patients/caregivers. A pilot of the tool was conducted 
      using 20 SHHC encounters. Home care nurses and physicians found the tool useful for 
      communication. Home care nurses were able to implement the HOME tool into their 
      clinical workflow and reported improved communication with physicians about 
      medications. This simple and largely automated tool improves understanding and 
      communication around medications in SHHC.

TI  - Essential elements of the nursing practice environment in nursing homes: 
      Psychometric evaluation.
LID - 10.1111/opn.12137 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To develop and psychometrically test the Essentials of 
      Magnetism II in nursing homes. BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers and complex needs of 
      older people in nursing homes strain the nursing workforce. Fewer adequately trained 
      staff and increased care complexity raise concerns about declining quality. Nurses' 
      practice environment has been reported to affect quality of care and productivity. 
      The Essentials of Magnetism II © measures processes and relationships of practice 
      environments that contribute to productivity and quality of care and can therefore 
      be useful in identifying processes requiring change to pursue excellent practice 
      environments. However, this instrument was not explicitly evaluated for its use in 
      nursing home settings so far. DESIGN: In a preparatory phase, a cross-sectional 
      survey study focused on face validity of the essentials of magnetism in nursing 
      homes. A second cross-sectional survey design was then used to further test the 
      instrument's validity and reliability. METHODS: Psychometric testing included 
      evaluation of content and construct validity, and reliability. Nurses (N = 456) 
      working at 44 units of three nursing homes were included. RESULTS: Respondent 
      acceptance, relevance and clarity were adequate. Five of the eight subscales and 54 
      of the 58 items did meet preset psychometric criteria. CONCLUSIONS: All essentials 
      of magnetism are considered relevant for nursing homes. The subscales Adequacy of 
      Staffing, Clinically Competent Peers, Patient Centered Culture, Autonomy and Nurse 
      Manager Support can be used in nursing homes without problems. The other subscales 
      cannot be directly applied to this setting. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The valid 
      subscales of the Essentials of Magnetism II instrument can be used to design 
      excellent nursing practice environments that support nurses' delivery of care. 
      Before using the entire instrument, however, the other subscales have to be 
      improved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the profile of patients evaluated by Nurse Care Management 
      in an Emergency Department and identify the type of alternative healthcare resource 
      assigned and report the results of clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Prospective follow-up, on admission to the Emergency Department in an acute hospital 
      and on discharge from the alternative healthcare resource, of patients assessed by 
      Nurse Care Management, from July to December 2015. The patient characteristics, 
      social environment and results of clinical practice were studied. RESULTS: 190 
      patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 (59.8%) cases from the 
      Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) 
      cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital 
      and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, 
      presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with 
      dementia, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and 
      cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before 
      emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative 
      healthcare resource (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with advanced age, 
      complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary 
      care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other 
      patients. After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional 
      capacity and present less polypharmacy.

TI  - The role of unregulated care providers in managing heart failure patients in 
      long-term care facilities.
PG  - 849-861
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13413 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Heart failure is a complex syndrome in which abnormal heart 
      function results in clinical symptoms and signs of low cardiac output and/or 
      pulmonary or systemic congestion. Heart failure is common among long-term care 
      residents, and is associated with significant morbidity and acute care utilisation. 
      Heart failure guidelines endorse standard therapies, yet long-term care residents 
      are less likely to receive recommended treatments. The objective of this study is to 
      understand the perceptions and potential role of unregulated care providers in 
      contributing to better heart failure management among long-term care residents. 
      DESIGN: Focus group interviews. METHODS: This qualitative study employed focus 
      groups to explore perceptions from 24 unregulated care providers in three Ontario, 
      Canada long-term care homes, about barriers to the optimal management of heart 
      failure. RESULTS: Three overarching concepts emerged characterising unregulated care 
      providers' experiences in caring for residents with heart failure in long-term care: 
      (1) the complexity of providing heart failure care in a long-term care setting, (2) 
      striving for resident-centred decision making and (3) unregulated care providers 
      role enactment nested within an interprofessional team in long-term care. These 
      concepts reflect the complex interplay between individual unregulated care providers 
      and residents, and heart failure-related, socio-cultural and organisational factors 
      that influence heart failure care processes in the long-term care system. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Optimising the management of heart failure in long-term care is 
      contingent on greater engagement of unregulated care providers as active partners in 
      the interprofessional care team. Interventions to improve heart failure management 
      in long-term care must ensure that appropriate education is provided to all 
      long-term care staff, including unregulated care providers, and in a manner that 
      fosters greater and more effective interprofessional collaboration. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: Active and collaborative engagement unregulated care providers 
      has the potential to improve the management of heart failure in long-term care 
      residents.

AB  - Older adults often experience functional losses during hospitalization. Clinical 
      care activities have been increasingly promoted as a way to help older hospitalized 
      patients offset these losses and recover from acute illness. Little research exists 
      to objectively measure clinical care activities. This study evaluated the utility 
      and feasibility of using the Actiheart, a combined heart rate monitor and 
      accelerometer, to measure heart rate and motion (activity counts) during five 
      clinical care activities. Fifty-four adults, aged 65 and older, scheduled for 
      surgery, participated in a simulation of activities. The Actiheart successfully 
      measured motion and heart rate during each of the five activities. One-way repeated 
      measures analyses of variance showed that the Actiheart discriminated significant 
      differences within and across the five activities. This study supports the use of an 
      activity monitor to quantify clinical care activities in research studies that can 
      be translated into clinical care. However, the complexity associated with data 
      collection and analysis using the Actiheart could limit its direct use in clinical 
      research.

AB  - Longitudinal studies are recognized as contributing to understanding the complexity 
      of aging and generating insights that cannot be gained using other research methods. 
      However, conducting longitudinal studies is recognized as challenging, especially 
      among older adults. The purpose of the current review is to describe how the authors 
      addressed the limitations and challenges of longitudinal studies in a study of the 
      health status of a community of religious sisters. Methods of this specific 
      longitudinal study are presented to provide background to the discussion. 
      Challenges, limitations, and advantages of the current longitudinal study are 
      organized into three categories (i.e., sample, method, and data analysis) that have 
      been addressed in the literature as contributing to the fidelity of longitudinal 
      studies. The unique characteristics of the current study sample, particularly their 
      access to health care, creates a comparison group for the study of older women in 
      general.

AB  - To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand 
      the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to 
      introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct 
      a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults 
      with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom 
      management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom 
      Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors 
      that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It 
      accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within 
      the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its 
      interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some 
      limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability 
      Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it 
      encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate 
      for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of 
      rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health 
      status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a 
      guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the 
      functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

TI  - Ageing out of place: The meaning of home among hispanic older persons living in the 
      United States.
LID - 10.1111/opn.12150 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the meaning of home among older Hispanic immigrants who are "aging 
      out of place." BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence supports the concept of older persons 
      ageing in place. Nurse researchers have demonstrated that older person who age in 
      place have better physical, psychological and cognitive outcomes. Less, however, is 
      known about older persons who are "aging out of place," meaning out of their country 
      of origin. With the growth of home health care, there is a need to understand the 
      older immigrants' meaning of home when ageing out of their country of origin. DESIGN 
      AND METHOD: An inductive, qualitative descriptive research design was used. 
      Seventeen Hispanic participants, ranging in age from 65 to 83 years were interviewed 
      using a semi-structured interview protocol. FINDINGS: Two major finding of the study 
      focused on participants' descriptions of home in their country of origin and in the 
      USA. The majority of participants described their home in their native country as 
      the community, countryside or town (pueblo) and in the U.S.A. as family. The level 
      of social isolation and loneliness among participants was evident. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Older Hispanic immigrants who are "aging out of place" integrate their past 
      experiences of sense of place in their native country with their present experiences 
      of home in the USA. The need to understand the role of the community and the family 
      in the provision of nursing care in the home may be more important than the physical 
      structure or setting in which it is delivered. Further intra- and cross-national 
      studies are needed to provide a framework for understanding the issues of ageing and 
      immigration globally. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Gerontological nurses need to 
      recognise the complexity of family relationships for older Hispanic persons who are 
      ageing out of place of origin and their risk of depression, social isolation, and 
      loneliness.

TI  - How is continuity of care experienced by people living with chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 153-161
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13860 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' perceptions of continuity of care within a 
      hospital-based specialist service. BACKGROUND: Patient journeys through health care 
      are becoming increasingly complex. For patients with chronic conditions, the 
      longevity of their illness and common multiple co-morbidities make this complexity 
      more pronounced. Continuity of care is most challenging to provide for these 
      patients. A multifaceted model of continuity is widely accepted, but despite this, 
      much literature focuses exclusively on relational aspects. In addition, the majority 
      of the literature has focused on primary and family care settings whilst continuity 
      within specialist and hospital care has not been widely researched. DESIGN: A 
      qualitative descriptive design was used. METHODS: Thirteen semi-structured 
      interviews with patients accessing services as at a Renal and Transplant Unit at a 
      UK hospital were conducted in 2014. Data were analysed thematically to identify 
      commonality as well as diversity amongst participants. RESULTS: Five themes of time, 
      being known, knowledge, knowing the system and responsibility were identified within 
      patient experiences of continuity. The multidisciplinary team was more important in 
      relational continuity than literature has previously suggested. Patients' 
      expectations in relation to continuity were notably different in their interactions 
      with hospital-based services in comparison with community and family-based care. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients accessing specialist care services may perceive continuity 
      differently to those receiving care in the community. Generic guidance concerned 
      with patient experience outcomes may be difficult to implement in practice. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses and the wider healthcare team play a 
      fundamental role within the provision of continuity, even in predominantly medically 
      led specialist services. The differences between primary and secondary care in terms 
      of patient expectation and experience should be recognised to ensure effective 
      models of care are implemented which both meet patient expectations and improve 
      their experience of care.

TI  - Complementary therapies in rehabilitation: stroke patients' narratives. Part 2.
PG  - 668-76
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03726.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To document the narratives of nursing staff and patients in a 
      Thailand Rehabilitation Centre where complementary therapies are used and to discuss 
      perceived progress of these stroke patients. Specific complementary therapies used 
      at this Rehabilitation Centre include Thai massage and herbal therapies. BACKGROUND: 
      Whilst there has been a small amount of quantitative research on stroke patients and 
      complementary therapies there has been no qualitative research on the experience of 
      stroke patients and the use of complementary therapies. DESIGN: Qualitative pilot 
      study using narrative inquiry and discourse analysis framed by poststructural 
      theory. METHOD: Six stroke patients were interviewed about their involvement in 
      complementary therapy practice and treatments and their experiences of these 
      therapies in rehabilitation. RESULTS: This study represents a reflective mining of 
      patients' stories and captures the main theme of changes in stroke patients' 
      embodiment and a main discourse of attending to and enabling progress. Throughout 
      the storylines there are many other discourses such as hope, desire, helplessness, 
      despair, fear, motivation, gratefulness, gladness and fragility. CONCLUSION: 
      Threaded throughout the stroke patients' stories of their rehabilitation there is a 
      layering of discourses involving tensions and a longing to overcome their 
      disability. There are twists and detours in their stories that show the complexity 
      of the illness experience. Progress is not straightforward with a quick recovery. 
      Many contexts or variables influence progress such as spatiality, temporality and 
      people. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: What is offered here is the reality of the 
      rehabilitation process for stroke patients. Through the use of narrative inquiry the 
      contexts of people, spatiality (environment) and temporality (time) are an important 
      part of rehabilitation process.

TI  - Optimism, Symptom Distress, Illness Appraisal, and Coping in Patients With 
      Advanced-Stage Cancer Diagnoses Undergoing Chemotherapy Treatment.
PG  - 384-392
LID - 10.1188/17.ONF.384-392 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationships between optimism, self-efficacy, 
      symptom distress, treatment complexity, illness appraisal, coping, and mood 
      disturbance in patients with advanced-stage cancer. . DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      study. . SETTING: Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven in Connecticut, an 
      outpatient comprehensive cancer center. . SAMPLE: A convenience sample of 121 adult 
      patients with stages III-IV cancer undergoing active chemotherapy. . METHODS: 
      Participants completed common self-report questionnaires to measure variables. 
      Treatment hours and visits were calculated from data retrieved from medical record 
      review. Mediation and path analysis were conducted to identify direct and indirect 
      pathways from the significant antecedent variables to mood disturbance. . MAIN 
      RESEARCH VARIABLES: Dispositional optimism, self-efficacy, social support, treatment 
      complexity, symptom distress, illness appraisal, coping, and mood disturbance. . 
      FINDINGS: Greater optimism and self-efficacy were associated with less negative 
      illness appraisal, less avoidant coping, and decreased mood disturbance. Conversely, 
      greater symptom distress was associated with greater negative illness appraisal, 
      greater avoidant coping, and greater mood disturbance. In the final model, optimism 
      and symptom distress had direct and indirect effects on mood disturbance. Indirect 
      effects were partially mediated by illness appraisal. . CONCLUSIONS: Mood 
      disturbance resulted from an interaction of disease stressors, personal resources, 
      and cognitive appraisal of illness. Avoidant coping was associated with greater 
      disturbed mood, but neither avoidant nor active coping had a significant effect on 
      mood in the multivariate model.  . IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Illness appraisal, 
      coping style, and symptom distress are important targets for intervention. Optimism 
      is a beneficial trait and should be included, along with coping style, in 
      comprehensive nursing assessments of patients with cancer.

TI  - Instrument to measure health literacy about complementary and alternative medicine.
PG  - 489-99
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Health literacy is an essential skill for today's health 
      care consumers. The growth in use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) 
      adds to the complexity of being sufficiently health literate. The purpose of this 
      article is to describe the initial psychometric evaluation of the "Montana State 
      University (MSU) CAM Health Literacy Scale," a newly developed instrument to measure 
      an individual's health literacy about CAM. METHODS: Exploratory factor analyses, 
      reliabilities, and conceptual considerations were used. RESULTS: The outcome is a 
      21-item instrument with Cronbach's alpha of .753 and 42.27% explained variance. 
      Convergent validity assessments revealed weak but significant correlations between 
      the scale and measures of general health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: The MSU CAM Health 
      Literacy Scale has promise for use in future research and clinical endeavors.

TI  - Clinical considerations for care of older adult cancer survivors.
PG  - 8-12
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20130801-89 [doi]
AB  - The number of cancer survivors has been steadily increasing due in part to the aging 
      population and advancements in cancer care and treatment. Of the current 13.7 
      million cancer survivors in the United States, most are 65 or older. Aging changes 
      and the presence of comorbidities add complexity to the care of cancer survivors. In 
      addition. common long-term cancer-related symptoms and late effects of cancer 
      treatments provide challenges to nurses and other health professionals caring for 
      older cancer survivors. Transition from oncology care to primary or shared care 
      requires understanding of detailed information about the specific cancer diagnosis, 
      treatments received, and recommendations for follow-up care to prevent recurrence, 
      recognize treatment-associated health effects, and understand strategies for health 
      promotion. Nurses in all practice areas will care for cancer survivors and must be 
      prepared to deliver safe and effective care.

TI  - How to mobilise patients with dementia to a standing position.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine which intervention used to assist people 
      with dementia from sitting to a standing position was the most effective approach to 
      aid movement. METHOD: Focus groups were held with care and therapy staff working in 
      dementia settings to find out the difficulties they encountered when helping someone 
      with dementia to a standing position, and the interventions to overcome these 
      difficulties. Suggested interventions were substantiated against the literature and 
      efficacy of intervention attempts was recorded in a diary. Participants also 
      completed a post-intervention questionnaire to establish their views on how results 
      should be used. RESULTS: Appropriate interventions led to a positive outcome for 
      participants as they were able to assist people with the minimum of fuss and 
      complexity, and for patients because they received the care they required. No single 
      intervention emerged as being particularly effective and other factors must be 
      considered when interpreting the results. CONCLUSION: Participants agreed that 
      interventions should be included in patient handling training programmes.

TI  - The Conversation: A Vital Element of Nephrology Care for Older Americans Who Are 
      Medically Complex.
PG  - 545-550
AB  - The U.S. population is aging, supported in part by continued development of 
      life-prolonging medical therapies and technologies. These innovations, including 
      kidney replacement therapies, have been effective in providing additional options to 
      patients facing serious illness, but they have also introduced a new level of 
      complexity in the provider assessment of treatment for these patients. Health care 
      providers are being tasked to decide if medical care is appropriate for an aging and 
      medically complex population, a decision complicated by a variety of factors. 
      Patient-focused conversations surrounding goals of care, prognosis, medical 
      futility, and quality of life need to become part of the routine practice pattern 
      for nephrology care in the United States.

TI  - Perception of risk for older people living with a mental illness: Balancing 
      uncertainty.
PG  - 577-86
LID - 10.1111/inm.12175 [doi]
AB  - Risk is commonly defined as a negative threat which needs to be controlled and 
      mitigated; as a concept, it takes high priority in contemporary mental health 
      services. Health-care organizations and clinicians are now required to use levels of 
      risk as a benchmark for clinical decision-making. However, perceptions of risk 
      change according to the lens through which it is viewed. A qualitative, exploratory 
      research study was undertaken in an aged persons' mental health programme in 
      Victoria, Australia, to explore the notion of risk from the multiple perspectives of 
      service providers and consumers. Data were obtained through in-depth interviews, and 
      analysis was based on the framework of Ritchie and Spencer. Balancing uncertainty 
      emerged as a major theme, and comprised two subthemes: (i) complexity of risk from 
      the perspective of providers of services; and (ii) complexity of safety from the 
      perspectives of recipients of services. These differences emphasize a significant 
      disjuncture between perceptions of risk and the potential for the individual needs 
      and concerns of consumers to be subsumed under broader organizational issues. The 
      uncertainty this tension highlights suggests the need to reconceptualize risk, 
      incorporating the views and experiences of all stakeholders, particularly consumers 
      and carers, to enhance recovery-oriented services and facilitate consumer 
      participation within mental health services.

TI  - Measuring health literacy - the Swedish Functional Health Literacy scale.
PG  - 165-72
LID - 10.1111/scs.12125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of health promotion efforts vary due to a complexity of 
      reasons. One possible reason for an absence of effects is the level of functional 
      health literacy among the individuals that participate in the interventions. Thus, 
      valid and reliable instruments that capture these kinds of skills are needed. The 
      aim of this study was to develop a Swedish Functional Health Literacy scale to use 
      in health promotion and health prevention by translating the Japanese Functional 
      Health Literacy scale into Swedish and testing some aspects of its validity and 
      test-retest reliability. METHODS: The research project comprised six phases 
      including translation and back translation, validity tests of the two first versions 
      of the instrument based on interviews with professionals and representatives for the 
      target group of the instrument, and a test-retest of the first version among target 
      groups. RESULTS: The items in the first two versions were experienced as unclear, 
      which led to improvements of the next version. The final version of the translated 
      instrument (the Swedish Functional Literacy scale) showed evidence of content 
      validity, and the test-retest confirmed that the instrument had stability over time 
      with a percentage agreement for the items ranging from 63% to 92% (M = 77.2%). 
      CONCLUSION: The items in the Swedish version of the scale are equivalent to the 
      original Japanese scale in terms of language and contents and cover the major 
      aspects of functional health literacy as it is defined in the literature. The 
      translated instrument shows stability over time, that is, reliability, at least for 
      a part of the Swedish population. More validity tests of the Swedish Functional 
      Health Literacy scale based on a broader population are needed.

TI  - A pre-emptive pain management protocol to support self-care following vitreo-retinal 
      day surgery.
PG  - 3230-9
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12572 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the development and evaluation of a pre-emptive and 
      multimodal pain management protocol that aims to improve patient experiences 
      following vitreo-retinal day surgery. BACKGROUND: Vitreo-retinal surgery has been 
      increasingly performed as day surgery that requires patients to undertake 
      postoperative self-care, including the management of pain. While vitreo-retinal 
      surgery is known to be painful in the convalescent period, pain management following 
      day surgery has been described as problematic across many surgical specialties. 
      DESIGN: One hundred patient audit and in-depth qualitative interviews with nine 
      participants. METHODS: A pain management protocol was developed from research 
      evidence, established knowledge and expert opinion, then implemented and evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The pre-emptive and multimodal protocol used intravenous Parecoxib in 
      conjunction with regional ocular anaesthesia and oral paracetamol. Parecoxib 40 mg 
      was administered prior to discharge, and participants were instructed to take the 
      paracetamol six hours post-regional anaesthesia. Rescue analgesia was also provided. 
      Following implementation of the protocol in a single clinical site, low levels of 
      pain were reported in the audited patient cohort and confirmed in the qualitatively 
      explored experiences of nine participants. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study 
      were encouraging, in that post vitreo-retinal day surgery pain appeared to have been 
      successfully self-managed with a multimodal and pre-emptive protocol. The protocol 
      was flexible and sensitive to patient comorbidities, surgical complexity, previous 
      experiences and medical preferences. Further research is required to consolidate the 
      success of this protocol to effectively support patients' self-care pain management 
      and provide capacity to generalise the findings. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: 
      Knowledge developed through this clinically based research has the potential for 
      informing future patient care across many sites where day surgery is an integral 
      component of treatment for people with vitreo-retinal disease.

TI  - Patient characteristics and surgery-related factors associated with patient-reported 
      recovery at 1 and 6 months after colorectal cancer surgery.
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12715 [doi]
AB  - Predictors for postoperative recovery after colorectal cancer surgery are usually 
      investigated in relation to length of stay (LoS), readmission, or 30-day morbidity. 
      This study describes patient characteristics and surgery-related factors associated 
      with patient-reported recovery 1 and 6 months after surgery. In total, 153 
      consecutively included patients who were recovering from colorectal cancer surgery 
      reported their level of recovery using the Postoperative Recovery Profile. Multiple 
      logistic regression analysis was used to calculate associations with recovery, 
      defined as good or poor, divided into five recovery dimensions: physical symptoms, 
      physical functions, psychological, social and activity. Better preoperative health 
      predicted good recovery regarding three dimensions 1 month after surgery. Regarding 
      all dimensions 1 month after surgery, poor recovery was predicted by a poor recovery 
      on the day of discharge within corresponding dimensions. Higher age was associated 
      with good recovery 6 months after surgery, while chemotherapy showed negative 
      associations. Overall, a majority of factors had a negative impact on recovery, but 
      without any obvious relation to one specific dimension or point in time. Those 
      factors were: high Body Mass Index, comorbidity, abdominoperineal resection, loop 
      ileostomy, colostomy and LoS. This study illustrates the complexity of postoperative 
      recovery and a need for individualised follow-up strategies.

AB  - Utilization and perceived benefits of hospice may vary across populations. In a 
      population-based survey, we examined the prevalence of hospice utilization, 
      caregiver sociodemographic characteristics, and quality and complexity of 
      end-of-life (EOL) care, as reported by community caregivers to people who died in 
      the prior year. The 2009 to 2010 Allegheny County, PA Behavioral Risk Factor 
      Surveillance System Health Survey, a population-based telephone survey of 5442 adult 
      residents, included an 8-item EOL caregiver module. Overall, 7.8% (95% confidence 
      interval = 7.0-8.6) of respondents reported having arranged or provided care for a 
      close friend/family member who died in the previous 12 months. Caregivers of 
      decedents who utilized hospice reported positive quality outcomes and greater 
      involvement in care. Utilization of hospice services was associated with beneficial 
      outcomes at EOL, but with increased involvement of EOL caregivers.

TI  - Nursing care complexity in a psychiatric setting: results of an observational study.
PG  - 79-86
LID - 10.1111/jpm.12049 [doi]
AB  - For nurses working in mental health service settings, it is a priority to perform 
      patient assessments to identify patients' general and behavioural risks and nursing 
      care complexity using objective criteria, to meet the demand for care and to improve 
      the quality of service by reducing health threat conditions to the patients' selves 
      or to others (adverse events). This study highlights that there is a relationship 
      between the complexity of psychiatric patient care, which was assigned a numerical 
      value after the nursing assessment, and the occurrence of psychiatric adverse events 
      in the recent histories of the patients. The results suggest that nursing 
      supervision should be enhanced for patients with high care complexity scores.

AB  - The current study investigated biopsychosocial resilience in an older adult 
      caregiver. A case study was selected for in-depth exploration of resilience in 
      caregiving identified through biopsychosocial (i.e., salivary cortisol) methods. An 
      exemplar of a woman caring for an adult child dying from a genetic disease is 
      presented in the context of multiple stressors. Significant stress was found to be 
      buffered by cognitive reframing and acceptance of interpersonal limits. Early 
      experiences in caregiving for others with terminal illnesses provided a frame of 
      reference, and difficult family dynamics added a layer of complexity. During periods 
      identified as stressful, cortisol levels rose outside of normal bounds. The study 
      implications are that mixed-methods (i.e., biopsychosocial) studies yield important 
      results on individual differences within similar contexts.

TI  - Detection and management of the deteriorating ward patient: an evaluation of nursing 
      practice.
PG  - 173-82
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12655 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To audit ward nursing practice in the adherence to an early 
      warning scoring protocol in the detection and initial management of the 
      deteriorating ward patient and investigate factors that may impact on practice. 
      BACKGROUND: Hospital inpatients can experience unexpected physiological 
      deterioration leading to poor outcomes and death. Although deterioration can be 
      signalled in the patients' physiological symptoms, evidence suggests that ward staff 
      can miss, misinterpret or mismanage the signs. Rapid response systems have been 
      implemented to address this problem. The rapid response systems consists of two 
      phases: the afferent phase involves monitoring the patient, recognising 
      deterioration and referring to more expert help and the efferent phase involves 
      expert teams assessing and treating the patient. Research has tended to concentrate 
      on the efferent phase of the process and has so far failed to show a significant 
      impact on patient outcome. METHODS: Using cardiac arrest as a surrogate marker for 
      deterioration, patient records were retrospectively reviewed during the 12 hours 
      prior to the cardiac arrest event. Data relating to nursing practice and adherence 
      to the early warning scoring protocol were extracted and analysed. FINDINGS: The 
      findings suggest that ward nurses' monitoring of patients' observations has improved 
      compared with earlier research, but errors in early warning scoring and nonadherence 
      to referral protocols are still a problem. A number of potentially influential 
      factors on nursing practice were tested, but only deterioration occurring outside 
      normal weekdays was associated with a reduced quality of nursing adherence to 
      protocol. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of rapid response systems may have been an 
      oversimplified solution to the highly complex problem of undetected patient 
      deterioration. There are a multitude of contributory factors to the problem of 
      noncompliance to early warning scoring protocols, and possible solutions will need 
      to reflect the breadth, depth and complexity of the problem if we are to improve 
      patient experience and outcome. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: An audit of nursing 
      practice against an early warning scoring protocol based on national recommendations 
      and standards in the recording of and response to physiological deterioration in the 
      ward patient has shown that vital signs recording has improved, but early warning 
      scoring accuracy and referral to more expert help remain suboptimal. By identifying 
      areas of suboptimal practice, strategies for education and training and service 
      development can be better informed. More in-depth evidence on factors that may 
      impact the quality of nursing practice has been identified. Problems with rapid 
      response systems assumptions have been highlighted, which may facilitate the 
      implementation of more realistic solutions for managing the deteriorating ward 
      patient.

TI  - Prevalence and Related Factors of Ineffective Self-Health Management in 
      Polymedicated Patients Over the Age of 65 Years.
PG  - 133-142
LID - 10.1111/2047-3095.12155 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Ineffective Self-Health Management (ISHM) 
      (00078) and its related factors in polymedicated patients over the age of 65 years. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. A home interview was 
      conducted with each participant (N = 375) for data collection. FINDINGS: The 
      prevalence of ISHM was 37.3%. The risk factors associated were social risk, 
      depression, noncompliance, medication errors, and confusion with medications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among polymedicated elderly patients, the prevalence of ISHM is high. 
      The diagnosis is closely connected to the compliance and complexity of the treatment 
      regimen, in addition to those relating strictly to social and emotional factors. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Nursing methodology encompasses instruments that allow nurses in 
      clinical practice to evaluate the issue of compliance.

TI  - A population-based care transition model for chronically ill elders.
PG  - 109-16, 141; quiz 117
AB  - Elders with chronic illness are hospitalized more often than those without major 
      chronic disease, and nearly one-fifth of hospitalizations result in re-admission 
      within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. Care transition management programs 
      address chronic disease complexity to reduce unnecessary hospitalization, improve 
      quality of care, and reduce medical expense. This report describes how informatics 
      influenced the transformation of a regional managed care organization from one 
      focused on specific chronic disease prevalence to one targeting population-specific 
      chronic conditions based on complexity. The key implication of these results is that 
      population-based informatics can amplify the impact of programs designed to improve 
      quality and prevent avoidable admissions and, at the same time, speed the rate of 
      translation of evidence-based interventions to entire populations. This approach 
      demonstrated an effective, efficient way to translate evidence-based research to the 
      Medicare population, smoothing the transition back into the community, and 
      preventing avoidable hospital admissions.

TI  - Medication management for nurses working in long-term care.
PG  - 128-49
AB  - In long-term care (LTC), the complexity of residents' conditions and their treatment 
      requirements present challenges for nurses managing medications. The purpose of this 
      qualitative descriptive study was to explore medication management as described by 
      licensed nurses working in LTC. A total of 22 licensed nurses from 2 LTC facilities 
      located in the Canadian province of Ontario participated in 4 focus groups. Thematic 
      content analysis was used to organize data into themes and a conceptual model was 
      developed. The overarching theme was that nurses are "racing against time" to manage 
      medications and 3 subthemes described how they coped with this important care 
      process: preparing to race, running the race, and finishing the race. Barriers to 
      safe medication management included time restraints, knowledge limitations, 
      interruptions and distractions, and poor communication. The findings can be used to 
      better inform health-care providers and to guide future research. They also have the 
      potential to directly impact outcomes related to safe medication management in LTC.

TI  - Sleep, mood, and quality of life in patients receiving treatment for lung cancer.
PG  - 441-51
LID - 10.1188/13.ONF.441-451 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To distinguish relationships among subjective and objective 
      characteristics of sleep, mood, and quality of life (QOL) in patients receiving 
      treatment for lung cancer. DESIGN: Descriptive, correlational study. SETTING: Two 
      ambulatory oncology clinics. SAMPLE: 35 patients with lung cancer. METHODS: The 
      following instruments were used to measure the variables of interest: Pittsburgh 
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional 
      Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Lung (FACT-L), a sleep diary, and a motionlogger 
      actigraph. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Sleep, mood, and QOL. FINDINGS: Significant 
      differences were found between sleep diary and actigraph measures of sleep 
      efficiency (p = 0.002), sleep latency (p = 0.014), sleep duration (p < 0.001), and 
      wake after sleep onset (p < 0.001). Poor sleepers (PSQI score greater than 5) were 
      significantly different from good sleepers (PSQI score of 5 or lower) on sleep diary 
      measures of sleep efficiency and sleep latency and the FACT-L lung cancer symptom 
      subscale, but not on mood or actigraphy sleep measures. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      patients with lung cancer may report an overall acceptable sleep quality when 
      assessed by a single question, those same patients may still have markedly increased 
      sleep latencies or reduced total sleep time. The findings indicate the complexity of 
      sleep disturbances in patients with lung cancer. Lung cancer symptoms had a stronger 
      association with sleep than mood. Research using prospective methods will help to 
      elucidate their clinical significance. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Patients receiving 
      treatment for lung cancer are at an increased risk for sleep disturbances and would 
      benefit from routine sleep assessment and management. In addition, assessment and 
      management of common symptoms may improve sleep and, ultimately, QOL. KNOWLEDGE 
      TRANSLATION: A high frequency of sleep disturbances in patients receiving treatment 
      for lung cancer was evident, and poor sleepers had lower QOL. Sleep disturbances may 
      be more related to lung cancer symptoms than anxiety or depression. Improving lung 
      cancer symptoms such as dyspnea may improve sleep.

TI  - CE: critical care recovery center: an innovative collaborative care model for ICU 
      survivors.
PG  - 24-31; quiz 34, 46

AB  - Five million Americans require admission to ICUs annually owing to life-threatening 
      illnesses. Recent medical advances have resulted in higher survival rates for 
      critically ill patients, who often have significant cognitive, physical, and 
      psychological sequelae, known as postintensive care syndrome (PICS). This growing 
      population threatens to overwhelm the current U.S. health care system, which lacks 
      established clinical models for managing their care. Novel innovative models are 
      urgently needed. To this end, the pulmonary/critical care and geriatrics divisions 
      at the Indiana University School of Medicine joined forces to develop and implement 
      a collaborative care model, the Critical Care Recovery Center (CCRC). Its mission is 
      to maximize the cognitive, physical, and psychological recovery of ICU survivors. 
      Developed around the principles of implementation and complexity science, the CCRC 
      opened in 2011 as a clinical center with a secondary research focus. Care is 
      provided through a pre-CCRC patient and caregiver needs assessment, an initial 
      diagnostic workup visit, and a follow-up visit that includes a family conference. 
      With its sole focus on the prevention and treatment of PICS, the CCRC represents an 
      innovative prototype aimed at modifying post-critical illness morbidities and 
      improving the ICU survivor's quality of life.

TI  - Hospital readmission: Older married male patients' experiences of life conditions 
      and critical incidents affecting the course of care, a qualitative study.
PG  - 1379-1389
LID - 10.1111/scs.12583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the frequency of hospital readmissions, there is still a 
      relatively incomplete understanding of the broader array of factors pertaining to 
      readmission in older persons. Few studies have explored how older persons experience 
      readmission and their perceptions of circumstances affecting the course of care. 
      Research indicates that males experience poorer health outcomes and are at higher 
      risk of readmission compared to women. AIM: To explore life conditions and critical 
      incidents pertained to hospital readmission from the perspective of older males. 
      METHODS: The study used a qualitative explorative design using the Critical Incident 
      Technique. A purposive sample of four males aged 65-75 were recruited from two 
      internal medical wards. Data were collected through narrative double interviews. The 
      study was registered by the North Denmark Region's joint notification of health 
      research (ID 2008-58-0028). FINDINGS: The analysis revealed four themes of life 
      conditions: 'Ambiguity of ageing', 'Living with the burden of illness', 'Realisation 
      of dependency' and 'Growing sense of vulnerability and mortality'. Critical 
      incidents comprised four areas: 'Balancing demands and resources in everyday life', 
      'Back home again - a period of recovery', 'Care interaction' and 'Navigating within 
      and between healthcare system(s)'. CONCLUSION: This study illustrated the 
      interconnectedness, dynamics and complexity of life conditions and critical 
      incidents that over time and across diverse healthcare sectors affected the course 
      of care in older persons. Hospital readmissions seem related to a complex web of 
      interacting life conditions and critical incidents rather than growing age or 
      specific illnesses.

TI  - Living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The stories of frequent attenders 
      to the Emergency Department.
PG  - 48-56
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13842 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD) amongst individuals who have a high frequency of presentations to the 
      Emergency Department and their carers. BACKGROUND: Patients with COPD are amongst 
      the most frequent attenders in the Emergency Department despite the chronic nature 
      of their condition. Good self-management has previously been identified as a key to 
      maintaining health and reducing COPD exacerbations. There has been limited 
      investigation of those with COPD who frequently attend the Emergency Department. 
      DESIGN: Descriptive qualitative phase of a mixed methods study. METHODS: Individuals 
      who had attended an Emergency Department within a single health district at least 
      three times in the previous year for COPD were invited to participate in 
      semistructured face-to-face interviews. A total of 19 individuals consented to 
      participate, of whom 12 were male. Half of the interviews included both those with 
      COPD and carers. Data were audio-recorded and transcribed, before being analysed 
      using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five main themes emerged from the data, namely (i) 
      a sense of grief, loss and guilt, yet hope for the future; (ii) the impact on 
      carers; (iii) the end point of self-management; (iv) the healthcare experience; and 
      (v) the primary care experience. CONCLUSION: The experience of individuals with COPD 
      who frequently present to the Emergency Department and their carers highlights the 
      complexity of living with this disease. Providing effective intervention to manage 
      exacerbation requires an understanding of the issues that are faced by patients and 
      their carers. Clear systems and skills for sharing information are essential to 
      decrease avoidable use of the Emergency Department.

TI  - Social provision and loneliness among older people suffering from chronic physical 
      illness. A mixed-methods approach.
PG  - 104-11
LID - 10.1111/scs.12041 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To describe and compare the perceived social provision for a group reporting 
      never feeling lonely with that of a group reporting feeling lonely and to explore 
      the meaning of loneliness. SUBJECTS: Participants (N = 101) were recruited from 
      geriatric wards. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 65 years or more, the 
      absence of dementia, one or more chronic physical disorders and plans to be 
      discharged from the hospital to their home. The mean age was 81.3 years (range: 
      65-96 years), 68% were women, and 66% lived alone. MEASURES: Assessments of social 
      provisions and loneliness were collected by a subjective report using the Social 
      Provision Scale (SPS), and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
      was used to assess depression. The participants were also asked whether they felt 
      lonely and were then asked to describe the meaning of loneliness if they had 
      indicated feeling lonely. Narratives were then condensed by the participants into 
      short sentences. RESULTS: Seventy-five per cent of the participants reported feeling 
      lonely, of these 54% were living alone, and 18% identified with depression. Three 
      subscales of SPS scores were significantly lower in the lonely group: attachment (p 
      < 0.001), a sense of reliable alliance (p = 0.001) and the obtaining of guidance (p 
      = 0.01). The overall view of the experience of loneliness was dominated by emptiness 
      and negative emotions. The following themes were identified: Emotions were dominated 
      by sadness, anxiety and restlessness, anger and guilt. Relationships were dominated 
      by being left alone, being confined and feeling useless. Existential dimensions were 
      characterised by emptiness, endless boredom, isolation and the potential for change. 
      CONCLUSION: The study shows that loneliness is prevalent among older people 
      suffering from chronic physical illness and confirms the complexity of the concept. 
      A mixed-methods design contributed to nuanced and detailed information about the 
      meaning of loneliness.

TI  - Sibling cooperative and externalizing behaviors in families raising children with 
      disabilities.
PG  - 235-42
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0000000000000046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Raising a child with a disability (CWD) in the home is increasing across 
      the globe. Because of caregiver burden and the complexity of care, there is growing 
      concern for typically developing sibling (TDS) outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the 
      study was to examine whether caregiver burden, parenting style, and sibling 
      relationships in families raising a CWD are associated with cooperative and 
      externalizing behaviors in TDS. METHODS: This correlational study included 189 
      families raising both a CWD and a TDS. Multilevel modeling was used to identify 
      which variables were most predictive of TDS outcomes and if there were parent gender 
      effects. RESULTS: Authoritative parenting was positively associated with cooperative 
      behaviors. Authoritarian parenting was positively associated with externalizing 
      behaviors. Multilevel modeling revealed caregiver burden was a significant predictor 
      of sibling behaviors in the first model. When parenting style was added as a 
      predictor, it was also significant. When sibling relationships were added as 
      predictors, they were significant predictors for both cooperative and externalizing 
      TDS behaviors; however, caregiver burden was no longer significant. Authoritarian 
      parenting significantly predicted externalizing behaviors, and authoritative 
      parenting was significantly related to cooperative behaviors. DISCUSSION: In 
      families raising a CWD, positive sibling relationships may help negate the effects 
      of caregiver burden and are more predictive of TDS outcomes than some parenting 
      practices.

TI  - Early and Intermediate Hospital-to-Home Transition Outcomes of Older Adults 
      Diagnosed With Diabetes.
PG  - 72-86
LID - 10.1177/0145721715620020 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting early and 
      intermediate hospital-to home transition outcomes of older adults with preexisting 
      diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used. A sample of 96 
      hospitalized older adults with a prior diagnosis of diabetes were recruited within 4 
      hours of discharge. Data reflective of general health status, diabetes status, 
      perceived discharge readiness (Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale), 
      hospitalization, and anticipated postdischarge support were gathered upon 
      enrollment. Transition outcome data including unplanned care encounter occurrences, 
      perceived transition quality (Care Transition Measure-15), and postdischarge 
      difficulty (scale and free responses to the Post-Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale 
      [PDCDS]) were obtained by telephone interview 7 and 30 days after discharge. Three 
      unique, dichotomous variables were created from recurrent subthemes that emerged 
      during content analysis of free-response data and were used in statistical testing. 
      Binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictive factors for an 
      unplanned care encounter within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS: Multimorbidity was 
      prevalent in participants. Difficulties managing medications, blood glucose, and 
      chronic illnesses other than diabetes were common problems. Higher PDCDS scores 7 
      and 30 days following discharge and difficulty managing a nondiabetes chronic health 
      problem were predictive of an unplanned care encounter within 30 days of discharge. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity complicates home recovery of older adults with diabetes. 
      Diabetes adds complexity to hospital-to-home care transitions. Transition 
      difficulties predict higher risk for an unplanned care encounter. More intensive 
      follow-up of older adults with diabetes during the first month following discharge 
      is recommended.

TI  - Motives that head and neck cancer patients have for contacting a specialist nurse - 
      an empirical study.
PG  - 3160-3166
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13283 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to systematically explore the 
      motives for patients with head and neck cancer to contact a specialist nurse during 
      two years postdiagnosis. BACKGROUND: Research focusing on the role of specialist 
      nurses in cancer care almost exclusively concern cancers other than head and neck 
      cancer. DESIGN: Qualitative, descriptive study based on the contacts between 
      patients with head and neck cancer and a specialist nurse. METHODS: Patients were 
      invited to contact a specialist nurse by telephone. The specialist nurse took 
      systematic field notes, that is, she registered who contacted her, the nature of the 
      call and the outcome. Sixty patients were included. RESULTS: In descending order, 
      the motives for contact were questions about practical and uncomplicated matters, 
      consultations about medical troubles/worries, presenting a report of the patient's 
      situation, requests for additional information about the treatment plan and requests 
      for medical information. The pattern of the patients' motivations for calling was 
      not related to medical or social factors, suggesting that the initiative to make 
      contact is very much a question of the complexity of individual life circumstances. 
      Very few referrals were sent from the specialist nurse to other professionals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The specialist nurse turned out to be more than just a coordinator of 
      health-care resources. The findings bring up questions about the potential of the 
      nurse's function as a coordinator, but also as a potential attachment figure, and 
      questions about the nurse's relationships to other professionals. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: When implementing a specialist nurse function, it is important to 
      decide whether the function should be inspired by a broader relational perspective. 
      In addition to the indispensible competence and experience in the clinical field of 
      head and neck cancer, training in counselling and acquaintance with 
      object-relational psychology will then be desirable.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was exploring the experience of male caregivers 
      living with a partner with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN AND METHODS: A 
      qualitative study was conducted following a grounded theory approach. Twenty-four 
      men-husbands or partners of a woman diagnosed with MS-were interviewed in-depth. A 
      thematic analysis was carried out and involved line-by-line coding with codes 
      deriving from narratives. FINDINGS: Five major themes emerged: caregiving as a 
      full-time job; changes in the couple; the importance of social support and social 
      life; gender specificities; and fear of the future. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight 
      the complexity of issues surrounding this specific form of caregiving. Social 
      expectations referring to the marital relationship and to gender norms play a 
      central role. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings can help in developing ad hoc 
      interventions to support male spousal caregivers to care for their partners.

TI  - Clinical and psychological characteristics predict future healthcare use in adults 
      with congenital heart disease.
PG  - 72-81

AB  - BACKGROUND: To deliver adequate care to patients with congenital heart disease 
      (CHD), it is important to know which patients use what type of care. This knowledge 
      is valuable, as modification of these factors may be used as means to regulate 
      healthcare use. Our objective was to examine the predictive value of psychological 
      characteristics for future healthcare use, independent of clinical characteristics. 
      METHODS: In total 845 adult CHD-patients participated in a longitudinal 
      questionnaire study, with a two-year follow-up period. Linear regression analyses 
      with negative binomial log link function were performed predicting healthcare used 
      during the previous year. Psychological predictors were Type D personality, quality 
      of life (QoL), depressive symptoms, trait-anxiety, happiness, optimism, and illness 
      perceptions, independent of the number of co-morbidities, disease complexity and 
      functional status. To control for clustering we included the variable type of centre 
      (regional versus tertiary referral). RESULTS: Patients who reported more healthcare 
      use had a complex defect, a poor functional status, no Type D personality, and a 
      poor QoL. They moreover felt their CHD had a severe impact on their life and 
      believed their CHD could be managed by themselves or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Healthcare use is not entirely determined by disease complexity and functional 
      status but also by psychological patient characteristics. It can by hypothesised 
      that reducing the negative impact experienced and informing patients about 
      strategies to manage their CHD, will modify their future healthcare use. Additional 
      research is necessary to examine this possibility.

TI  - Psychometric testing of the clinical nurse leader staff satisfaction instrument.
PG  - 302-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient care is changing rapidly with increased complexity 
      of care, patient volumes, and financial constraints with rising health care costs 
      and limited reimbursements. In response, the clinical nurse leader (CNL) role was 
      developed. No appropriate instrument exists to measure staff satisfaction with the 
      CNL role. This study describes the development and testing of an instrument designed 
      to measure staff satisfaction with implementation of the CNL role. METHODS: The 
      psychometric properties and factor structure of the Clinical Nurse Leader Staff 
      Satisfaction (CNLSS) instrument was examined. RESULTS: A 2-factor solution was 
      discovered for the CNLSS. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were acceptable for the 
      subscales and instrument. CONCLUSION: The CNLSS is a valid and reliable instrument. 
      Future research should focus on establishing test-retest reliability and construct 
      validity.

TI  - Nursing Diagnoses as Predictors of Hospital Length of Stay: A Prospective 
      Observational Study.
PG  - 96-105
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12444 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether the number of nursing diagnoses on hospital 
      admission is an independent predictor of the hospital length of stay. DESIGN: A 
      prospective observational study was carried out. A sample of 2,190 patients 
      consecutively admitted (from July to December 2014) in four inpatient units (two 
      medical, two surgical) of a 1,547-bed university hospital were enrolled for the 
      study. METHODS: Data were collected from a clinical nursing information system and 
      the hospital discharge register. Two regression analyses were performed to 
      investigate if the number of nursing diagnoses on hospital admission was an 
      independent predictor of length of stay and length of stay deviation after 
      controlling for patients' sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender), clinical 
      variables (disease groupers, disease severity morbidity indexes), and organizational 
      hospital variables (admitting inpatient unit, modality of admission). FINDINGS: The 
      number of nursing diagnoses was shown to be an independent predictor of both the 
      length of stay (β = .15; p < .001) and the length of stay deviation (β = .19; p < 
      .001). CONCLUSIONS: The number of nursing diagnoses is a strong independent 
      predictor of an effective hospital length of stay and of a length of stay longer 
      than expected. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The systematic inclusion of standard nursing care 
      data in electronic health records can improve the predictive ability on hospital 
      outcomes and describe the patient complexity more comprehensively, improving 
      hospital management efficiency.

PG  - 348-58; quiz 359-61
LID - 10.1016/j.aorn.2011.04.025 [doi]
AB  - Transitions between care settings are periods of vulnerability for patients. This is 
      especially true for older adults, for whom comorbidities and functional impairments 
      can increase the complexity of care and the need for multiple caregivers can 
      compromise safety. Poor care transitions can result in costly hospital admissions. 
      For this reason, leading health care organizations have initiated programs to 
      improve the quality of transitions; however, to date, the ambulatory surgical 
      setting has not been a focus of these initiatives. The ambulatory setting serves an 
      increasingly complex patient population and provides the majority of elective 
      surgeries, and adapting some of the transition tools that have been tested in other 
      settings will benefit health care providers and patients in the ambulatory setting. 
      Identifying periods of transition and risk, implementing electronic health records 
      across all phases of patient care, and using evidence-based tools at each 
      transitional stage can optimize the quality and safety of patient care.

TI  - Orchestrating care: nursing practice with hospitalised older adults.
PG  - 252-62
LID - 10.1111/opn.12075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased incidence of health challenges with aging means that 
      nurses are increasingly caring for older adults, often in hospital settings. 
      Research about the complexity of nursing practice with this population remains 
      limited. OBJECTIVE: To seek an explanation of nursing practice with hospitalised 
      older adults. METHODS: Design. A grounded theory study guided by symbolic 
      interactionism was used to explore nursing practice with hospitalised older adults 
      from a nursing perspective. Glaserian grounded theory methods were used to develop a 
      mid-range theory after analysis of 375 hours of participant observation, 35 
      interviews with 24 participants and review of selected documents. RESULTS: The 
      theory of orchestrating care was developed to explain how nurses are continuously 
      trying to manage their work environments by understanding the status of the 
      patients, their unit, mobilising the assistance of others and stretching available 
      resources to resolve their problem of providing their older patients with what they 
      perceived as 'good care' while sustaining themselves as 'good' nurses. They 
      described their practice environments as hard and under-resourced. Orchestrating 
      care is comprised of two subprocesses: building synergy and minimising strain. These 
      two processes both facilitated and constrained each other and nurses' abilities to 
      orchestrate care. CONCLUSIONS: Although system issues presented serious constraints 
      to nursing practice, the ways in which nurses were making meaning of their work 
      environment both aided them in managing their challenges and constrained their 
      agency. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses need to be encouraged to share their 
      important perspective about older adult care. Administrators have a role to play in 
      giving nurses voice in workplace committees and in forums. Further research is 
      needed to better understand how multidisciplinary teams influence care of 
      hospitalized older adults.

PG  - 25-9
LID - 10.7748/nop.28.5.25.s25 [doi]
AB  - This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the 
      use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA 
      is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and 
      mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues 
      that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable 
      individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the 
      case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a 
      number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding 
      needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental 
      health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a 
      better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant 
      transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the 
      provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.

AB  - We explored perceptions of HIV-related stigma using a qualitative approach based on 
      the findings of in-depth e-mail asynchronous interviews with 37 self-identified 
      Portuguese men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV infection and undetectable viral 
      loads. Participants were asked to answer an online interview. Major findings 
      concerned external perceptions of HIV-related stigma, HIV status disclosure, the 
      impact of HIV on everyday life, the presence of double discrimination, and general 
      perceptions of HIV-related stigma. Results revealed (a) stigmatizing and 
      discriminatory behaviors and practices in psychosocial and inter-relational events, 
      but not in accessing and receiving health care; (b) double exposure to stigma 
      associated with being gay and having HIV; and (c) undetectability as an autonomous 
      identity with important connections to social and interpersonal interactions. An 
      important implication was related to multilevel risk perceptions and the 
      psychosocial complexity and challenges of HIV infection. In Portugal, HIV is still a 
      socially disabling disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health care professionals may assume questionnaires are burdensome to 
      patients, and this limits their use in clinical settings and promotes 
      simplification. However, patient adherence may improve by optimizing questionnaire 
      attributes and contexts. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used Contingent 
      Valuation methods to directly elicit patient preference for conventional monitoring 
      of symptoms, versus adding a tool to monitoring. Under explicit consideration was 
      the 10-question Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). In the questionnaire, 
      attributes of ESAS were sequentially altered to try and force preference reversal. A 
      separate group of participants completed both questionnaire and interviews to 
      explore questionnaire reliability, and extend validity. RESULTS: Overall, 24 of 43 
      participants preferred using ESAS. Most important attributes to preference were 
      frequency, specificity, and complexity. Where preference is initially against ESAS, 
      it may reverse by simplifying the tool and its administrative processes. Interviews 
      in 10 additional participants supported reproducibility and validity of the 
      questionnaire method. CONCLUSIONS: Preference for using tools increases when tools 
      are made relevant and used more appropriately. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Questionnaires 
      completed by patients as screening tools or aids to communication may be 
      under-utilized. Optimization of ESAS and similar tools may be guided by empirical 
      findings, including those obtained from Contingent Valuation methodologies.

TI  - Understanding the reasons why patients delay seeking treatment for oral cancer 
      symptoms from a primary health care professional: an integrative literature review.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejon.2013.07.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this integrative literature review was to investigate 
      existing research on the reasons why patients delay in seeking treatment for oral 
      cancer symptoms from a primary health care professional. METHOD: The systematic 
      approach developed by Cooper (1984) was the guiding framework for this integrative 
      review. Cooper (1984) identifies the process of conducting an integrative review as 
      encompassing the following five stages: (a) problem formulation, (b) data 
      collection, (c) evaluation of data points, (d) data analysis and interpretation, and 
      (e) public presentation of results. RESULTS: Despite different research designs 
      employed and sample sizes ranging from 15 to 559, three major themes emerged from 
      the 16 studies included in the review, all of which are directly related to the 
      reasons why people delay seeking treatment for oral cancer symptoms: Patient 
      Sociodemographic Characteristics; Health Related Behaviours, and Psychosocial 
      Factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this integrative review demonstrates the complexity 
      surrounding the reasons why patients delay in seeking help for oral cancer 
      treatment. The association between knowledge and patient delay has implications for 
      information provision about cancer to those at risk of developing the disease. The 
      relationship between socioeconomic status and patient delay behaviour warrants 
      further investigation as this has been shown to be an influential factor in the 
      study of patient delay. The meaning of many of the investigated psychosocial factors 
      (e.g. an individuals' symptom interpretation/attribution, disclosure of symptoms to 
      significant others, social priorities), have not been discussed in detail and the 
      research is not theory driven.

TI  - Caring nurse practice in the intrapartum setting: nurses' perspectives on 
      complexity, relationships and safety.
PG  - 2019-2030
LID - 10.1111/jan.12356 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This article reports on a qualitative study of nurse perceptions of caring 
      nurse practice in the complex adaptive system of health care. BACKGROUND: Caring 
      nurse practice encompasses technical skills and caring behaviours. Maternity care in 
      the USA has seen worsening maternal and neonatal outcomes and safety has become a 
      priority. As a result, hospital systems have begun efforts to improve outcomes, 
      initiating safety and quality programmes that standardize care and implementing 
      nursing frameworks that enhance relationships. DESIGN: Qualitative hermeneutic 
      phenomenology. METHODS: A qualitative design analysed 13 nurses' perspectives on 
      caring practice during the second stage of labour. In June and July of 2012, 
      interviews were conducted with 13 labour and delivery nurses located in a hospital 
      that had adopted a perinatal safety initiative and relationship-focused nursing 
      model. The nurses described caring nurse practice and the factors that affected its 
      provision. Transcripts of audio recordings and notes taken during interviews were 
      analysed for themes and fundamental meanings. FINDINGS: Nurses' perspectives about 
      the provision of caring nurse practice was affected by the complexity of the 
      healthcare system, interactions with team members, challenges related to 
      documentation; and respect for natural birth. CONCLUSION: Nurses at all levels of 
      practice can use these perspectives to identify patterns in the complex adaptive 
      healthcare system to improve quality and safety. Best practices include enhancing 
      teamwork, implementing safety initiatives and promoting a Relationship-Based 
      framework. Continued study of caring nurse practice could lead to establishment of 
      additional safety and quality protocols vital to improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Factors related to falls, weight-loss and pressure ulcers--more insight in risk 
      assessment among nursing home residents.
PG  - 940-50
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13154 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe how the included items in three different scales, 
      Downton Fall Risk Index, the short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment and the 
      Modified Norton Scale are associated to severe outcomes as falls, weight loss and 
      pressure ulcers. BACKGROUND: Falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are common 
      adverse events among nursing home residents and risk scoring are common preventive 
      activities, mainly focusing on single risks. In Sweden the three scales are 
      routinely used together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention. 
      DESIGN: Longitudinal quantitative study. METHODS: Descriptive analyses and Cox 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: Only 4% scored no risk for any of these serious 
      events. Longitudinal risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating 
      increased risks. This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general 
      condition. There were no statistical significant differences between residents 
      categorised at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but 
      decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of 
      general health were most important. CONCLUSIONS: Risk tendencies for falls, 
      malnutrition and pressure ulcers are high in nursing homes, and when measure them at 
      the same time the majority will have several of these risks. Items assessing 
      mobility or items affecting mobility were of most importance. Care processes can 
      always be improved and this study can add to the topic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: A more comprehensive view is needed and prevention can not only be based 
      on total scores. Mobility is an important factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both 
      as a risk factor and a protective factor. This involves a challenge for care--to 
      keep the inmates physical active and at the same time prevent falls.

TI  - Towards a better understanding of readmissions after stroke: partnering with stroke 
      survivors and caregivers.
PG  - 1091-100
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12739 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of readmission from the perspective 
      of the stroke survivor and family caregiver. BACKGROUND: Older stroke survivors are 
      at an increased risk for readmission with approximately 40% being readmitted in the 
      first year after stroke. Patients and their families are best positioned to provide 
      information about factors associated with readmission, yet their perspectives have 
      rarely been elicited. DESIGN: Descriptive qualitative study. METHODS: This study 
      included older stroke survivors who were readmitted to acute care from home in the 
      six months following stroke, and their family caregivers. Participants were 
      interviewed by telephone at approximately two weeks after discharge and a sub-set 
      was also interviewed in person during the readmission. Interviews were audio-taped 
      and content analysis was used to identify themes. RESULTS: From the 29 
      semi-structured interviews conducted with 20 stroke survivors and/or their 
      caregivers, the following themes were identified: preparing to go home after the 
      stroke, what to expect at home, complexity of medication management, support for 
      self-care in the community and the influence of social factors. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study provides the critical perspective of the stroke survivor and family caregiver 
      into furthering our understanding of readmissions after stroke. Participants 
      identified several areas for intervention including better discharge preparation and 
      the need for support in the community for medication management and self-care. The 
      findings suggest that interventions designed to reduce readmissions after stroke 
      should be multifaceted in approach and extend across the continuum of care. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The hospital level has been the focus of 
      interventions to reduce preventable readmissions, but the results of this study 
      suggest the importance of community-level care. The individual nature of each 
      situation must be taken into account, including the postdischarge environment and 
      the availability of social support.

      must be delivered to minimize the time spent in the acute care setting. Avoiding 
      costly complications and focusing on health promotion rather than disease management 
      will be key. Geriatrics is a complex patient population and basic nursing care is 
      essential to prevent unnecessary complications if our health care system is to 
      survive. Our profession is ill prepared to optimally care for this patient 
      population.

TI  - Early identification and management of the unstable adult patient in the emergency 
      department.
PG  - 3138-46
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12916 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The focus of this research was to standardise an emergency 
      observation chart, the Adult Emergency Department Flow Chart, which incorporates 
      elements designed to allow clinicians to more readily recognise the trends of 
      patient deterioration. BACKGROUND: Patients present to the Emergency Department with 
      some form of instability. Core skills and principles of Emergency Department care 
      are to rapidly and continually assess the clinical condition of the patient, 
      prioritise their care and treat accordingly. Often, however, deterioration of these 
      patients is missed. The incidence of missed deterioration is set within a background 
      of increasing presentations to Emergency Departments, greater complexity of the 
      patient health status, longer length of stay within the Emergency Department and an 
      ageing population. DESIGN: This quantitative research study comprised a 
      retrospective medical record audit. Only those records containing notes relating to 
      an Emergency Department admission were included. METHODS: An online data collection 
      tool based on the Adult Emergency Department Flow Chart was developed. A total of 
      181 medical records were reviewed: 80 during the pre-implementation audit and 101 
      during the post-implementation audit. RESULTS: The Adult Emergency Department Flow 
      Chart enabled clinicians to better identify deteriorating patients, with a higher 
      number of abnormal vital signs being identified at the post-implementation audit. 
      Identification of pain also dramatically increased at the post-implementation audit. 
      Documentation of notification to Medical Officers also increased, as did 
      documentation of the number of patients receiving medication to help treat the 
      abnormal vital sign. CONCLUSION: The introduction of the Adult Emergency Department 
      Flow Chart facilitated the essential role of nurses in the identification, 
      documentation and monitoring of the unstable or deteriorating patient in the 
      Emergency Department. Further research is required with larger samples to determine 
      the impact of the Adult Emergency Department Flow Chart on the timely management of 
      abnormal vital signs. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The Adult Emergency Flow Chart 
      provides a valuable tool for the early identification and subsequent management of 
      an unstable / deteriorating adult in the emergency department, particularly for 
      clinicians with limited experience.

TI  - Complexities of Medication Management Across Care Transitions: A Case Report.
PG  - E1-7
LID - 10.1097/NUR.0000000000000141 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to identify medication-related 
      considerations for clinical nurse specialist practice by presenting a case report 
      detailing the complexities of medication management, unresolved medication 
      discrepancies, and reconciliation across care transitions. BACKGROUND: Care 
      transitions are a vulnerable time for medication-related problems to occur. 
      Unresolved medication discrepancies can lead to adverse drug events and other poor 
      health outcomes, including hospital readmissions and increased healthcare costs. 
      Reconciling medication discrepancies during care transitions has been identified as 
      a national patient safety goal to prevent medication-related problems. Clinical 
      nurse specialists are uniquely qualified to lead and manage efforts to mitigate 
      these problems during care transitions. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old male 
      patient diagnosed with oral cancer underwent 8 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation 
      treatments. Throughout these 8 weeks, the patient was seen by 4 providers and 
      admitted to the hospital for neutropenia. As a result, a total of 19 new medications 
      were prescribed and 5 medications were discontinued. Medication reconciliation was 
      completed at each visit and at admission and discharge at the hospital. At 
      discharge, the patient's medication regimen was complex, with 38 separate doses of 
      17 different medications per 24-hour period. Understanding and organizing the daily 
      medication regimen were a consistent challenge for the patient during his illness. 
      DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexities of medication regimens and 
      opportunities to improve medication management and reconciliation across care 
      transitions. This case underscores the need for and importance of quality 
      patient-provider communication, assessing and managing medication regimen 
      complexity, evaluating medications against the American Geriatrics Society Beers 
      Criteria, evaluating potential drug-drug or drug-food interactions, and recognizing 
      at-risk behaviors that may lead to medication discrepancies and errors at care 
      transitions. Potential opportunities where clinical nurse specialists could 
      intervene to promote safe and effective medication management across care 
      transitions are presented. CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: Clinical nurse specialists have 
      the unique ability to make key contributions and influence medication management and 
      reconciliation across care transitions to promote medication effectiveness and 
      safety.

TI  - Readiness for and predictors of evidence-based practice of acute-care nurses: a 
      cross-sectional postal survey.
PG  - 572-81
LID - 10.1111/scs.12083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses' adoption of evidence-based practice (EBP) remains limited 
      although most nurses are familiar with EBP and belief in its value for patient care. 
      Efforts to accelerate nurses' EBP activities have met with limited success. 
      Knowledge of predictors of nurses' EBP activities is lacking. AIMS: To describe 
      nurses' readiness for EBP as measured by their information needs, skills in using 
      electronic bibliographical databases (EBDs) and awareness of available EBP-needed 
      resources; EBP beliefs and frequency of EBP activities, and identify predictors of 
      EBP activities and beliefs. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey, distributed 
      to a homogeneous, consecutive sample of 546 acute-care nurses. Response rate was 
      64.3%; responses from direct-care nurses (n = 298) and administrators (n = 45) were 
      analysed. Descriptive statistics were used to describe readiness for EBP, frequency 
      of certain EBP activities and EBP beliefs. Logistic regression analyses were 
      performed to identify predictors of EBP activities and multiple regression analysis 
      to identify predictors of EBP beliefs. RESULTS: The nurses generally seldom 
      participated in the EBP activities studied, in spite of familiarity with and 
      positive beliefs towards EBP. Evidence-based practice beliefs predicted all three 
      activities studied. Skills in using EBDs predicted information-seeking and 
      evaluating research. Awareness of available EBP-needed resources predicted 
      information-seeking, role predicted evaluating research, while familiarity with EBP 
      predicted using research in practice. Six predictors explained nearly 40% of the 
      variance in EBP beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses' EBP activities must be facilitated and 
      accelerated. The findings provide empirical support to the primacy of EBP beliefs in 
      nurses' engagement in EBP and of the complexity of EBP. While the identified 
      predictors of EBP activities and beliefs are susceptible to change, diverse 
      strategies are needed to influence each one. Strategies should focus on influencing 
      EBP beliefs, that is, by increasing skills in using EBDs, discussion about EBP in 
      the clinical environment and familiarity with EBP.

TI  - Exploring motivation and confidence in taking prescribed medicines in coexisting 
      diseases: a qualitative study.
PG  - 471-81
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12171 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the motivation and confidence of people with 
      coexisting diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension to take their 
      medicines as prescribed. BACKGROUND: These comorbidities are major contributors to 
      disease burden globally. Self-management of individuals with these coexisting 
      diseases is much more complicated than that of those with single diseases and is 
      critical for improved health outcomes. DESIGN: Motivational interviewing telephone 
      calls were made with participants with coexisting diabetes, CKD and hypertension. 
      METHODS: Patients aged ≥18 years with diabetes, CKD and systolic hypertension were 
      recruited from outpatient clinics of an Australian metropolitan hospital between 
      2008-2009. An average of four motivational interviewing telephone calls was made 
      with participants (n = 39) in the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial. 
      Data were thematically analysed using the modified Health Belief Model as a 
      framework. RESULTS: Participants' motivation and confidence in taking prescribed 
      medicines was thwarted by complex medicine regimens and medical conditions. 
      Participants wanted control over their health and developed various strategies to 
      confront threats to health. The perceived barriers of taking recommended health 
      action outweighed the benefits of taking medicines as prescribed and were primarily 
      related to copious amounts of medicines. CONCLUSION: Taking multiple prescribed 
      medicines in coexisting diabetes, CKD and hypertension is a perpetual vocation with 
      major psychosocial effects. Participants were overwhelmed by the number of medicines 
      that they were required to take. The quest for personal control of health, fear of 
      the future and the role of stress and gender in chronic disease management have been 
      highlighted. Participants require supportive emotional interventions to self-manage 
      their multiple medicines on a daily basis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Reducing 
      the complexity of medicine regimens in coexisting diseases is paramount. 
      Individualised psychosocial approaches that address the emotional needs of patients 
      with regular follow-up and feedback are necessary for optimal chronic disease 
      self-management.

TI  - Balancing truth-telling: relatives acting as translators for older adult cancer 
      patients of Turkish or northwest African origin in Belgium.
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12498 [doi]
AB  - The first generation of Turkish and Northwest African immigrants in Belgium are 
      ageing and at risk for developing cancer. Relatives play an important role and 
      provide both emotional and practical care, including mental support and acting as a 
      contact person and/or a translator for improving access to healthcare, as most 
      patients and their spouses have only a limited command of the language. Although 
      access to professional interpreters has shown to be the best guarantee for 
      qualitative healthcare, oncology health providers working with relatives as 
      interpreters is much more common than professional interpreters. The aim of this 
      study was to provide insight into the process wherein relatives balance 
      truth-telling in translating for an older family member diagnosed with cancer. This 
      was a qualitative research study, with elements of constructivist grounded theory. 
      Twenty-eight loosely structured interviews were conducted. Most relatives consider 
      it their responsibility to contribute to a positive attitude of the patient. 
      Relatives decided to what extent they inform the patient, based on several motives 
      and embedded in their assessment of the patient's emotional strength, understanding 
      and need to be informed. What they decide influences the way they act as a 
      translator and/or a contact person between the patient and health professional(s). 
      Some considered it best to omit medical information while others considered it best 
      to inform the patient fully. The results emphasise the importance for healthcare 
      providers to take into account the complexity and unpredictable character of the 
      process of balancing truth-telling when family members translate for their ill older 
      relative.

TI  - Dimensions of uncertainty after stroke: perspectives of the stroke survivor and 
      family caregiver.
PG  - 233-40
LID - 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000066 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been limited examination of uncertainty after stroke. The 
      effects of stroke extend beyond the stroke survivor to impact on the family, and 
      thus, an exploration of uncertainty with the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad is 
      important to gain a fuller understanding. METHODS: Stroke survivors and their family 
      caregivers (n = 33) participated in eight focus groups. Transcripts from the focus 
      groups were examined for recurrent themes using content analysis. Mishel's theory of 
      uncertainty was used as a framework to classify the themes. RESULTS: Participants 
      reported uncertainty about (a) future events, in particular, recurrent stroke; (b) 
      signs and symptoms of stroke; (c) stroke risk factor management; and (d) resources 
      for poststroke care. The uncertainty was brought on by the lack of predictability of 
      these future events, lack of information, and the complexity of poststroke care and 
      corresponded to Mishel's four key elements of ambiguity, deficient information, lack 
      of clarity, and unpredictability. CONCLUSIONS: The fear of recurrent stroke was a 
      pervasive theme and may represent a window of opportunity to work actively with 
      stroke survivors in managing their risk factors. Although certain aspects of 
      uncertainty after stroke cannot be eliminated, we can intervene with stroke 
      survivors and family caregivers to assist them in reframing their responses to 
      uncertainty and to foster coping and promote health.

TI  - Using visual displays to communicate risk of cancer to women from diverse 
      race/ethnic backgrounds.
PG  - 327-35
LID - 10.1016/j.pec.2011.11.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated how well women from diverse race/ethnic groups were 
      able to take a quantitative cancer risk statistic verbally provided to them and 
      report it in a visual format. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey was administered in 
      English, Spanish or Chinese, to women aged 50-80 (n=1160), recruited from primary 
      care practices. The survey contained breast, colorectal or cervical cancer questions 
      regarding screening and prevention. Women were told cancer-specific lifetime risk 
      then shown a visual display of risk and asked to indicate the specific lifetime 
      risk. Correct indication of risk was the main outcome. RESULTS: Correct responses on 
      icon arrays were 46% for breast, 55% for colon, and 44% for cervical; only 25% 
      correctly responded to a magnifying glass graphic. Compared to Whites, African 
      American and Latina women were significantly less likely to use the icon arrays 
      correctly. Higher education and higher numeracy were associated with correct 
      responses. Lower education was associated with lower numeracy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Race/ethnic differences were associated with women's ability to take a quantitative 
      cancer risk statistic verbally provided to them and report it in a visual format. 
      PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Systematically considering the complexity of intersecting 
      factors such as race/ethnicity, educational level, poverty, and numeracy in most 
      health communications is needed.

AB  - Back pain consists of a spectrum of conditions, with no common etiology and 
      therefore no dominant method of treatment. The purpose of this study is to describe 
      the complexity of a collection of 8000 back pain patients who appeared in an 
      integrative medicine clinic, as a prelude to conducing comparative effectiveness 
      research on CAM alternatives to conventional therapy. Approximately 23% of all 
      clinic patients were diagnosed at some time with back pain. Nearly half had 
      treatment periods of less than one month, while more than 25% were treated for back 
      pain for more than two years. Women were represented more than twice as often as 
      men. The initial diagnosis categories that occurred most frequently were lumbar 
      symptoms, cervical symptoms, and a general category, with smaller numbers having 
      lumbar anatomic, thoracic symptom, brachial neuritis, or sciatica diagnoses. There 
      were few strong relationships between initial diagnosis pattern and length of back 
      pain treatment period. While 77% of back pain patients presented with diagnoses in 
      only a single category, there were many composite categories each of which was 
      sparsely represented. Between 50% and 75% of patients used some CAM service, 
      depending on their initial diagnosis pattern. Patients with complex initial 
      diagnosis patterns strongly tended to chose CAM, and among CAM-users those with 
      complex diagnoses tended toward chiropractic, as opposed to acupuncture or bodywork. 
      The CAM usage patterns of men and women were highly similar. Again among CAM users, 
      82% used only a single type of CAM service, and multiple service uses tend to be 
      combined at random. Between two-thirds and three-quarters of multiple CAM service 
      users had very simple temporal patterns of use, dominated by use of one type of CAM 
      at a time.

TI  - Nurse managers describe their practice environments.
PG  - 317-25
LID - 10.1097/NAQ.0b013e3182a2f9c3 [doi]
AB  - Hospital work environments that support the professional practice of nurses are 
      critical to patient safety. Nurse managers are responsible for creating these 
      professional practice environments for staff nurses, yet little is known about the 
      environments needed to support nurse managers. Domains of nurse managers' practice 
      environment have recently been defined. This is a secondary analysis of 2 
      cross-sectional studies of organizational characteristics that influence nurse 
      manager practice. Content analysis of the free text comments from 127 nurse managers 
      was used to illustrate the 8 domains of nurse managers' practice environments. Nurse 
      managers valued time spent with their staff; therefore, workloads must permit 
      meaningful interaction. Directors demonstrated trust when they empowered nurse 
      managers to make decisions. Administrative leaders should build patient safety 
      cultures on the basis of shared accountability and mutual respect among the health 
      care team. The expectations of nurse managers have greatly expanded in the volume 
      and complexity of direct reports, patient care areas, and job functions. The nurse 
      managers in this analysis reported characteristics of their practice environments 
      that limit their role effectiveness and may negatively impact organizational 
      performance. Further research is needed to understand the effects of nurse managers' 
      practice environments on staff and patient outcomes.

TI  - Clinical outcomes associated with screening and referral for depression in an acute 
      cardiac ward.
PG  - 2228-34
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03934.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper is to describe the implementation of a depression 
      screening and referral tool in two cardiac wards of a major metropolitan public 
      hospital. The tool consisted of two sections: (1) screening for depression risk 
      (Cardiac Depression Scale-5) and (2) consequential referral actions. BACKGROUND: 
      Prior research has shown that depression in patients with heart disease is 
      associated with significantly impaired quality of life, decreased medication 
      adherence, increased morbidity and increased use of healthcare services. DESIGN: A 
      prospective in-patient study design. METHOD: A consecutive sample of 202 patients 
      admitted to either the cardiac medical (n = 145) or surgical (n = 57) wards of a 
      major Melbourne metropolitan hospital were recruited into the study over an 18-week 
      period. RESULTS: Just over half (54%) of the patients were identified as 'at risk' 
      of depression. Of these, 19% were assessed as moderate risk and 35% high risk. Of 
      those patients, 91% had the risk score documented in their medical history, 90% had 
      engaged in discussions with clinicians regarding their risk score, 85% had their 
      risk score communicated formally to the medical team and 25% were formally referred 
      for appropriate follow-up - significantly more than prior to implementation of the 
      screening and referral tool. CONCLUSIONS: By providing a formalised mechanism for 
      detecting depression, documented screening and referral rates improved for those 
      with comorbid depression and heart disease affording an opportunity for early 
      intervention. These findings support a move towards integrated approaches to 
      screening of depression to become standard practice in the acute cardiac setting. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Such mechanisms also have the potential to initiate 
      the development of new models of care that acknowledge the complexity of comorbid 
      depression and heart disease and provide pathways from speciality to primary care 
      which integrate the physical and psychosocial domains inclusive of screening, 
      referral, systematic monitoring and streamlined behavioural and physical care.

TI  - Feeling safe and motivated to achieve better health: Experiences with a 
      partnership-based nursing practice programme for in-home patients with chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 2755-2764
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13794 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients' 
      experiences with a partnership-based nursing practice programme in the home setting. 
      BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suffer from 
      psychological and physiological problems, especially when they return home after 
      hospitalisation from exacerbation. Many express a need for information and knowledge 
      about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Partnership as practice is a 
      patient-centred framework providing an individualised practice for each patient. 
      This study intends to achieve a nuanced and improved understanding of chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease patients' experiences with a partnership-based nursing 
      practice programme comprising home visits from a respiratory nurse after hospital 
      discharge, alongside interdisciplinary collaboration. DESIGN: This study has a 
      qualitative design with interviews. METHODS: Six individual semi-structured 
      interviews collected in 2012-2013 constitute the material. Interviews were recorded, 
      transcribed to written text and analysed using systematic text condensation. 
      RESULTS: Three key themes were identified: to be seen, talked with and understood; 
      healthcare support at home-continuity, practical support and facilitation; and 
      exchange of knowledge. However, there were two generic themes that permeated the 
      material: feeling safe and comforted, and motivation to achieve better health. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can experience 
      feeling safe and comforted, and be motivated to make changes in order to achieve 
      better health after participating in a partnership-based nursing practice programme 
      that includes home visits from a respiratory nurse and interdisciplinary cooperation 
      after hospital discharge. To feel safe is of great importance, and how this relates 
      to the patient's ability to cope with illness should be explored in further 
      research. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results suggest that the 
      partnership-based nursing practice programme that includes home visits and 
      interdisciplinary collaboration can be a good approach to meeting the complexity of 
      the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient's health needs.

TI  - "Making the best of what we have": The lived experiences of community psychiatric 
      nurses, day centre managers and social workers supporting clients with dementia 
      attending a generic day care service.
LID - 10.1111/opn.12157 [doi]
AB  - AIM AND OBJECTIVES: This study explored the experiences and perspectives of 
      community psychiatric nurses, day centre managers and social workers about 
      supporting clients living with and without dementia attending a generic day care 
      service. The purpose of the study was to elucidate approaches that enable clients 
      living with dementia to access and derive benefit from the service. BACKGROUND: In 
      the light of international ageing demographics and strategy towards social 
      inclusion, it is anticipated that demand for generic day care services for clients 
      living with and without dementia will increase. DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive 
      qualitative design utilised three focus groups for data collection. Community 
      psychiatric nurses (n = 4), day centre mangers (n = 4) and social workers (n = 12) 
      participated in the study. Data analysis informed a narrative description of the 
      approaches that support adults living with dementia in day care. FINDINGS: An 
      exhaustive description is encapsulated in five key themes. These are "easing the 
      transition to day care," "proactively managing supervision and complexity of need," 
      "sustaining the person and family carer," making the best of what we have" and 
      "encountering a need for change," The data conveyed a sensitivity to the life story 
      and needs of clients with dementia. Whilst the data revealed deficits in the 
      physical environment of the centres, there were indications of the generation of a 
      positive social environment. CONCLUSIONS: A generic day care service that provides 
      an integrated blend of care and treatment and social and recreational support to 
      older adults, irrespective of whether they have or have not dementia, is realistic 
      and manageable. The routine of day centre attendance may have value in sustaining 
      clients with dementia and family care-giving relationships. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: Approaches to support the attendance of clients with dementia at day care 
      include home visits, life story work, proactive supervision and careful planning of 
      social groupings and recreational activities.

TI  - Hispanic older adults' osteoarthritis pain communication.
PG  - 173-9
LID - 10.1016/j.pmn.2010.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Better understanding of how Hispanic older adults describe their chronic pain might 
      suggest ways to support Hispanic older adults to talk about important pain 
      information with their practitioner. The study aim was to describe how Hispanic 
      older adults communicate pain information, including the amount of pain information 
      and communication processes employed. A secondary analysis with a descriptive design 
      was used. The data were from a larger primary study that tested the effect of 
      practitioner pain question phrasing on the amount of pain information described by 
      older adults with osteoarthritis pain. The sample for this secondary analysis was 
      composed of the 24 Hispanic older adults with chronic osteoarthritis pain. In the 
      primary study older adults watched and orally responded to a videotape of a 
      practitioner asking about their pain. Pain content from the patient responses was 
      content analyzed by two independent raters. Communication processes were also 
      content analyzed by two independent raters using a priori criteria from 
      communication accommodation theory (clarity, syntax, complexity, explicitness, and 
      staying on topic). Participants described a mean of 5.5 (SD 3.39) items of pain 
      information. The majority stayed on topic, and one-half spoke clearly and 
      explicitly. Hispanic older adults with osteoarthritis pain concisely describe 
      clinically important pain information when given the opportunity to do so.

AB  - In view of the likelihood that the complexity of care required by those admitted to 
      nursing homes will continue to increase, an expert consensus study was conducted to 
      reach consensus on the competencies which distinguish baccalaureate-educated 
      registered nurses from other nursing staff working in nursing homes. Thirty-one 
      international experts, identified through literature and our professional network, 
      participated in a two-round web-based survey and an expert meeting. Experts reached 
      consensus on 16 desirable competencies, including some not traditionally associated 
      with nursing expertise e.g. being a team leader, role model and coach within the 
      nursing team. These findings suggest that revision of current nursing curricula, 
      nurse training programs and nursing home job profiles might be needed to meet the 
      medically and psychologically complex needs of nursing home residents.

TI  - Waiting for a kidney transplant: the experience of patients with end-stage renal 
      disease in South Korea.
PG  - 930-9
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13107 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of Korean patients with end-stage 
      renal disease awaiting kidney transplantation. BACKGROUND: The need for kidney 
      transplantation has increased worldwide, while the number of kidney donors has not 
      increased commensurately. This mismatch is a serious issue in South Korea. Prolonged 
      waits for transplantation may cause physical and psychosocial issues and lead to 
      poor outcomes. Nevertheless, the experience of waiting for kidney transplantation in 
      South Korea has never been explored in depth. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive 
      design was used. METHODS: The participants were eight patients diagnosed with 
      end-stage renal disease on the waiting list for kidney transplantation in South 
      Korea. Data were collected through individual in-depth interviews. All conversations 
      during interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcribed data were 
      analysed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: The experience of waiting for 
      kidney transplantation consisted of six categories: (1) the light at the end of the 
      tunnel, (2) being on call without any promise, (3) a tough tug of war between 
      excitement and frustration, (4) doubts in the complexity, (5) A companion on the 
      hard journey and (6) getting ready for D-day. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation 
      candidates experience psychosocial difficulties and concerns while waiting for long 
      periods of time without any assurance of resolution. Systematic education and 
      psychosocial support from health care professionals and family members help patients 
      get through what they describe as a difficult journey. Comprehensive management 
      programs for kidney transplantation candidates are needed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Health care professionals need to recognise the psychosocial concerns of 
      patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Clinicians should provide patients with 
      information and support throughout the waiting period.

TI  - Validation of a dietary intake tool for african-american dialysis patients with low 
      literacy.
PG  - 126-33
LID - 10.1111/jorc.12104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study analysed the validity and reliability of a food frequency 
      questionnaire designed for African-American patients with low literacy. This 
      instrument was designed specifically to meet the need for a tool that was short, 
      easy to understand, and met clinical reliability and validity standards. OBJECTIVES: 
      Assessing patient nutritional status and dietary intake is crucial to the care of 
      patients in end stage kidney disease. The development of a quick and reliable 
      nutritional assessment tool for patients with low literacy could increase 
      nutritional counselling effectiveness and improve patient outcomes. DESIGN: The 
      renal food frequency questionnaire (RFF) and a standard 24-hour recall were 
      administered to a general population of African-American patients undergoing 
      dialysis. Registered Dieticians and statistical analyses were used to validate the 
      content and structural validity and reliability of the RFF to adequately measure 
      dietary intake. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 30 African-American 
      patients who received dialysis treatment at a regional teaching hospital facility. 
      RESULTS: The RFF was found to be a simple, easy to understand instrument with low 
      reading complexity (grade level 4.4). Inter-rater reliability was found to be high 
      (.81-1.00), and statistical analysis determined a high level of clinical validity. 
      CONCLUSION: The RFF was found to be a valid dietary recall tool that is appropriate 
      for patients with limited literacy. It was found to have acceptable reliability and 
      validity when compared with a standard 24-hour recall and has potential for use as a 
      dietary intake and monitoring tool in patients undergoing dialysis.

TI  - Home healthcare teams' assessments of pain in care recipients living with dementia: 
      a Swedish exploratory study.
PG  - 190-200
LID - 10.1111/opn.12072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain assessment in people living with dementia is a challenge due to the 
      complexity of pain and dementia and the difficulties in self-reporting. In home 
      healthcare, nurses are frequently involved in pain assessment situations and there 
      is a need to explore how home healthcare teams' manage pain assessment in this 
      setting. AIM: The study aimed to explore home healthcare teams' experiences of pain 
      assessment among care recipients with dementia. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative 
      design was used. METHODS: Open-ended individual interviews were conducted with 
      thirteen registered nurses and ten nursing assistants, working in three different 
      home healthcare teams in one municipality in western Sweden. Philosophical 
      hermeneutics was utilised to interpret the home healthcare teams' experiences. 
      RESULTS: Four interpretations emerged: the need for trusting collaboration, the use 
      of multiple assessment strategies, maintenance of staff continuity in care and 
      assessment situations, and the need for extended time to assess pain. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The home healthcare teams recognise pain assessment in people with dementia as 
      involving a complex interaction of sensory, cognitive, emotional and behavioural 
      components in which efforts to acquire understanding of behavioural changes mainly 
      guides their assessments. The solid team coherence between registered nurses and 
      nursing assistants aided the assessment procedure. To assess pain, the teams used 
      multiple methods that complemented one another. However, no systematic routines or 
      appropriate evidence-based pain tools were used. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The team 
      members'concern for care recipients when assessing pain is evident and needs to be 
      acknowledged by the organisation which is responsible for the quality of care. 
      Future studies should focus on further exploration of nurses' experiences with pain

      they deal with their findings. It is imperative to investigate how organisations and 
      nurses can ensure best practices and how the implementation of evidence-based 
      routines for assessing pain may aid in pain assessment situations.

AB  - This study explores the referral experience of physicians who refer Latinos to 
      end-of-life care and challenges associated with the referral process. Qualitative 
      data were collected in New Jersey through semistructured, open-ended interviews. Six 
      physicians participated in this study: 1 oncologist, 2 internists, 1 gerontologist, 
      and 2 infectious disease specialists. The study reveals that language barriers, 
      level of family involvement, and generational group of the patient and the family 
      contribute to the complexity of the physician's experience. Physicians' comments 
      evidence the importance of culturally competent training in medical school and 
      continued education on this topic for physicians who did not receive such training. 
      Bilingual bicultural hospice admissions' staff available at the physician's office 
      could enhance the referral experience.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences and expectations 
      of both women with breast cancer and the health professionals who care for them, in 
      relation to the management of menopausal symptoms. METHOD: A qualitative, 
      exploratory study using a combination of focus groups and in depth individual 
      interviews was carried out to collect data from women with breast cancer (14) and 
      Health Professionals (15). KEY RESULTS: A number of categories arose including 
      breast cancer experience, menopausal symptoms, seeking support, taking control; with 
      a number of contributory factors. CONCLUSION: The findings illustrated the 
      complexity of supporting women experiencing menopausal symptoms following their 
      breast cancer diagnosis. They also captured the difficulty women have in isolating 
      these symptoms from their experiences of breast cancer and associated management 
      from diagnosis and beyond. The results indicate that health professionals are 
      working and reacting to individual requests for support in isolation of the team. 
      There is a need to assess and manage women both individually and within a 
      multidisciplinary context. This would allow complex issues that span across the pre, 
      peri, or post-menopausal stages, to be identified and resolved effectively.

PG  - 1196-1203
LID - 10.1017/ice.2017.176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Predicting recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) remains 
      difficult. METHODS: We employed a retrospective cohort design. Granular electronic 
      medical record (EMR) data had been collected from patients hospitalized at 21 Kaiser 
      Permanente Northern California hospitals. The derivation dataset (2007-2013) 
      included data from 9,386 patients who experienced incident CDI (iCDI) and 1,311 who 
      experienced their first CDI recurrences (rCDI). The validation dataset (2014) 
      included data from 1,865 patients who experienced incident CDI and 144 who 
      experienced rCDI. Using multiple techniques, including machine learning, we 
      evaluated more than 150 potential predictors. Our final analyses evaluated 3 models 
      with varying degrees of complexity and 1 previously published model. RESULTS Despite 
      having a large multicenter cohort and access to granular EMR data (eg, vital signs, 
      and laboratory test results), none of the models discriminated well (c statistics, 
      0.591-0.605), had good calibration, or had good explanatory power. CONCLUSIONS Our 
      ability to predict rCDI remains limited. Given currently available EMR technology, 
      improvements in prediction will require incorporating new variables because 
      currently available data elements lack adequate explanatory power. Infect Control

TI  - Measuring nursing care workload in non-intensive cardiac surgery: an observational 
      study.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: An understanding of the time nurses spend assessing and meeting 
      patients' needs is key to improve nursing outcomes and support organizational 
      well-being. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to determine whether the use 
      of an assessment scale with some clinical parameters indicative of hemodynamic, 
      neurological, respiratory and mobility functions could be able to estimate nursing 
      care workload in non-intensive cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: A correlational 
      descriptive study was designed. Two types of inpatients were included in the study: 
      those waiting for cardiac surgery and those who had already undergone cardiac 
      surgery. Using specific indicators, patient's clinical status was classified in 10 
      levels of complexity and nursing care interventions were divided into three 
      categories: clinical activities, educational activities and organizational 
      activities. For each of this categories the correlation coefficient between the 
      nursing time and the level of patient's complexity was measured. RESULTS: Per hour 
      of hospitalization, nurses spent an average of 11 minutes and 49 seconds providing 
      care to each patient. A good correlation coefficient between the amount of the 
      nursing time spent for clinical activities and the level of patient's complexity was 
      found. Educational activities were minimal compared with the clinical and 
      organizational activities, but they were mostly conducted during the preoperative 
      phase. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment scale tested in this study, including some 
      information about the patient's clinical status, allowed to estimate clinical 
      nursing workload in non-intensive cardiac surgery patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of infection due to 
      Escherichia coli sequence type ST131. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: All 
      healthcare settings in Olmsted County, Minnesota (eg, community hospital, tertiary 
      care center, long-term care facilities, and ambulatory clinics). PATIENTS: 
      Ambulatory and hospitalized children and adults with extraintestinal E. coli 
      isolates. METHODS: We analyzed 299 consecutive, nonduplicate extraintestinal E. coli 
      isolates submitted to Olmsted County laboratories in February and March 2011. ST131 
      was identified using single-nucleotide polymorphism polymerase chain reaction and 
      further evaluated through pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Associated clinical data 
      were abstracted through medical record review. RESULTS: Most isolates were from 
      urine specimens (90%), outpatients (68%), and community-associated infections (61%). 
      ST131 accounted for 27% of isolates overall and for a larger proportion of those 
      isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones (81%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (42%), 
      gentamicin (79%), and ceftriaxone (50%). The prevalence of ST131 increased with age 
      (accounting for 5% of isolates from those 11-20 years of age, 26% of isolates from 
      those 51-60 years of age, and 50% of isolates from those 91-100 years of age). ST131 
      accounted for a greater proportion of healthcare-associated isolates (49%) than 
      community-associated isolates (15%) and for fully 76% of E. coli isolates from 
      long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. Multivariable predictors of ST131 carriage 
      included older age, LTCF residence, previous urinary tract infection, 
      high-complexity infection, and previous use of fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and 
      extended-spectrum cephalosporins. With multivariable adjustment, ST131-associated 
      infection outcomes included receipt of more than 1 antibiotic (odds ratio [OR], 2.54 
      [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-5.17]) and persistent or recurrent symptoms (OR, 
      2.53 [95% CI, 1.08-5.96]). Two globally predominant ST131 pulsotypes accounted for 
      45% of ST131 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ST131 is a dominant, antimicrobial-resistant 
      clonal group associated with healthcare settings, elderly hosts, and persistent or 
      recurrent symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to identify the average direct cost of maintaining the patency of totally 
      implanted central venous catheter with heparin at a Day Hospital of a public 
      hospital of high complexity specialized in the treatment of cancer patients, and 
      estimate the average direct cost of replacing heparin with sodium chloride 0.9%. 
      METHOD: quantitative, exploratory-descriptive study, with a sample of 200 
      non-participant observations of the maintenance of totally implanted central venous 
      catheters with heparin. The average direct cost was calculated by multiplying the 
      (clocked) time spent by professionals to complete the procedure by the direct unit 
      cost of workforce, added to the cost of materials and solutions. RESULTS: the 
      estimated total direct cost of catheter maintenance with heparin was US$ 9.71 
      (SD=1.35) on average, ranging from US$ 7.98 to US$ 23.28. The estimated total direct 
      cost of maintenance with 0.9% sodium chloride in the place of heparin was US$ 8.81 
      (SD=1.29) on average, resulting in a reduction of US$ 0.90 per procedure. 
      CONCLUSION: the results contributed to propose strategies to assist in cost 
      containment/minimization in this procedure. The replacement of heparin by 0.9% 
      sodium chloride proved to be an option to reduce the total average direct cost.

TI  - An intervention to improve adherence and management of symptoms for patients 
      prescribed oral chemotherapy agents: an exploratory study.
PG  - 18-28
LID - 10.1097/NCC.0b013e3182551587 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of oral chemotherapy agents to treat cancer has increased. Patients 
      are responsible for adhering to complex regimens while managing symptoms from 
      adverse effects of the chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study examined an intervention 
      to manage symptoms and adherence to oral agents. METHODS: A 3-group pilot study 
      determined how an Automated Voice Response (AVR) system alone (n = 40), or the AVR 
      with strategies to manage symptoms and adherence (n = 40), or the AVR with 
      strategies to manage adherence (n = 39) reduced symptom severity and improved 
      adherence. Participants received a Symptom Management Toolkit, completed a baseline 
      interview, and were randomized to receive 8 weekly AVR calls. An exit interview 
      occurred at 10 weeks. RESULTS: Mean age was 59.6 years, with 70% female and 76% 
      white, and 42% were nonadherent, with missed doses increasing with regimen 
      complexity. Symptom severity declined over time in all groups. No difference was 
      found in adherence rates, and higher adherence was related with lower symptom 
      severity across groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence, a significant clinical problem, can 
      affect efficacy of the cancer treatment. The AVR intervention alone was just as 
      effective as the AVR plus the nurse intervention at promoting adherence and managing 
      symptoms from adverse effects. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses need to focus on 
      patient education by ensuring patient understanding of oral agent regimen and the 
      need to adhere to the oral agent for efficacious cancer treatment. Nurses can 
      promote the use of medication reminders and self-management of symptoms from adverse 
      effects, to support adherence to the oral agent.

TI  - Factors associated with rushed and missed resident care in western Canadian nursing 
      homes: a cross-sectional survey of health care aides.
PG  - 2815-25
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12887 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the nature, frequency and factors associated with 
      care that was rushed or missed by health care aides in western Canadian nursing 
      homes. BACKGROUND: The growing number of nursing home residents with dementia has 
      created job strain for frontline health care providers, the majority of whom are 
      health care aides. Due to the associated complexity of care, health care aides are 
      challenged to complete more care tasks in less time. Rushed or missed resident care 
      are associated with adverse resident outcomes (e.g. falls) and poorer quality of 
      staff work life (e.g. burnout) making this an important quality of care concern. 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of health care aides (n = 583) working in a 
      representative sample of nursing homes (30 urban, six rural) in western Canada. 
      METHODS: Data were collected in 2010 as part of the Translating Research in Elder 
      Care study. We collected data on individual health care aides (demographic 
      characteristics, job and vocational satisfaction, physical and mental health, 
      burnout), unit level characteristics associated with organisational context, 
      facility characteristics (location, size, owner/operator model), and the outcome 
      variables of rushed and missed resident care. RESULTS: Most health care aides (86%) 
      reported being rushed. Due to lack of time, 75% left at least one care task missed 
      during their previous shift. Tasks most frequently missed were talking with 
      residents (52% of health care aides) and assisting with mobility (51%). Health care 
      aides working on units with higher organisational context scores were less likely to 
      report rushed and missed care. CONCLUSION: Health care aides frequently report care 
      that is rushed and tasks omitted due to lack of time. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Considering the resident population in nursing homes today--many with 
      advanced dementia and all with complex care needs--health care aides having enough 
      time to provide physical and psychosocial care of high quality is a critical 
      concern.

TI  - Effort, workload, and depressive symptoms in family caregivers of older adults: 
      conceptualizing and testing a work-health relationship.
PG  - 74-94
AB  - Increasing effort in response to a complex workload is detrimental to workers' 
      health and may explain the negative health consequences experienced by millions of 
      family caregivers who are the primary workforce for older adult care in the United 
      States. This cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study used survey data from 
      110 family caregivers of community-dwelling older adults to theoretically explain 
      caregiving effort (as perceived exertion) and to examine the relationship between 
      effort and depressive symptoms, a particularly persistent adverse caregiver health 
      outcome. Visual analog scales and exemplar quotes explicated physical, mental, 
      emotional, and time-related effort. Notably, effort was considered too 
      multidimensional by several caregivers to discretely categorize. Among the 
      relationships tested, effort was statistically significantly correlated with 
      workload proxies (time, difficulty, overload), caregiver health and depressive 
      symptoms, and care receiver function. Using regression analysis, effort and workload 
      did not have direct effects on depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, effort was not 
      decreased for caregivers who had formal or informal caregiving help. These findings 
      support an energetical conceptualization in caregiving and highlight the complexity 
      of a caregiving workload assessment. Practice suggestions are offered toward 
      tailored health promotion strategies to benefit the families who constitute this 
      essential, global caregiving workforce.

TI  - Having a sibling as donor: patients' experiences immediately before allogeneic 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 436-42
LID - S1462-3889(14)00036-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejon.2014.03.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a 
      potential cure for a variety of diseases but is also associated with significant 
      risks. With HSCT the donor is either a relative, most often a sibling, or an 
      unrelated registry donor. PURPOSE: The aim was to explore patients' experiences, 
      immediately before transplantation, regarding having a sibling as donor. METHOD: Ten 
      adult patients with sibling donors were interviewed before admission for HSCT. The 
      interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to 
      qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The main theme Being in no man's land is a 
      metaphor for the patients' complex situation with its mixture of emotions and 
      thoughts prior to transplantation. The three subthemes Trust in the sibling donor, 
      Concern about others and Loss of control cover the various experiences. The 
      patient's experiences are influenced by their personal situation and the quality of 
      the relationship with the sibling donor. While patients feel secure in having a 
      sibling donor, they are dependent for their survival on the cell donation and feel 
      responsible for the donor's safety during donation. These emotions intensify the 
      patients' sense of dependency and loss of control. CONCLUSIONS: In caring for HSCT 
      patients the nurses should be aware of the complexity of the patients' situation and 
      keep in mind that having a sibling donor might imply extra pressure, including a 
      sense of responsibility. Caring for both patients and sibling donors optimally is a 
      challenge, which needs further improvement and exploration.

TI  - The search for a higher power among terminally ill people with no previous religion 
      or belief.
PG  - 384-9
AB  - In a palliative care setting, there is evidence from the practice of spiritual care 
      delivery to suggest that some terminally ill patients may seek, with varying degrees 
      of openness and articulation, to connect with a higher power, or God, despite having 
      expressed no previous interest in religion or belief. Developing a better 
      understanding of the thoughts and feelings of such patients requires insight into 
      the initial triggers of their search. In this small qualitative study involving six 
      patients, fear, hope, and a natural connection are posited as possible prompts. The 
      results highlight the complexity of ambivalent feelings toward a transcendent being 
      that can be the focus of anger and blame while simultaneously offering a source of 
      comfort and hope for an afterlife. Moreover, the study revealed something of the 
      extent to which health professionals may feel limited in facilitating necessary 
      discussion by a need to protect patients and themselves from entering an unfamiliar 
      and complex area.

TI  - What impact do anxiety, depression, perceived control and technology capability have 
      on whether patients with chronic heart failure take-up or continue to use home 
      tele-monitoring services? Study design of ADaPT-HF.
PG  - 283-289
LID - 10.1177/1474515116657465 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home tele-monitoring (HTM) is used to monitor the clinical signs and 
      symptoms of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) in order to reduce unplanned 
      hospital admissions. However, not all patients who are referred will agree to use 
      HTM, and some patients choose to withdraw early from its use. AIMS: ADaPT-HF will 
      investigate whether depression, anxiety, low perceived control, reduced technology 
      capability, level of education, age or the severity or complexity of a patient's 
      illness can predict refusal of, or early withdrawal from, HTM in patients with CHF. 
      METHODS: The study will recruit 288 patients who have been recently admitted to 
      hospital with heart failure who have been referred for HTM. At the time of referral, 
      patients will complete depression (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety 
      (seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), perceived control 
      (eight-item revised Controlled Attitudes Scale) and technology capability (ten-item 
      Technology Readiness Index 2.0) screening questionnaires. In addition, data on 
      demographics, diagnosis, clinical examination, socio-economic status, history of 
      comorbidities, medication, biochemistry and haematology will be recorded. The 
      primary outcome will be a composite of refusal of or early withdrawal from HTM. The 
      principle analysis will be made using logistic regression. CONCLUSION: By 
      establishing which factors influence a patient's decision to refuse or withdraw 
      early from HTM, it may be possible to redesign HTM referral processes. It may be 
      that patients with CHF who also have depression, anxiety, low control and poor 
      technology skills should not be referred until they receive appropriate support or 
      that they should be managed differently when they do receive HTM. The results of 
      ADAPT-HF may provide a way of making more efficient and cost-effective use of HTM 
      services.

AB  - AIM:   This article is a report of a study exploring health-related quality of life 
      in adults with congenital heart disease and the extent to which it is associated 
      with patients' illness beliefs and emotional health. BACKGROUND:   A reduction in 
      mortality in patients with congenital heart disease has led to an increasingly older 
      population that faces new challenges. Studies in a younger adult population have 
      reported inconsistent findings regarding health-related quality of life. Factors 
      such as, the complexity of the congenital heart defect, have not been found to be 
      associated with quality of life. The association between illness beliefs and 
      health-related quality of life has not previously been reported. METHOD:   A 
      cross-sectional questionnaire study of adults with congenital heart disease 
      attending an outpatient clinic in a specialist centre in the United Kingdom between 
      October 2007 and May 2008. RESULTS:   The mean age of the study population was 37·2 
      years. Participants reported poorer physical functioning, role functioning and 
      general health than a general population. High levels of anxiety were reported in 
      38% and high levels of depression in 17%. In multivariate analysis, higher levels of 
      anxiety and depression were associated with poorer mental functioning and higher 
      levels of depression with poorer physical quality of life. CONCLUSION:   We have 
      reported that high levels of anxiety and depression in an older population of 
      patients with congenital heart disease are associated with poorer quality of life. 
      This highlights the need to routinely assess anxiety and depression in this patient 
      group and to provide psychological support appropriately.

TI  - A qualitative study of recently bereaved people's beliefs about death: implications 
      for bereavement care.
PG  - 1300-8
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12326 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the beliefs of recently bereaved people about 
      death and to explore the implications of these beliefs for bereavement care. 
      BACKGROUND: Little is known about recently bereaved people's beliefs about death, 
      although there is evidence that these beliefs may have an impact on health. The 
      funeral provides an opportunity for bereaved people to reflect on their beliefs 
      about death. DESIGN: A qualitative approach. METHODS: This paper describes one 
      aspect of an interdisciplinary study of the spirituality of contemporary funerals. 
      We obtained access to 46 funerals through funeral directors and other contacts, and 
      interviewed principal mourners to explore their beliefs. Interviews were recorded, 
      transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Three themes emerged that 
      reflected the beliefs and experiences of bereaved people. The first theme describes 
      people's understanding of death in terms of five positions: religious, dualist, 
      eco-spiritualist, materialist and death-as-transition. The second theme addresses a 
      range of views about the possibility of life after death: resurrection, reuniting 
      and reincarnation. The third theme describes ways in which people felt that their 
      relationship with the deceased person continues after death: continuity as sense of 
      presence and continuity as memory, legacy and love. Some people were reluctant to 
      express a firm view about death. CONCLUSIONS: People express a spectrum of beliefs 
      about death. Their beliefs are infrequently linked to formal religious or spiritual 
      perspectives but seem to have an important role in coping with bereavement. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This is a unique study illustrating the complexity 
      of bereaved people's beliefs about death. The study provides a research-based 
      framework within which to understand contemporary beliefs about death, and 
      contributes to our understanding of how health professionals can support recently 
      bereaved people.

TI  - Being a haematopoietic stem cell donor for a sick sibling: Adult donors' experiences 
      prior to donation.

LID - S1462-3889(15)00035-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejon.2015.02.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of knowledge about sibling stem cell donors' experiences 
      pre-donation and the waiting period before the donation might have been long. The 
      donors and their corresponding sibling recipients were simultaneously included in 
      two different interview studies. The results from the recipient study have been 
      presented in a separate paper. PURPOSE: The aim was to explore the experiences of 
      being a stem cell donor for a sibling, prior to donation. METHOD: Ten adult sibling 
      donors were interviewed prior to stem cell donation. The interviews were digitally 
      recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to qualitative content analysis. 
      RESULTS: The main theme Being a cog in a big wheel describes the complex process of 
      being a sibling donor prior to donation, covering a mixture of emotions and 
      thoughts. The four subthemes Being available, Being anxious, Being concerned and 
      Being obliged cover the various experiences. The sibling donors' experiences are 
      influenced by the quality of the relationship with the sick sibling. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sibling stem cell donors go through a complex process once they have accidentally 
      got involved in. They have been asked to become a donor; it was not a voluntary 
      choice. In caring for sibling stem cell donors the nurses should be aware of the 
      complexity of the process they experience and take into consideration their personal 
      situation and needs. Providing optimal care for both sibling donors and their 
      corresponding recipients is a challenge, and further improvement and exploration are 
      needed.

TI  - Variation in Empiric Coverage Versus Detection of Methicillin-Resistant

      Community-Onset Pneumonia Across 128 US Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.
PG  - 937-944
LID - 10.1017/ice.2017.98 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE To examine variation in antibiotic coverage and detection of resistant 
      pathogens in community-onset pneumonia. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING A 
      total of 128 hospitals in the Veterans Affairs health system. PARTICIPANTS 
      Hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia from 2009 through 2010. 
      METHODS We examined proportions of hospitalizations with empiric antibiotic coverage 
      for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      (PAER) and with initial detection in blood or respiratory cultures. We compared 
      lowest- versus highest-decile hospitals, and we estimated adjusted probabilities 
      (AP) for patient- and hospital-level factors predicting coverage and detection using 
      hierarchical regression modeling. RESULTS Among 38,473 hospitalizations, empiric 
      coverage varied widely across hospitals (MRSA lowest vs highest, 8.2% vs 42.0%; PAER 
      lowest vs highest, 13.9% vs 44.4%). Detection rates also varied (MRSA lowest vs 
      highest, 0.5% vs 3.6%; PAER lowest vs highest, 0.6% vs 3.7%). Whereas coverage was 
      greatest among patients with recent hospitalizations (AP for anti-MRSA, 54%; AP for 
      anti-PAER, 59%) and long-term care (AP for anti-MRSA, 60%; AP for anti-PAER, 66%), 
      detection was greatest in patients with a previous history of a positive culture (AP 
      for MRSA, 7.9%; AP for PAER, 11.9%) and in hospitals with a high prevalence of the 
      organism in pneumonia (AP for MRSA, 3.9%; AP for PAER, 3.2%). Low hospital 
      complexity and rural setting were strong negative predictors of coverage but not of 
      detection. CONCLUSIONS Hospitals demonstrated widespread variation in both coverage 
      and detection of MRSA and PAER, but probability of coverage correlated poorly with 
      probability of detection. Factors associated with empiric coverage (eg, healthcare 
      exposure) were different from those associated with detection (eg, microbiology 
      history). Providing microbiology data during empiric antibiotic decision making 
      could better align coverage to risk for resistant pathogens and could promote more 
      judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol

TI  - Power relations in patient's experiences of suffering during treatment for cancer.
PG  - 271-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05731.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This paper is a report of how patients who have cancer experience suffering in 
      the context of power relations. BACKGROUND: Many studies in Sweden and in other 
      countries have detected inequality in healthcare use and resources, including unseen 
      influences that can be connected to gender and distribution of resources. Few 
      studies have examined how multiple relations of power - such as gender, ethnicity, 
      age and education - influence how people with cancer experience suffering during 
      treatment. METHOD: A hermeneutic design was used. Qualitative interviews were 
      conducted with 12 women and 14 men receiving treatment for a variety of cancer 
      diagnoses. The data collection was done at two hospitals in Sweden during 2008-2009. 
      The interpretation of data was based on two theoretical perspectives - suffering and 
      intersectionality. RESULTS: The results highlight patients suffering where two or 
      more positions of power relations interacted with each other. Three main themes were 
      identified: the complexity of control, the vulnerable effects of body changes, and 
      the internal battle of survival. CONCLUSION: A vulnerable social situation for 
      people with cancer concretely increased their suffering. Social inequalities, 
      seemingly linked to social hierarchy, increased the suffering of people with cancer. 
      For example, women with cancer with a low education belonging to an ethnic minority 
      suffered more than highly educated patients belonging to the ethnic majority.

TI  - The wicked question answered: positive deviance delivers patient-centered care.
PG  - 142-50
LID - 10.1097/DCC.0000000000000038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: How nurses respond when faced with the dilemma of providing 
      patient-centered care in the absence of patient-centered practice guidelines remains 
      relatively unreported. Standards may not be available to guide nurses or may not be 
      realistic for implementation at the point of care. Nurses may be forced to react 
      creatively to meet the needs of their patients. OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to 
      understand nursing care when standard practice guidelines did not meet 
      patient-specific care needs and to develop various viewpoints related to the use of 
      positive deviance in providing patient-centered care. METHODS: Complexity theory and 
      the framework of a wicked question were used to guide a 3-round online national 
      Delphi study from November 2011 to February 2012. The panel was accessed through the 
      American Association of Critical Care Nurses to expose the care provided when 
      standard practice guidelines were lacking. RESULTS: Findings support the presence of 
      positive deviance and expose care provided by nurses when standard practice 
      guidelines lacked the ability to provide patient-centered care. Dominant themes of 
      positive deviance are recommended as priorities for future research. DISCUSSION: 
      Better guidelines are needed that work for nurses, instead of against them, that 
      would not force a nurse into actions that are not patient centered. Guidelines 
      should guide practice and assist in allowing nurses to provide care that is centered 
      on the best needs of the patient in the specific care situation.

TI  - Illness perceptions of adults with congenital heart disease and their predictive 
      value for quality of life two years later.
PG  - 86-94
LID - 10.1177/1474515113481908 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To improve patients' quality of life (QoL) we need to identify 
      modifiable determinants, such as illness perceptions. Patients' illness perceptions 
      are known to regulate emotional responses and health-behaviour. Illness perceptions 
      comprise several components: consequences, control, coherence, changeability and 
      emotional representations. AIMS: To examine (a) the relation between patient 
      characteristics and illness perceptions, and (b) the independent predictive value of 
      illness perceptions for future QoL. METHODS: A longitudinal study in 845 patients 
      with congenital heart disease was conducted. Patients completed three 
      questionnaires: the IPQ-R (illness perceptions) and two years later the SF-36 and 
      TAAQOL-CHD (QoL). Linear regression analyses were performed relating illness 
      perceptions to patient characteristics (sex, age, disease complexity and functional 
      status) and QoL. RESULTS: Patients with a complex defect or poor functional status 
      reported poor illness perceptions. Independent of patient characteristics, poor 
      illness perceptions (i.e. a strong belief that the illness has severe consequences; 
      a weak belief that you have a coherent illness understanding and that the illness 
      can be controlled by treatment; and a strong belief that the illness is changeable 
      and causes negative emotions) were predictive of future QoL. CONCLUSION: Illness 
      perceptions independently predict QoL, suggesting that QoL may be improved by 
      altering patients' beliefs about their illness. For example, increasing patients' 
      knowledge regarding their disease and informing them about treatment opportunities 
      may enhance their QoL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased 
      risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, 
      an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving 
      individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and 
      long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case 
      manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates 
      cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications 
      regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale 
      had not hitherto been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which the 
      interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into 
      healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the 
      benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. DESIGN: A process evaluation was 
      conducted using a mixed methods design. SETTINGS: Six GP practices in the south of 
      the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Practice nurses (n=7), GPs (n=12), occupational 
      therapists (n=6) and physical therapists (n=20) participated in the process 
      evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (≥ 70 years) were 
      included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were 
      confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to 
      communicate in Dutch were excluded. METHODS: Quantitative data (logbooks and 
      evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 
      13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, 
      data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured 
      interviews and four focus group discussions. RESULTS: Although some parts of the 
      protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older 
      people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for 
      the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive 
      treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and 
      experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the 
      interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of 
      the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the 
      protocol need special attention.

AB  - Chronic back pain is globally acknowledged as a common reason why people seek help 
      from health professionals. The complexity of persistent chronic pain can undermine 
      the person's self-esteem and present a number of challenges to an individual's 
      ability to manage their pain. Multi-professional person-centered care is advocated 
      as a key strategy to support people with chronic back pain. However, the impact of 
      these approaches on restoring the person's independence is unclear, and little is 
      known about whether and how person-centered approaches restore autonomy and 
      influence the person's ability to manage their pain. The aim of this grounded theory 
      study was to generate understanding about person-centered care from the perspectives 
      of people with chronic back pain and the multi-professional teams who cared for 
      them. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 17 people with 
      chronic back pain over one year. A constant comparative analytical approach 
      identified five key categories: the skeptical professional, validation, becoming a 
      person, regaining control, and restoring faith. These categories formed the 
      "conditional partnership" as a theory to explain person-centered care, which related 
      to the way in which the partnership developed between the patients and teams. The 
      findings suggest that person-centered care was influenced by the participants' need 
      to be believed and the relationship developed with health care providers. Crucially, 
      these findings suggest that legitimizing the pain experience through person-centered 
      approaches to care can empower people with chronic back pain to regain control of 
      their lives and their pain.

LID - 10.3928/19404921-20130910-01 [doi]
AB  - Prescription drug misuse among older adults includes inappropriate and harmful use 
      of these drugs. In this study, prescription drug misuse in assisted living settings 
      as reported by direct care workers (DCWs) was examined. Data came from DCWs in 45 
      assisted living settings located in Pennsylvania. A total of 944 DCWs completed a 
      questionnaire on their opinions of prescription drug misuse. DCWs believed most 
      assisted living residents take prescription medications. In addition, 10% of DCWs 
      observed or had evidence that residents used unnecessarily high doses, 30% were 
      preoccupied with the cost of prescription drugs, and 26% had problems understanding 
      the complexity of their drug treatment regimen. Prescription drug misuse may be a 
      problem of importance in assisted living settings. Assisted living has experienced 
      rapid growth in capacity, yet the ability of these settings and their residents to 
      manage prescription drugs may not have kept pace with this growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to investigate the factors associated with mortality in patients 
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in a cardiovascular referral hospital in 
      Santa Catarina. METHOD: quantitative, exploratory, descriptive and retrospective 
      study. The medical records of 1447 patients, from 2005 to 2013, were analyzed for 
      statistically related variables, these being: profile, hospitalization diagnosis, 
      risk factors for coronary artery disease, complications recorded during the 
      hospitalization, length of hospitalization and cause of death. RESULTS: the 
      mortality rate was 5.3% during the study period. Death was more common in females 
      and those of black skin color, with a mean age of 65 years. Acute myocardial 
      infarction was the most common hospitalization diagnosis. The majority of the 
      complications recorded during hospitalization were characterized by changes in the 
      cardiovascular system, with longer hospitalization periods being directly related to 
      death from septic shock. CONCLUSION: the data provide subsidies for nursing work 
      with preventive measures and early detection of complications associated with 
      coronary artery bypass grafting. This reinforces the importance of using the data as 
      quality indicators, aiming to guarantee care guided by reliable information to guide 
      managers in planning patient care and high complexity health services.

TI  - Complexity of management and health outcomes in a prospective cohort study of 573 
      heart failure patients in Australia: does more equal less?
PG  - 1629-38
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12073 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of chronic heart failure management 
      programmes (CHF-MPs) according to a scoring algorithm used to quantify the level of 
      applied interventions-the Heart Failure Intervention Score (HF-IS). BACKGROUND: The 
      overall efficacy of heart failure programmes has been proven in several 
      meta-analyses. However, the debate continues as to which components are essential in 
      a heart failure programme to improve patient outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort 
      study of patients participating in heart failure programmes. METHOD: Forty-eight of 
      62 (77%) programmes in Australia participating in a national register of CHF-MPs 
      were evaluated using the HF-IS: derived from a summed and weighted score of each 
      intervention applied by the CHF-MP (27 interventions overall). The CHF-MPs were 
      prospectively categorised as relatively low (HF-IS < 190 - n = 39 programmes & 407 
      patients) or high (HF-IS ≥ 190 - n = 9 programmes & 166 patients) in complexity. 
      Six-month morbidity and mortality rates in 573 consecutively recruited patients with 
      systolic dysfunction and in New York Heart Association Class II-IV were 
      prospectively examined. RESULTS: Patients exposed to CHF-MPs with a high HF-IS had a 
      lower rate of unplanned, all-cause hospitalisation (n = 24, 14% vs. n = 102, 25%) 
      compared with CHF-MPs with a low HF-IS within six months. On an adjusted basis, 
      CHF-MPs with a high HF-IS were associated with a reduced risk of unplanned 
      hospitalisation and/or death within six months and remained event-free longer. 
      CONCLUSION: High complexity CHF-MPs applying more evidence-based interventions are 
      associated with a higher event-free survival over six months. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: The HF-IS is an easy-to-use evidence-based tool to assist programme 
      coordinators to improve the quality of their heart failure programme which may also 
      improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Nurse perceptions of the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale in two palliative care 
      inpatient units: a focus group study.
PG  - 3276-85
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12925 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore nurse perceptions of the feasibility of integrating 
      the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale into practice within the inpatient palliative 
      care setting. BACKGROUND: Delirium occurs frequently in palliative care inpatient 
      populations, yet is under-recognised. Exploring feasibility of delirium screening 
      tools in this setting can provide insights into how recognition can be improved. 
      DESIGN: This was a qualitative study using a focus group methodology. METHOD: Four 
      semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 21 nurses working in two Australian 
      palliative care units. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed 
      verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Three 
      major themes were identified: (1) Delirium screening using the Nursing Delirium 
      Screening Scale is feasible, but then what? (2) Nuances, ambiguity and clinical 
      complexity; and (3) Implementing structured processes requires firmer foundations. 
      Themes describe how nurses perceived the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale to be an 
      easy and brief screening tool which raised their awareness of delirium. They were 
      largely willing to adopt it into practice, yet had uncertainty and misunderstandings 
      of the tool specifically and delirium screening generally, application in a 
      palliative care context, interventions for delirium and impact of screening on 
      medical practice. CONCLUSION: The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale is feasible for 
      use in a palliative care inpatient setting, but requires investigation of its 
      psychometric properties before routine use in this patient population. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses require understanding of delirium, tailored guidance and a 
      united approach with doctors to support their effective use of a delirium screening 
      tool in the palliative care unit. Delirium practice change in this setting will also 
      require nurses to become more active leaders and collaborators within their 
      interdisciplinary teams.

AB  - Transitioning to long-term care environments presents a significant challenge for 
      new nurses and their directors of nursing. The complexity of this environment, 
      instability of the workforce, and the lack of support structures frequently affect a 
      new nurse's decision not to apply to long-term care, but to look for positions in 
      acute care hospitals. To address these issues, a long-term care new nurse residency 
      program was developed, implemented, and evaluated in New Jersey through the work of 
      the New Jersey Action Coalition. The purpose of this study was to determine the 
      effects of the residency program on new nurses' confidence, competence, retention, 
      job satisfaction, and perceptions of organizational safety. J Contin Educ Nurs.

TI  - Walking down 'Via Dolorosa' from primary health care to the specialty pain clinic - 
      patient and professional perceptions of inequity in rehabilitation of chronic pain.
PG  - 45-53
LID - 10.1111/scs.12312 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse patient and professional perceptions about (in)equity of care 
      and rehabilitation of chronic pain patients from primary health care to assessment 
      at a specialty rehabilitation clinic. SETTING AND METHODS: This qualitative study 
      consists one focus group interview with eight general practitioners who refer 
      patients to pain rehabilitation clinics, 10 individual interviews with patients who 
      were assessed at a pain rehabilitation clinic and seven interviews with 
      professionals participating in multimodal assessment teams at a pain rehabilitation 
      clinic. Interview analysis was conducted by the grounded theory method. RESULTS: The 
      core category Via Dolorosa, the way of suffering and pain, captured how gender and 
      sociocultural context may contribute to advantages and disadvantages during patient 
      journeys from primary health care to a pain rehabilitation clinic. Patients and 
      professionals perceived pain as a low-ranking illness, and women and men used 
      different gendered strategies to legitimise the pain and to be taken seriously. 
      Being 'a proper patient ready to change' and having 'likeness' between patients and 
      professionals were viewed as advantageous in rehabilitation of pain patients. 
      Patients with higher educational levels were perceived as easier to interact with 
      and had better access to health care. Professional thoughts about gender norms 
      influenced the rehabilitation options. The rehabilitation programme was seen by 
      several professionals to be better suited for women than men, which could lead to 
      unequal care. CONCLUSION: From an equity and gender perspective, our study 
      highlights the complexity in rehabilitation of chronic pain patients - both from 
      patient and professional perspectives. Awareness of gendered and the biased 
      preconceptions and norms is crucial when professionals struggle to offer equitable 
      health care and rehabilitation.

TI  - Factors influencing the adoption of home telecare by elderly or chronically ill 
      people: a national survey.
PG  - 3183-93
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04173.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The primary aim is to provide insight into client 
      characteristics and characteristics of home telecare contacts, which may influence 
      the adoption of home telecare. Secondary aim is to examine the applicability of four 
      perceived attributes in Rogers' diffusion of innovations theory, which may influence 
      the adoption: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity and observability. 
      BACKGROUND: Western countries face strongly increasing healthcare demands. At the 
      same time, a growing nursing shortage exists. The use of home telecare may be 
      instrumental in improving independence and safety and can provide support to older 
      and chronically ill people, but a precondition for its uptake is that clients 
      consider it as a useful and helpful technological tool. DESIGN: A survey conducted 
      among clients of seven home care organisations in the Netherlands connected to a 
      home telecare system. METHODS: In 2007, a postal questionnaire was distributed to 
      468 older or chronically ill clients: 254 responded (54%). The data were analysed by 
      regression techniques, employing a theoretical model. RESULTS: This study showed 
      that clients' perceived attributes - relative advantage, compatibility, complexity 
      and observability - have a significant effect on adoption of home telecare 
      explaining 61% of the variance. The chance of adoption is higher when a client 
      already receives long-term personal and/or nursing care, he/she lives alone and when 
      there are fixed daily contacts via the home telecare system. The perception of 
      possible benefits can still be enhanced. CONCLUSIONS:   The concept of perceived 
      attributes, derived from Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory, has been useful to 
      explain clients' adoption of home telecare. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Home 
      care organisations can best focus on clients already in care and people living 
      alone, in offering home telecare. Nurses, who aim to enhance the client's adoption 
      of home telecare, have to take into account clients' perceived attributes of such 
      new technology.

TI  - Uncertainty in illness among patients with chronic heart failure is less in 
      person-centred care than in usual care.
PG  - 521-8
LID - 10.1177/1474515112472270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) experience uncertainty 
      regarding the treatment and characteristics of their illness. Person-centred care 
      (PCC) emphasizes patient involvement in care. We have previously shown that PCC 
      improved outcomes such as length of hospital stay and activities of daily living in 
      patients with CHF. The impact of PCC on self-reported uncertainty in illness among 
      patients hospitalized for CHF is still unknown. AIM: To evaluate whether PCC is 
      associated with less self-reported uncertainty in illness compared with usual care 
      in patients hospitalized for worsening CHF. METHODS: Using a controlled 
      before-and-after design, eligible CHF patients were assigned to either a usual care 
      group or a PCC intervention group. Patient-reported uncertainty in illness was 
      assessed at hospital discharge with the Cardiovascular Population Scale (CPS). The 
      CPS consists of two domains: 1) Ambiguity (about illness severity); and 2) 
      Complexity (of treatment and system of care). RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-eight 
      patients were included in the study; 123 in the usual care group and 125 in the PCC 
      intervention. The PCC group had better scores than the usual care group in the CPS 
      domains complexity (M=15.2, SD=4.7 vs. M=16.8, SD=4.7; p=0.020) and ambiguity 
      (M=27.8, SD=6.6 vs. M=29.8, SD=6.9; p=0.041). CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF were 
      less uncertain in their illness after PCC, which may help to equip and empower 
      patients to manage their illness. Together with earlier findings of shortened 
      hospital stay and improved activities of daily living, this indicates that PCC 
      should be a standard approach for hospital care of patients with worsening CHF.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a distressing respiratory disease 
      that may greatly impact a patient's quality of life. Although many treatment options 
      exist, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Guidelines outline 
      management strategies based on severity of daily symptoms and exacerbations. 
      Although it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of medication use, 
      involvement of patients in their overall care plan is imperative to optimal 
      outcomes. According to recent studies, the prevalence of COPD in older adults is 
      increasing, along with the complexity of care due to comorbidities, drug 
      interactions, and side effects. A thorough evaluation of a patient case provides 
      insight into the everyday challenges of COPD management. [Journal of Gerontological 
      Nursing, 44(7), 10-14.].

TI  - Patient participation in the medical decision-making process in haemato-oncology--a 
      qualitative study.
PG  - 684-90
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12077 [doi]
AB  - Cancer patients are showing increased interest in shared decision-making. Patients 
      with haematological illnesses, however, express considerably less desire for shared 
      decision-making as compared with other oncological patient groups. The goal of the 
      current project was to identify the reasons for the lower desire for shared 
      decision-making among patients with haematological illness. We conducted 
      qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 11 haematological patients (39-70 years 
      old) after the beginning of therapy concerning the course and evaluation of medical 
      shared decision-making. The patients were often overwhelmed by the complexity of the 
      illness and the therapy and did not want to assume any responsibility in medical 
      decision-making. They reported a great deal of distress and very traditional 
      paternalistic role expectations with regards to their health care providers, which 
      limited the patients' ability to partake in the decision-making process. In contrast 
      to the socio-cultural support for many other oncological diseases, haematological 
      diseases are not as well supported, e.g. there is a lack of self-help materials, 
      systematic provision of information and support groups for patients, which may be 
      related to a lower empowerment of this patient population. Results show the limits 
      of patient participation in the context of highly complicated medical conditions. In 
      addition to already researched preferences of the physicians and patients for shared 
      decision-making, future research should pay greater attention to the process and 
      other variables relevant to this aspect of the doctor-patient relationship.

TI  - Why take part in personalised cancer research? Patients' genetic misconception, 
      genetic responsibility and incomprehension of stratification-an empirical-ethical 
      examination.
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12563 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic misconception is a well-known challenge for informed decision-making for 
      cancer research participants. What is still missing, is a detailed understanding of 
      the impact of "personalised" treatment research (e.g. biomarkers for stratification) 
      on research participants. For this, we conducted the first longitudinal 
      empirical-ethical study based on semi-structured interviews with colorectal cancer 
      patients (n = 40) enrolled in a biomarker trial for (neo)adjuvant treatment, 
      analysing the patients' understanding of and perspectives on research and treatment 
      with qualitative methods. In addition to therapeutic misconception based on 
      patients' confusion of research and treatment, and here triggered by misled 
      motivation, information paternalism or incomprehension, we identified genetic 
      misconception and genetic responsibility as new problematic issues. Patients mainly 
      were not aware of the major research aim of future stratification into responders 
      and non-responders nor did they fully acknowledge this as the aim for personalised 
      cancer research. Thus, ethical and practical reflection on informed decision-making 
      in cancer treatment and research should take into account the complexity of lay 
      interpretations of modern personalised medicine. Instead of very formalistic, 
      liability-oriented informed consent procedures, we suggest a more personalised 
      communication approach to inform and motivate patients for cancer research.

AB  - Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments can be used to alleviate 
      the symptoms of fibromyalgia, although none of them are completely effective at 
      present. In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of different therapies in 
      three groups of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The sample for this randomized 
      controlled trial was made up of 66 people diagnosed with fibromyalgia in southern 
      Catalonia. In turn, this sample was divided into three groups of 22 participants 
      each, who were treated with: i) cervical infiltration with botulinum toxin, ii) 
      group problem-solving therapy, or iii) both therapies. The variables recorded were 
      quality of life, suicidal thoughts, perception of pain, quality of sleep, and 
      satisfaction. Female patients composed 96.9% (n = 64) of the study sample. 
      Satisfaction with the infiltration was 5.1 ± 2.7 points, while in group 
      problem-solving therapy it was 6.6 ± 3.2. Self-perceived health in the infiltration 
      group (p = .016) and the therapy group (p = .001) improved after the intervention 
      took place. The risk of suicide decreased in the both treatments/groups (p = .049). 
      Pain was reduced by 31.8% with infiltration, 13.6% with therapy, and 22.7% with both 
      treatments. Anxiety/depression decreased by 45% with therapy, 36.3% with 
      infiltration, and 36.3% with both treatments. The results also showed that the use 
      of both treatments significantly reduces suicidal thoughts (p = .049). In 
      conclusion, this study showed the complexity of reducing chronic pain and increasing 
      the quality of life of people with fibromyalgia.

TI  - Prehospital experiences of older men with a first myocardial infarction: a 
      qualitative analysis within the Northern Sweden MONICA Study.
PG  - 787-97
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2011.00896.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore older men's prehospital experiences of their first myocardial 
      infarction (MI). BACKGROUND: The delay between the onset of symptoms to the 
      initiation of medical care is a major determinant of prognosis in MI. The majority 
      of people experiencing MI are men. But few studies have been conducted solely on 
      men's experiences before seeking medical care for MI. The objective of this study 
      was to explore older men's experiences of symptoms and their reasoning during the 
      prehospital phase of their first MI. METHOD: Data collection was carried out through 
      individual interviews with 20 men representing the age range 65-80 (mean 71) years. 
      The participants were interviewed 3 days after admission for a confirmed first MI. 
      The interviews were designed to prompt the men to describe their symptoms and their 
      reasoning up to the decision to seek care. A qualitative content analysis was used 
      to analyse the interviews. FINDINGS: The prehospital phase in older men was found to 
      be a complex and extended journey. The symptoms were perceived from diffuse 
      ill-being to a cluster of alarming symptoms. The participants dealt with conceptions 
      about MI symptoms. They were unsure about the cause of their symptoms, which did not 
      correspond to their expectations about an MI, and whether they should seek medical 
      care. They had difficulty making the final decision to seek care and strived to 
      maintain a normal life. They initially tried to understand, reduce or treat the 
      symptoms by themselves. The decision to seek medical care preceded a movement from 
      uncertainty to conviction. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding older men's prehospital 
      experiences of MI is essential to reduce their patient decision times. This requires 
      knowledge about the complexity and dynamic evolvement of symptoms, beliefs and 
      strategies to maintain an ordinary life.

TI  - Understanding the complex role of a hospice spiritual counselor.
PG  - 353-5
LID - 10.1177/1049909113494746 [doi]
AB  - Hospice's professional roles in end-of-life care can be widely misunderstood by 
      physicians, patients, and family members as well as others who do not work directly 
      with them. The role of the spiritual counselor may be the most misunderstood due to 
      the nature of this professional title. Hospice care at the end of life is holistic 
      in that it is important to meet physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the 
      patient and their family. In order to provide the most complete and beneficial 
      end-of-life care, it is important to understand the complexity and the importance of 
      the role of the spiritual counselor.

TI  - Supportive Communication to Facilitate Chinese Patients' Adaptation to a Permanent 
      Colostomy: A Qualitative Case Study Approach.
PG  - 366-75
LID - 10.1097/SGA.0000000000000179 [doi]
AB  - This study, which is a part of action research, aims to explore how supportive 
      communication can impact individuals' adaptation to a permanent colostomy in a 
      Chinese cultural context. Two Chinese rectal cancer patients with complexity and 
      difficulty in living with a permanent colostomy were selected using a qualitative 
      case study approach. The researcher (H.T.) interacted with the participants along 
      their journey from the preoperative period until the third postoperative month after 
      discharge via face-to-face or telephone interviews. Content analysis was applied. 
      Supportive communication was characterized by "communication as a supportive tool," 
      which consisted of 4 elements: respect, description, empathy, and empowerment. The 
      nursing strategies included (1) developing a collaborative relationship with 
      patients and families; (2) understanding patients' concerns and problems; (3) 
      discussing potential solutions; (4) encouraging patients to take action; (5) 
      bringing out emotional expression; (6) normalizing negative emotions; and (7) 
      protecting hope. The findings of this study informed that supportive communication 
      is a valuable tool for nurses to provide informational and emotional support to 
      Chinese patients in order to enhance their adaptation to living with a permanent 
      colostomy. Developing an operational manual to enhance supportive communication for 
      patients with colostomy is suggested.

PG  - 115-7
LID - 10.1097/01.ASW.0000412908.43335.46 [doi]
AB  - With the aging population and increasing complexity of patients with pressure ulcers 
      (PrUs), as well as regulatory requirements, PrUs have become an important concern 
      for physicians. Although there are some studies that measure nurses' knowledge of 
      PrUs, there is a paucity of literature about physician knowledge of PrUs. Given that 
      the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is holding physicians accountable for 
      documenting PrU status on admission to hospitals and the increased need for 
      collaboration with revisions to long-term-care documentation MDS 3.0: Skin 
      Condition, physicians' knowledge regarding PrUs takes on new urgency. This study 
      reports on PrU knowledge of physicians using 2 tools: the Pieper Pressure Ulcer 
      Knowledge Tool and a wound photograph test. Physicians' mean scores of 69% on the 
      Pieper Tool were well below average scores of nurses' 76%. Physicians had greatest 
      difficulty identifying suspected deep tissue injury and unstageable ulcers. Pressure 
      ulcer content, including prevention, identification, staging, and treatment, needs 
      to be included in physician education.

LID - 10.1111/ppc.12177 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This article describes the evaluation of the implementation of a nursing 
      intervention, that is, the Systematic Activation Method (SAM), among inpatients with 
      late life depression (LLD). METHODS: A qualitative study in four clinical units for 
      old age psychiatry. RESULTS: We identified facilitators and barriers relating to 
      patient and nurse characteristics, as well as to contextual factors, from the 
      perspective of mental health nurses. The nature of the LLD and the quality of the 
      therapeutic relationship were major aspects that affected the implementation of the 
      SAM. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Given the complexity of the implementation process, 
      careful supervision and monitoring, with the active participation of management and 
      the multidisciplinary team, are necessary.

TI  - Development and validation of an instrument to assess patients' appraisal, emotions 
      and action tendencies preceding care-seeking in acute myocardial infarction: The 
      PA-AMI questionnaire.
PG  - 240-248
LID - 10.1177/1474515116652758 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing patient delay for patients afflicted by an acute myocardial 
      infarction is a task of great complexity, which might be alleviated if more factors 
      that influence this delay could be identified. Although a number of self-reported 
      instruments associated with patient delay exist, none of these taps the content of 
      the appraisal process related to patients' subjective emotions. AIM: The aim of this 
      study was to develop and validate a questionnaire aimed at assessing patients' 
      appraisal, emotions and action tendencies when afflicted by an acute myocardial 
      infarction. METHODS: An item pool was generated based on themes conceptualized in a 
      recent qualitative study of acute myocardial infarction patients' thoughts, feelings 
      and actions preceding the decision to seek medical care. The 'Think-Aloud Protocol' 
      and test-retest analysis at item level were performed. The modified item pool was 
      administered to 96 patients when treated for acute myocardial infarction. 
      Explorative factor analysis and principal component analysis with the non-linear 
      iterative partial least squares algorithm were performed to examine the underlying 
      factor structure of the items. RESULTS: The findings indicated three core dimensions 
      corresponding to three subscales, namely, 'symptom appraisal'; 'perceived inability 
      to act'; 'autonomy preservation'. The results demonstrated acceptable measures of 
      reliability and validity Conclusions: The PA-AMI questionnaire demonstrated 
      satisfactory psychometric properties. Assessment of the included core dimensions may 
      contribute to greater understanding of the appraisal processes for patients 
      afflicted by an acute myocardial infarction.

PG  - 157-62
LID - 10.1097/WON.0b013e318283bcd8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this cohort study was to evaluate the effect of a 1-year 
      intervention of an electronic medical record wound care template on the completeness 
      of wound care documentation and medical coding compared to a similar time interval 
      for the fiscal year preceding the intervention. METHODS: From October 1, 2006, to 
      September 30, 2007, a "good wound care" intervention was implemented at a rural 
      Veterans Affairs facility to prevent amputations in veterans with diabetes and foot 
      ulcers. The study protocol included a template with foot ulcer variables embedded in 
      the electronic medical record to facilitate data collection, support clinical 
      decision making, and improve ordering and medical coding. RESULTS: The intervention 
      group showed significant differences in complete documentation of good wound care 
      compared to the historic control group (χ = 15.99, P < .001), complete documentation 
      of coding for diagnoses and procedures (χ = 30.23, P < .001), and complete 
      documentation of both good wound care and coding for diagnoses and procedures (χ = 
      14.96, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An electronic wound care template improved 
      documentation of evidence-based interventions and facilitated coding for wound 
      complexity and procedures.

PG  - 131-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1744-6198.2011.00255.x [doi]
AB  - The increasing numbers of people seeking care for chronic disease has placed 
      unparalleled demands on nurses who journey with them as they grasp the meaning of 
      their altered health status. The complexity of the newly diagnosed chronic disease 
      can be overwhelming. Newly diagnosed elder patients need a refuge in which to 
      explore the uncertainties and challenges in managing a chronic illness. Reactions to 
      a new diagnosis are uniquely shaped by the elder person's culture, age, life 
      circumstances, and previous coping strategies. Six dichotomous response pairs are 
      posed: relief versus devastation, courage versus cowardice, disease obsession versus 
      disease aversion, rational thinking versus intuition, reawakening versus stuck, and 
      self-reliance versus dependence. Nurses can create a sanctuary for elderly patients 
      with protected space, presence, partnership, past to future orientation, and 
      perspective on life. Nurses who embrace this mission may find themselves returning 
      to the reasons they sought a nursing career, to support and strengthen elderly 
      people in the most vulnerable moments of their lives.

TI  - Prevention of functional decline in older hospitalized patients: nurses should play 
      a key role in safe and adequate care.
PG  - 106-13
LID - 10.1111/ijn.12134 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a discussion of knowledge and awareness regarding prevention of 
      functional decline in older hospitalized patients. Functional decline is experienced 
      by 30-60% of the older hospitalized patients, resulting in decreased independence 
      and other adverse health outcomes. One literature study and four cohort studies 
      (total n = 1628) were conducted to develop and validate an instrument to identify 
      older hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline. An evidence-based best 
      practice was developed to improve the quality of care for older patients. This paper 
      shows the relevance and the complexity of this problem and shows that patients at 
      risk can be recognized by four simple questions. Due to their ability to observe and 
      guide patients and their 24-h patient supervision, nurses should play a key role in 
      strategies to prevent functional decline. Nurses should assess the geriatric needs 
      in patients at risk and based on these initiate and coordinate multi-professional 
      interventions. Given the growing number of older people in western society and the 
      growing need for care, action to prevent functional decline cannot be withheld. 
      Knowledge of the ageing process, implementation of an evidence-based programme and a 
      multidisciplinary approach is a basic ingredient to prevent functional decline.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Internationally, older adults visit the ED at a rate higher than other 
      age groups. Little attention has been given to ED care for older people with 
      dementia, although concern for such care is growing with the increasing number of 
      individuals worldwide affected by this significant disabling problem. It is critical 
      to understand ED transitional processes and consequences because the complexity of 
      dementia care poses multiple challenges to optimizing safety, effectiveness and 
      quality of care during admission, assessment, and treatment in this setting. METHOD: 
      Using an interpretive, descriptive exploratory design with three iterative, 
      interrelated phases, we conducted interviews, created a photographic narrative 
      journal (PNJ), and finally held photo elicitation focus groups to identify factors 
      that facilitate or impede safe transitional care for community dwelling older adults 
      with dementia in two Canadian emergency departments, and to identify practice 
      solutions for nurses. We purposively sampled to recruit ten older adult-family 
      caregiver dyads, ten ED RNs, and four Nurse Practitioners. Data were analyzed using 
      constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Four interconnected reinforcing consequences 
      emerged from our analysis: being under-triaged; waiting and worrying about what was 
      wrong; time pressure with lack of attention to basic needs; and, relationships and 
      interactions leading to feeling ignored, forgotten and unimportant. Together these 
      consequences stem from a triage system that does not recognize atypical presentation 
      of disease and illness. This potentiated a cascade of vulnerability in older people 
      with dementia and their caregivers. Nurses experienced time pressure challenges that 
      impeded their ability to be responsive to basic care needs. CONCLUSIONS: In an aging 
      population where dementia is becoming more prevalent, the unit of care in the ED 
      must include both the older person and their family caregiver. Negative reinforcing 
      consequences can be interrupted when nurses communicate and engage more regularly 
      with the older adult-caregiver dyad to build trust. System changes are also needed 
      to support the ability of nurses to carry out best practices.

TI  - Ethical considerations on the value of patient knowledge in long-term care: a 
      qualitative study of patients suffering from Korsakoff 's syndrome.
PG  - 377-88
LID - 10.1177/0969733014534876 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study explores experiences of patients suffering from Korsakoff's 
      syndrome. It contributes to improved reflection on the value of patient knowledge. 
      BACKGROUND: An ethics of care perspective states the importance of moving to 
      patients in their vulnerable state of being, and to figure out patients' individual 
      needs necessary to provide good care. The information given by patients suffering 
      from Korsakoff's syndrome might be mistaken, invented and even not true. The value 
      of these patients' experiences and knowledge had not been researched to date. 
      METHOD: Data from six in-depth interviews were analysed concurrently through the 
      constant comparative method. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The principles of 
      voluntariness, confidentiality and anonymity were respected during the research 
      process. FINDINGS: Four important themes within patients' knowledge emerged: health 
      condition, involuntary admission into the nursing home, the daily routine and 
      interpretation of the caring abilities of healthcare professionals. The findings 
      show that our respondents were able to provide a window into their inner 
      perspective. CONCLUSION: This study deepens our understanding of the value of 
      patient knowledge in situations where patients see the world in a different manner 
      as do healthcare professionals. The conversations revealed personal subjective 
      knowledge which our respondents create and live by. Healthcare professionals are 
      encouraged to discover and affirm the understandings of these patients, and not be 
      prepossessed due to the diagnosis or general nursing home rules. Understanding 
      patients' unique knowledge through appreciation of the complexity and richness of 
      different views on the situation can assist to give a more humane response to 
      individual needs and pain. Health staff in healthcare institutions are encouraged to 
      evaluate the - unintended - effect of rigidly applied nursing home rules, and the 
      government is challenged to rethink its policy about care, and provide more 
      resources permitting relational care that nurtures the dignity of patients suffering 
      from Korsakoff's syndrome.

LID - 10.1017/ice.2015.75 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Valid comparison between hospitals for benchmarking or 
      pay-for-performance incentives requires accurate correction for underlying disease 
      severity (case-mix). However, existing models are either very simplistic or require 
      extensive manual data collection. OBJECTIVE To develop a disease severity prediction 
      model based solely on data routinely available in electronic health records for 
      risk-adjustment in mechanically ventilated patients. DESIGN Retrospective cohort 
      study. PARTICIPANTS Mechanically ventilated patients from a single tertiary medical 
      center (2006-2012). METHODS Predictors were extracted from electronic data 
      repositories (demographic characteristics, laboratory tests, medications, 
      microbiology results, procedure codes, and comorbidities) and assessed for 
      feasibility and generalizability of data collection. Models for in-hospital 
      mortality of increasing complexity were built using logistic regression. Estimated 
      disease severity from these models was linked to rates of ventilator-associated 
      events. RESULTS A total of 20,028 patients were initiated on mechanical ventilation, 
      of whom 3,027 deceased in hospital. For models of incremental complexity, area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.83 to 0.88. A simple model 
      including demographic characteristics, type of intensive care unit, time to 
      intubation, blood culture sampling, 8 common laboratory tests, and surgical status 
      achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% CI, 
      0.86-0.88) with adequate calibration. The estimated disease severity was associated 
      with occurrence of ventilator-associated events. CONCLUSIONS Accurate estimation of 
      disease severity in ventilated patients using electronic, routine care data was 
      feasible using simple models. These estimates may be useful for risk-adjustment in 
      ventilated patients. Additional research is necessary to validate and refine these 
      models.

AB  - The current study aimed to profile behaviors associated with dementia that pose 
      management difficulties for staff and determine whether existing rating scales 
      capture these reported behaviors. Staff in 17 nursing homes described the behavioral 
      symptoms of 229 residents with predominantly moderate-severe dementia associated 
      with management difficulties. Behaviors were categorized by an expert clinical panel 
      and compared to items in four dementia behavior rating scales. Staff reported 59 
      discrete behavioral symptoms, with physically agitated, aggressive verbal, 
      non-aggressive verbal, and aggressive physical behaviors most common, followed by 
      resistance to care and inappropriate social and sexual behaviors. Results suggested 
      that some scales omit important behaviors reported by staff for residents with 
      particularly challenging behaviors. The current study highlights the clinical 
      complexity faced by nursing home staff in managing residents with behavioral 
      symptoms of dementia. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 43(1), 34-43.].

TI  - The care of older adults in hospital: if it's common sense why isn't it common 
      practice?
PG  - 1573-82
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12529 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To present three converging myths that underlie the perception 
      that nursing care for older persons in hospital is simple in comparison with its 
      actual complexity. BACKGROUND: Literature provides strong evidence indicating that 
      the myths we discuss inherently arise from ageism, the social value of older 
      patients and the economic burden of being an older patient in hospital. These 
      powerful social discourses promote harm to older patients. Harm emerges from both 
      the omission of gerontological nursing knowledge and skill and the commission of 
      acts that unintentionally harm. A corresponding ethical challenge results for acute 
      care nurses. DESIGN: A discursive paper. METHODS: We illuminate gerontological 
      issues by discussing three myths. In myth one, we detail four clusters of 
      distinguishing characteristics in older hospitalised people. In the second myth, we 
      challenge the idea that the role of the acute care hospital is to attend only to 
      acute medical concerns. Finally, in the third myth, we address the issue of 
      incorporating functional assessment into the acute care nursing assessment. We argue 
      that functional assessment is poorly integrated and becomes acceptable only as long 
      as the medical regimen is managed appropriately. CONCLUSION: Safe quality care in 
      hospital for older adults requires a hybrid practice that integrates acute care 
      specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing knowledge and skill. Clinical 
      reasoning that integrates this type of nursing knowledge can prevent harm. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Integrating key elements of acute care nursing specialty 
      knowledge with gerontological nursing principles aids to prevent the omission of 
      care that is known to be harmful to older people. Conversely, the commission of 
      gerontologically sensitive acute care can enhance safety and promote quality care in 
      hospital.

TI  - Health-care professionals' documentation of wellbeing in patients following open 
      heart surgery: a content analysis of medical records.
PG  - 112-20

AB  - AIM: To explore health-care professionals' documentation of patient wellbeing in the 
      first five months after open heart surgery. BACKGROUND: Open heart surgery (coronary 
      artery bypass grafting or heart valve replacement) is an intervention aimed at 
      relief of symptoms and increased wellbeing. It is a complex procedure with deep 
      experiences encompassing physiological, psychological and social aspects. 
      Health-care professionals' documentation of expressions of decreased wellbeing 
      related to open heart surgery is an important basis for decisions and for the 
      understanding of patients' overall health situation. METHOD: Eighty medical records 
      were examined by means of qualitative and quantitative methods in order to explore 
      documentation of patient wellbeing at four points in time. The analysis was 
      performed by content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Documentation of 
      physical wellbeing was dominant on all occasions, while psychological wellbeing was 
      moderately well documented and social aspects of wellbeing were rarely documented. 
      CONCLUSION: The medical records did not adequately reflect the complexity of 
      undergoing open heart surgery. Hence the holistic approach was not confirmed in 
      health-care professionals' documentation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: 
      Managers need to support and work for a patient-centred approach in cardiac care, 
      resulting in patient documentation that reflects patient wellbeing as a whole.

TI  - A prospective, descriptive study to assess the reliability and usability of a rapid 
      foot screen for patients with diabetes mellitus in a complex continuing care 
      setting.
PG  - 28-34
AB  - Inlow's 60-second Diabetic Foot Screen is a paper-pencil tool developed to guide 
      professionals in the completion of a quick foot assessment of persons with diabetes 
      mellitus to determine recommended frequency of assessments. The tool has been used 
      in various healthcare settings and its reliability and validity previously tested in 
      acute and long-term care settings. The purpose of this study was to assess content, 
      time to complete assessment, ease of use, and reliability of the tool in a complex 
      continuing care setting. The tool includes questions about 10 variables; skin, 
      nails, deformities, footwear, temperature, range of motion, sensation, pulses, 
      dependent rubor, and erythema. Answers convert to a score ranging from 0 (low risk, 
      yearly screenings) to 23 (high risk, weekly screenings). Using the tool, the study 
      questionnaire, and a watch, three nurse assessors experienced in assessing the feet 
      of persons with diabetes completed 70 assessments on 35 patients during a period of 
      30 days. Content areas assessed included significance of comorbidities and interval 
      screening times. Mean time to complete the assessment was 7 minutes (range 2 to 21 
      minutes); 39% of assessments took 6 to 7 minutes. Times to perform assessment varied 
      widely due to the functional and cognitive well-being of the patient. Inter-rater 
      reliability was low (ICC 0.608 [95% confidence interval 0.349-0.781]), perhaps due 
      to varying interpretations of assessment parameters related to the complexity of the 
      study patient population. Comments suggest that some tool revisions may increase 
      ease of use as well as tool validity and reliability, especially for complex care 
      patients with multiple comorbidities.

TI  - Exploration of the family's role and strengths after a young woman is diagnosed with 
      breast cancer: views of women and their families.
PG  - 124-30
LID - 10.1016/j.ejon.2011.04.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This exploratory descriptive study examined the role and strengths of the 
      family when supporting the younger woman (<50 years) after a diagnosis of breast 
      cancer. The perspectives of women and family members were sought. METHOD: 
      Participants were recruited from oncology outpatient units in Australia. 
      Semi-structured interviews guided by the Family Resiliency Framework were undertaken 
      with 14 young women with breast cancer and 11 family members who reflected on the 
      roles of family. Transcripts were analysed individually and in family groupings. 
      RESULTS: Women with breast cancer and their family members experienced a range of 
      emotions during the treatment period. Roles within the family changed as members 
      responded to their circumstances. Analysis of interview transcripts identified the 
      following primary themes; 'just being there', 'paradox of help' and 'buffer from 
      society'. A secondary theme related to support, specifically 'the changing role of 
      support for family members', highlighting the strengths and experiences of family. 
      CONCLUSION: Recognition needs to be given to the complexity of changing roles 
      experienced by young women with breast cancer and their families. Young women with 
      breast cancer require unique forms of support because of the nature of their 
      experience. Family roles were shaped through a shared sense of commitment and open 
      communication amongst members. Families may demonstrate a range of strengths but are 
      also vulnerable during this stressful period. Health professionals need to be aware 
      of the possible needs of families, assess their adaptation to changing 
      circumstances, and intervene through the provision of information, and counselling 
      to enhance coping.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to identify factors associated with occupational exposure to biological 
      material among nursing professionals. METHOD: a cross-sectional study was conducted 
      in a high complexity hospital of a city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Nursing 
      professionals were interviewed from March to November 2015. All ethical aspects were 
      observed. RESULT: among the 226 professionals interviewed, 17.3% suffered 
      occupational exposure to potentially contaminated biological material, with 61.5% 
      being percutaneous. Factors such as age (p=0.003), professional experience in 
      nursing (p=0.015), and experience at the institution (p=0.032) were associated with 
      the accidents with biological material. CONCLUSION: most accidents with biological 
      material among nursing professionals were percutaneous. Age, professional 
      experience, and experience at the institution were considered factors associated 
      with occupational exposure.

AB  - There are many established benefits of exercise for older adults. Emerging studies 
      suggest that it may even be able to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      in older adults with the disease. However, it is yet unknown how bedside nurses can 
      monitor ongoing exercise participation in this population due to the complexity and 
      impact of AD symptoms. The purpose of this study is to provide bedside nurses with 
      tools to capture actual received exercise doses to ensure adequate exercise 
      participation by older adults with AD. This study is a secondary data analysis of a 
      master study in which 8 participants who were clinically diagnosed with AD 
      participated in moderate intensity aerobic exercise for 10 to 45 minutes, three 
      times per week, for 6 months. The results show that participants were able to meet 
      the overall exercise prescription 74.3% of the time. The findings of this study 
      suggest that bedside nurses are able to monitor the actual exercise delivery 
      (frequency, intensity, and duration) to ensure exercise participation.

      supervision satisfaction.
PG  - 611-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2011.01260.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine the influence of nurse manager span (number of direct report staff), 
      time in staff contact, transformational leadership practices and operational hours 
      on nurse supervision satisfaction. BACKGROUND: Increasing role complexity has 
      intensified the boundary spanning functions of managers. Because work demands and 
      scope vary by management position, time in staff contact rather than span may better 
      explain managers' capacity to support staff. METHODS: A descriptive, correlational 
      design was used to collect cross-sectional survey and prospective work log and 
      administrative data from a convenience sample of 558 nurses in 51 clinical areas and 
      31 front-line nurse managers from four acute care hospitals in 2007-2008. Data were 
      analysed using hierarchical linear modelling. RESULTS: Span, but not time in staff 
      contact, interacted with leadership and operational hours to explain supervision 
      satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: With compressed operational hours, supervision 
      satisfaction was lower with highly transformational leadership in combination with 
      wider spans. With extended operational hours, supervision satisfaction was higher 
      with highly transformational leadership, and this effect was more pronounced under 
      wider spans. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Operational hours, which influence 
      the manager's daily span (average number of direct report staff working per 
      weekday), should be factored into the design of front-line management positions.

TI  - The health professional-patient-relationship in conventional versus complementary

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore differences between conventional medicine (COM) and 
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) regarding the attitude toward and the 
      perceived use of shared decision-making (SDM) from the health professional 
      perspective. METHODS: Thirty guideline-based interviews with German GPs and 
      nonmedical practitioners were conducted using qualitative analysis for 
      interpretation. RESULTS: The health professional-patient-relationship in CAM differs 
      from that in COM, as SDM is perceived more often. Reasons for this include external 
      context variables (e.g., longer consultation time) and internal provider beliefs 
      (e.g., attitude toward SDM). German health care policy was regarded as one of the 
      most critical factors which affected the relationship between GPs and their patients 
      and their practice of SDM. CONCLUSION: Differences between COM and CAM regarding the 
      attitude toward and the perceived use of SDM are attributable to diverse concepts of 
      medicine, practice context variables and internal provider factors. Therefore, the 
      perceived feasibility of SDM depends on the complexity of different occupational 
      socialization processes and thus, different value systems between COM and CAM. 
      PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Implementation barriers such as insufficient communication 
      skills, lacking SDM training or obedient patients should be reduced. Especially in 
      COM, contextual variables such as political restrictions need to be eliminated to 
      successfully implement SDM.

AB  - INTRODUCTION:   Nursing models and terminologies can contribute to research the 
      nature of nursing care. AIM:   The aim of this study was to describe nursing 
      diagnoses in acute- and long-term elderly care. METHODS:   A point prevalence survey 
      was conducted on 240 patients. The International Classification for Nursing Practice 
      was used to describe nursing diagnoses, and a conceptual model was used to 
      categorize them in nursing needs. RESULTS:   A total of 2,673 diagnoses were 
      detected. Mean was higher in nursing home than in hospital (t test =-3.688; p = 
      .0003). Prevalent diagnoses were significantly different. DISCUSSION:   High 
      complexity, with different issues for nurses, was observed both in acute- and in 
      long-term settings. CONCLUSION:   The results could help to comprehend the nature of 
      older persons needs and could contribute to the development of an International 
      Classification for Nursing Practice catalogue for elderly care.

AB  - AIMS: This paper is a report of a study of quality of care delivered by an emergency 
      department fast track unit where both doctors and an emergency nurse practitioner 
      treated patients. BACKGROUND: Fast track units were established in Australian 
      emergency departments to meet the needs of low complexity emergency department 
      patients. Few studies have reported on the overall quality of care delivered by 
      these units. METHODS: A convenience sample of adult patients triaged to an 
      Australian emergency department fast track unit between April 2010 and April 2011 
      were randomised to care by a doctor or an emergency nurse practitioner. Quality of 
      care was measured using patient satisfaction, follow up health status using Short 
      Form 12 and adverse event rate (missed fractures or unplanned representations). 
      RESULTS: A total of 320 patients were enrolled into the study. Of the 236 patients 
      who submitted completed survey forms, median satisfaction scores were 22 out of 25 
      with 84% of patients rating care as "excellent" or "very good". At two week follow 
      up, health status score was comparable to normal healthy populations. When comparing 
      study groups, patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the ENP group 
      compared to DR group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients received high quality of care in this 
      fast track unit where both nurse practitioner and doctors treated patients. 
      Emergency nurse practitioners were associated with higher patient satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if the pattern of monthly medical 
      expense can be used to identify individuals at risk of dying, thus supporting 
      providers in proactively engaging in advanced care planning discussions. BACKGROUND: 
      Identifying the right time to discuss end of life can be difficult. Improved 
      predictive capacity has made it possible for nurse leaders to use large data sets to 
      guide clinical decision making. METHODS: We examined the patterns of monthly medical 
      expense of Medicare beneficiaries with life-limiting illness during the last 24 
      months of life using analysis of variance, t tests, and stepwise hierarchical linear 
      modeling. RESULTS: In the final year of life, monthly medical expense increases 
      rapidly for all disease groupings and forms distinct patterns of change. CONCLUSION: 
      Type of condition can be used to classify decedents into distinctly different cost 
      trajectories. Conditions including chronic disease, system failure, or cancer may be 
      used to identify patients who may benefit from supportive care.

AB  - The purpose of this cross-sectional observational study was to explore depressive 
      symptoms, among 377 women, during hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 
      Women were screened for depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory-II 
      (BDI-II). Pearson chi-squared tests for independence were used for comparisons 
      between categorical variables and t-tests for independent samples were used for 
      comparisons between continuous variables. Tukey's honestly significant difference 
      test along with one-way anova test was used to conduct multiple comparisons between 
      the three defined age groups ranging from 29-49, 50-64 to ≥65 years. A total of 118 
      women screened positive for depression (BDI-II score ≥ 14). The percentage of women 
      that met the criteria for a positive depression screening was significantly 
      different between the three age groups. The proportion of depressed women who 
      reported feelings of sadness, past failures, punishment, self-dislike, agitation, 
      worthlessness, sleep disturbances and irritability varied significantly by age 
      group. Study findings indicate that symptom experience and severity may differ 
      across a lifetime. These results support the need to understand the complexity of 
      depressive symptoms experienced by women. The ability to understand and recognize 
      depressive symptoms in women, with ACS, may assist healthcare professionals with the 
      management of a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor.

AB  - The increasing complexity of healthcare systems is driving changes in the academic 
      preparation of nurse leaders. The number of doctorate of nursing practice programs 
      has increased. Leaders in the Council on Graduate Education for Administration in 
      Nursing (CGEAN) were interested in learning how graduate nursing leadership programs 
      have responded. An electronic survey was administered to CGEAN members to understand 
      the emphasis of their graduate curricula. Results demonstrate good alignment between 
      academic programs, American Association of College of Nursing essentials, and 
      American Organization of Nurse Executives competencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimising time to treatment onset for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
      in the emergency department (ED) is essential, yet little is understood about the 
      interactions between variables affecting it. The aim of this study was to develop a 
      regression tree model explicating the influence of patient and non-patient factors 
      on the time taken to commence treatment for patients with AMI in Victorian EDs. 
      METHODS: A regression tree model for variables impacting time to treatment was 
      developed on retrospective data for patients aged 18-85 years with AMI treated in 
      Victorian EDs from 2005 to 2010 (n=21,080). Data were partitioned into three 
      subsets, with a complexity parameter set at 0.0005. RESULTS: Four variables emerged 
      in the final regression tree model: triage score; mode of arrival; area of 
      residence; and patient sex. The variable most influencing time to treatment onset 
      for AMI was triage category. For undertriaged patients, treatment time patterns were 
      affected by arrival mode, residential location and their sex, significantly 
      extending delays to treatment onset. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between specific 
      variables influenced whether patients with AMI were treated with equity in Victorian 
      EDs, resulting in previously unidentified evidence-practice gaps and an improved 
      understanding of which patient groups were vulnerable to delayed treatment for AMI.

AB  - Few researchers have examined how the components of the Practice Environment Scale 
      of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) relate to nurses' well-being at multiple 
      organizational levels. The objective of the study was to perform a multilevel 
      assessment of the relationships of the PES-NWI subscales with three nurse outcomes: 
      job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and turnover intentions. Additionally, we 
      tested the multilevel factor structure of the PES-NWI. In a sample of 699 full-time 
      registered nurses in 79 units and 9 branches of a hospital system, relationships of 
      the NWI with nurse outcomes were fairly consistent across levels of analysis. 
      However, subscales contributed differently to the three outcomes, demonstrating the 
      complexity of environmental influences on nurses' work experience.

TI  - Single-use NPWT for the treatment of complex orthopaedic surgical and trauma wounds.
PG  - S5-9
LID - 10.12968/jowc.2013.22.Sup10.S5 [doi]
AB  - Orthopaedic limb reconstruction patients often have wounds that are difficult to 
      heal either due to the underlying problems, their surgery, underlying comorbidities 
      or a combination of these factors. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a 
      useful tool with which to manage these wounds; however, many systems are not ideal 
      for use in the patient's home, due in part to size and complexity. There are also 
      staff training issues if transferring patients to an area which does not routinely 
      use negative pressure systems. This paper reports the outcomes for some of the 
      patients who were treated with a novel, single-use NPWT device in a orthopaedic 
      trauma/limb reconstruction unit.

TI  - Successful aging theory and the patient with chronic renal disease: application in 
      the clinical setting.
PG  - 255-60, 270
AB  - As life expectancies increase, nurses will care for more individuals with chronic 
      conditions, one of which is chronic renal disease. Increasing diversity and 
      complexity of older adult healthcare needs signals a need to reconceptualize 
      perceptions of successful aging. By emphasizing health promotion and adaptation, 
      successful aging is possible for those with chronic renal disease. This article 
      provides an overview of theory-based strategies for fostering successful aging in 
      the patient with chronic renal disease.

TI  - Psychosocial needs of cancer patients living in the Adirondacks: a needs assessment.
PG  - 22-9
AB  - As the national conversation on solutions to healthcare factors such as 
      affordability and access is likely to intensify, health inequities continue to 
      persist in rural areas. National studies suggest a growing, aging, rural population 
      impacting the revenues of local healthcare facilities, as well as contributing to 
      complexity of care. This paper examines factors influencing the health of rural 
      citizens in upstate New York and offers the results of an initial needs assessment 
      looking at the psychosocial healthcare needs of cancer patients living in the 
      Adirondack Park region. Patients were surveyed regarding their perceptions of 
      psychosocial needs and experiences as a cancer patient. Psychosocial factors while 
      acknowledged as important influences on recovery and healing remain an 
      underdeveloped intervention toward improving the quality of cancer care. 
      Recommendations are made based on the results to enhance the quality of life for 
      this vulnerable population.
