AB  - Frailty is a complex of symptoms that is characterized by impaired stress tolerance 
      due to a decline in the functionality of different organs. Due to its multifactorial 
      aetiology, several definitions and assessments of this symptom complex have been 
      developed, of which the Fried Frailty Score (Phenotype Score) and the broader 
      Frailty Index (Deficit Accumulation Index) are the most commonly used. The 
      prevalence of frailty increases with age independently of the assessment instrument 
      and ranges between 4 and 59% in community-dwelling elderly populations and is higher 
      in women than in men. The actual prevalence rate in a population depends on the 
      prevalence of chronic diseases including depression, nutritional status, and 
      inherently socio-economic background and education. Frailty is, however, not a 
      steady state and progression, but also reversion is common. Although numerous 
      studies on the prevalence of frailty have been conducted, systematic assessments in 
      different populations are rare, which reduces the comparability of results. 
      Similarly heterogeneous, but less frequent are studies on the incidence and on 
      trajectories and transitions of frailty, calling for further, more systematic 
      studies on this topic.

AB  - Perioperative management of older adults is a complex field that is heavily 
      influenced by the clinical heterogeneity of older adults. Frailty-a geriatric 
      syndrome in which a patient is more vulnerable to stressors due to decreases in 
      physical function and reserve-has been indicative of adverse postoperative outcomes. 
      Many tools have been developed to measure frailty that incorporate a variety of 
      factors including physical and cognitive function, comorbidities, self-reported 
      measures of health, and clinical judgment. Most of these frailty assessment tools 
      are able to identify a subset of patients at risk of adverse outcomes including 
      postoperative complications, longer hospital length of stay, discharge to a higher 
      level of care, and mortality. Frailty assessment before surgical interventions can 
      also guide discussions among patients, their families, anesthesiologists, and 
      surgeons to tailor operative plans for patients to mitigate this increased risk. 
      Studies are ongoing to identify interventions in frail patients that can improve 
      postoperative outcomes, but high-quality data in the form of randomized controlled 
      trials are lacking at this time.

TI  - Approach to frailty in the elderly in primary care and the community.
PG  - 240-245
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2018052 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a distinct clinical syndrome wherein the individual has low reserves and 
      is highly vulnerable to internal and external stressors. Although it is associated 
      with disability and multiple comorbidities, it can also be present in individuals 
      who seem healthy. Frailty is multidimensional and its pathophysiology is complex. 
      Early identification and intervention can potentially decrease or reverse frailty, 
      especially in the early stages. Primary care physicians, community nurses and 
      community social networks have important roles in the identification of pre-frail 
      and frail elderly through the use of simple frailty screening tools and rapid 
      geriatric assessments. Appropriate interventions that can be initiated in a primary 
      care setting include a targeted medical review for reversible medical causes of 
      frailty, medication appropriateness, nutritional advice and exercise prescription. 
      With ongoing training and education, the multidisciplinary engagement and 
      coordination of care of the elderly in the community can help to build resilience 
      and combat frailty in our rapidly ageing society.

TI  - Complex interventions to improve physical function and maintain independent living 
      in elderly people: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 725-35
LID - 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60342-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In old age, reduction in physical function leads to loss of 
      independence, the need for hospital and long-term nursing-home care, and premature 
      death. We did a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of community-based 
      complex interventions in preservation of physical function and independence in 
      elderly people. METHODS: We searched systematically for randomised controlled trials 
      assessing community-based multifactorial interventions in elderly people (mean age 
      at least 65 years) living at home with at least 6 months of follow-up. Outcomes 
      studied were living at home, death, nursing-home and hospital admissions, falls, and 
      physical function. We did a meta-analysis of the extracted data. FINDINGS: We 
      identified 89 trials including 97 984 people. Interventions reduced the risk of not 
      living at home (relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.97). Interventions reduced 
      nursing-home admissions (0.87, 0.83-0.90), but not death (1.00, 0.97-1.02). Risk of 
      hospital admissions (0.94, 0.91-0.97) and falls (0.90, 0.86-0.95) were reduced, and 
      physical function (standardised mean difference -0.08, -0.11 to -0.06) was better in 
      the intervention groups than in other groups. Benefit for any specific type or 
      intensity of intervention was not noted. In populations with increased death rates, 
      interventions were associated with reduced nursing-home admission. Benefit in trials 
      was particularly evident in studies started before 1993. INTERPRETATION: Complex 
      interventions can help elderly people to live safely and independently, and could be 
      tailored to meet individuals' needs and preferences.

TI  - Interdisciplinary Home Visits for Individuals with Advanced Parkinson's Disease and 
      Related Disorders.
PG  - 1226-1232
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15337 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisymptom, neurodegenerative disease 
      affecting primarily older adults. With progression, many individuals become 
      homebound and removed from coordinated, expert care, resulting in excess morbidity, 
      mortality, and healthcare expenditures in acute care settings and institutions. Home 
      visit care models have achieved the triple aim of improving individual and 
      population health while reducing costs in many frail, community-dwelling geriatric 
      cohorts. This study details a novel, interdisciplinary home visit program 
      specifically designed for individuals with PD and related disorders and their family 
      caregivers built upon best practice principles in the care of multimorbid older 
      adults. At each quarterly home visit, a movement disorders-trained neurologist, 
      social worker, and nurse work in parallel with the individual and caregiver to 
      complete a history, physical, detailed medication reconciliation, psychosocial needs 
      assessment, and home safety assessment. A comprehensive, person-centered plan is 
      agreed upon, referrals to community resources are made, standardized documentation 
      is shared, and follow-up communication is instituted. In the first 2 years, 272 
      visits were conducted with 85 individuals who represent one of the oldest, most 
      disabled PD populations reported. Satisfaction with and retention in the program 
      were high. This study represents the first translation of the success of 
      interdisciplinary and home-based geriatric care models to a population with a 
      specific neurological disease. Preliminary evidence supports the need for such 
      programs in vulnerable populations. Future studies will prospectively assess 
      person-centered outcomes, the effect of using telemedicine on sustainability, and 
      cost effectiveness.

LID - 10.7748/ns.30.16.50.s46 [doi]
AB  - Pressure ulcers are painful and cause discomfort, have a negative effect on quality 
      of life, and are costly to treat. The incidence and severity of preventable pressure 
      ulcers is an important indicator of quality of care; it is essential that healthcare 
      providers monitor prevalence and incidence rates to ensure that care strategies 
      implemented are effective. Frail older people are at increased risk of developing 
      pressure ulcers. This article discusses the complexities of preventing pressure 
      ulcers in frail older people and emphasises the importance of structured educational 
      programmes that incorporate effective clinical leadership and multidisciplinary 
      teamwork.

AB  - Frailty and falls are closely associated with each other as well as with disability, 
      hospitalization, and death. Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail 
      older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a 
      one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 
      community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. 
      After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of 
      falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail 
      participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a 
      viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where 
      these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a 
      lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.

TI  - Family conferences and shared prioritisation to improve patient safety in the frail 
      elderly (COFRAIL): study protocol of a cluster randomised intervention trial in 
      primary care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty in elderly patients is associated with an increased risk of poor 
      health outcomes, including falls, delirium, malnutrition, hospitalisation, and 
      mortality. Because polypharmacy is recognised as a possible major contributor to the 
      pathogenesis of geriatric frailty, reducing inappropriate medication exposure is 
      supposed to be a promising approach to improve health-related quality of life and 
      prevent adverse outcomes. A major challenge for the process of deprescribing of 
      inappropriate polypharmacy is to improve the communication between general 
      practitioner (GPs), patient and family carer. This study investigates the effects of 
      a complex intervention in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy living at home. 
      METHODS: This is a cluster randomised controlled trial including 136 GPs and 676 
      patients. Patients with a positive clinical screening for frailty are eligible if 
      they are aged 70 years or older, receiving family or professional nursing care at 
      home, and taking in five or more drugs per day. Exclusion criteria are higher grade 
      of dementia and life expectancy of 6 months or less. The GPs of the intervention 
      group receive an educational training promoting a deprescribing guideline and 
      providing information on how to conduct a family conference focussing on 
      prioritisation of treatment goals concerning drug therapy. During the 1-year 
      intervention, GPs are expected to perform a total of three family conferences, each 
      including a structured medication review with patients and their family carers. GPs 
      of the control group will receive no training and will deliver care as usual. 
      Geriatric assessment of all patients will be performed by study nurses during home 
      visits at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is the 
      hospitalisation rate during the observation period of 12 months. Secondary outcomes 
      are number and appropriateness of medications, mobility, weakness, cognition, 
      depressive disorder, health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, 
      weight, and costs of health care use. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence 
      for a pragmatic co-operative and patient-centred educational intervention using 
      family conferences to improve patient safety in frail elderly patients with 
      polypharmacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00015055 (WHO

AB  - Frailty engenders a recognizable clinical syndrome of vulnerability to stressors 
      related to impaired physiologic reserve that primarily occurs among older adults. 
      Features of frailty include weight loss, exhaustion, muscle weakness, performance 
      impairment, and cognitive slowing and can be identified independent of comorbid 
      conditions. Among frail older adults, anemia prevalence is markedly increased. The 
      interaction between anemia and frailty is complex and confidently separating cause 
      and effect may not be possible. Nevertheless, anemia functions as a powerful 
      prognostic factor for the development of frailty related problems such as muscle 
      weakness, reduced performance, falls, and mortality. Further, mildly reduced 
      hemoglobin shows a similar association with adverse outcomes. The data strongly 
      intimate that anemia predisposes or accelerates the development of frailty. Anemia 
      interventional studies are sorely needed to determine whether treatment may mitigate 
      either the development of frailty and/or the sequela of frailty.

AB  - Aging together with multimorbidity, polymedication and various social factors are 
      some of the determinants that lead to increasing complexity of care in the elderly, 
      thus making it difficult for health systems to meet their needs. To approach this 
      new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal health and social care 
      systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing specialists trained to 
      address the needs of older people from a perspective of comprehensive care, both for 
      healthy aging, and for the different health problems of this population group, 
      characterized by the consequences of aging and chronicity, towards dependence, and 
      develop the powers established by law in the framework of an interdisciplinary team, 
      for those who have been trained and accredited, thus adding value to the response 
      that health systems have to provide for this growing problem of the 
      'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.

TI  - Risk Prediction for Adverse Outcomes for Frail Older Persons with Complex Healthcare 
      and Social Care Needs Admitted to a Community Virtual Ward Model.
PG  - 915-926
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S236895 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Population ageing is challenging healthcare systems with limited resources, 
      necessitating the development of new care models to address the needs of older, 
      frail community-dwellers. Community Virtual Wards (CVW) reduce adverse events in 
      these patients. We examined the effect of an established CVW on pre-defined health 
      trajectories (between "stable", "deteriorating", and "unstable" states) and 
      characteristics that increased the likelihood of adverse healthcare outcomes 
      (hospitalization, institutionalization and death). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We 
      collected prospective data on frail patients admitted to a CVW in a single centre in 
      Ireland. Relationships between risk scores, health states and adverse outcomes at 
      30, 60 and 90 days after admission were examined using multinomial regression 
      analysis. RESULTS: In total, 88 community-dwellers, mean (±SD) age of 82.8 ±6.4 
      years, were included. Most were severely frail on the Rockwood Clinical Frailty 
      Scale (mean 6.8/9 ±1.33). Reaching stability ("stable" state) within 30 days was a 
      predictor for stability at 60 and 90 days and remaining at home. Stability was also 
      associated with fewer care episodes (<2) (p=<0.001), a requirement for fewer 
      healthcare professionals (HCP) (<7) (p<0.001) and lower risk of delirium (p<0.001). 
      By contrast, being "unstable" at 60 days increased the numbers of HCP referrals (>7) 
      and was predictive of more acute episodes (>2) and institutionalization or death 
      (p<0.001). Predictors of adverse outcomes of either institutionalization or death 
      included frailty status, function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risk and 
      cognition. CONCLUSION: A CVW model can provide a framework for monitoring and case 
      management to support older people to remain at home or identify those at risk of 
      institutional care. The use of defined health states helped to stratify those at 
      lower or higher risk in an already high-risk frail population. Level of frailty, 
      function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risks and cognition were predictive of 
      remaining at home and reaching a level of stability or instability/deterioration and 
      institutional care.

TI  - Quality of life of older persons in nursing homes after the implementation of a 
      knowledge-based palliative care intervention.
PG  - e12258
LID - 10.1111/opn.12258 [doi]
LID - e12258
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goals of palliative care are to relieve suffering and promote 
      quality of life. Palliative care for older persons has been less prioritised than 
      palliative care for younger people with cancer, which may lead to unnecessary 
      suffering and decreased quality of life at the final stage of life. AIM: To evaluate 
      whether a palliative care intervention had any influence on the perceived quality of 
      life of older persons (≥65 years). METHODS: This study was conducted as a complex 
      intervention performed with an experimental crossover design. The intervention was 
      implemented in 20 nursing homes, with a six-month intervention period in each 
      nursing home. Twenty-three older persons (≥65 years) in the intervention group and 
      29 in the control group were interviewed using the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD 
      questionnaires at both baseline and follow-up. The collected data were analysed 
      using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare paired data between baseline and 
      follow-up. RESULTS: In the intervention group, no statistically significant 
      increases in quality of life were found. This result contrasted with the control 
      group, which revealed statistically significant declines in quality of life at both 
      the dimension and item levels. Accordingly, this study showed a trend of decreased 
      health after nine months in both the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: It 
      is reasonable to believe that quality of life decreases with age as part of the 
      natural course of the ageing process. However, it seems that the palliative care 
      approach of the intervention prevented unnecessary quality of life decline by 
      supporting sensory abilities, autonomy and social participation among older persons 
      in nursing homes. From the ageing perspective, it may not be realistic to strive for 
      an increased quality of life in older people living in nursing homes; maybe the goal 
      should be to delay or prevent reduced quality of life. Based on this perspective, 
      the intervention prevented decline in quality of life in nursing home residents. 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The high number of deaths shows the importance to 
      identify palliative care needs in older persons at an early stage to prevent or 
      delay deterioration of quality of life.

TI  - Differences in levels of albumin, ALT, AST, γ-GT and creatinine in frail, moderately 
      healthy and healthy elderly individuals.
PG  - 471-478
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2017-0311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reference intervals are widely used as decision tools, providing the 
      physician with information about whether the analyte values indicate ongoing disease 
      process. Reference intervals are generally based on individuals without diagnosed 
      diseases or use of medication, which often excludes elderly. The aim of the study 
      was to assess levels of albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST), creatinine and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) in frail, 
      moderately healthy and healthy elderly indivuduals. METHODS: Blood samples were 
      collected from individuals >80 years old, nursing home residents, in the Elderly in 
      Linköping Screening Assessment and Nordic Reference Interval Project, a total of 569 
      individuals. They were divided into three cohorts: frail, moderately healthy and 
      healthy, depending on cognitive and physical function. Albumin, ALT, AST, creatinine 
      and γ-GT were analyzed using routine methods. RESULTS: Linear regression predicted 
      factors for 34% of the variance in albumin were activities of daily living (ADL), 
      gender, stroke and cancer. ADLs, gender and weight explained 15% of changes in ALT. 
      For AST levels, ADLs, cancer and analgesics explained 5% of changes. Kidney disease, 
      gender, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease explained 25% of the variation in creatinine levels and MMSE explained three 
      per cent of γ-GT variation. CONCLUSIONS: Because a group of people are at the same 
      age, they should not be assessed the same way. To interpret results of laboratory 
      tests in elderly is a complex task, where reference intervals are one part, but far 
      from the only one, to take into consideration.

TI  - Models of primary care for frail patients.
PG  - 601-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss models of care for frail seniors provided in primary care 
      settings and those developed by Canadian FPs. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Ovid MEDLINE 
      and the Cochrane database were searched from 2010 to January 2014 using the terms 
      models of care, family medicine, elderly, and geriatrics. MAIN MESSAGE: New models 
      of funding for primary care have opened opportunities for ways of caring for complex 
      frail older patients. Severity of frailty is an important factor, and more severe 
      frailty should prompt consideration of using an alternate model of care for a 
      senior. In Canada, models in use include integrated care systems, shared care 
      models, home-based care models, and family medicine specialty clinics. No one model 
      should take precedence but FPs should be involved in developing and implementing 
      strategies that meet the needs of individual patients and communities. 
      Organizational and remunerative supports will need to be put in place to achieve 
      widespread uptake of such models. CONCLUSION: Given the increased numbers of frail 
      seniors and the decrease in access to hospital beds, prioritized care models should 
      include ones focused on optimizing health, decreasing frailty, and helping to avoid 
      hospitalization of frail and well seniors alike. The Health Care of the Elderly 
      Program Committee at the College of Family Physicians of Canada is hosting a 
      repository for models of care used by FPs and is asking physicians to submit their 
      ideas for how to best care for frail seniors.

TI  - The CareWell-primary care program: design of a cluster controlled trial and process 
      evaluation of a complex intervention targeting community-dwelling frail elderly.
PG  - 115
LID - 10.1186/1471-2296-13-115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With increasing age and longevity, the rising number of frail elders 
      with complex and numerous health-related needs demands a coordinated health care 
      delivery system integrating cure, care and welfare. Studies on the effectiveness of 
      such comprehensive chronic care models targeting frail elders show inconclusive 
      results. The CareWell-primary care program is a complex intervention targeting 
      community-dwelling frail elderly people, that aims to prevent functional decline, 
      improve quality of life, and reduce or postpone hospital and nursing home admissions 
      of community dwelling frail elderly. METHODS/DESIGN: The CareWell-primary care study 
      includes a (cost-) effectiveness study and a comprehensive process evaluation. In a 
      one-year pragmatic, cluster controlled trial, six general practices are non-randomly 
      recruited to adopt the CareWell-primary care program and six control practices will 
      deliver 'care as usual'. Each practice includes a random sample of fifty frail 
      elders aged 70 years or above in the cost-effectiveness study. A sample of patients 
      and informal caregivers and all health care professionals participating in the 
      CareWell-primary care program are included in the process evaluation. In the 
      cost-effectiveness study, the primary outcome is the level of functional abilities 
      as measured with the Katz-15 index. Hierarchical mixed-effects regression 
      models/multilevel modeling approach will be used, since the study participants are 
      nested within the general practices. Furthermore, incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios will be calculated as costs per QALY gained and as costs weighed against 
      functional abilities. In the process evaluation, mixed methods will be used to 
      provide insight in the implementation degree of the program, patients' and 
      professionals' approval of the program, and the barriers and facilitators to 
      implementation. DISCUSSION: The CareWell-primary care study will provide new 
      insights into the (cost-) effectiveness, feasibility, and barriers and facilitators 
      for implementation of this complex intervention in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      The CareWell-primary care study is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol 
      Registration System: NCT01499797.

TI  - Using the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) to improve cost-effectiveness of 
      interventions in multimorbid frail older persons: results and final recommendations 
      from the MPI_AGE European Project.
PG  - 861-868
LID - 10.1007/s40520-020-01516-0 [doi]
AB  - MPI_AGE is a European Union co-funded research project aimed to use the 
      Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), a validated Comprehensive Geriatric 
      Assessment (CGA)-based prognostic tool, to develop predictive rules that guide 
      clinical and management decisions in older people in different European countries. A 
      series of international studies performed in different settings have shown that the 
      MPI is useful to predict mortality and risk of hospitalization in community-dwelling 
      older subjects at population level. Furthermore, studies performed in older people 
      who underwent a CGA before admission to a nursing home or receiving homecare 
      services showed that the MPI successfully identified groups of persons who could 
      benefit, in terms of reduced mortality, of specific therapies such as statins in 
      diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation 
      and antidementia drugs in cognitive decline. A prospective trial carried out in nine 
      hospitals in Europe and Australia demonstrated that the MPI was able to predict not 
      only in-hospital and long-term mortality, but also institutionalization, 
      re-hospitalization and receiving homecare services during the one-year follow-up 
      after hospital discharge. The project also explored the association between MPI and 
      mortality in hospitalized older patients in need of complex procedures such as 
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation or enteral tube feeding. Evidence from these 
      studies has prompted the MPI_AGE Investigators to formulate recommendations for 
      healthcare providers, policy makers and the general population which may help to 
      improve the cost-effectiveness of appropriate health care interventions for older 
      patients.

TI  - Fidelity and moderating factors in complex interventions: a case study of a 
      continuum of care program for frail elderly people in health and social care.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/1748-5908-7-23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies measuring fidelity of complex interventions have mainly 
      evaluated adherence, and not taken factors affecting adherence into consideration. A 
      need for studies that clarify the concept of fidelity and the function of factors 
      moderating fidelity has been emphasized. The aim of the study was to systematically 
      evaluate implementation fidelity and possible factors influencing fidelity of a 
      complex care continuum intervention for frail elderly people. METHODS: The 
      intervention was a systematization of the collaboration between a nurse with 
      geriatric expertise situated at the emergency department, the hospital ward staff, 
      and a multi-professional team with a case manager in the municipal care services for 
      older people. Implementation was evaluated between September 2008 and May 2010 with 
      observations of work practices, stakeholder interviews, and document analysis 
      according to a modified version of The Conceptual Framework for Implementation 
      Fidelity. RESULTS: A total of 16 of the 18 intervention components were to a great 
      extent delivered as planned, while some new components were added to the model. No 
      changes in the frequency or duration of the 18 components were observed, but the 
      dose of the added components varied over time. Changes in fidelity were caused in a 
      complex, interrelated fashion by all the moderating factors in the framework, i.e., 
      context, staff and participant responsiveness, facilitation, recruitment, and 
      complexity. DISCUSSION: The Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity was 
      empirically useful and included comprehensive measures of factors affecting 
      fidelity. Future studies should focus on developing the framework with regard to how 
      to investigate relationships between the moderating factors and fidelity over time.

TI  - Nurse Practitioners' Role in Improving Service for Elderly Trauma Patients.
PG  - 174-179
LID - 10.1097/JTN.0000000000000445 [doi]
AB  - Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently 
      complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center 
      expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity 
      patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to 
      initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the 
      supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the 
      need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development 
      of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in 
      elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP 
      (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of 
      hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, 
      p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average 
      decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. 
      $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients 
      admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a 
      significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing 
      facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have 
      proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study 
      institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive 
      outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current 
      practice model.

TI  - Use and Deprescribing of Potentially Inappropriate Medications in Frail Nursing Home 
      Residents.
PG  - 917-924
LID - 10.1007/s40266-020-00805-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The STOPPFrail criteria were developed to assist physicians in 
      deprescribing medications among frail patients approaching end of life. We aimed to 
      measure the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and to 
      describe changes over time, using STOPPFrail, in frail nursing home residents (NHRs) 
      with limited life expectancy included in a medication review trial. METHODS: We 
      conducted a post-hoc analysis of the COME-ON study, a cluster-controlled trial that 
      evaluated the effect of a complex intervention on appropriateness of prescribing in 
      Belgian nursing homes. We identified NHRs eligible for the application of STOPPFrail 
      based on functional status, comorbidities, level of care and survival. PIM use was 
      measured at baseline and at 8 months. Changes over time were compared in the control 
      group (CG) and intervention group (IG). RESULTS: At baseline, 308 NHRs met the 
      STOPPFrail eligibility criteria, of whom 196 (64.1%) had one or more PIM. At 
      8 months, among the 218 NHRs who were alive, there was an absolute reduction in the 
      prevalence of PIMs of 9.1% in the CG (p < 0.05) and 10.2% in the IG (p < 0.05). We 
      found large reductions for some medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors) but no 
      reduction for others (e.g. calcium). The percentage of NHRs with one or more PIM 
      discontinued without a new PIM initiated was higher in the IG than the CG but the 
      difference was not significant (35.1% vs 23.6%, p = 0.127). CONCLUSION: Among frail 
      NHRs with poor survival prognosis, a significant and encouraging decrease in PIM 
      prevalence over time was observed, probably facilitated by medication reviews. The 
      overall prevalence of PIMs remained high, however.

TI  - A mixed methods thematic review: Health-related decision-making by the older person.
PG  - e1327-e1343
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14261 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To undertake a mixed methods thematic literature review that 
      explored how elderly adults approached decision-making in regard to their health 
      care following discharge. BACKGROUND: A critical time for appropriate health 
      decisions occurs during hospital discharge planning with nursing staff. However, 
      little is known how the 89% of elderly living at home make decisions regarding their 
      health care. Research into older adults' management of chronic conditions emerges as 
      an important step to potentially encourage symptom monitoring, prevent missed care 
      and detect deterioration. All should reduce the risk of hospital re-admission. 
      DESIGN: A mixed methods thematic literature review was undertaken. The structure 
      followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews recommended by the 
      EQUATOR network. METHODS: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus online databases were searched using keywords, 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. References drawn from relevant publications, 
      identified by experts and published between 1995 and 2017 were also considered. 
      Twenty-five qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies and reviews were 
      critically appraised (CASP 2013) before inclusion in the review. Analysis of each 
      study's findings was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (2006) steps to identify 
      major themes and sub-themes. RESULTS: Four main themes associated with 
      health-related decision-making in the elderly were identified: "the importance of 
      maintaining independence," "decision making style," "management of conditions at 
      home" and "discharge planning." CONCLUSION: Health care decision preferences in the 
      elderly emerged as highly complex and influenced by multiple factors. Development of 
      a tool to assess these components has been recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Nurses play a vital role in exploring and understanding the influence that 
      maintaining independence has with each patient. This understanding provides an 
      initial step toward development of a tool to assist collaboration between patients 
      and healthcare professionals involved in their care.

TI  - Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE): Integrating Health and Social 
      Care Since 1973.
PG  - 30-32
AB  - According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the future of older 
      adult care in the United States has arrived in a provider-sponsored health plan 
      model that integrates medical, behavioral, and social care for frail elders. This 
      approach gives the provider complete control over patient outcomes and total cost of 
      care and enables participants to live safely in the community - rather than a 
      nursing home - for an extra four years, on average. This article reviews the Program 
      of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) model, whose roots go back to the 1970s 
      in California, and offers case studies on two PACE-RI participants with chronic 
      healthcare needs. In both examples, the patients reduced hospitalizations and 
      increased mental and physical health, all while alleviating caregiver stress. With 
      the older population slated to double by 2060, the time has come to expand PACE to 
      more people. A few years ago, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & 
      Medicaid Services (CMS) said he was "glimpsing into our future" when he visited a 
      provider-sponsored health plan that integrated medical, behavioral, and social care 
      for frail elders, allowing them to remain in the community rather than live in a 
      nursing home.[1] This approach to aging services successfully braided Medicare and 
      Medicaid funding and gave the provider complete control over patient outcomes and 
      total cost of care over a significant period - the key elements to delivering 
      "value-based care." What is noteworthy is that this program of the "future" has been 
      in Rhode Island since 2005 and in other parts of the country since 1973! It helps 
      its medically complex participants live at home for an extra four years on average 
      and retain a much higher quality of life, all while controlling associated costs for 
      the government through capitated payment arrangements.[5] The program is called PACE 
      - short for Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly - and it is a 
      comprehensive and community-based model of care that coordinates medical, 
      behavioral, and social services for individuals ages fifty-five and older who have 
      high care needs but can remain safely in the community. PACE is currently offered in 
      31 states.[2] The model is backed by the National PACE Association and serves 50,000 
      seniors in 126 sponsoring organizations at 260 PACE centers across the country. 
      While PACE has already had some success at scaling its integrated services, emerging 
      demographics and heightened outreach poise the program for significant growth.

TI  - Older Adult Caregiving in an Amish Community.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.3928/19404921-20171128-02 [doi]
AB  - Amish older adults represent a growing and understudied population whose current 
      health practices, interactions with health care systems outside of their community, 
      and care needs are unknown. Limited research exists on why, when, and how Amish 
      older adults and their caregivers experience health care services outside of their 
      family and community. The purpose of the current study was to describe and explore 
      the perspectives of Amish caregivers caring for older adults and their experiences 
      with health care services outside of their community. A qualitative phenomenological 
      research design was used in combination with a community-based participatory 
      framework with caregivers in a small, rural Amish settlement. Amish caregiving of 
      older adults is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by cultural characteristics. 
      Caregivers place significant cultural value on home caregiving, emphasize the 
      experience as a blessing, and relate misunderstandings between themselves and 
      outside health care providers as significant concerns. [Res Gerontol Nurs. 2018;

AB  - The number of older adults continues to increase in all healthcare settings. The 
      majority of older adults are living in the community. Most are dealing with at least 
      one chronic physical illness or mental health concern. Nutritional status and 
      depression, key indicators of overall health, have a complex and interdependent 
      relationship. Clinicians must understand factors that affect nutrition and 
      depression to promote positive health outcomes and enhance the overall quality of 
      life for the oldest-old in the community.

TI  - Being acknowledged by others and bracketing negative thoughts and feelings: Frail 
      older people's narrations of how existential loneliness is eased.
PG  - e12213
LID - 10.1111/opn.12213 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe how EL was eased, as 
      narrated by frail older people. BACKGROUND: Existential loneliness (EL) is an 
      unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been 
      described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older 
      people, the experience of EL can be reduced. DESIGN: In this qualitative study, we 
      used an exploratory and descriptive design. METHODS: The study was based on 22 
      narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were 
      receiving long-term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional 
      content analysis. RESULTS: Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of 
      others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having 
      meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the 
      background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, 
      that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the 
      rear-view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract 
      themselves. CONCLUSION: Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing 
      meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the 
      forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease 
      EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person-centred care and 
      create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherness. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: If frail older people's ongoing processes of adjusting and accepting their 
      situation are understood and confirmed by people in their environment, for example, 
      by nurses, family and friends, the experience of living a meaningful life can be 
      supported, which, in turn, can ease EL.

AB  - Structured clinical data generated using standardized terminologies such as the 
      Omaha System are available for evaluating healthcare quality and patient outcomes. 
      New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, 
      complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived 
      using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 
      14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted 
      hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. 
      Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies 
      in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization 
      outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is 
      needed and the level of care that is provided.

TI  - Protocol of a case-control longitudinal study (fraXity) assessing frailty and 
      complexity among Swiss home service recipients using interRAI-HC assessments.
PG  - 207

LID - 207
AB  - BACKGROUND: The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex 
      care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare 
      nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of 
      identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity 
      study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation 
      algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of 
      the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying 
      subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and 
      complexity appears to be most relevant. METHODS: The study will rely on a 
      prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of 
      individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients 
      of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals 
      free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC 
      assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. 
      Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups 
      will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate 
      the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve 
      to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and 
      complexity appears to be the most relevant. DISCUSSION: The expected results of the 
      fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity 
      scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by 
      homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the 
      health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting 
      the best care and quality of life for aged citizens. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

COIS- The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Relevant to this 
      statement is a clarification regarding the involvement of imad in the study. Imad is 
      domiciled in Canton Geneva, Switzerland; it is a public autonomous institution that 
      operates under the supervision of the State Council of Canton, Geneva. Cantonal 
      (LIMAD - k1 07, LSDOM - k1 06 and RSDom k1 06.01) and federal laws (LAMal) regulate 
      imad. Its basic financing is predominantly Swiss and public. Projects conducted at 
      imad are non-commercial and of public interest. Also relevant is the fact that the 
      interRAI RAI-HC instrument is used for research purposes, royalty free. Thus, no 
      conflict of interest with the interRAI Consortium exists.

TI  - Community care for severely frail older people: Developing explanations of how, why 
      and for whom it works.
PG  - e12217
LID - 10.1111/opn.12217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A Community Wellness Team was implemented in North East England in 2014, 
      in line with national policy directives to support frail older people in the 
      community. The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which 
      aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients 
      to stay at home. DESIGN: A realist design combining a review of the literature and 
      primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop 
      programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust 
      development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; 
      advice on self-management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of 
      services. DISCUSSION: The programme theories explain the role and impact of the 
      Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one 
      another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the 
      Community Wellness Team "works" is discussed. Of particular importance was the 
      comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and 
      physical environment within which older people live. CONCLUSION: Severely frail 
      older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and 
      environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a 
      complex and flexible person-centred approach. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study 
      paves the way for further research into the care networks surrounding severely frail 
      older people living in the community, and how they can most effectively be 
      implemented.

TI  - Improving quality of care and reducing unnecessary hospital admissions: a literature 
      review.
PG  - 284, 288-91
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.6.284 [doi]
AB  - As the UK population lives to older ages, with more complex health and social care 
      needs, there comes a time when going to live in a care home might be essential for a 
      frail, older person. Residents and their families expect high-quality care in return 
      for the costs of their placements, but often find this is not the case ( Help the 
      Aged, 2006 ). In order to improve quality in care homes, the Lincolnshire Community 
      Health Services NHS Trust are piloting a care home support team. The new service 
      aims to provide education and training to an unpredictable workforce, with the 
      addition of regular ward rounds in care homes to ensure more proactive care for 
      residents, in order to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and improve the 
      quality of care offered. This article looks at the literature relating to education 
      and training for staff in care homes to support this service. It also aims to use 
      the reviewed articles to identify specific training and education needed to improve 
      quality of care for residents and reduce avoidable hospital admissions.

TI  - Posthospital Falls Prevention Intervention: A Mixed-Methods Study.
PG  - 155-165
LID - 10.1123/japa.2017-0406 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Posthospital discharge shows increased risk for falls in older people. 
      This pilot study was created to determine feasibility and acceptability of a 
      community-delivered posthospital multifactorial program. METHOD: This mixed-method 
      study used randomized controlled design (quantitative component) and interviews 
      (qualitative component). People aged ≥65 years, hospitalized for a fall, underwent 
      assessment for quality of life and falls-related outcomes, followed by interviews, 
      randomization into intervention (exercise, medication review, and education) or 
      control group, and follow-up at 6 months. RESULTS: Thirteen people commenced, with 
      10 people assessed at 6 months. Participants were complex with high degrees of 
      frailty, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and falls risk. Interview data related to 
      intervention, impacts on quality of life, and fall-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: 
      Preliminary findings suggest suitability of a multifactorial program for older 
      people posthospital discharge following a fall. A social component would be a useful 
      addition to falls prevention strategies, utilizing existing community nursing 
      organizations.

TI  - Narratives of older persons' frailty and physical activity in relation to 
      environmental landscapes and time.
PG  - e12298
LID - 10.1111/opn.12298 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the 
      environmental landscape on the physical activity of older persons experiencing 
      frailty. BACKGROUND: This manuscript describes the second phase of an unpublished 
      larger study in the northern province of Lampang, Thailand. Phase One revealed that 
      14% of 1,788 older persons surveyed were found to have experienced frailty according 
      to Fried's frailty phenotypes, and low physical activity was associated with 
      frailty. In the light of frailty, how older persons experience physical activity in 
      their day-to-day living environments warrants in-depth exploration. DESIGN: This was 
      a qualitative study guided by narrative inquiry. METHODS: In-depth interviews and 
      observations were conducted with 13 older persons living with frailty. The method of 
      analysis was thematic and performance analysis. RESULTS: Two broad themes relating 
      to the environmental landscapes were as follows: (a) limiting environmental 
      landscapes and (b) engaging environmental landscapes. These landscapes, which change 
      across time, refer to physical and social spaces, and beliefs of older persons and 
      their family that have either positive or negative impacts on physical activity of 
      frail older persons. CONCLUSION: Complex interactions between physical and social 
      spaces and beliefs of older persons and family influence the physical activity 
      behaviours of older persons living with frailty. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This 
      study warrants education and policy aiming at creating optimal environmental 
      landscapes to promote physical activity in frail older persons.

LID - 10.7748/ns.30.1.45.e9816 [doi]
AB  - Many people with dementia have other complex health needs, including comorbidity and 
      frailty. Most models of care focus on single diseases and do not take into account 
      the needs of those with comorbidities and dementia. Integration, continuity of care 
      and personalisation are particularly important for this vulnerable group. It is also 
      important to recognise potential barriers to accessing care so that these can be 
      addressed. Issues around providing health care for people with dementia and complex 
      health needs are considered in this article, including management and organisation 
      of care, access to care, models of care, role of the family carer, and prevention of 
      dementia, frailty and long-term conditions.

TI  - The holistic assessment and care planning in partnership intervention study (HAPPI): 
      A protocol for a feasibility, cluster randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 3078-3087
LID - 10.1111/jan.14106 [doi]
AB  - AIM: During an initial phase of this research, an e-Delphi survey was conducted to 
      gain consensus among stakeholders on the components of a nurse-led assessment and 
      care planning intervention for older people who live with frailty in primary care. 
      This feasibility randomized controlled trial (fRCT) will test the proposed 
      intervention and its implementation and determine methods for the design of a 
      conclusive randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The fRCT, with embedded qualitative 
      study, aims to recruit 60 participants. Moderately and severely frail older people 
      will be identified using the electronic frailty index (eFI) and the intervention 
      will be delivered by senior community nurses. The control participants will receive 
      usual primary care for frailty. The study is funded by the National Institute of 
      Health Research (NIHR; funding granted in May 2016, ref: ICA-CDRF-2016-02-018) and 
      received NHS and University Research Ethics Committee approval in 2018. DISCUSSION: 
      There is evidence that the delivery of complex interventions for community-dwelling 
      older people can reduce care home and hospital admissions and falls, there is less 
      evidence for the benefit of any specific type or intensity of intervention or the 
      additional benefits of targeting the frail population. This trial will determine 
      feasibility of the intervention, define recruitment and retention parameters and 
      trial logistics, and decide outcome measures. IMPACT: This study aims to address the 
      limitations of current research by using a systematic method of frailty diagnosis 
      and participant identification, trialling implementation of a person-centred 
      intervention, and testing of feasibility parameters. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      ISRCTN: 74345449.

TI  - The Association of Frailty With Adverse Outcomes After Multisystem Trauma: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1482-1492
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004687 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty strongly predicts adverse outcomes in a variety of clinical 
      settings; however, frailty-related trauma outcomes have not been systematically 
      reviewed and quantitatively synthesized. Our objective was to systematically review 
      and meta-analyze the association between frailty and outcomes (mortality-primary; 
      complications, health resource use, and patient experience-secondary) after 
      multisystem trauma. METHODS: After registration (CRD42018104116), we applied a 
      peer-reviewed search strategy to MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Comprehensive Index to Nursing 
      and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) from inception to May 22, 2019, to identify 
      studies that described: (1) multisystem trauma; (2) participants ≥18 years of age; 
      (3) explicit frailty instrument application; and (4) relevant outcomes. Excluded 
      studies included those that: (1) lacked a comparator group; (2) reported isolated 
      injuries; and (3) reported mixed trauma and nontrauma populations. Criteria were 
      applied independently, in duplicate to title/abstract and full-text articles. Risk 
      of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-of 
      Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Effect measures (adjusted for prespecified 
      confounders) were pooled using random-effects models; otherwise, narrative synthesis 
      was used. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included that represented 5198 participants; 
      9.9% of people with frailty died compared to 4.2% of people without frailty. Frailty 
      was associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.37-1.71), complications (adjusted OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 
      1.72-3.15), and adverse discharge (adjusted OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.29-2.45). Patient 
      function, experience, and resource use outcomes were rarely reported. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The presence of frailty is significantly associated with mortality, complications, 
      and adverse discharge disposition after multisystem trauma. This provides important 
      prognostic information to inform discussions with patients and families and 
      highlights the need for trauma system optimization to meet the complex needs of 
      older patients.

TI  - Forging a Frailty-Ready Healthcare System to Meet Population Ageing.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14121448 [doi]
LID - 1448
AB  - The beginning of the 21st century has seen health systems worldwide struggling to 
      deliver quality healthcare amidst challenges posed by ageing populations. The 
      increasing prevalence of frailty with older age and accompanying complexities in 
      physical, cognitive, social and psychological dimensions renders the present modus 
      operandi of fragmented, facility-centric, doctor-based, and illness-centered care 
      delivery as clearly unsustainable. In line with the public health framework for 
      action in the World Health Organization's World Health and Ageing Report, meeting 
      these challenges will require a systemic reform of healthcare delivery that is 
      integrated, patient-centric, team-based, and health-centered. These reforms can be 
      achieved through building partnerships and relationships that engage, empower, and 
      activate patients and their support systems. To meet the challenges of population 
      ageing, Singapore has reorganised its public healthcare into regional healthcare 
      systems (RHSs) aimed at improving population health and the experience of care, and 
      reducing costs. This paper will describe initiatives within the RHS frameworks of 
      the National Health Group (NHG) and the Alexandra Health System (AHS) to forge a 
      frailty-ready healthcare system across the spectrum, which includes the well healthy 
      ("living well"), the well unhealthy ("living with illness"), the unwell unhealthy 
      ("living with frailty"), and the end-of-life (EoL) ("dying well"). For instance, the 
      AHS has adopted a community-centered population health management strategy in older 
      housing estates such as Yishun to build a geographically-based care ecosystem to 
      support the self-management of chronic disease through projects such as "wellness 
      kampungs" and "share-a-pot". A joint initiative by the Lien Foundation and Khoo Teck 
      Puat Hospital aims to launch dementia-friendly communities across the island by 
      building a network comprising community partners, businesses, and members of the 
      public. At the National Healthcare Group, innovative projects to address the needs 
      of the frail elderly have been developed in the areas of: (a) admission avoidance 
      through joint initiatives with long-term care facilities, nurse-led geriatric 
      assessment at the emergency department and geriatric assessment clinics; (b) 
      inpatient care, such as the Framework for Inpatient care of the Frail Elderly, 
      orthogeriatric services, and geriatric surgical services; and (c) discharge to care, 
      involving community transitional care teams and the development of community 
      infrastructure for post-discharge support; and an appropriate transition to EoL 
      care. In the area of EoL care, the National Strategy for Palliative Care has been 
      developed to build an integrated system to: provide care for frail elderly with 
      advance illnesses, develop advance care programmes that respect patients' choices, 
      and equip healthcare professionals to cope with the challenges of EoL care.

TI  - Attributes of person-centred communication: A qualitative exploration of 
      communication with older persons in home health care.
PG  - e12284
LID - 10.1111/opn.12284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research points to challenges related to the home healthcare of 
      older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although person-centred care 
      has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to 
      enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons. 
      AIM: The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication 
      between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home. METHODS: A 
      descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the 
      COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between 
      registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative 
      thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the attributes of 
      person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older 
      persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness 
      on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated 
      when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' 
      views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions. CONCLUSION: The nurses' 
      attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication 
      with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve 
      older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. Implication 
      for practice The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred 
      approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included 
      in education and training.

TI  - Developing a holistic, multidisciplinary community service for frail older people.
PG  - 34-40
LID - 10.7748/nop.2018.e1064 [doi]
AB  - This article explores the development of an ambulatory community service that 
      demonstrates multidisciplinary working to meet the diverse needs of frail older 
      people and their carers. The service comprises advanced nurse practitioners, a 
      pharmacist, a community navigator, consultants, occupational therapists, 
      physiotherapists, a nurse, rehabilitation assistants, a healthcare assistant and an 
      administrator. This multidisciplinary team (MDT) serves adults with complex medical 
      and rehabilitation needs who are being discharged from hospital, staying in bedded 
      rehabilitation units or living at home by offering assessments, investigations and 
      rehabilitation, where appropriate closer to home. The aims of the service are to: 
      keep people well, prevent unplanned hospital admissions, promote health and 
      well-being, reduce the risk of falls, enable independent living and provide 
      rehabilitation. Personalised care plans are developed with patients and their 
      carers. Advanced nursing practice is demonstrated in assessment, investigation, 
      diagnosis, management, referral and non-medical prescribing. Development of this MDT 
      is required to support and promote integrated, evidence-based work. Such development 
      leads to integrated care across communities, and bridges gaps between patients and 
      carers, GPs, home, residential and hospital-based services, and the voluntary, 
      statutory and non-statutory sectors.

TI  - Frailty: a review of the first decade of research.
PG  - 422-32
LID - 10.1177/1099800412462866 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased 
      vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, 
      hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and 
      operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty 
      development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of 
      conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put 
      forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated 
      pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and 
      exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes 
      of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere 
      length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and 
      metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, 
      lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive 
      decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological 
      approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for 
      future methodological and physiological inquiry.

TI  - Comparing the case-mix of frail older people at home and of those being admitted 
      into residential care: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/s12877-020-01593-w [doi]
LID - 195
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to optimize interventions and services in the community, it is 
      important to identify the profile of persons who are able to stay at home and of 
      those who are being admitted into residential care. Understanding their needs and 
      their use of resources is essential. The main objective of the study is to identify 
      persons who are likely to enter residential care based upon their needs and resource 
      utilization, so that care providers can plan interventions effectively and optimize 
      services and resources to meet the persons' needs. METHODS: This is a longitudinal 
      quasi-experimental study. The data consists of primary data from the community 
      setting collected every six months during the period of 2010-2016. Interventions had 
      the goal of keeping older people longer at home. Participants were at least 65 years 
      old and were living in the community. The interRAI Resource Utilization Group system 
      (RUG-III) was used to calculate the case-mix indexes (CMI) of all participants. 
      Comparisons were made between the case-mix of those who were still living at home 
      and those who were admitted into residential care at follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 
      10,289 older persons participated in the study (81.2 ± 7.1 yrs., 69.1% female). From 
      this population, 853 participants (8.3%) were admitted into residential care. The 
      CMI of the persons receiving night care at home were the highest (1.6 at baseline 
      and 1.7 at the entry point of residential care), followed by persons receiving 
      occupational therapy (1.5 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential 
      care) and persons enrolled in case management interventions with rehabilitation (1.4 
      at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care). The CMIs at follow-up 
      were significantly higher than at baseline and the linear regression model showed 
      that admission to residential care was a significant factor in the model. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the RUG-III system offers possibilities for 
      identifying persons at risk of institutionalization. Interventions designed to avoid 
      early nursing home admission can make use of the RUG-III system to optimize care 
      planning and the allocation of services and resources. Based on the RUG-III 
      case-mix, resources can be allocated to keep older persons at home longer, bearing 
      in mind the complexity of care and the availability of services in the community.

TI  - Agitation and depression in frail nursing home elderly patients with dementia: 
      treatment characteristics and service use.
PG  - 231-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors describe characteristics, treatment, and acute service use 
      associated with agitation and depression in dementia. METHODS: Authors used 
      retrospective chart review of symptoms, physician-level prescribing, and acute 
      service use over 3 months for 2,487 physically frail older residents, including 
      1,836 with dementia, (mean age: 79.8 years) in 109 long-term care facilities, 
      describing differences between uncomplicated dementia and three mutually exclusive 
      subgroups of complicated dementia, including dementia with agitation-only, dementia 
      with depression-only, and dementia with mixed agitation and depression. RESULTS: 
      Compared with the other subgroups, frail elderly patients with dementia complicated 
      by mixed agitation and depression have the highest rate of hospitalization, the 
      greatest number of medical diagnoses, and the greatest medical severity, and they 
      receive the greatest number of psychiatric medications. Depression in dementia 
      (either alone or mixed with agitation) was associated with greater prevalence of 
      pain. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia complicated by mixed agitation and depression accounts 
      for over one-third of complicated dementia and is associated with multiple 
      psychiatric and medical needs, intensive pharmacological treatment, and use of 
      high-cost services. Research should target this complex, high-risk group to develop 
      appropriate diagnostic criteria and effective treatment interventions.

TI  - Acute care for the elderly: a literature review.
PG  - 219-25
LID - 10.1089/pop.2009.0058 [doi]
AB  - Traditionally, acute medical care has been insufficient to meet the complex care 
      needs of frail older adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) units at improving hospitalization 
      outcomes for adults older than 65 years of age. A review of the literature was 
      performed, focusing on randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, reviews, and 
      meta-analyses from 1990 to 2008. This review revealed ACE to be associated with 
      positive global outcomes (eg, cost, length of stay, readmission rates, utilization, 
      rehabilitation, cognition, function, patient/staff satisfaction). Furthermore, some 
      studies may point to a decreased incidence of delirium and polypharmacy. Though 
      larger studies with consistent operational definitions and replicative studies are 
      needed, the literature presents compelling evidence that warrants further 
      investigation of ACE as a valuable alternative paradigm of acute geriatric care.

TI  - Is hospitalisation necessary? A survey of frail older persons with cognitive 
      impairment transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department.
PG  - 1138-1147
LID - 10.1111/scs.12559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the 
      transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is 
      associated with a high risk of them developing complications. AIM: To survey the 
      most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from 
      nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, 
      symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. METHOD: A retrospective descriptive 
      survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and 
      presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. 
      FINDINGS: The persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail 
      with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of 
      criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined 
      and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. CONCLUSION: Frail older persons 
      with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end-of-life care, should be prevented 
      from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency 
      department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially 
      trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making 
      house calls.

TI  - Geriatric urinary incontinence.
PG  - 65-149
AB  - Urinary incontinence (UI) is now recognized as a prevalent, physically and 
      emotionally disruptive, and costly health problem in the geriatric population. 
      Because incontinence may be a manifestation of a subacute or reversible process 
      within or outside of the lower urinary tract, and because effective treatment is 
      available, it is important for primary care physicians to identify and appropriately 
      assess incontinence in their geriatric patients. The initial evaluation of an 
      incontinent geriatric patients. The initial evaluation of an incontinent geriatric 
      patient includes a targeted history and physical examination, urinalysis, and simple 
      tests of lower urinary tract function. Potentially reversible conditions that may be 
      causing or contributing to the incontinence, such as delirium and urinary tract 
      infection (UTI), should be identified and managed. Patients who may benefit from 
      further testing, including urologic or gynecologic examination and/or complex 
      urodynamic tests, should be identified and referred. Several therapeutic modalities 
      can be used to treat geriatric UI. Behavioral therapies are noninvasive and 
      effective, both in functional community-dwelling geriatric patients and in 
      functionally impaired nursing home residents. Behavioral therapies include bladder 
      training, pelvic muscle exercises, biofeedback, scheduled toileting, habit training, 
      and prompted voiding. Pharmacologic therapy is often used in conjunction with 
      behavioral therapy. For stress incontinence, alpha-adrenergic drugs are used and can 
      be combined with topical or oral estrogen therapy in women. For urge incontinence, 
      pharmacologic treatment involves drugs with anticholinergic and direct bladder 
      muscle relaxant properties. Pharmacologic therapy for overflow incontinence is 
      generally not effective on a long-term basis. Surgical treatment is indicated when a 
      pathologic lesion such as a tumor is diagnosed, or when anatomic obstruction is 
      believed to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. Surgical treatment of stress 
      incontinence can be highly effective in properly selected women. Nonspecific, 
      supportive treatments are also important in managing geriatric UI. Education for 
      patients and caregivers is critical for the success of most therapies. Environmental 
      manipulations and the appropriate use of toilet substitutes are especially important 
      in frail, functionally impaired patients. Highly absorbent adult undergarments are 
      helpful for managing many patients, but should not be used as the initial response 
      to incontinence, and are best used in conjunction with more specific treatment 
      whenever possible. Chronic indwelling catheterization should only be used to manage 
      incontinence when it is associated with clinically significant urinary retention, 
      skin conditions that cannot heal because of incontinence, or severe illness that 
      makes the catheter the most comfortable method of management.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Revisiting geriatric failure to thrive: a complex and compelling clinical condition.
PG  - 18-24; quiz 26-7
AB  - Geriatric failure to thrive (GFTT) poses a complex clinical issue in gerontological 
      nursing practice. GFTT is not a normal part of aging, nor is it an outcome of 
      chronic illness. Rather, GFTT describes a lack of vitality and diminished capacity 
      for life and outlines a process of functional decline that is often difficult to 
      explain. The purpose of this article is to review GFTT, examine the literature on 
      GFTT, and suggest strategies for the identification, assessment, and creative 
      management of this complex condition that affects millions of older adults.

PG  - 402-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2009.00418.x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Seventy percent of people over 65 years of age have hypertension, and one 
      third of elders fall each year. These conditions frequently coexist, and each 
      carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews 
      the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with 
      hypertension. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the published and unpublished 
      literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must 
      include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments 
      that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. 
      Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The 
      periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse 
      practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication 
      management accordingly. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article will assist the NP 
      to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.

TI  - Older women, intimate partner violence and mental health: a consideration of the 
      particular issues for health and healthcare practice.
PG  - 2177-2191
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13490 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history 
      of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. 
      BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and 
      well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate 
      partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has 
      not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to 
      address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's 
      experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health 
      issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic 
      synthesis of qualitative evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and 
      PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end 
      of December 2015. RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence 
      exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner 
      violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the 
      boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within 
      the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of 
      intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence 
      of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who 
      experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner 
      violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service 
      providers need to be aware of these. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and 
      healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management 
      and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they 
      are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of 
      abuse and this includes older women.

TI  - A critical pathway for the frail elderly cardiac patient.
PG  - 159-63
LID - 10.1097/HPC.0b013e318237b2d8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The medical community needs to better respond to the predictable 
      complexities associated with admission of frail and elderly cardiac patients who may 
      need specific attention and care programs. The nurse practitioner can play an 
      important role to continue and coordinate nursing and medical care. We propose a new 
      critical pathway designed to improve cardiac and nursing care for frail elderly 
      cardiac patients admitted with heart failure or atrial fibrillation. METHOD: The 
      critical pathway is developed by the nurse practitioner who will act as a pathway 
      coordinator and take care of the medical care of these patients in a teaching 
      hospital setting. This critical pathway is applied to all patients aged >75 years 
      who are admitted for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: The pathway 
      implementation identified 5 important socio-medical parameters that may account for 
      a delayed length of stay, even in patients without a complicated medical situation: 
      delirium and fall prevention, nutritional awareness, fluid restriction efforts, and 
      information optimization of patients and spouses. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a 
      critical care pathway for the frail elderly patients who are admitted for heart 
      failure or atrial fibrillation. In doing so, we have been able to change the medical 
      and social management of these patients at a general cardiology ward in a teaching 
      hospital.

TI  - Evaluation of bottom-up interventions targeting community-dwelling frail older 
      people in Belgium: methodological challenges and lessons for future comparative 
      effectiveness studies.
PG  - 416
LID - 10.1186/s12913-019-4240-9 [doi]
LID - 416
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimizing the organization of care for community-dwelling frail older 
      people is an important issue in many Western countries. In Belgium, a series of 
      complex, innovative, bottom-up interventions was recently designed and implemented 
      to help frail older people live at home longer. As the effectiveness of these 
      interventions may vary between different population groups according to their 
      long-term care needs, they must be evaluated by comparison with a control group that 
      has similar needs. METHODS: The goal was to identify target groups for these 
      interventions and to establish control groups with similar needs and to explore, per 
      group, the extent to which the utilization of long-term care is matched to needs. We 
      merged two databases: a clinical prospective database and the routine administrative 
      database for healthcare reimbursements. Through Principal Component Analysis 
      followed by Clustering, the intervention group was first stratified into disability 
      profiles. Per profile, comparable control groups for clinical variables were 
      established, based on propensity scores. Using chi-squared tests and logistic 
      regression analysis, long-term care utilization at baseline was then compared per 
      profile and group studied. RESULTS: Stratification highlighted five disability 
      profiles: people with low-level limitations; people with limitations in instrumental 
      activities of daily life and low-level of cognitive impairment; people with 
      functional limitations; people with functional and cognitive impairments; and people 
      with functional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These profiles made it possible 
      to identify long-term care needs. For instance, at baseline, those who needed more 
      assistance with hygiene tasks also received more personal nursing care (P < 0.05). 
      However, there were some important discrepancies between the need for long-term care 
      and its utilization: while 21% of patients who were totally dependent for hygiene 
      tasks received no personal nursing care, personal nursing care was received by 33% 
      of patients who could perform hygiene tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The disability profiles 
      provide information on long-term care needs but not on the extent to which those 
      needs are met. To assess the effectiveness of interventions, controls at baseline 
      should have similar disability profiles and comparable long-term care utilization. 
      To allow for large comparative effectiveness studies, these dimensions should 
      ideally be available in routine databases.

TI  - Conceptualizations of frailty in relation to older adults.
PG  - 58-68
AB  - AIM: The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy 
      in identifying and describing older adults as frail. BACKGROUND: Despite the 
      dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a 
      lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear 
      conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. 
      Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding 
      eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. 
      METHOD: The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and 
      conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the 
      paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. 
      The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six 
      conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions 
      about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the 
      ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are 
      discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. CONCLUSION: The 
      review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in 
      older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex 
      interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the 
      concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of 
      ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and 
      incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the 
      contribution of both individual and environmental factors.

      Study.
PG  - 55-63
LID - 10.1111/2047-3095.12198 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with frailty among the young-old elderly 
      (YOE) and old-old elderly (OOE). METHODS: This longitudinal study with a 3-year 
      follow-up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS: 
      Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility 
      and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3-year 
      period. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent frailty, we suggest weight-loss prevention programs 
      for the YOE, lower-limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management 
      programs for both groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The findings may be 
      used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and 
      YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.

TI  - What impedes and what facilitates a quality improvement project for older 
      hospitalized patients?
PG  - 41-8
LID - 10.1093/intqhc/mzt079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into which factors impede, and which facilitate, the 
      implementation of a complex multi-component improvement initiative in hospitalized 
      older patients. DESIGN: A qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews. The 
      three dimensions of Pettigrew and Whipp's theoretical framework, namely, Process, 
      Content and Context, were used to undertake a structured data analysis. SETTING: The 
      study was conducted in 19 Dutch hospitals implementing the Frail Elderly Project. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five members of staff, including physicians, nurses and members 
      of the policy team. INTERVENTION: The Frail Elderly Project, a Dutch quality 
      improvement program, aims to decrease adverse events in frail older hospitalized 
      people by implementing screening instruments and interventions targeting delirium, 
      falls, malnutrition and physical impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The management 
      of the process of implementation, participants' opinions of the program elements and 
      contextual factors which influence the implementation. RESULTS: Barriers to 
      implementation included two process factors (insufficient involvement of clinicians 
      and lack of time), two content factors (having divergent objectives and concerns 
      about recommended program elements) and two contextual factors (a lack of knowledge 
      of delirium and minimal insight into the purposes and effects of the program). 
      Facilitating factors included one process factor (leadership), one content factor 
      (flexibility in choosing methods) and two contextual factors (the program's guidance 
      and the use of digital patient records). CONCLUSION: We identified the barriers and 
      the factors which facilitate implementing complex multi-component improvement 
      programs concerning care for older patients. These barriers must be resolved in 
      future improvement programs in order to ensure successful implementation.

TI  - Professional and family caregivers' attitudes towards involuntary treatment in 
      community-dwelling people with dementia.
PG  - 96-107
LID - 10.1111/jan.13839 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to gain insight into professional and family 
      caregivers' attitudes towards involuntary treatment in community-dwelling people 
      with dementia (PwD). BACKGROUND: The number of PwD with complex care needs living at 
      home is increasing rapidly. In some situations, caregivers provide care against the 
      will of PwD, referred to as involuntary treatment, which includes non-consensual 
      care, psychotropic medication and physical restraints. DESIGN: A cross-sectional 
      study. METHODS: A total of 228 professional (nursing staff, general practitioners 
      (GPs) and other healthcare professionals such as physical therapists and 
      psychologists) and 77 family caregivers of PwD completed the Maastricht Attitude 
      Questionnaire-Home Care. This questionnaire measures attitudes towards involuntary 
      treatment and perceived restrictiveness of and experienced discomfort in using 
      involuntary treatment. Data were collected in the Netherlands between June and 
      November 2016. RESULTS: Family caregivers and GPs had more positive attitudes 
      towards involuntary treatment than nursing staff and other healthcare professionals, 
      indicating that they are more accepting of involuntary treatment. A more positive 
      attitude was associated with higher perceived caregiver burden and being a family 
      caregiver. Family caregivers and GPs found the use of involuntary treatment less 
      restrictive and indicated feeling more comfortable when using these measures. 
      CONCLUSION: It is important to account for the differences in attitudes and foster 
      dialogue among professional and family caregivers to find common ground about 
      alternatives to involuntary treatment. These results will inform the development of 
      an intervention that aims to prevent involuntary treatment in home care.

TI  - Home-based primary care: the care of the veteran at home.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - Home-Based Primary Care is a program designed by the Department of Veteran Affairs 
      (VA) to care for frail, medically complex, elderly veteran patients in their home 
      setting. Unique to the VA, the program has similarities and differences in relation 
      to typical Medicare/Medicaid home health and hospice programs. The VA has 
      demonstrated success in maintaining the patients' independence and quality of life 
      as well as exceptional management of chronic disease and prevention.

TI  - Exploring the expectations, needs and experiences of general practitioners and 
      nurses towards a proactive and structured care programme for frail older patients: a 
      mixed-methods study.
PG  - 2262-73
LID - 10.1111/jan.12110 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and 
      practice nurses regarding the U-CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of 
      the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older 
      people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. BACKGROUND: Care for 
      older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and 
      time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve 
      physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. DESIGN: An 
      explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. METHODS: The 
      barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and 
      expectations regarding the U-CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires 
      sent to all participating general practitioners (n = 32) and practice nurses 
      (n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme 
      after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. RESULTS: 
      Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide 
      proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different 
      cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and 
      financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated 
      that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to 
      provide structured care. CONCLUSION: This explanatory mixed-methods study showed 
      that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U-CARE programme as 
      feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care 
      towards a proactive and preventive care approach.

TI  - The impact of medical issues in inpatient geriatric psychiatry.
PG  - 23-46
AB  - At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. 
      Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from 
      coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are 
      important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of 
      hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes 
      adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better 
      treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need 
      for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the 
      importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.

PG  - 16-20
LID - 10.7748/nop.28.4.16.s20 [doi]
AB  - This is the third in a short series that presents case study examples of the 
      application of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical 
      settings. CGA is a holistic assessment model, which is designed to determine a frail 
      older person's medical and mental health status, as well as functional, social and 
      environmental issues. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised care 
      planning. The case study presented explores the application of CGA with an 
      89-year-old patient with complex health and social care needs. It demonstrates how a 
      hospital admission was avoided and the patient's health outcomes improved, by using 
      a nurse-led systematic approach to assessment and by careful consideration of CGA 
      domains.

TI  - A model of community-based interdisciplinary team training in the care of the frail 
      elderly.
PG  - 936
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is widely recognized that interdisciplinary team care is essential for 
      effective management of complex patients such as the frail elderly. Physicians need 
      to understand the operational mechanisms that drive the team care model. While such 
      concepts should be an integral part of medical education, teaching such a model of 
      care that demonstrates effective provider communication, coordination of multiple 
      services, and the provision of cost-effective health care can be difficult. The 
      Program of All-inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE) is a well-established, 
      high-quality program that has been replicated nationally and can serve as an 
      effective teaching model. Achieving the goals of the PACE program requires strong 
      team leadership and communication, clear patient-oriented goal definition, an 
      understanding and appreciation of roles among various disciplines, skillful 
      negotiation, and shared responsibility for the patient. The PACE model offers 
      medical and family practice residents a non-traditional clinical setting with 
      educational opportunities not available in most hospital or ambulatory settings. 
      DESCRIPTION: For several years the Fallon Healthcare System Elder Service Plan 
      (ESP), one of 25 national PACE programs, has provided an educational setting for 
      medical and family practice residents as a component of their clinical rotations in 
      geriatrics. This training experience has been expanded to include additional 
      residents in on-site interactive seminars that focus on effective communication 
      using an interdisciplinary team approach to care. The ESP program provides 
      comprehensive medical and social services to a frail, non-institutionalized 
      nursing-home-eligible population. The aim of the program is to preserve the health 
      and independence of its participants for as long as possible. The ESP team consists 
      of physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, nurse's aides, home health workers, 
      social workers, therapists, nutritionists, and pharmacists. The seminar includes a 
      slide and video presentation led by members of the ESP team using selected scenarios 
      that portray both effective and poor team dynamics and communication. Definitions of 
      a team, the process of establishing patient- and family-oriented goals, 
      interdisciplinary role appreciation and responsibility, and the basics of financing 
      a comprehensive health care delivery system for the frail elderly are discussed. 
      Approximately half of each session is devoted to interactive discussion and 
      critiquing of the scenarios by the residents and faculty, which is derived from the 
      ESP team. DISCUSSION: For most of the medical and family practice residents, this 
      experience represents their first exposures to this model of coordinated team care 
      for the elderly. Preliminary evaluation results indicate that residents have 
      generally been unaware of the services available to the elderly and of the 
      opportunities for coordinated care using the expertise of multiple disciplines. 
      There is a lack of knowledge of key non-physician professional roles. The expanded 
      use of PACE models as training sites could be beneficial in preparing future health 
      care professionals for interdisciplinary team care of the growing numbers of frail 
      elderly.

TI  - Frail older patient care by interdisciplinary teams: a primer for generalists.
PG  - 51-62
AB  - Frail older patients-unlike younger persons in the health care system or even well 
      elders-require complex care. Most frail older patients have multiple chronic 
      illnesses. Optimum care cannot be achieved by following the paradigm of ongoing 
      traditional health care, which emphasizes disease and cure. Because no one health 
      care professional can possibly have all of the specialized skills required to 
      implement such a model of health care delivery, interdisciplinary team care has 
      evolved. This paper describes the roles of the participating team members in the 
      context of interdisciplinary care for frail older adults. In addition, the 
      challenges that occur when Geriatric Interdisciplinary (ID) Teams involved in 
      providing care to frail older patients are identified and discussed.

TI  - Managing deterioration in older adults in care homes: a quality improvement project 
      to introduce an early warning tool.
PG  - 58-66
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2019.24.2.58 [doi]
AB  - Many older adults living in care homes have complex health needs requiring 
      comprehensive care. Early warning tools can help identify deterioration, but 
      currently they are less often used in care homes. The aim of this quality 
      improvement project was to introduce an early warning tool, the Significant 7, to 
      facilitate identification and management of deterioration in care home residents. 
      The plan, do, study, act (PDSA) method was used, and process mapping informed a 
      tailored intervention. Introducing the tool had positive outcomes for residents and 
      care staff. There was a reduction in the incidence of pressure ulcers and falls, and 
      care staff were more confident in recognising resident deterioration. Next steps 
      include scaling up the project to further examine how this early warning tool can 
      improve resident, staff and organisational outcomes, in order to explore the 
      potential use of the tool by community nurses with older people living at home.

TI  - Reflection on the pharmaceutical service in nursing homes; understanding reality to 
      cover needs.

AB  - The increasing concern regarding chronic care, which is a consequence of the current 
      demographic progression, and the need to decrease the costs associated with its 
      care, places a focus on social care homes caring for highly dependent patients. 
      Simultaneously, the residential facilities are progressing in order to care for 
      fragile patients with increasingly complexity, even though, with some exceptions, it 
      is in parallel with the healthcare system. Within this reality, pharmaceutical care 
      is developing very differently in all the autonomic regions, and has become a reason 
      for controversy. In this sense, diverse factors related with the patient care 
      setting, but also linked to different pharmaceutical levels, make it difficult to 
      implement a patient care model. Faced with this scenario, it seems reasonable to 
      analyze the situation from the perspective of the healthcare requirements of the 
      institutionalized persons in these facilities, and in terms of the patient care that 
      we can and should provide; subsequently, and based on this, we should be able to 
      propose the basic guidelines for developing an efficient model of pharmaceutical 
      care integrated within this patient care setting.

TI  - Psychological transition into a residential care facility: older people's 
      experiences.
PG  - 1159-68

AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper is to discuss the complexity of admission into a 
      residential care facility from a psychological perspective for residents and their 
      relatives and the resulting implications for nursing care. BACKGROUND: Admission 
      into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well 
      as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful 
      involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is 
      important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. DATA SOURCES: The 
      background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into 
      nursing homes and psychological transitions. DISCUSSION: The concepts of transition 
      from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by 
      residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very 
      different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a 
      difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require 
      improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will 
      support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      NURSING: Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication 
      strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that 
      occurs when an older person is admitted into care. CONCLUSION: Improving the 
      psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal 
      for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal 
      constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a 
      more positive experience.

TI  - Stakeholder Meeting: Integrated Knowledge Translation Approach to Address the 
      Caregiver Support Gap.
PG  - 108-119
LID - 10.1017/S0714980816000660 [doi]
AB  - Family caregivers are an integral and increasingly overburdened part of the health 
      care system. There is a gap between what research evidence shows is beneficial to 
      caregivers and what is actually provided. Using an integrated knowledge translation 
      approach, a stakeholder meeting was held among researchers, family caregivers, 
      caregiver associations, clinicians, health care administrators, and policy makers. 
      The objectives of the meeting were to review current research evidence and conduct 
      multi-stakeholder dialogue on the potential gaps, facilitators, and barriers to the 
      provision of caregiver supports. A two-day meeting was attended by 123 individuals. 
      Three target populations of family caregivers were identified for discussion: 
      caregivers of seniors with dementia, caregivers in end-of-life care, and caregivers 
      of frail seniors with complex health needs. The results of this meeting can and are 
      being used to inform the development of implementation research endeavours and 
      policies targeted at providing evidence-informed caregiver supports.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in the nursing home.
PG  - 24, 27-8, 35-9
AB  - Risk factors, diagnosis, ethical considerations, and treatment of pneumonia in a 
      nursing home setting are summarized. Risk factors for pneumonia include 
      age-associated changes, co-morbid conditions, declining general health, and 
      iatrogenic factors. Diagnosis can be challenging in geriatric residents because of 
      atypical presentations and complex underlying diseases. Key features of presentation 
      include rhonchi and confusion. An increased respiratory rate can be a sensitive 
      indicator for pneumonia. Ethical dilemmas include identifying a resident's wishes 
      for treatment in the event of an acute illness and the decision on whether to 
      relocate the resident to an acute care facility. Decisions are based on available 
      resources, medical stability of the resident, unimpeded access to a hospital, and 
      the resident's well-informed decision. The common etiologic pathogen(s) of 
      nursing-home-acquired pneumonia reflect a mixture between community-acquired and 
      hospital-acquired pathogens. Multiple pharmacologic interventions are available, as 
      well as supportive measures including oxygen therapy and hydration. Preventive 
      measures are utilized to decrease the incidence of further infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the issues that influenced the implementation of programmes 
      designed to identify and support frail older people in the community in the 
      Netherlands. METHODS: Qualitative research methods were used to investigate the 
      perspectives of project leaders, project members and members of the steering 
      committee responsible for the implementation of the programmes. Interviews were 
      conducted in 2009 (n = 10) and in 2012 (n = 13) and a focus group was organised in 
      2012 (n = 5). MAIN FINDINGS: The interviews revealed that the implementation was 
      influenced by the extent and quality of collaboration between organisations, 
      adaptation to existing structures, future funding for the programmes and project 
      leadership. A good relationship between participating organisations and 
      professionals is required for successful implementation. A lack of clear project 
      leadership and structural funding hampers the implementation of complex programmes 
      in primary care settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study are 
      useful for organisations and professionals who are planning to implement complex 
      programmes. Identifying barriers concerning institutional collaboration, adaptation 
      to existing structures, leadership and continuation of financial support at an early 
      stage of the implementation process can support practitioners in overcoming them.

TI  - Increasing the profile of the care of the older person in the ED: a contemporary 
      nursing challenge.
PG  - 152-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ienj.2008.05.005 [doi]
AB  - The numbers of frail older persons using emergency departments are already 
      considerable and will continue to increase over time. There are a number of issues 
      related to the assessment and care of older patients that are significantly 
      different to other patient groups. The traditional emergency department (ED) model 
      focusing on rapid triage, treatment and throughput does not meet the needs of many 
      older patients, who have complex presentations, and require comprehensive assessment 
      and referral. In response to this, there are already a number of appropriate and 
      innovative approaches to the care of the older patient demonstrated in the 
      literature. Nurses have a crucial role in contributing to these approaches and in 
      raising the profile of quality care of the older person. Some specific areas that ED 
      nurses can focus on include a more comprehensive approach to assessment and 
      discharge planning, improved communication with the patient and their personal 
      carers, attention to basic nursing care, and making the physical environment safer 
      and less stressful for the older patient. While developing collaborations with their 
      aged care nursing colleagues is important, emergency nurses need to view care of the 
      older person as a central part of their own core business.

TI  - Ability of Emergency Department Physicians Using a Functional Autonomy-Assessing 
      Version of the Triage Risk Screening Tool to Detect Frail Older Patients Who Require 
      Mobile Geriatric Team Consultation.
PG  - 634-641
LID - 10.1007/s12603-020-1378-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frailty in older people associates with poor outcomes. Screening by ED 
      physicians would greatly facilitate detection of frail older patients but our 
      previous attempt to introduce routine ED-physician screening with Short Emergency 
      Geriatric Assessment (SEGA), a 13-item frailty tool that French geriatricians use to 
      identify frail patients, failed due to its length and complexity. A national 
      committee recently generated a new version of the fast and simple 5-item Triage Risk 
      Screening Tool (TRST) in which a subjective item ('nurse concern') was replaced by 
      an item assessing basic activities of daily living. The ability of ED physicians 
      using this French-TRST to accurately detect frail patients who require comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment was assessed. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study on 
      diagnostic accuracy relative to the gold standard, namely, geriatrician-administered 
      SEGA. SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital, France. SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS: The 
      participants were 498 ≥75-year-old patients who visited the ED in 2018-2019 and were 
      administered French-TRSTs by first ED physicians and then geriatricians, followed by 
      SEGA, all within 24 hours. Diagnostic accuracy variables were calculated. 
      Geriatrician-TRST was used to identify TRST items that associated with ED physician 
      misclassification of frail patients. RESULTS: Emergency-TRST was significantly less 
      sensitive than Geriatrician-TRST (88% vs. 93%; p=0.04) and tended to have lower 
      negative predictive value (66% vs. 77%; p=0.09). Emergency-TRSTs rated four 
      French-TRST items less well than Geriatrician-TRSTs. CONCLUSIONS: As a substitute 
      for SEGA in the ED, the French-TRST performed quite well overall but the ED 
      physicians detected frail patients less well than the geriatricians. Modifications 
      of the French-TRST that may improve the diagnostic performance of ED physicians are 
      discussed.

TI  - Dental management considerations for institutionalized geriatric patients.
PG  - 510-6
AB  - The elderly in general and the residents of nursing home facilities in particular 
      are increasingly frail, old, and dentate. Dentists should be prepared to manage the 
      oral health needs of elderly clients who are afflicted with complex medical, 
      functional, and dental disabilities. Proper dental management requires a commitment 
      to provide treatment of quality despite myriad obstacles. From the outset of 
      evaluation, there must be recognition of the likelihood of compromised self-care and 
      the development of proactive strategies to address dependence in oral care.

AB  - Emergency planning for vulnerable populations constitutes a major element of 
      community disaster preparedness and is an area in which guidance is particularly 
      sparse. As evidenced by the well-publicized deaths of nursing home residents 
      following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the need to improve nursing home emergency 
      preparedness is self-evident. Nevertheless, as efforts to improve preparedness 
      develop, a central controversy remains. Aside from mandatory complete evacuations, 
      is it better to evacuate or not to evacuate frail elderly nursing home residents in 
      the setting of hurricane emergencies? This paper reviews the historical evidence on 
      both sides of the argument and suggests a policy and research agenda.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults have complex medical conditions and multiple comorbidities 
      that make them extremely vulnerable when discharged from hospital to home or 
      community settings. Discharge failures and communication gaps lead to negative 
      outcomes, both short term and long term (Naylor, Annu Rev Nurs Res. 
      2003;20:127-147). METHODS: A 9-month study including 89 heart failure (HF) patients 
      was undertaken. These patients were considered at high risk for rehospitalization 
      using definitive inclusion criterion. This criterion was clinically driven and 
      assessed at point of entry into the hospital. Health literacy screening was done 
      before educational sessions, using "The Newest Vital Sign Assessment Tool." This 
      tool has been validated against previous measures of health literacy such as the 
      TOFHLA (Osborn et al, Am J Health Behav. 2007;31:36-46). Reconciliation of 
      medications upon hospital admission, discharge, and during the 6-month follow-up 
      period ensured that all providers were aware of the patient's medications upon 
      discharge. A follow-up appointment with the patient's cardiologist was also arranged 
      within 7 to 10 days postdischarge. The comparison group was all other HF patients 
      within the same hospital setting. Exclusion criteria also included nursing home 
      residents and anyone who declined enrollment into the study. RESULTS: Continual 
      identification of system or process and communication gaps postdischarge helped 
      improve the continuum of care. Key findings from this study include a 30-day 
      readmission rate for the study group of 15%, with an expected rate of 20%. Observed 
      mortality rate was 2% for the study group with an expected rate of 7%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A successful transitional HF program can reduce readmissions, length of stay, cost 
      of hospitalization, and mortality rates. Adaptation of this model elsewhere should 
      be a consideration.

AB  - Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a 
      difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the 
      likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve 
      services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with 
      more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is 
      an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of 
      this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ 
      to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop 
      effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.

TI  - Frailty: a term with many meanings and a growing priority for community nurses.
PG  - 385-9
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.8.385 [doi]
AB  - The question of exactly what frailty is and what that may mean for patients is 
      extremely complex. This is a very conceptual problem requiring a broad and long-term 
      solution. It is not a disease or a condition that can be treated in isolation. 
      Frailty is a collection of contributing factors that culminate in an individual 
      being susceptible to poorer outcomes following health-care interventions and minor 
      illness. The solution to such a complex problem lies in engaging and empowering 
      staff to understand and champion frailty. Once better understood, it will be 
      possible to educate and enable this workforce to recognise the signs of frailty, 
      poor prognosis and patients requiring more specialised palliative care. Informing 
      staff working within a health-care economy of this issue must be the first step in a 
      shift towards managing patients with frailty more appropriately, and streaming their 
      care towards the correct care pathways sooner. This article discusses what frailty 
      is, what it may mean for patients, and attempts to expand on why the construct of 
      frailty is a prevalent issue for community nurses. The link between frailty and 
      mortality is discussed and how targeted appropriate advanced care planning may be 
      used to address this demographic challenge.

TI  - Frailty in older adults: an evolutionary concept analysis.
PG  - 66-84
AB  - The term frailty is often used to describe a subset of the older population with 
      complex health issues. It is associated with dependence, disability, increased 
      health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to 
      the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to 
      clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a 
      definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. 
      The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state 
      of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, 
      psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's 
      susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.

PG  - S15-S23
LID - 10.12968/bjon.2017.26.14.S15 [doi]
AB  - At the beginning of the 21st century, one in five of UK residents can expect to see 
      their 100th birthday and one in four people are aged 60 years or older. The UK has 
      an ageing population. With older age comes an increasing variety of comorbidities 
      that have an impact not only on an individual's quality of life but also on 
      healthcare resources. Older people account for a rapidly rising cohort of 
      individuals admitted to hospital, often with complex needs, and this can require 
      achieving venous access. Venepuncture and cannulation are the most commonly 
      performed invasive procedures in health care today. This article aims to increase 
      awareness of vascular access challenges in older patients so the potential for 
      complications relating to venepuncture, cannulation and infusion therapy can be 
      minimised, thereby improving their overall quality of care. The article will look at 
      the healthcare challenges facing the older population, and the importance of a 
      holistic approach to assess their vascular access needs to deliver optimum care.

      persons from CCC. MEASUREMENT: Data were collected using Resident Assessment 
      Instrument 2.0 (RAI 2.0) (1996-2004) in CCC and Resident Assessment Instrument for 
      Home Care (RAI-HC) (2003-2004) in HC. RESULTS: Prevalence of depressive symptoms 
      among older HC enrollees was lower (12.0%) than in CCC (23.6%). It decreased 
      significantly with age in HC (to about 6% in those older than 95 years) but there 
      were not substantial age differences in CCC. Common factors associated with 
      depressive symptoms in both types of care were cognitive impairment, instability of 
      health, daily pain, disability in activities of daily living; however, advanced age 
      lost its protective effect in CCC. Less than half of the persons in HC and CCC with 
      depressive symptoms were treated with antidepressants and their use decreased with 
      age. CONCLUSIONS: Undertreatment of depressive symptoms among older persons remains 
      a serious problem. Learning more about factors associated with depressive symptoms 
      among the oldest old might improve detection and treatment of depression.

AB  - Improving hospital care for frail older people requires expertise, leadership and 
      resources as these patients have multiple complex needs. One innovative solution to 
      providing the skilled care necessary is to train experienced nurses to become 
      advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs). Such roles encompass activity previously 
      undertaken by medical staff, together with leadership, teaching, research and 
      service development. Skills specific to caring for older people, such as 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment, are also required. This article discusses the 
      need for ANPs in this clinical area, a pilot that is under way in one acute trust to 
      develop these roles, and the potential benefits and challenges that may accompany 
      this development.

AB  - To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand 
      the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to 
      introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct 
      a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults 
      with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom 
      management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom 
      Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors 
      that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It 
      accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within 
      the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its 
      interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some 
      limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability 
      Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it 
      encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate 
      for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of 
      rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health 
      status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a 
      guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the 
      functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

TI  - Development of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac 
      surgery (the PREDOCS programme), following phase one of the guidelines of the 
      Medical Research Council.
PG  - 494-505
LID - 10.1177/1474515113511715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In older patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the timely 
      identification and preparation of patients at risk for frequent postoperative 
      hospital complications provide opportunities to reduce the risk of these 
      complications. AIMS: We developed an evidence-based, multi-component nursing 
      intervention (Prevention of Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery Patients; the PREDOCS 
      programme) for application in the preadmission period to improve patients' physical 
      and psychosocial condition to reduce their risk of postoperative complications. This 
      paper describes in detail the process used to design and develop this 
      multi-component intervention. METHODS: In a team of researchers, experts, cardiac 
      surgeons, registered cardiac surgery nurses, and patients, the revised guidelines 
      for developing and evaluating complex interventions of the Medical Research Council 
      (MRC) were followed, including identifying existing evidence, identifying and 
      developing theory and modelling the process and outcomes. Additionally, the criteria 
      for reporting the development of complex interventions in healthcare (CReDECI) were 
      followed. RESULTS: The intervention is administered during a consultation by the 
      nurse two to four weeks before the surgery procedure. The consultation includes 
      three parts: a general part for all patients, a second part in which patients with 
      an increased risk are identified, and a third part in which selected patients are 
      informed about how to prepare themselves for the hospital admission to reduce their 
      risk. CONCLUSIONS: Following the MRC guidelines, an extended, stepwise, multi-method 
      procedure was used to develop the multi-component nursing intervention to prepare 
      older patients for cardiac surgery, creating transparency in the assumed working 
      mechanisms. Additionally, a detailed description of the intervention is provided.

TI  - Patient outcomes following lower leg major amputations for peripheral arterial 
      disease: A series review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite improvements in revascularization, major amputation remains a 
      significant part of the case-mix in vascular surgical units. These patients tend to 
      be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of 
      stay (LOS). AIM: This series review provides a description of the patient 
      complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb 
      amputation for peripheral arterial disease. METHOD: Medical records coded for major 
      amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, 
      tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed. 
      FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions 
      from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before 
      amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial 
      morbidity and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Major amputation continues to present 
      challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These 
      issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes 
      consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to 
      optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding 
      to surgery require further investigation.

TI  - Mortality and Functional Outcomes After Minor Urological Surgery in Nursing Home 
      Residents: A National Study.
PG  - 909-915
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15302 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine outcomes of minor urological surgery in frail older adults. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: U.S. nursing homes (NHs). PARTICIPANTS: 
      NH residents aged 65 and older undergoing minor inpatient urological surgery 
      (cystoscopy, bladder biopsy, transurethral resection of bladder tumor, prostate 
      biopsy, transurethral resection of prostate, removal of ureteral obstruction, 
      suprapubic tube placement) in the United States between 2004 and 2012 (N=34,605). 
      MEASUREMENTS: One-year mortality and changes in functional status before and after 
      surgery using the Minimum Data Set Activity of Daily Living (MDS-ADL) summary scale. 
      RESULTS: Overall 1-year mortality was 50%, and on average, residents had a 1.9-point 
      worsening in their MDS-ADL score at 1 year, whereas the most highly functional 
      residents (baseline quartile of MDS-ADL scores (0-12)) had a 4.7-point worsening in 
      their MDS-ADL scores at 1 year. Functional decline in residents 1 year after surgery 
      was associated with decline in function in the 6 months before surgery (adjusted 
      hazard ratio (aH)=2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.29-2.49), emergency 
      procedures (aHR=1.37, 95% CI=1.31-1.43), older age (≥85 vs 65-74, aHR=1.17, 95% 
      CI=1.11-1.23), and baseline cognitive impairment (aHR=1.15, 95% CI=1.11-1.20). 
      CONCLUSION: Despite the low complexity of minor urological procedures, NH residents 
      experience high mortality and many demonstrate sustained functional decline up to 
      1-year postoperatively.

TI  - Carers' and nurses' appraisals of needs of nursing home placement for frail older in 
      Norway.
PG  - 3079-88
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02663.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' 
      appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people 
      awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions 
      regarding nursing home placement. BACKGROUND: Requesting nursing home placement can 
      be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and 
      guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the 
      older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides 
      support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers 
      face difficult life situations. DESIGN: This is a descriptive and comparative 
      cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. METHODS: The convenience sample (n 
      = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list 
      in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly 
      participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content 
      analysis. RESULTS: Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' 
      appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, 
      beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making 
      concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising 
      nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able 
      to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 
      'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be 
      placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and 
      involved ethical issues. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite insufficient 
      resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and 
      their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each 
      situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for 
      the timely nursing home placement of older people.

AB  - AIM: To implement an educational programme for nursing staff on recognising, 
      reporting and managing resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in aged care 
      facilities. BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the 
      demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for 
      older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction 
      between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those 
      behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as 
      abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an 
      educational programme. DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia 
      New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). METHODS: This trial was 
      undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded 
      in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control 
      group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were 
      consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the 
      intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control 
      group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, 
      managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be 
      evaluated on an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: It is vital to manage and 
      reduce resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may 
      assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and 
      may improve comprehensive evidence-based care for older people residing in aged care 
      facilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally the older population is increasing rapidly. As a result there 
      is an increase in frail older persons living within the community, with increased 
      risks of a hospital admission and higher mortality and morbidity rates. Due to 
      complexity of care, health care professionals face challenges in providing effective 
      case management and avoiding unplanned admissions to hospital. A community virtual 
      ward (CVW) model was developed to assist health care professionals to support older 
      persons at home during periods of illness and/or functional decline. METHODS: A 
      quantitative observational study was conducted to examine if a CVW model of care 
      reduced unplanned hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations in 
      54 patients over a 12-month period. The sign-rank test examined matched data on bed 
      days, ED presentations, and unplanned hospital admissions pre- and post-CVW 
      implementation. Other risk factors for admission to hospital were examined using the 
      Mann-Whitney test pre-and post-CVW admission, including falls, living alone, and 
      cognition. Correlations between hospital admission avoidances and unplanned hospital 
      admissions and ED presentations were tested using Spearman's ρ test. RESULTS: There 
      was a reduction in ED presentations post-CVW admission (P<0.001), and median 
      unscheduled admissions were reduced (P=0.001). Those living alone had a lower number 
      of ED presentations (median 0.5, interquartile range 0-1) prior to admission in 
      comparison to those living with a caregiver, with no differences observed during 
      admission to CVW. For those who experienced a fall during CVW admission, the odds 
      ratio (OR) of requiring long-term care doubled for each extra fall (OR =2.24, 95% CI 
      1.11 to 4.52, P=0.025). Reduced cognition was associated with an increased risk of 
      ED presentations (ρ=0.292, P<0.05) but not associated with increased risks of 
      unplanned hospital admissions (ρ=0.09, P=0.546). There were no significant 
      correlations seen between admission avoidance and the number of unplanned hospital 
      admissions or ED presentations. CONCLUSION: Through an integrated approach to care, 
      a CVW model in the care of older persons can reduce ED presentations and unplanned 
      hospital admissions.

TI  - The design of the Dutch EASYcare study: a randomised controlled trial on the 
      effectiveness of a problem-based community intervention model for frail elderly 
      people [NCT00105378].
PG  - 65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of their complex clinical presentations and needs frail elderly 
      people require another approach than people who age without many complications. 
      Several inpatient geriatric health services have proven effectiveness in frail 
      persons. However, the wish to live independently and policies that promote 
      independent living as an answer to population aging call for community intervention 
      models for frail elderly people. Maybe models such as preventive home visits, 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment, and intermediate care qualify, but their 
      efficacy is controversial, especially in frail elderly persons living in the 
      community. With the Dutch EASYcare Study Geriatric Intervention Programme (DGIP) we 
      developed a model to study effectiveness of problem based community intervention 
      models in frail elderly people. METHODS/DESIGN: DGIP is a community intervention 
      model for frail elderly persons where the GP refers elderly patients with a problem 
      in cognition, mood, behaviour, mobility, and nutrition. A geriatric specialist nurse 
      applies a guideline-based intervention with a limited number of follow up visits. 
      The intervention starts with the application of the EASYcare instrument for 
      geriatric screening. The EASYcare instrument assesses (instrumental) activities of 
      daily life, cognition, mood, and includes a goal setting item. During the 
      intervention the nurse regularly consults the referring GP and a geriatrician. 
      Effects on functional performance (Groningen Activity Restriction Scale), health 
      related quality of life (MOS-20), and carer burden (Zarit Burden Interview) are 
      studied in an observer blinded randomised controlled trial. 151 participants were 
      randomised over two treatment arms--DGIP and regular care--using pseudo cluster 
      randomisation. We are currently performing the follow up visits. These visits are 
      planned three and six months after inclusion. Process measures and cost measures 
      will be recorded. Intention to treat analyses will focus on post intervention 
      differences between treatment groups. DISCUSSION: The design of a trial evaluating 
      the effects of a community intervention model for frail elderly people was 
      presented. The problem-based participant selection procedure satisfied; few patients 
      that the GP referred did not meet our eligibility criteria. The use of standard 
      terminology makes detailed insight into the contents of our intervention possible 
      using terminology others can understand well.

AB  - Geographically based inpatient geriatric units are an increasingly common 
      organizational approach throughout the world for the care of the hospitalized frail 
      elderly with complex, multidisciplinary acute care needs. The unit provides 
      comprehensive and efficient quality care to these patients by bringing together, in 
      a geographically based unit, specialists from a multiplicity of disciplines to 
      provide needed services in a coordinated manner. To accomplish its goals, the unit 
      employs experts in geriatric medicine, nursing, social work, psychiatry, and other 
      disciplines in a team approach to comprehensive assessment. The education of medical 
      students, medical housestaff, and geriatrics fellows is a critical function of the 
      unit. The unit also serves as a site for research in improving the care of the 
      hospitalized frail elderly.

PG  - 19-24
AB  - A complex and dangerous area of medical intervention with the elderly population is 
      drug therapy. Although drugs have contributed to the well-being of many older 
      persons, some elderly individuals are at risk due to polypharmacy and age-related 
      factors. The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the 
      medication-taking behaviors of two ethnic groups of noninstitutionalized frail 
      elderly individuals. The findings indicate that these individuals may be at risk for 
      harm due to their medication-taking practices. Healthcare professionals must 
      evaluate drug use by the elderly and be aware of the risks of drug misuse by this 
      vulnerable group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are complex 
      cardiogeriatric syndromes mediated by physical, psychological and social factors. 
      Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these 
      syndromes, particularly stroke. PURPOSE: This study sought to describe the clinical 
      characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and 
      concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined 
      the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors 
      of adverse events. METHODS: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and 
      concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were 
      assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, 
      stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding. RESULTS: All-cause readmission 
      to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). 
      The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly 
      associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 
      0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates 
      of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of 
      participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. 
      Self-reported self-care behaviour and 'not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were 
      associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical 
      significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having 
      greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge. 
      CONCLUSION: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be 
      important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients

TI  - A systematic review of predictors and screening instruments to identify older 
      hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline.
PG  - 46-57
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly 
      instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at 
      risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially 
      considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of 
      existing screening instruments are investigated. BACKGROUND: Functional decline is a 
      common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in 
      quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people 
      develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital 
      stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing 
      home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not 
      only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, 
      the impact on health-care costs is also high. RESULTS: Age, lower functional status, 
      cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily 
      life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of 
      functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at 
      risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission 
      Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity 
      Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease 
      of use in the clinical setting were not well described. CONCLUSION: These three 
      instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for 
      functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are 
      identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe 
      and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in 
      this process.

AB  - Older adults and their family caregivers face numerous decisions about hospital 
      discharge, including where they will go and how they will receive care. Older adults 
      who account for nearly 37% of all hospital discharges often need care and support of 
      family members at the time of hospital discharge. This study examines decisions made 
      by hospitalized older adults, families, and health care team members (HCTMs) about 
      hospital discharge. The sample included older adults (n = 13, average age 84), 
      family members (n = 12, average age 71), and HCTMs (n = 7, average age 47). Findings 
      revealed the complexity of hospital discharge planning for older adults through five 
      themes as follows: (a) home, (b) staying independent, (c) "advocating for them," (d) 
      deciding what to tell, and (e) changing the plan.

TI  - The relationship between self-destructive behaviour and nursing home environment.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between self-destructive 
      behaviour and nursing home environment. We performed a cross-sectional study 
      comprising 647 residents in 11 nursing homes in Sydney, Australia using the Harmful 
      Behaviours Scale (HBS), Abbreviated Mental Test Scale and the Resident 
      Classification Index. The Directors of Nursing completed a questionnaire that rated 
      physical design, staff and resident characteristics and demographics were obtained 
      from nursing home records. On regression analysis a greater number of design 
      features for frail and residents with dementia in general, and increased security 
      measures were associated with greater HBS total score and risk-taking and passive 
      self-harm subscales. A residential environment in which the residents were more 
      functionally dependent and more likely to be in a shared room, managerial policies 
      less geared towards managing difficult behaviour and less staff availability and 
      training were associated with the 'uncooperativeness' factor. There were no 
      significant predictors of the other two factors. The relationship between nursing 
      home environment and self-destructive behaviours and the environment is complex and 
      there needs to be an individualized approach to placement.

TI  - Fall prevention in frail elderly nursing home residents: a challenge to case 
      management: part II.
PG  - 32-44
AB  - Parts I and II of this article examine the impact of a falls prevention program on 
      the fall incidents among the residents in a nursing home. It was hypothesized that a 
      diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home 
      residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number 
      of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The 
      program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks 
      facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining 
      changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results 
      identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized 
      interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex 
      medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that 
      muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. 
      Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail 
      elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and 
      postponing problems resulting from inactivity. Part I (LCM, Nov-Dec 2001) discussed 
      the background and process of a falls program and factors contributing to the 
      occurrence of falls. This month we examine the interdisciplinary team approach to 
      assessment, method, and implementing strategies for an effective fall prevention 
      program. Tools used for prevention, monitoring, and investigation of falls are also 
      detailed.

AB  - The elderly population in Sweden is increasing. This will lead to an increased need 
      for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. 
      Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra 
      demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical 
      presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance 
      personnel to understand and meet these patients' care needs. Using a caring science 
      approach, we apply the patient's perspective, and the aim of this study is to 
      identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the 
      assessment category "general affected health condition". Thus, we have analyzed the 
      characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective 
      audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service 
      records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty 
      which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state 
      of "general affected health condition", as either illness or ill-health. This offers 
      a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and 
      support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the 
      concept of frailty ought to be included in "The International Statistical 
      Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (ICD-10).

TI  - Integrated services for frail elders (SIPA): a trial of a model for Canada.
PG  - 5-42
AB  - The complex formed by chronic illness, episodes of acute illness, physiological 
      disabilities, functional limitations, and cognitive problems is prevalent among 
      frail elderly persons. These individuals rely on assistance from social and health 
      care programs, which in Canada are still fragmented. SIPA (Services intégrés pour 
      les personnes âgées fragiles) is an integrated service model based on community 
      services, a multidisciplinary team, case management that retains clinical 
      responsibility for all the health and social services required, and the capacity to 
      mobilize resources as required and according to the care protocol. The SIPA 
      demonstration project used an experimental design, with random allocation of the 
      1,230 participants from two areas of Montreal to an experimental and a control 
      group. The costs of institutional services were $4,270 less for those in the SIPA 
      group compared to the control group; the costs of community care were $3,394 more. 
      The proportion of persons waiting in acute care hospitals for nursing home placement 
      was twice as high in the control group as in the SIPA group. The costs of acute 
      hospitalizations for persons in the SIPA group with ADL disabilities were at least 
      $4,000 lower than those for persons in the control group. In conclusion, the SIPA 
      trial showed that it is possible to undertake ambitious and rigorous demonstration 
      projects in Canada. These results were obtained without an increase in the overall 
      costs of health and social services, without reducing the quality of care, and 
      without increasing the burden on elderly persons and their relatives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Case management is a type of intervention expected to improve the 
      quality of care and therefore the quality of life of frail, community-dwelling older 
      people while delaying institutionalisation in nursing homes. However, the 
      heterogeneity, multidimensionality and complexity of these interventions make their 
      evaluation by the means of classical approaches inadequate. Our objective was 
      twofold: (i) to propose a tool allowing for the identification of the key components 
      that explain the success of case management for this population and (ii) to propose 
      a typology based on the results of this tool. METHODS: The process started with a 
      multiple embedded case study design in order to identify the key components of case 
      management. Based on the results of this first step, data were collected among 22 
      case management interventions, in order to evaluate their expected effectiveness. 
      Finally, multiple correspondence analyses was conducted to propose a typology of 
      case management. The overall approach was informed by Wagner's Chronic Care Model 
      and the theory of complexity. RESULTS: The study identified a total of 23 
      interacting key components. Based on the clustering of response patterns of the 22 
      case management projects included in our study, three types of case management 
      programmes were evidenced, situated on a continuum from a more "socially-oriented" 
      type towards a more "clinically-oriented" type of case management. The type of 
      feedback provided to the general practitioner about both the global geriatric 
      assessment and the result of the intervention turned out to be the most discriminant 
      component between the types. CONCLUSION: The study design allowed to produce a tool 
      that can be used to distinguish between different types of case management 
      interventions and further evaluate their effect on frail older people in terms of 
      the delaying institutionalisation, functional and cognitive status, quality of life 
      and societal costs.

TI  - Pain complaints and cognitive status among elderly institution residents.
PG  - 517-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between self-reported pain and cognitive 
      impairment among frail elderly institution residents. DESIGN: A cross-sectional 
      correlational study. SETTING: A large urban nursing home and congregate apartment 
      complex housing predominantly Jewish elderly. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred 
      fifty-eight elderly institution residents (30% in the nursing home, 70% in 
      congregate apartments). The sample was 70% female and averaged 83.3 years of age. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Respondent self-reports tapped pain intensity, number of localized 
      pain complaints, cognitive status, and disability in performance of activities of 
      daily living. Attending physicians or physician assistants rated respondents' health 
      status. MAIN RESULTS: Pain intensity and number of localized pain complaints bore 
      small but significant negative relationships to cognitive impairment. Pain was 
      positively associated with physician-rated ill health and functional disability. The 
      association between pain and cognitive status remained significant even when 
      controlled statistically for effects of physical health and functional disability. 
      Item-by-item examination of localized pain complaints indicated that markedly 
      cognitively impaired individuals were less likely to report pain in the back and 
      joints. However, examination of possible physical causes of reported pain revealed 
      no differences between pain reports of cognitively impaired versus intact 
      individuals in either the presence or the absence of a likely physical cause. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data provide no evidence for the "masking" of pain complaints by 
      cognitive impairment. They suggest instead that, although cognitively impaired 
      elderly may slightly underreport experienced pain, their self-reports are generally 
      no less valid that those of cognitively intact individuals. Limitations of the 
      research are acknowledged and implications for treatment of cognitively impaired 
      institution residents are discussed.

TI  - Characteristics of patients described as sub-acute in an acute care hospital.
PG  - 203-8
LID - 10.1017/S0714980813000214 [doi]
AB  - Frail older patients suffer from multiple, complex needs that often go unmet in an 
      acute care setting. Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults 
      is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated 
      "sub-acute" frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. 
      Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants (n = 62) 
      required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely 
      ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went 
      unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The 
      majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of 
      post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part 
      of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being 
      funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home.

TI  - A nurse-led interdisciplinary primary care approach to prevent disability among 
      community-dwelling frail older people: a large-scale process evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased 
      risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, 
      an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving 
      individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and 
      long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case 
      manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates 
      cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications 
      regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale 
      had not hitherto been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which the 
      interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into 
      healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the 
      benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. DESIGN: A process evaluation was 
      conducted using a mixed methods design. SETTINGS: Six GP practices in the south of 
      the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Practice nurses (n=7), GPs (n=12), occupational 
      therapists (n=6) and physical therapists (n=20) participated in the process 
      evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (≥ 70 years) were 
      included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were 
      confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to 
      communicate in Dutch were excluded. METHODS: Quantitative data (logbooks and 
      evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 
      13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, 
      data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured 
      interviews and four focus group discussions. RESULTS: Although some parts of the 
      protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older 
      people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for 
      the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive 
      treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and 
      experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the 
      interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of 
      the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the 
      protocol need special attention.

TI  - Fall prevention in frail elderly nursing home residents: a challenge to case 
      management: part I.
PG  - 246-51
AB  - Parts I and II of this article examine the impact of a falls prevention program on 
      the fall incidents among the residents in a nursing home. It was hypothesized that a 
      diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home 
      residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number 
      of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The 
      program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks 
      facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining 
      changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results 
      identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized 
      interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex 
      medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that 
      muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. 
      Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail 
      elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and 
      postponing problems resulting from inactivity. Part I discusses the background and 
      process of a falls program and factors contributing to the occurrence of falls. Part 
      II will examine the interdisciplinary team approach to assessment, method, and 
      implementing strategies for an effective fall prevention program. Tools used for 
      prevention, monitoring, and investigation of falls will be detailed in Part II.

TI  - Development of a frailty measure for older adults: the frailty index for elders.
PG  - 223-40
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Frailty is a significant challenge for health care. 
      Therefore, it is important to identify frail individuals. Theoretical Framework: The 
      Vulnerability/Risk/Human Response/Care Model. The purpose of this study was to 
      develop and validate a measure to identify frail older adults. METHODS: Instrument 
      development encompassed the following: delineation of content domains, item 
      generation, content validity, quantitative content validity analysis, and 
      psychometric analysis. RESULTS: Findings indicated the following: (a) Frailty is a 
      complex concept, (b) the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE) is composed of 10 items, 
      (c) FIFE was able to predict depression, and (d) FIFE was able to differentiate 
      differences in demographic profiles by social support environment. CONCLUSIONS: FIFE 
      is a valid instrument. FIFE can be used to study the relationships among frailty 
      determinants, provide standardized measurement, and develop and measure 
      interventional studies.

TI  - Quality care provision for older people: an interview study with patients and 
      primary healthcare professionals.
PG  - e500-7
LID - 10.3399/bjgp15X686065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, primary health care for the ageing population has 
      become increasingly complex. AIM: This study sought to explore the views and needs 
      of healthcare professionals and older patients relating to primary care in order to 
      identify focal areas for improving primary health care for older people. DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: This research was structured as a mixed interview study with focus groups 
      and individual interviews. Participants were made up of primary healthcare 
      professionals and older patients. Patients were recruited from five elderly care 
      homes in a small city in the southern part of the Netherlands. METHOD: All 
      interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by two individual researchers 
      applying constant comparative analysis. Data collection proceeded until saturation 
      was reached. RESULTS: Participants in the study agreed about the need for primary 
      care for older patients, and showed sympathy with one another's perspectives. They 
      did note, however, a number of obstacles hindering good healthcare provision. The 
      major themes that arose were: 'autonomy and independence', 'organisational 
      barriers', and 'professional expertise'. Participants generally noted that it is 
      important to clarify differences in perspectives about good care between patients 
      and healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Effective primary care intervention for 
      older patients requires mutual understanding of the expectations and goals of all 
      parties involved. There are a number of important requirements, especially 
      accessible patient information in the form of care plans; specialist training for 
      nurses and GPs on complex care and multimorbidity; and training on discussing 
      autonomy, goal setting, and shared care. Further improvement in health care for 
      older people and its evaluation research should focus on these requirements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the content of an English-language 
      version of a Japanese iPad application designed to facilitate shared decision-making 
      around goal setting in rehabilitation: Aid for Decision-making in Occupational 
      Choice-English (ADOC-E). DESIGN: Phase 1: Delphi methods to reach consensus with an 
      international group of expert occupational therapists on the text and images in 
      ADOC-E. Phase 2: Testing correct recognition (unprompted and prompted) of images in 
      ADOC-E by health service users in inpatient rehabilitation and residential care. 
      SETTING: Phase 1: International, online. Phase 2: Three healthcare services in New 
      Zealand-(1) a residential rehabilitation service for traumatic brain injury, (2) a 
      nursing home for frail older adults and (3) an inpatient rehabilitation ward in a 
      public hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Phase 1: Fourteen experienced occupational therapists 
      from New Zealand (4), Australia (4), UK (2) and USA (4). Phase 2: Twenty-four 
      rehabilitation and residential care service users (10 men, 14 women; 20-95 years; 
      Mini-Mental State Exam scores 13-30). RESULTS: Four Delphi rounds were required to 
      reach consensus with the experienced occupational therapists on the content of 
      ADOC-E, ending with 100 items covering daily activities that people do and social 
      roles they participate in. Ninety-five per cent (95/100) of ADOC-E items could each 
      be correctly identified by over 80% of service user participants with either 
      unprompted or prompted recognition. CONCLUSION: While a few of the more abstract 
      concepts in ADOC-E (related to complex social roles) were less likely to be 
      correctly recognised by all participants, the text and images ADOC-E were deemed to 
      be fit for purpose overall and ready for future clinical testing.

TI  - Frailty Index and Mortality in Nursing Home Residents in France: Results From the

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine whether the capacity of an 
      age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by 
      Rockwood) to predict mortality in a nursing home population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of 
      pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 773 older 
      persons (74.4% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. MEASUREMENTS: The FI was 
      computed as the ratio between actual and 30 potential deficits the participant might 
      have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 
      deficits]). Death events were monitored and detected over a 12-month follow-up. The 
      risk of death was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Mean age 
      of participants was 86.2 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.35 (SD 0.11). At the 
      end of the follow-up, 135 (17.4%) death events were recorded. A positive association 
      between the FI and mortality (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard 
      ratio 1.018, 95% confidence interval 1.002-1.035, P = .03) was reported. The use of 
      the traditional 0.25 cut-point for detecting the frailty status is inadequate in 
      this population. CONCLUSION: The FI is able to predict mortality even in very old 
      and complex elders, such as nursing home residents.

TI  - The effect of a complementary e-learning course on implementation of a quality 
      improvement project regarding care for elderly patients: a stepped wedge trial.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1748-5908-7-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium occurs frequently in elderly hospitalised patients and is 
      associated with higher mortality, increased length of hospital stay, functional 
      decline, and admission to long-term care. Healthcare professionals frequently do not 
      recognise delirium, indicating that education can play an important role in 
      improving delirium care for hospitalised elderly. Previous studies have indicated 
      that e-learning can provide an effective way of educating healthcare professionals 
      and improving quality of care, though results are inconsistent. METHODS AND DESIGN: 
      This stepped wedge cluster randomised trial will assess the effects of a 
      complementary delirium e-learning course on the implementation of quality 
      improvement initiative, which aims to enhance the recognition and management of 
      delirium in elderly patients. The trial will be conducted in 18 Dutch hospitals and 
      last 11 months. Measurements will be taken in all participating wards using monthly 
      record reviews, in order to monitor delivered care. These measurements will include 
      the percentage of elderly patients who were screened for the risk of developing 
      delirium, use of the Delirium Observation Screening scale, use of nursing or medical 
      interventions, and the percentage of elderly patients who were diagnosed with 
      delirium. Data regarding the e-learning course will be gathered as well. These data 
      will include user characteristics, information regarding use of the course, delirium 
      knowledge before and after using the course, and the attitude and intentions of 
      nurses concerning delirium care. SETTING: The study will be conducted in internal 
      medicine and surgical wards of eighteen hospitals that are at the beginning stages 
      of implementing the Frail Elderly Project in the Netherlands. DISCUSSION: Better 
      recognition of elderly patients at risk for delirium and subsequent care is expected 
      from the introduction of an e-learning course for nurses that is complementary to an 
      existing quality improvement project. This trial has the potential to demonstrate 
      that e-learning can be a vital part of the implementation process, especially for 
      quality improvement projects aimed at complex health issues such as delirium. The 
      study will contribute to a growing body of knowledge concerning e-learning and the 
      effects it can have on knowledge as well as delivered care. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Specialist care for frail older people.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - At Leicester Royal Infirmary, the care of frail older people occupies a 
      disproportionate amount of emergency department (ED) staff's time and resources. Too 
      few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with 
      older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the 
      pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has 
      set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not 
      be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as 
      possible. This article describes how the unit operates.

TI  - Minimal effect on energy intake by additional evening meal for frail elderly service 
      flat residents--a pilot study.
PG  - 295-301
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional problems are common in frail elderly individuals receiving 
      municipal care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if an additional evening meal could improve 
      total daily food intake, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life 
      (HRQOL) in frail elderly service flat (SF) residents. DESIGN: Out of 122 residents 
      in two SF complexes, 60 subjects agreed to participate, of which 49 subjects (median 
      84 (79-90) years, (25th-75th percentile)) completed the study. For six months 23 
      residents in one SF complex were served 530 kcal in addition to their regular meals, 
      i.e. intervention group (I-group). Twenty-six residents in the other SF building 
      were controls (C-group). Nutritional status, energy and nutrient intake, length of 
      night time fast, cognitive function and HRQOL was assessed before and after the 
      intervention. RESULTS: At the start, the Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 27% 
      as malnourished and 63% as at risk for malnutrition, with no difference between the 
      groups. After six months the median body weight was unchanged in the I-group, +0.6 
      (-1.7-+1.6) kg (p=0.72) and the C-group -0.6 (-2.0-+0.5) kg (p=0.15). Weight change 
      ranged from -13% to +15%. The evening meal improved the protein and carbohydrate 
      intake (p<0.01) but the energy intake increased by only 180 kcal/day (p=0.15). The 
      night time fast decreased in the I-group from 15.0 (13.0-16.0) to 13.0 (12.0-14.0) 
      hours (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in cognitive function or HRQOL 
      between the groups. CONCLUSION: Nine out of ten frail elderly SF residents had 
      nutritional problems. Serving an additional evening meal increased the protein and 
      carbohydrate intake, but the meal had no significant effect on energy intake, body 
      weight or HRQOL. The variation in outcome within each study group was large.

TI  - Unravelling the differences between complexity and frailty in old age: findings from 
      a constructivist grounded theory study.
PG  - 67-73

AB  - UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but 
      there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important 
      if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in 
      society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study 
      into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and 
      operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded 
      theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses 
      and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the 
      relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within 
      the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand 
      important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to 
      describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has 
      resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity 
      means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has 
      implications for nursing practice that require further study.

TI  - Care management's challenges and opportunities to reduce the rapid rehospitalization 
      of frail community-dwelling older adults.
PG  - 451-8
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnq015 [doi]
AB  - Community-based frail older adults, burdened with complex medical and social needs, 
      are at great risk for preventable rapid rehospitalizations. Although federal and 
      state regulations are in place to address the care transitions between the hospital 
      and nursing home, no such guidelines exist for the much larger population of 
      community-dwelling frail older adults. Few studies have looked at interventions to 
      prevent rehospitalizations in this large segment of the older adult population. 
      Similarly, standardized disease management approaches that lower hospitalization 
      rates in an independent adult population may not suffice for guiding the care of 
      frail persons. Care management interventions currently face unique challenges in 
      their attempt to improve the transitional care of community-dwelling older adults. 
      However, impending national imperatives aimed at reducing potentially avoidable 
      hospitalizations will soon demand and reward care management strategies that 
      identify frail persons early in the discharge process and promote the sharing of 
      critical information among patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. 
      Opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of care-related communications 
      must focus on the effective blending of training and technology for improving 
      communications vital to successful care transitions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: "Lack of energy" or anergia is a common complaint associated with adverse 
      outcomes in older people. There is a lack of knowledge on this symptom in the 
      nursing home (NH) setting. The aim of this study was to investigate whether lack of 
      energy was associated with hospitalization and mortality in NH residents. DESIGN: 
      Longitudinal observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 575 NH 
      residents (72% women) in 13 French NHs from the Incidence of pNeumonia and related 
      ConseqUences in nursing home Residents (INCUR) study cohort. MEASUREMENTS: Lack of 
      energy was measured at the baseline visit as part of the 10-item Geriatric 
      Depression Scale. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models 
      were performed to test the association of lack of energy with hospitalization events 
      and mortality over 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: The mean age of the study sample 
      was 86.3 (SD = 7.5) years. At the baseline, 250 (43.5%) residents complained about 
      lack of energy. Overall, 192 (33.4%) individuals experienced at least 1 
      hospitalization event and 98 (17.0%) died during the 12-month follow-up. Lack of 
      energy was significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.35; 
      95% CI 1.02-1.80; P = .03), even after adjustment for potential confounders (HR 
      1.41; 95% CI 1.04-1.91; P = .02). No statistically significant association was found 
      between lack of energy and 12-month mortality. CONCLUSION: Lack of energy is a 
      predictor of hospitalization in older people living in NHs. It may be considered a 
      relevant clinical feature for identifying individuals at risk of adverse health 
      outcomes, thus potentially serving as a screening tool for subsequently conducting a 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment in this highly vulnerable and complex population.

AB  - The Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors program, a joint program of Mount Sinai Medical 
      Center's Departments of Medicine and Geriatrics, is a large multidisciplinary 
      teaching, research, and clinical care initiative serving homebound adults in 
      Manhattan since 1995. Caring for more than 1,000 patients annually, the physicians 
      of Visiting Doctors make more than 6,000 urgent and routine visits each year, making 
      it the largest program of its kind in the country. Services include 24-hour 
      physician availability, palliative care, social work case management, collaboration 
      with nursing agencies, and in-home specialty consultation. The program serves many 
      individuals who have previously received inadequate and inconsistent medical care. 
      Patients are referred by social service agencies, localphysicians, and hospitals and 
      are primarily frail older individuals with complex needs. Funded by Mount Sinai and 
      private support, the program serves as a major teaching site for medical nursing, 
      and social work trainees interested in home-based primary care.

      satisfaction: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 1079-90
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12699 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse effects of a comprehensive 
      continuum of care (intervention group) on frail older persons' life satisfaction, as 
      compared to those receiving usual care (control group). The intervention included 
      geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for 
      relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes. 
      BACKGROUND: Improvements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in 
      studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects 
      of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life 
      satisfaction are not well explored. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. METHODS: 
      The validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older 
      persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12 months after the 
      baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for 
      intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as 
      well as six- to 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Older persons who received the 
      intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who 
      received usual care, between 6 and 12 month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding 
      functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a 
      positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, 
      psychological health and financial situation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Frail 
      older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from 
      the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care 
      interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential 
      part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers 
      promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.

TI  - Encountering the older confused patient: professional carers' experiences.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - THE STUDY'S RATIONALE: Confusion is a common condition among older patients and 
      often a fearful experience. Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for 
      confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost 
      as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 
      study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with 
      older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected 
      from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the 
      care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach 
      was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with 
      older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research 
      Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles 
      were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter 
      providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the 
      interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff 
      health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been 
      changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused 
      patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the 
      patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. 
      The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the 
      unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging 
      professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the 
      confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and 
      the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. 
      Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the 
      professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly -- a geriatrician's perspective.
PG  - 113-37
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different 
      populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of 
      complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for 
      cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now 
      that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also 
      prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the 
      world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early 
      detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the 
      increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is 
      this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting 
      the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail 
      elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and 
      aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on 
      dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of 
      CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its 
      complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly 
      succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire 
      dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for 
      those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly 
      with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? 
      The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality of 
      life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital 
      aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by 
      each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men 
      being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of 
      CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.

TI  - Recruitment of frail older people to research: lessons learnt through experience.
PG  - 643-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based 
      practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to 
      provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, 
      interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important 
      factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. 
      Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. 
      However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. AIMS OF THE 
      PAPER: This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older 
      people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of 
      research related to ethical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of frail older people 
      to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the 
      researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not 
      to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is 
      sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and 
      refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older 
      people to research while protecting their right to refuse.

TI  - Who is looking after Mom and Dad? Unregulated workers in Canadian long-term care 
      homes.
PG  - 47-59
LID - 10.1017/S0714980814000506 [doi]
AB  - Older adults living in residential long-term care or nursing homes have increasingly 
      complex needs, including more dementia than in the past, yet we know little about 
      the unregulated workforce providing care. We surveyed 1,381 care aides in a 
      representative sample of 30 urban nursing homes in the three Canadian Prairie 
      provinces and report demographic, health and well-being, and work-related 
      characteristics. Over 50 per cent of respondents were not born in Canada and did not 
      speak English as their first language. They reported moderately high levels of 
      burnout and a strong sense of their work's worth. Few respondents reported attending 
      educational sessions. This direct caregiver workforce is poorly understood, has 
      limited training or standards for minimum education, and training varies widely 
      across provinces. Workplace characteristics affecting care aides reflect factors 
      that precipitate burnout in allied health professions, with implications for quality 
      of care, staff health, and staff retention.

TI  - Daily physical activity and the use of a walking aid in relation to falls in elderly 
      people in a residential care setting.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - Physical activity is usually considered as an important component of a healthy 
      lifestyle, including a preventive effect on the risk of falls in the elderly. The 
      relationship between physical activity and falls is complex: physical activity is a 
      prerequisite to maintain neuromuscular functioning, necessary to keep balance and to 
      react to a fall, but a higher level of physical activity also implies a greater 
      exposure to environmental threats, possibly leading to a fall. Related to this 
      greater exposure to threats, the use of a walking aid may protect against falls in 
      those who have impaired mobility. In this cross-sectional study we investigated the 
      relationship between daily physical activity and falls and the use of a walking aid 
      in elderly subjects. Participants were 131 men and 563 women, aged 70 years and over 
      (mean age and standard deviation: 82+/-6 years), living in homes for the elderly 
      (n=335) and apartment houses for elderly (n=359). Data on baseline characteristics 
      and falls in the previous year were obtained using a questionnaire. The level of 
      daily physical activity in the previous year was obtained by means of a 
      questionnaire regarding household and leisure activities. Subjects with a lower 
      extremity fracture in the previous year were excluded from the analyses. Data were 
      analysed using multiple logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, and 
      residence. In the past year, 40% of the participants fell at least one time, and 19% 
      of the participants fell two times or more. Since falls and recurrent falls were 
      nonlinearly related to the level of daily physical activity, the physical activity 
      score was grouped into quartiles: the highest quartile corresponding to the highest 
      activity level. Odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for falls and recurrent 
      falls for subjects in the highest quartile contrasted with those in the lowest 
      quartile were 0.5 (0.3-0.9) and 0.3 (0.2-0.6), respectively. The risk of falls and 
      recurrent falls was not lower for those with intermediate levels of daily physical 
      activity. The use of a walking aid protected against falls in those with 
      intermediate high activity levels (third quartile). It was suggested that the 
      exposure to environmental hazards, due to some degree of physical activity may have 
      been responsible for the nonlinear relationship between daily physical activity and 
      falling. We conclude that a high activity level and the use of a walking aid may 
      protect against falls.

AB  - This paper analyses a photographic essay of older adults and workers in a nursing 
      home environment, as a day-in-the-life documentary photographic essay Who cares 
      published in Kai Tiaki, Nursing New Zealand in 2006. We discuss the essay, which 
      intended to make eldercare work more visible and valued. The purpose of this paper 
      is to ask, 'Why were these photographs so uncomfortable to view, and why did they 
      elicit such strong polysemous reactions from viewers?' We argue that in order to 
      address this question, sites of eldercare may be understood as heterotopias, or 
      places of exclusion from social norms. While the photographs were meant to make it 
      possible for viewers to look into the daily reality of eldercare work, we suggest 
      the visual essay instead acted as a heterotopic hall of mirrors, revealing tensions 
      that obscured the labour value to viewers. As observers looked into the mirror of 
      their own lives, the utopian discourse of a residential care 'home' was disrupted, 
      as the idealised version of eldercare work we have become attuned to in the media 
      was punctured by the powerful heterotopia of the photographic essay. This article 
      illustrates the way in which eldercare work is made invisible through complex social 
      processes involving sight and site related to contemporary visual and spatial 
      practices of aging and eldercare.

TI  - Violence in nursing homes: perceptions of female caregivers.
PG  - 1660-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02196.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence. 
      BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and 
      injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, 
      few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence. METHODS: Forty-one female 
      caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a 
      situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The 
      reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The main 
      finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the 
      beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, 
      ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes. CONCLUSION 
      AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the perception of violence is subjective, 
      there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as 
      over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined 
      operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also 
      indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. 
      To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how 
      caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to disclose the characteristics of quality of life 
      as perceived by physically frail but lucid elderly people living in nursing homes to 
      increase the understanding of the phenomenon of quality of life in this setting. 
      Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on 
      two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for 
      hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both 
      nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The 
      participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main 
      themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for 
      departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon 
      quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important 
      aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing 
      home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set 
      their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be 
      recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and 
      doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to 
      living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in 
      caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what 
      matters most in relation to their quality of life.

TI  - Integrated client care for frail older adults in the community: preliminary report 
      on a system-wide approach.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - The Toronto Central Community Care Access Centre is leading a collaborative local 
      health integration network systemic change initiative to implement and evaluate a 
      practical model of integrated care for older adults with complex needs. The approach 
      is embedded in the community where older adults and their families live and is 
      designed to first and foremost improve the quality of care while ultimately bending 
      the cost curve. The model is leveraging and aligning existing system resources by 
      bringing together sectors from across the health system to create ways of working 
      that build capacity in the system to be more responsive to this population. Outcomes 
      to date will be discussed and next steps described. The secondary goal was to 
      understand the key elements of this integration that can be scaled locally and 
      across the province.

TI  - Nurse-Physician Collaborative Partnership: a rural model for the chronically ill.
PG  - 208-16
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accessibility and quality of primary health care services in rural 
      areas are challenging issues, particularly for the elderly and those with chronic or 
      complex medical conditions. The objective of the Nurse-Physician Collaborative 
      Partnership was to implement and evaluate a collaborative partnership between 
      homecare nurses and family physicians in the rural Trochu-Delburne-Elnora area of 
      Alberta. METHODS: Overall, 37 patients were enrolled in a shared care plan, which 
      included comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment, early intervention, health 
      education and self-management. Patient and provider outcomes were assessed using 
      quantitative and qualitative data collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. 
      RESULTS: Results showed that patients made improvements in activities of daily 
      living and robust cognitive status. In interviews, patients reported improvements in 
      psychological well-being, knowledge of disease processes and confidence to manage 
      health issues. Patients' use of acute health care services decreased, showing a 51% 
      reduction in the number of days in hospital, a 32% reduction in emergency department 
      visits and a 25% reduction in hospital admissions. Total acute service costs, 
      excluding program costs, decreased by 40% from an average of $15,485 to $9,313 per 
      person (p < or = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, policy initiatives that 
      incorporate the shared care model developed in this project may be considered. To 
      our knowledge, this type of evaluation has not previously been conducted in a rural 
      Canadian setting.

TI  - Making sense of frailty: An ethnographic study of the experience of older people 
      living with complex health problems.
LID - 10.1111/opn.12172 [doi]
LID - e12172
AB  - AIM: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in 
      their daily lives. BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the personal experience of 
      frailty in the context of fluctuating ill-health has the potential to contribute to 
      the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. DESIGN: An 
      ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a 
      community matron service in a large city in the North of England. METHODS: Up to six 
      care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were 
      observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11 months. 
      Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own 
      homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4-year period. Data analysis was undertaken using 
      the constant comparative method. FINDINGS: The experience of frailty was understood 
      through the construction of four themes: Fluctuating ill-health and the disruption 
      of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety 
      and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of 
      complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience 
      episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living 
      becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding 
      of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has 
      the potential to inform nursing practice in person-centred care . IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and 
      continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.

TI  - Relationships between nurses and family caregivers: partners in care?
PG  - 89-103
AB  - Increasing reliance on family care of elderly people at home calls for a critical 
      analysis of the relationship between formal and informal caregivers. Although much 
      has been written about how health professionals and family caregivers should relate 
      to one another, we know very little about the relationships that develop between 
      them. Using data from a qualitative study, this article illustrates that 
      relationships between community nurses and family members caring for frail elders 
      are complex, dynamic, and multifaceted. Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to 
      changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four 
      distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) 
      manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient. Each type is described, and implications for 
      nursing practice and research are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diabetes in older adults is increasing in its prevalence and complexity. 
      To date, little research has been done to inform current diabetes management, 
      including education and support, in older adults in Canada. The objective of this 
      interactive national workshop was to develop key research priorities for future 
      research related to diabetes in older adults. METHODS: Workshop participants 
      comprised interprofessional healthcare providers, decision makers and policy makers 
      from across Canada. Approximately 30 individuals attended an interactive 2-day 
      meeting that included expert presentations and group consensus building using an 
      electronic meeting system as well as nominal group techniques. RESULTS: The results 
      of the 2-day meeting found more than 50 ideas that were summarized into 5 overall 
      themes, with 14 subquestions, reflecting areas such as 1) identifying relevant 
      outcomes for patients, providers and decision makers; 2) diabetes prevention; 3) the 
      impact of diabetes on older adults and informal caregivers; 4) risk assessment tools 
      and 5) effective models of care across a variety of healthcare settings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To date, this workshop is the first of its kind and follows suit with 
      other international working groups and associations. The research priorities 
      developed through consensus from this workshop set forward a research agenda for 
      diabetes in older adults in Canada.

TI  - Supporting elderly dependent people at home.
PG  - 1290-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relation between the dependency of elderly people and the 
      assistance they receive from others by using a detailed but simple measure of 
      dependency. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a survey of people aged 70 and 
      over. SETTING: Two general practices in south Wales. SUBJECTS: 1280 people aged 70 
      and over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependency on others to perform essential 
      functions; detailed data on who assists with those functions. RESULTS: Increasing 
      dependency was associated with increased use of more than one member of the family 
      or friends and an increase in the provision of statutory services. CONCLUSION: The 
      complexity of the relation between dependency and those who care for dependent 
      people has previously been underestimated. The presence of providers of statutory 
      services at the household of elderly dependent people suggests that these services 
      can be developed further to help those caring for elderly people at home.

TI  - Nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients: a 
      descriptive study of what nurses actually do?
PG  - 1387-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03026.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aims to explore nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised 
      older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and 
      strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem. BACKGROUND: Urinary tract 
      infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. 
      Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms 
      causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of 
      caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition. 
      DESIGN: Qualitative. METHODS: A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a 
      hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen 
      nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. RESULTS: When 
      managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, 
      nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms 
      and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed 
      the basis for deciding whether the patient's urinary condition should be managed by 
      nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on 
      this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be 
      effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to 
      improve nurses' existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary 
      tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified. CONCLUSION: 
      Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing 
      care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive 
      'basic urinary tract infection care' on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms 
      could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by 
      nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of 
      interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine 
      which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.

TI  - Comparing and contrasting the role of family carers and nurses in the domestic 
      health care of frail older people.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - Care in the community has been constructed on the basis of professional support for 
      carers who, as a result of community care policy that has released highly dependant 
      people from residential care and long-stay wards, are carrying out a wide range of 
      tasks, including complex health care activities. The present paper examines the 
      health care activities currently undertaken by family carers and the way in which 
      they work with, and are supported by, professional nurses in the home. It compares 
      and contrasts the approaches of both groups to care-giving for this client group. 
      The authors conclude by making some suggestions for improving the way in which 
      family carers and nurses work together in the home.

TI  - The use of case management for community-dwelling older people: the effects on 
      loneliness, symptoms of depression and life satisfaction in a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 889-901
LID - 10.1111/scs.12520 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for 
      community-dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated 
      contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms 
      and life satisfaction. DESIGN: A two-armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial 
      with repeated follow-ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an 
      intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. METHOD: Inclusion criteria were 
      the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance 
      in two or more self-reported activities of daily living, having at least two 
      hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to 
      enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of 
      general case management, general information, specific information and continuity 
      and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) 
      being conducted per month. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the 
      primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along 
      with complete case and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: During the trial period n = 12 
      died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups 
      at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary 
      outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in any significant effects 
      for the primary outcomes at any of the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete 
      case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention 
      regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 
      0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in 
      clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that 
      case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity 
      of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

TI  - Geriatrician input into nursing homes reduces emergency hospital admissions.
PG  - 331-7
LID - 10.1016/j.archger.2011.10.014 [doi]
AB  - Nursing home residents are often very dependent, very frail and have complex care 
      needs. Effective partnerships between primary and secondary care will be of benefit 
      to these residents. We looked at 1954 admission episodes to our Trust from April 
      2006 to March 2009 inclusive. 3 nursing homes had the highest number of multiple 
      admissions (≥ 4). Four strategies to reduce hospital admissions were used at these 
      nursing homes for 3 months. An alert was also sent to the geriatrician if one of the 
      residents was admitted so that their discharge from hospital could be expedited. The 
      project was then extended for another 4 months with 6 nursing homes. The results 
      showed that geriatrician input into nursing homes had a significant impact on 
      admissions from nursing homes (χ(2)(2)=6.261, p < 0.05). The second part of the 
      project also showed significant impact on admissions (χ(2)(2) = 12.552, p < 0.05). 
      Furthermore, in both parts of the project the length of stay in hospital for the 
      residents was reduced. Geriatricians working together with co-ordinated 
      multidisciplinary teams are well placed to manage the care needs of frail, elderly 
      care home residents.

TI  - Classification of residents in nursing homes in Tuscany (Italy) using Resource 
      Utilization Groups Version III (RUG-III).
PG  - 133-40
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Samples of nursing homes in Tuscany (Italy) classify their 
      residents and determine their case-mix according to the Resource Utilization Groups 
      System, Version III (RUG-III). METHODS: A large sample of nursing homes was 
      selected, based on willingness to participate, representation of both public and 
      private institutions, and wide geographic representation. Two registered nurses 
      assessed all residents using the RUG questionnaire. The information collected was 
      then used to group residents into 44 RUGs, and facility-specific case-mix indices 
      were calculated using the RUG-specific weights previously validated in Italy. 
      RESULTS: A total of 3981 residents from 93 nursing homes were assessed. Most 
      residents were over 75 years old (87.4%) and women (68.6%). A large percentage was 
      classified into RUGs within the following primary categories: reduced physical 
      function (33.6%), impaired cognition (17.6%) and clinically complex (17.6%). The 
      resulting nursing home case-mix indices ranged from 0.627 to 1.108 (mean 
      0.807+/-0.110). No significant association was found between type of facility, level 
      of fees, or extent of staff in the nursing homes and their case-mix indices. 
      CONCLUSIONS: RUGIII can provide information on types of nursing home residents and 
      their care needs. This is useful for monitoring and evaluating long-term care 
      services for the elderly, and allows for more effective planning and allocation of 
      staffing and financial resources.

AB  - CONTEXT: Identifying high-value health care delivery for patients with clinically 
      complex and high-cost conditions is important for future reimbursement models. 
      OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the Medicare reimbursement 
      savings of an established palliative care homebound program. METHODS: This is a 
      retrospective cohort study involving 50 participants enrolled in a palliative care 
      homebound program and 95 propensity-matched control patients at Mayo Clinic in 
      Rochester, Minnesota, between September 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. Total Medicare 
      reimbursement was compared in the year before enrollment with the year after 
      enrollment for participants and controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were 
      observed in demographic characteristics or prognostic indices between the two 
      groups. Total Medicare reimbursement per program participant the year before program 
      enrollment was $16,429 compared with $14,427 per control patient, resulting in $2004 
      higher charges per program patient. In 12 months after program enrollment, mean 
      annual payment was $5783 per patient among participants and $22,031 per patient 
      among the matched controls. In the second year, the intervention group had a 
      decrease of $10,646 per patient; the control group had an increase of $7604 per 
      patient. The difference between the participant group and control group was 
      statistically significant (P < 0.001) and favored the palliative care homebound 
      program enrollees by $18,251 (95% CI, $11,268-$25,234). CONCLUSION: The Mayo Clinic 
      Palliative Care Homebound Program reduced annual Medicare expenditures by $18,251 
      per program participant compared with matched control patients. This supports the 
      role of home-based palliative medicine in delivering high-value care to high-risk 
      older adults.

TI  - Investigating the contribution of community nurses to anticipatory care: a 
      qualitative exploratory study.
PG  - 1558-67
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05589.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate how one aspect of anticipatory care is understood and delivered 
      in practice. 'Anticipatory care' in this context can be understood as proactive 
      care, which is oriented towards prevention of adverse events. BACKGROUND: Scotland 
      has identified the intention to move away from a preoccupation with acute care and 
      invest in health improvement and anticipatory care. Community nurses are the key, 
      yet little is known about how they understand and deliver anticipatory care. 
      METHODS: A qualitative case study design using individual in-depth interviews 
      (n=10), observation (n=9) and focus groups (n=5) was selected. Five focus group 
      interviews were carried out with district nurses, practice nurses and health 
      visitors. Subsequently, nine observation events took place, each focused on a single 
      nurse/client encounter. Data were collected during 2008 and 2009 in one Community 
      Health Partnership in Scotland. FINDINGS: Two approaches to anticipatory care 
      emerged; these were influenced by participants' roles and responsibilities. Approach 
      1 derives from Government policy agenda and is focused on protocol-focused 
      management of long-term illness. Approach 2 is synonymous with long-standing nursing 
      activity focused on holistic care of individual patients. Both approaches are 
      proactive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: There is scope to develop a more conceptually 
      complex model of anticipatory care, building on this initial exploration, within 
      which all aims, roles, practices and methods of evaluation can be located and 
      clearly visible. This offers the potential to enable practitioners to interpret and 
      apply policy--otherwise change may be limited and result in service gaps.

TI  - Feasibility of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac 
      surgery: a mixed-methods study.
PG  - 342-51
LID - 10.1177/1474515114535511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the growing number of vulnerable, older cardiac surgery patients, 
      the preadmission PREvention Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery patients (PREDOCS) 
      programme was developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. 
      Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be 
      evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with 
      the acceptability, compliance and delivery. AIM: The purpose of this study was to 
      test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings. 
      METHODS: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) 
      guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost 
      savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data 
      registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for 
      reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI). RESULTS: Twenty-one 
      females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and 
      provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the 
      PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were 
      satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative 
      complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. 
      Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both 
      patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the 
      patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative 
      complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should 
      be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.

TI  - Developing and piloting a multifactorial intervention to address participation and 
      quality of life in nursing home residents with joint contractures (JointConImprove): 
      study protocol.
PG  - Doc13
LID - 10.3205/000217 [doi]
LID - Doc13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Joint contractures are common problems in frail older people in nursing 
      homes. Irrespective of the exact extent of older individuals in geriatric care 
      settings living with joint contractures, they appear to be a relevant problem. Also, 
      the new emphasis on the syndrome of joint contractures, e. g. by the German 
      statutory long term care insurance, led to an increase in assessment and 
      documentation efforts and preventive interventions in clinical care. However, more 
      attention should be paid to the actual situation of older individuals in nursing 
      homes with prevalent joint contractures, particularly their experience of related 
      activity limitations and participation restrictions. Thus, the aim of this study is 
      1) to develop a tailored intervention to improve functioning, and especially 
      participation and quality of life in older residents with joint contractures in 
      nursing homes and 2) to test the feasibility of the intervention accompanied by a 
      rigorous process evaluation. METHODS: The complex intervention, which will be 
      developed in this project follows the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework 
      and integrates the perspectives of all potentially relevant user groups, from the 
      affected individuals to clinicians and researchers. The development process will 
      comprise a systematic literature review, reanalysis of existing data and the 
      integration of the knowledge of the affected individuals and experts. The developed 
      intervention including a comprehensive process evaluation will be pilot tested with 
      residents with joint contractures in three nursing homes. DISCUSSION: The projected 
      study will provide a tailored intervention to improve functioning, participation and 
      quality of life in older residents with joint contractures in nursing homes. With 
      this focus, the intervention will support patient relevant outcomes. The pilot study 
      including process evaluation will offer a first opportunity to indicate the size of 
      the intervention's effect and prepare further studies.

TI  - Clinical profile of acute confusion in the long-term care setting.
PG  - 145-58
AB  - Aspects of acute confusion (AC) including risk factors, behavior patterns, and 
      outcomes are not well documented in long-term care (LTC) residents. The purpose of 
      this prospective study was to describe the clinical profile of AC in LTC including 
      risk factors, behavior patterns, etiologies, and 3-month outcomes. Seventy-four 
      elderly LTC residents were assessed for AC, depression, and global cognitive 
      impairment. Risk factors associated with AC included hearing deficits, depression, 
      pulmonary disorders, and abnormal serum sodium or potassium levels. Behavior 
      patterns of acutely confused residents included hyperactive (n = 9, 31%), hypoactive 
      (n = 8, 28%), and mixed (n = 7, 24%). In the majority of the AC cases, the etiology 
      was multIfactorial infections and dehydration were the most common causes. Residents 
      with AC had very poor 3-month outcomes. Thirty-four percent (n = 10) of the 
      residents with AC died within 3 months of the evaluation. This study highlights the 
      complexity and serious nature of AC in this frail population.

TI  - Protocol for the PREHAB study-Pre-operative Rehabilitation for reduction of 
      Hospitalization After coronary Bypass and valvular surgery: a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - e007250
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-007250 [doi]

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterised by reductions in muscle 
      mass, strength, endurance and activity level. The frailty syndrome, prevalent in 
      25-50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, is associated with increased rates of 
      mortality and major morbidity as well as function decline postoperatively. This 
      trial will compare a preoperative, interdisciplinary exercise and health promotion 
      intervention to current standard of care (StanC) for elective coronary artery bypass 
      and valvular surgery patients for the purpose of determining if the intervention 
      improves 3-month and 12-month clinical outcomes among a population of frail patients 
      waiting for elective cardiac surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, 
      randomised, open end point, controlled trial using assessor blinding and 
      intent-to-treat analysis. Two-hundred and forty-four elective cardiac surgical 
      patients will be recruited and randomised to receive either StanC or StanC plus an 
      8-week exercise and education intervention at a certified medical fitness facility. 
      Patients will attend two weekly sessions and aerobic exercise will be prescribed at 
      40-60% of heart rate reserve. Data collection will occur at baseline, 1-2 weeks 
      preoperatively, and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcome of the 
      trial will be the proportion of patients requiring a hospital length of stay greater 
      than 7 days. POTENTIAL IMPACT OF STUDY: The healthcare team is faced with an 
      increasingly complex older adult patient population. As such, this trial aims to 
      provide novel evidence supporting a health intervention to ensure that frail, older 
      adult patients thrive after undergoing cardiac surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      Trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national 
      and international scientific meetings. The University of Manitoba Health Research 
      Ethics Board has approved the study protocol V.1.3, dated 11 August 2014 
      (H2014:208). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial has been registered on 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry and results database of privately and publicly funded 
      clinical studies (NCT02219815).

AB  - Drug treatment is often an essential part in treatment and prevention of diseases in 
      older people, but there is much concern about inappropriate medication use. This 
      paper aims to describe the complexity of medication safety issues and clinical 
      judgments when optimizing prescribing in older individuals. It uses the case of Mrs. 
      Hansen, an aged nursing home resident, to illustrate the facilitators and barriers 
      of this process. With decreasing life expectancy, medication use should shift from 
      cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment to increase the patient's 
      well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of (potentially) dangerous medications 
      were reduced, and non-pharmacological alternatives were considered. There were some 
      medicines added, as underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. 
      Deprescribing long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family 
      as "giving up hope". More clinical evidence and practical communication tools are 
      needed to guide deprescribing decisions, taking medical and patient-centered 
      priorities into account. Studies evaluating such interventions should select outcome 
      measures that are particularly relevant for frail old individuals.

AB  - In this article two algorithms are suggested for use by district nurses in the 
      management of constipation in dependent older people at home. Prescribing for this 
      group of patients requires a complex assessment of medical and social factors as 
      24-hour supervision is not always available and local health and social service 
      resources may impact on the level of care that is available in terms of the 
      provision of food and drink and the taking of medicines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care-based comprehensive care programs have the potential to 
      improve outcomes in frail older adults. We evaluated the impact of the Geriatric 
      Care Model (GCM) on the quality of life of community-dwelling frail older adults. 
      METHODS: A 24-month stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted 
      between May 2010 and March 2013 in 35 primary care practices in the Netherlands, and 
      included 1147 frail older adults. The intervention consisted of a geriatric in-home 
      assessment by a practice nurse, followed by a tailored care plan. Reassessment 
      occurred every six months. Nurses worked together with primary care physicians and 
      were supervised and trained by geriatric expert teams. Complex patients were 
      reviewed in multidisciplinary consultations. The primary outcome was quality of life 
      (SF-12). Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, functional 
      limitations, self-rated health, psychological wellbeing, social functioning and 
      hospitalizations. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses based on multilevel modeling 
      showed no significant differences between the intervention group and usual care 
      regarding SF-12 and most secondary outcomes. Only for IADL limitations we found a 
      small intervention effect in patients who received the intervention for 18months 
      (B=-0.25, 95%CI=-0.43 to -0.06, p=0.007), but this effect was not statistically 
      significant after correction for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION: The GCM did not 
      show beneficial effects on quality of life in frail older adults in primary care, 
      compared to usual care. This study strengthens the idea that comprehensive care 
      programs add very little to usual primary care for this population. TRIAL

      adults via enhanced self-management of medication: randomized clinical trial to test 
      efficacy.
PG  - 269-78
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0b013e318298aa55 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is 
      challenging for many older adults. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support 
      program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination 
      and technology. DESIGN: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three 
      arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. SETTING: Older adults having difficulty 
      in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three 
      Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. METHODS: All 
      participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no 
      further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses 
      coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either 
      an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the 
      Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance 
      Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were 
      measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS: After covariate and 
      baseline health status adjustment, time × group interactions for the MD.2 and 
      medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time × group 
      interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. 
      DISCUSSION: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health 
      status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 
      machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.

TI  - Older people's experiences of nurse-patient telephone communication in the primary 
      healthcare setting.
PG  - 373-382
LID - 10.1111/jan.13449 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine which aspects of primary nurse-patient telephone communication are 
      viewed positively or negatively in terms of meeting the older persons' needs. 
      BACKGROUND: Health professionals are increasingly being called on to develop 
      different ways of working and increase their capacity to meet the needs of an ageing 
      population. In some countries, telephone communication between primary nurses and 
      patients in General Practice is already seen as a routine practice, but determining 
      the value of this type of communication as a specific health service needs more 
      understanding. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study as the aim was to explore the 
      older person's experiences. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 
      21 older people from General Practices in New Zealand during 2014-2015. Thematic 
      analysis was informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: The 
      overarching theme was the difficulties older people face in making decisions about 
      whether to contact a health professional by telephone and whether this should be the 
      Primary nurse. Accounting for some of their symptoms as age related added to the 
      uncertainty of decision-making. Importantly, some older people were not raising 
      concerns e.g. emotional state. CONCLUSION: Decision-making by older people around 
      treatment seeking is complex. Increasing the awareness of the nurse role in the 
      General Practice is integral to creating a health system which will meet the needs 
      of a growing older population. Primary care practices can review their systems to 
      better inform older people how the nurse-telephone role as a specific health service 
      works and what they can expect when using this service.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize emergency department (ED) use by nursing home residents 
      in the United States. DESIGN: Analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical 
      Care Survey. SETTING: U.S. EDs from 2005 to 2008. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals visiting 
      U.S. EDs stratified according to nursing home residency. MEASUREMENTS: All ED visits 
      by nursing home residents were identified. The demographic and clinical 
      characteristics and ED resource utilization, length of stay, and outcomes of nursing 
      home residents and nonresidents were compared. RESULTS: During 2005 to 2008, nursing 
      home residents accounted for 9,104,735 of 475,077,828 U.S. ED visits (1.9%; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-2.1%). The annualized number of ED visits by nursing 
      home residents was 2,276,184. Most nursing home residents were older (mean age 76.7, 
      95% CI = 75.8-77.5), female (63.3%), and non-Hispanic white (74.8%). Nursing home 
      residents were more likely to have been discharged from the hospital in the prior 
      7 days (adjusted odds ratio (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9), to present with fever 
      (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5-2.4) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg, 
      aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5-2.2), and to receive diagnostic tests (OR = 1.9, 95% 
      CI = 1.6-2.2), imaging (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3-1.7), or procedures (OR = 1.6, 95% 
      CI = 1.4-1.7) in the ED. Almost half of nursing home residents visiting the ED were 
      admitted to the hospital. Nursing home residents were more likely to be admitted to 
      the hospital (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.6-2.0) and to die (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6-3.3). 
      CONCLUSION: Nursing home residents account for more than 2.2 million ED visits 
      annually in the United States. Nursing home residents have greater medical acuity 
      and complexity. These observations highlight the national challenges of organizing 
      and delivering ED care to nursing home residents in the United States.

TI  - Process evaluation of a trial evaluating a multidisciplinary nurse-led home visiting 
      programme for vulnerable older people.
PG  - 937-46
LID - 10.3109/09638280903381006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This article describes the content of and adherence with a nurse-led home 
      visiting programme (Dutch Geriatric Intervention Programme; DGIP) for vulnerable 
      older people. The randomised Dutch EASYcare Study showed positive patient endpoints 
      for DGIP. Describing content and adherence is rarely performed, but highly important 
      for understanding the results of trials. METHOD: DGIP is a complex multicomponent 
      intervention tailored to the patients' needs. This process evaluation describes 
      these components and patient characteristics and creates meaningful clusters of 
      these specific components using hierarchical cluster analysis. Both 
      patient/caregiver and physician adherence rates and possible predictors were 
      investigated. RESULTS: In line with the heterogeneity among the subjects, the 
      individual treatment plans turned out to be highly tailored. Cluster analysis 
      identified five clusters of intervention components. DGIP turned out to be largely 
      unsuitable for one group of very vulnerable older participants in urgent need of 
      more care. Overall, physician adherence was 75% and was better than patient 
      adherence (51% complete/partial adherence). Adherence levels increased when both 
      patients, caregivers and physicians received recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      content of a multicomponent tailored home-visiting programme was very diverse, 
      matching the heterogeneity among frail elderly subjects. Detailed process and 
      cluster analysis helped to understand the content of the intervention, sharpen 
      target criteria and identify possibilities to improve adherence.

TI  - Complexity in caring for an ageing heart failure population: concomitant chronic 
      conditions and age related impairments.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further 
      complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age 
      related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in 
      activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, 
      lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, 
      outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by 
      putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on 
      how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by 
      applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure 
      population.

AB  - Care coordination for the older adult is growing based on increases in aging 
      populations, fragmentation in healthcare systems, and the desire by many older 
      adults to remain in their homes. Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs) guide older adults 
      and families in navigating the complexities of the continuum of care and with 
      finding available resources for long-term care planning. This article reviews the 
      GCM role, which patients may be appropriate for the service, and patient benefits.

TI  - Can an EASYcare based dementia training programme improve diagnostic assessment and 
      management of dementia by general practitioners and primary care nurses? The design 
      of a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-8-71 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of dementia benefits both patient and caregiver. 
      Nevertheless, dementia in primary care is currently under-diagnosed. Some 
      educational interventions developed to improve dementia diagnosis and management 
      were successful in increasing the number of dementia diagnoses and in changing 
      attitudes and knowledge of health care staff. However, none of these interventions 
      focussed on collaboration between GPs and nurses in dementia care. We developed an 
      EASYcare-based Dementia Training Program (DTP) aimed at stimulating collaboration in 
      dementia primary care. We expect this program to increase the number of cognitive 
      assessments and dementia diagnoses and to improve attitudes and knowledge of GPs and 
      nurses. METHODS: The DTP is a complex educational intervention that consists of two 
      workshops, a coaching program, access to an internet forum, and a Computerized 
      Clinical Decision Support System on dementia diagnostics. One hundred duos of GPs 
      and nurses will be recruited, from which 2/3 will be allocated to the intervention 
      group and 1/3 to the control group. The effects of implementation of the DTP will be 
      studied in a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Primary outcomes will be the 
      number of cognitive assessments and dementia diagnoses in a period of 9 months 
      following workshop participation. Secondary outcomes are measured on GP and nurse 
      level: adherence to national guidelines for dementia, attitude, confidence and 
      knowledge regarding dementia diagnosis and management; on patient level: number of 
      emergency calls, visits and consultations and patient satisfaction; and on caregiver 
      level: informal caregiver burden and satisfaction. Data will be collected from GPs' 
      electronic medical records, self-registration forms and questionnaires. Statistical 
      analysis will be performed using the MANOVA-method. Also, exploratory analyses will 
      be performed, in order to gain insight into barriers and facilitators for 
      implementation and the possible causal relations between the rate of success of the 
      intervention components and the outcomes. DISCUSSION: We developed multifaceted 
      dementia training programme. Novelties in this programme are the training in fixed 
      collaborative duos and the inclusion of an individual coaching program. The 
      intervention is designed according to international guidelines and educational 
      standards. Exploratory analysis will reveal its successful elements. Selection bias 
      and contamination may be threats to the reliability of future results of this trial. 
      Nevertheless, the results of this trial may provide useful information for policy 
      makers and developers of continuing medical education. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Application of an electronic Frailty Index in Australian primary care: data quality 
      and feasibility assessment.
PG  - 653-660
LID - 10.1007/s40520-018-1023-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary care setting is the ideal location for identifying the 
      condition of frailty in older adults. AIMS: The aim of this pragmatic study was 
      twofold: (1) to identify data items to extract the data required for an electronic 
      Frailty Index (eFI) from electronic health records (EHRs); and (2) test the ability 
      of an eFI to accurately and feasibly identify frailty in older adults. METHODS: In a 
      rural South Australian primary care clinic, we derived an eFI from routinely 
      collected EHRs using methodology described by Clegg et al. We assessed feasibility 
      and accuracy of the eFI, including complexities in data extraction. The reference 
      standard for comparison was Fried's frailty phenotype. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of 
      participants was 80.2 (4.8) years, with 36 (60.0%) female (n = 60). Frailty 
      prevalence was 21.7% by Fried's frailty phenotype, and 35.0% by eFI (scores > 0.21). 
      When deriving the eFI, 85% of EHRs were perceived as easy or neutral difficulty to 
      extract the required data from. Complexities in data extraction were present in EHRs 
      of patients with multiple health problems and/or where the majority of data items 
      were located other than on the patient's summary problem list. DISCUSSION: This 
      study demonstrated that it is entirely feasible to extract an eFI from routinely 
      collected Australian primary care data. We have outlined a process for extracting an 
      eFI from EHRs without needing to modify existing infrastructure. Results from this 
      study can inform the development of automated eFIs, including which data items to 
      best access data from.

TI  - Early detection of health problems in potentially frail community-dwelling older 
      people by general practices--project [G]OLD: design of a longitudinal, 
      quasi-experimental study.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/1471-2318-13-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the ageing of the population, the number of frail older people 
      who suffer from multiple, complex health complaints increases and this ultimately 
      threatens their ability to function independently. Many interventions for frail 
      older people attempt to prevent or delay functional decline, but they show 
      contradicting results. Recent studies emphasise the importance of embedding these 
      interventions into existing primary care systems and tailoring care to older 
      people's needs and wishes. This article presents the design of an evaluation study, 
      aiming to investigate the effects and feasibility of the early detection of health 
      problems among community-dwelling older people and their subsequent referral to 
      appropriate care and/or well-being facilities by general practices. METHODS/DESIGN: 
      A longitudinal, quasi-experimental study is designed comparing 13 intervention 
      practices with 11 control practices. General practices select eligible 
      community-dwelling older people (≥ 75 years). Practice nurses from intervention 
      practices (1) visit older people at home for a comprehensive assessment of their 
      health and well-being; (2) discuss results with the GP; (3) formulate - if required 
      - a care and treatment plan together with the patient; (4) refer patient to care 
      and/or well-being facilities; and (5) monitor and coordinate care and follow-up. 
      Control practices provide usual care and match the intervention practices on the 
      presence of different primary care professionals within the practice. Primary 
      outcome measures are health-related quality of life and disability. Additionally, 
      attitude towards ageing, care satisfaction, health care utilisation, nursing home 
      admission and mortality are measured. Some outcomes are assessed by means of a 
      postal questionnaire (at baseline and after 6, 12, and 18 months follow-up), others 
      through continuous registration over the 18-month period. A profound process 
      evaluation will provide insight into barriers and facilitators for implementing the 
      intervention protocol within general practices from both the patient and caregiver 
      perspective. DISCUSSION: The proposed approach requires redesigning care delivery 
      within general practices for accomplishing appropriate care for older people. A 
      quasi-experimental design is chosen to closely resemble a real-life situation, which 
      is desirable for future implementation after this innovation proves to be 
      successful. Results of the effect and process evaluation will become available in 
      2013. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Netherlands National Trial Register NTR2737.

TI  - Expert knowledge elicitation using computer simulation: the organization of frail 
      elderly case management as an illustration.
PG  - 534-43
LID - 10.1111/jep.12101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various elderly case management projects have been implemented in 
      Belgium. This type of long-term health care intervention involves contextual factors 
      and human interactions. These underlying complex mechanisms can be usefully informed 
      with field experts' knowledge, which are hard to make explicit. However, computer 
      simulation has been suggested as one possible method of overcoming the difficulty of 
      articulating such elicited qualitative views. METHODS: A simulation model of case 
      management was designed using an agent-based methodology, based on the initial 
      qualitative research material. Variables and rules of interaction were formulated 
      into a simple conceptual framework. This model has been implemented and was used as 
      a support for a structured discussion with experts in case management. RESULTS: The 
      rigorous formulation provided by the agent-based methodology clarified the 
      descriptions of the interventions and the problems encountered regarding: the 
      diverse network topologies of health care actors in the project; the adaptation time 
      required by the intervention; the communication between the health care actors; the 
      institutional context; the organization of the care; and the role of the case 
      manager and his or hers personal ability to interpret the informal demands of the 
      frail older person. CONCLUSION: The simulation model should be seen primarily as a 
      tool for thinking and learning. A number of insights were gained as part of a 
      valuable cognitive process. Computer simulation supporting field experts' 
      elicitation can lead to better-informed decisions in the organization of complex 
      health care interventions.

TI  - Treatment of older people in emergency departments.
PG  - 18-9
AB  - The UK has an ageing population, which means that more and more older people with 
      complex social and healthcare problems will present to emergency departments (EDs). 
      This article explains why ED staff must have appropriate training and education in 
      all aspects of caring for frail older people, including the use of appropriate and 
      specific assessment tools. The authors also refer to a soon-to-be-published 
      guideline for the care of frail older people with emergency care needs.

TI  - The complexities of documenting clinical information in long-term care settings in 
      Australia.
PG  - 8-12
AB  - Clinical nursing documentation, written, verbal or supported by technology, is being 
      affected by both the worldwide "information explosion" and budgetary constraints. In 
      Australia, the necessity of documenting complex care needs and treatment plans in 
      older adult care settings has become more imperative because funding levels and 
      sources are frequently tied to these documents. As a consequence, the statutory 
      requirements for documentation have become a significant driving force in shaping 
      nursing practice. Although the value of quality documentation is or should be 
      recognized, the seemingly vast amounts of time required inevitably distracts nurses 
      from what they see as their primary purpose-the provision of direct patient care. 
      Older adults who are frail are among the most complex clients requiring services in 
      what is traditionally a poorly resourced sector. Under-funding frequently impacts on 
      the staff skill mix, resulting in low levels of senior, highly qualified, and 
      skilled staff. These factors impact the quality of the documentation and possibly 
      the usage of the information itself. This article will provide an overview of the 
      issues related to documentation of clinical information in older adult care settings 
      with particular reference to some of the "unique" inefficiencies inherent in the 
      Australian system.

TI  - Reliability of the interRAI Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF) and interRAI Home Care 
      (HC).
PG  - 220-8
LID - 10.1111/ggi.12330 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Sharing clinical information across care settings is a cornerstone to providing 
      quality care to older people with complex conditions. The purpose of the present 
      study was to examine the reliability of the interRAI Long Term Care Facilities 
      (interRAI LTCF) and the interRAI Home Care (interRAI HC), comprehensive and 
      integrated assessment instruments with common core items, in Korea, an Asian county 
      where comprehensive geriatric assessment is not widely used in long-term care. 
      METHODS: The Korean version of the instruments was developed through field tests, as 
      well as multiple iterations of translations, back-translations and expert reviews. 
      For the reliability test, a random sample of 908 older people in 27 long-term care 
      hospitals or nursing homes, or at home with home care, were assessed by regular 
      staff, among which a subsample of 534 people were dually assessed. The Cronbach's 
      alphas of seven major composite scales in the instruments were examined for internal 
      consistency. Interrater reliability was tested using agreement, kappa coefficients 
      and interclass correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The internal consistencies of all 
      key measures were adequate (Cronbach's alpha≥0.75). The overall mean kappa 
      statistics of the items in the interRAI LTCF and those in the interRAI HC were 0.78 
      and 0.89, respectively. All key common items in the interRAI LTCF and the interRAI 
      HC had almost perfect (κ≥0.81) or substantial (0.61≤κ≤0.80) interrater reliability. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings show the interRAI LTCF and the interRAI HC have adequate 
      reliability for assessing the function and health of frail older adults across 
      various long-term settings, which can promote continuity of care for the aged.

TI  - When the patient cannot come to the doctor: a medical housecalls program.
PG  - 226-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe a medical housecalls program and to assess its ability to 
      meet the medical needs of homebound patients. PROGRAM STRUCTURE: The housecalls 
      program is part of a larger ambulatory practice situated in a senior center staffed 
      by geriatricians and nurse practitioners. The practice serves as the major teaching 
      site of outpatient geriatrics for a medical residency program. Scheduled visits are 
      made every 3 to 4 months, and unscheduled visits are made weekday days for acute 
      problems. PARTICIPANTS: Patients are eligible for the housecalls program if they 
      live within a 15- minute drive of the center and are unable to leave their home. 
      PROGRAM EVALUATION: The majority of the 71 patients in the housecalls program 
      between 1993 and 1995 were female (81%), aged 85 years or older (52%), and dependent 
      in one or more activities of daily living: 65% were dependent in bathing and 42% in 
      dressing. A substantial minority (16%) had severe cognitive impairment. Patients 
      received a mean of 5.0 visits per patient-year. The majority of patients (59%) were 
      treated at home for an acute illness or symptom ranging from upper respiratory tract 
      infections to pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Approximately one-quarter of 
      the patients or their proxies elected to avoid hospitalization; several of these 
      patients had complex illnesses managed in their homes. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of 
      medical problems can be addressed in patients' homes. Because our patients could not 
      leave their homes easily, or at all, it is probable they would not have received 
      routine medical care and would have used the emergency room for evaluation of acute 
      problems if the housecalls program were not available. Despite their potential value 
      in the care of frail older patients, housecalls will likely not become a widespread 
      practice until barriers to their performance cited by physicians are addressed.

TI  - The effect of dementia on acute care in a geriatric medical unit.
PG  - 231-9
AB  - Treatment of dementia costs billions of dollars in long-term care and community 
      services every year. Dementia also burdens the acute care system and may contribute 
      to financial problems for hospitals serving large numbers of demented elderly. In a 
      specialized geriatric medical unit devoted to acute care of the frail elderly, 
      Alzheimer's disease and vascular and mixed dementias afflicted 63% of inpatients and 
      were associated with excess consumption of nursing resources, complications of 
      treatment, nosocomial infections, lengthy hospitalizations, and financial losses to 
      the hospital. Due in part to the effects of dementia on mobility, continence, and 
      nutrition, demented patients suffered more frequently from life-threatening 
      infections, sepsis, iatrogenic disease, and prolonged hospital stays. Hospital 
      losses were 75% higher for demented patients than for nondemented patients. Dementia 
      affected the majority of acute care patients in this study. However, it was rarely 
      coded as an admitting diagnosis, even though it may have been the proximate cause of 
      the medical morbidity which led to the acute hospitalization. In addition, despite 
      the significant impact of dementia on the hospital course and costs, it was a factor 
      in hospital reimbursement in less than one third of cases. The results indicate that 
      dementia was not considered to be an acute diagnosis, nor was it recognized as a 
      complex medical illness. The impact of dementia on acute hospitalization, including 
      the mechanisms by which dementia prolongs the hospital stay, requires further 
      investigation.

TI  - Patterns and health effects of caring for people with dementia: the impact of 
      changing cognitive and residential status.
PG  - 643-52
AB  - PURPOSE: To link changes over 5 years in the health, vital and residential status of 
      very elderly people to changes in their family caregivers' health. DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: Canadian population-based, longitudinal study including community and 
      institutional residents. From interviews and clinical examinations, 948 people (mean 
      age = 86 years) were classified as demented, frail, or healthy at two points in 
      time. Caregivers reported on the care they provided and their health outcomes. 
      RESULTS: Diagnostic and residential groups of care recipients differed significantly 
      in their level of activity of daily living/instrumental activity of daily living 
      disability (range = 0.2 problems for the healthy group, 10-12 in the dementia 
      groups) and in the amount of assistance received; caregiver burden scores were 
      higher for people with dementia in the community than for those in institutions (p 
      <.001). However, these differences did not translate directly into contrasts in 
      caregiver health. Caregivers of healthy elders reported fewer health problems than 
      did caregivers for people with dementia or frailty, but the latter groups did not 
      differ significantly. Death of the care recipient and admission to institutional 
      care did not have a consistent impact on caregiver health. IMPLICATIONS: The 
      relationship between caregiver load and health outcomes is complex and dynamic; 
      treatments that slow the progression of dementia will not necessarily relieve 
      caregiver strain.

TI  - Development of a proactive care program (U-CARE) to preserve physical functioning of 
      frail older people in primary care.
PG  - 230-7
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12023 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, 
      and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program 
      (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of 
      life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process 
      of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. METHODS: The framework of the 
      Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex 
      interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. 
      An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of 
      researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an 
      independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to 
      increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature 
      and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert 
      opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. FINDINGS: Based on 
      predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises 
      three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home 
      followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based 
      care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical 
      practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development 
      process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in 
      reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the 
      general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE 
      intervention is feasible in clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCES: The U-CARE 
      program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care 
      of older patients.

TI  - Nursing home residents attending the emergency department: clinical characteristics 
      and outcomes.
PG  - 803-8
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hct136 [doi]
AB  - Nursing home (NH) residents represent the frailest group of older people, and 
      providing gerontologically attuned care that addresses these frailties is often a 
      challenge within the emergency department (ED). This study sought to prospectively 
      profile acutely unwell NH residents in order to clarify some of the challenges of 
      providing emergency care to this group. Over an 18-week period, we prospectively 
      reviewed all NH residents presenting to the ED of an urban university teaching 
      hospital. Relevant data were retrieved by direct physician review (as part of a 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment in the ED), collateral history from NH staff and 
      primary carers, and review of electronic records. There were 155 ED visits by 116 NH 
      residents. Their mean age was 80.3 (±9.6) years. High pre-morbid levels of 
      dependency were reflected by a mean Barthel Index of 34.1 (±20) and almost 
      two-thirds had a pre-existing diagnosis of dementia. One-third of visits were during 
      'normal' working hours. Patients were reviewed by their regular NH doctor 
      pre-transfer for 36% of visits. Using accepted international criteria, over half of 
      the visits were deemed 'potentially preventable'. Unwell NH residents have complex 
      medical needs. The decision to refer these patients to the ED is often made by 'out 
      of hours' general practitioners and their initial care in the ED is directed by 
      physicians with limited experience in geriatric medicine. Most referrals to the ED 
      are potentially preventable but this would require enhancements to the package of 
      care available in NHs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate the quality of care provided in special 
      needs plans (SNPs; Medicare Advantage plans that aim to provide specialized care for 
      complex older adults) and specifically the nurse care management model in the 
      community setting. DESIGN: We adapted 107 process-of-care quality measures across 12 
      conditions from the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders set to obtain a clinically 
      detailed evaluation of the quality of care received by complex older enrollees in a 
      dual eligible Evercare SNP. We abstracted 13 months of primary care medical records 
      to delineate quality of care provided by physicians and whether there was value 
      added from the nurse care manager model. SETTING: Dual eligible Evercare SNP located 
      in central Florida. PARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred thirty-one vulnerable older enrollees 
      in the SNP who had complex disease. RESULTS: Based on physician medical records 
      alone, the 231 high-risk participants (mean age 77, 67% women) received recommended 
      care for 53% of 5,569 evaluated clinical circumstances, ranging from 12% for 
      end-of-life care to 78% for diabetes mellitus. In fewer than 40% of these clinical 
      circumstances was recommended care provided for dementia, falls, and urinary 
      incontinence. In a second analysis accounting for care provided by both the Evercare 
      nurse and the physician, recommended care was provided to patients in 69% of the 
      5,684 evaluated clinical circumstances. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive quality 
      measurement applied to vulnerable older adults enrolled in one mature SNP showed 
      that the Evercare nurse model addresses important deficits in physician care for 
      geriatric conditions. Such measurement should be applied to other SNP models and to 
      compare SNP care with that for complex, older, fee-for-service Medicare cohorts.

TI  - Implementing the chronic care model for frail older adults in the Netherlands: study 
      protocol of ACT (frail older adults: care in transition).
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/1471-2318-12-19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Care for older adults is facing a number of challenges: health problems 
      are not consistently identified at a timely stage, older adults report a lack of 
      autonomy in their care process, and care systems are often confronted with the need 
      for better coordination between health care professionals. We aim to address these 
      challenges by introducing the geriatric care model, based on the chronic care model, 
      and to evaluate its effects on the quality of life of community-dwelling frail older 
      adults. METHODS/DESIGN: In a 2-year stepped-wedge cluster randomised clinical trial 
      with 6-monthly measurements, the chronic care model will be compared with usual 
      care. The trial will be carried out among 35 primary care practices in two regions 
      in the Netherlands. Per region, practices will be randomly allocated to four 
      allocation arms designating the starting point of the intervention. PARTICIPANTS: 
      1200 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 or over and their primary informal 
      caregivers. Primary care physicians will identify frail individuals based on a 
      composite definition of frailty and a polypharmacy criterion. Final inclusion 
      criterion: scoring 3 or more on a disability case-finding tool. INTERVENTION: Every 
      6 months patients will receive a geriatric in-home assessment by a practice nurse, 
      followed by a tailored care plan. Expert teams will manage and train practice 
      nurses. Patients with complex care needs will be reviewed in interdisciplinary 
      consultations. EVALUATION: We will perform an effect evaluation, an economic 
      evaluation, and a process evaluation. Primary outcome is quality of life as measured 
      with the Short Form-12 questionnaire. Effect analyses will be based on the 
      "intention-to-treat" principle, using multilevel regression analysis. Cost 
      measurements will be administered continually during the study period. A 
      cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis will be conducted comparing 
      mean total costs to functional status, care needs and QALYs. We will investigate the 
      level of implementation, barriers and facilitators to successful implementation and 
      the extent to which the intervention manages to achieve the transition necessary to 
      overcome challenges in elderly care. DISCUSSION: This is one of the first studies 
      assessing the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and implementation process of the 
      chronic care model for frail community-dwelling older adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

      function of frail older people. Collaborative Assessment and Rehabilitation for 
      Elders.
PG  - 1155-60
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frail older adults are especially vulnerable in a health 
      system that is fragmented and fails to focus on preservation or restoration of 
      function. The School of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, together with the 
      School of Medicine and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, established 
      the Collaborative Assessment and Rehabilitation for Elders (CARE) Program to meet 
      the needs of this population. We used the British Day Hospital as a model because it 
      provides a comprehensive approach to care and a bridge between acute, home-based, 
      and institutional long-term care. We have designed our program to provide 
      innovative, interdisciplinary care as well as to be reimbursable under current and 
      future payment structures. This nurse-managed, collaborative practice seeks to 
      maximize independent functioning, promote health, and enhance quality of life for 
      chronically ill, frail older adults living in the community whose needs are left 
      unmet by existing services. The program was certified as a Comprehensive Outpatient 
      Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) in December 1993 to maximize reimbursement of 
      services through Medicare and other third party payers. With a Gerontological Nurse 
      Practitioner as care manager, clients receive an intensive, individualized, 
      time-limited program of nursing, rehabilitation, mental health, social, and medical 
      services in one setting several days each week. Additional geriatric services, such 
      as primary care, are available in the same location when needed. SETTING: The 
      program is housed in renovated space devoted to the care of older people. The 
      academic and clinical offices of the University of Pennsylvania's nursing and 
      medical gerontologic and geriatric faculty are in the same building. PARTICIPANTS: 
      We have targeted those persons older than age 65 who have complex health problems 
      and are living at home. Individuals must need multiple services, including at least 
      one rehabilitation therapy, and they must be unsuitable-for inpatient 
      rehabilitation. DESCRIPTION OF THE POPULATION: In its first 8 months of operation, 
      the program received 97 referrals and admitted 53 clients. Clients were, on average, 
      78 years of age. Over three-fourths (77%) were women and 58% were black. The average 
      stay in the program was 6 weeks. FIM scores, which improved a mean of 2.4 points, 
      were found to lack sensitivity to the functional improvements achieved by clients. 
      CONCLUSION: Under existing Medicare and third party reimbursement policies, it is 
      feasible to establish a nurse-managed comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation 
      program designed to meet the needs of frail older persons. Preliminary data support 
      the beneficial effects of the program as well as the economic feasibility of this 
      approach.

AB  - Overall, critical care nursing and medical teams are inadequately prepared to 
      deliver palliative care for the critically ill geriatric patient. Conversations with 
      nursing and medical providers caring for the frail elderly within an intensive care 
      unit often reveal feelings of concern for overtreatment of patients when hope for 
      improvement has diminished. Decline of critically ill elders regularly results in 
      conflicts and disagreements surrounding care directives among patient, family, 
      nursing, and specialty service teams. Uncertainty shrouds the care goals as the 
      patient declines within a critical care setting. Nursing and medical providers 
      caring for the critically ill elderly population often waver anxiously between 
      aggressive verses palliative care measures and are troubled by ethical dilemmas of 
      "doing more harm than good." Collaborative, interdisciplinary practice in the face 
      of such dilemmas offers an interactive and practical approach that promotes clinical 
      excellence and improves quality of care for the critically ill. This article defines 
      palliative care, discusses the complexities of caring for the critically ill older 
      adult, and suggests recommendations for nursing practice.

TI  - Complexity theory: a long-term care specialty practice exemplar for the education of 
      advanced practice nurses.
PG  - 84-7
AB  - This clinical exemplar highlights how an academic clinical practice supported 
      gerontological nursing students as they learned evidence-based approaches to 
      managing complex geriatric syndromes in long-term care. Urinary incontinence (UI), 
      which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the 
      faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included 
      advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal 
      of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach 
      evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the 
      practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, 
      reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes 
      included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex 
      geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design 
      and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility 
      outcomes.

TI  - Prevalence, clinical correlates, and treatment of hypertension in elderly nursing 
      home residents. SAGE (Systematic Assessment of Geriatric Drug Use via Epidemiology) 
      Study Group.
PG  - 2377-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is prevalent in the elderly, but an information gap remains 
      regarding the old, frail, individuals with complex conditions living in long-term 
      care. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the patterns of antihypertensive drug therapy among 
      elderly patients living in nursing homes to elucidate their conformity with 
      consensus guidelines. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We used a long-term care database that 
      merged sociodemographic, functional, clinical, and treatment information on nearly 
      300000 patients admitted to the facilities of 5 US states between 1992 and 1994. 
      RESULTS: Hypertension was diagnosed in 80206 patients (mean age, 82.7+/-7.8 years). 
      The prevalence was higher among women and among blacks. About one fourth of patients 
      had 6 or more comorbid conditions; 26%, 22%, and 29% had concomitant diagnoses of 
      coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease, 
      respectively. Seventy percent of patients were treated pharmacologically. Calcium 
      channel blockers were the most common agents (26%), followed by diuretics (25%), 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (22%), and beta-blockers (8%). The relative 
      use of these drugs changed according to the presence of other cardiovascular 
      conditions. Adjusting for potential confounders, the relative odds of receiving 
      antihypertensive therapy were significantly decreased for the oldest subjects (> or 
      =85 years old: odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.89) and those with 
      marked impairment of physical (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.81) 
      and cognitive (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.70) function. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among very old, frail hypertensive patients living in nursing homes, 
      the pattern of treatment seems not to follow recommended guidelines; age, functional 
      status, and comorbidity appear to be important determinants of treatment choice.

      lovely woman. I enjoy caring for her".

LID - 10.1001/jama.2011.1420 [doi]
AB  - More than 1.5 million adults live in US nursing homes, and approximately 30% of 
      individuals in the United States will die with a nursing home as their last place of 
      residence. Physicians play a pivotal role in the rehabilitation, complex medical 
      care, and end-of-life care of this frail and vulnerable population. The reasons for 
      admission are multifactorial and a comprehensive care plan based on the Minimum Data 
      Set guides the multidisciplinary nursing home team in the care of the patient and 
      provides assessments of the quality of care provided. Using the cases of 2 patients 
      with different experiences, we describe the physician's role in planning for 
      admission, participating as a team member in the ongoing assessment and care in the 
      nursing home, and guiding care at the end of life. The increasing population of 
      older adults has also promoted community-based and residential alternatives to 
      traditional nursing homes. The future of long-term care will include additional 
      challenges and rich innovations in services and options for older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementation fidelity, the degree to which a care program is 
      implemented as intended, can influence program impact. Since results of trials that 
      aim to implement comprehensive care programs for frail, older people have been 
      conflicting, assessing implementation fidelity alongside these trials is essential 
      to differentiate between flaws inherent to the program and implementation issues. 
      This study demonstrates how a theory-based assessment of fidelity can increase 
      insight in the implementation process of a complex intervention in primary elderly 
      care. METHODS: The Geriatric Care Model was implemented among 35 primary care 
      practices in the Netherlands. During home visits, practice nurses conducted a 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment and wrote a tailored care plan. Multidisciplinary 
      team consultations were organized with the aim to enhance the coordination between 
      professionals caring for a single patient with complex needs. To assess fidelity, we 
      identified 5 key intervention components and formulated corresponding research 
      questions using Carroll's framework for fidelity. Adherence (coverage, frequency, 
      duration, content) was assessed per intervention component during and at the end of 
      the intervention period. Two moderating factors (participant responsiveness and 
      facilitation strategies) were assessed at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: 
      Adherence to the geriatric assessments and care plans was high, but decreased over 
      time. Adherence to multidisciplinary consultations was initially poor, but increased 
      over time. We found that individual differences in adherence between practice nurses 
      and primary care physicians were moderate, while differences in participant 
      responsiveness (satisfaction, involvement) were more distinct. Nurses deviated from 
      protocol due to contextual factors and personal work routines. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Adherence to the Geriatric Care Model was high for most of the essential 
      intervention components. Study limitations include the limited number of assessed 
      moderating factors. We argue that a longitudinal investigation of adherence per 
      intervention component is essential for a complete understanding of the 
      implementation process, but that such investigations may be complicated by practical 
      and methodological challenges. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Netherlands National Trial

      validity for clinical utilization, and sensitivity to change of this measure. 
      DESIGN: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study among elderly people with 
      primarily physical or medical impairments who were residing in LTC institutions that 
      provide nursing home and more-complex care, with access to physical therapy 
      services. METHOD: The CCAM, the Clinical Outcome Variables Scale (COVS), the Social 
      Engagement Scale (SES) of the Resident Assessment Instrument-Minimum Data Set 
      (RAI-MDS) 2.0 instrument, and the Resource Utilization Groups, version 3, (RUG-III) 
      were administered by clinical and research physical therapists, with timing dictated 
      by the study purpose. RESULTS: The participants were 136 residents of LTC 
      institutions and 21 physical therapists. The CCAM interrater reliability (intraclass 
      correlation coefficient [ICC]) was .97 (95% confidence interval=.91-1.00), and 
      test-retest reliability (ICC) over a period of 1 week was .99 (95% confidence 
      interval=.93-1.00). Over 6 months, the absolute change in total score was 5.88 for 
      the CCAM and 4.26 for the COVS; the CCAM was 28% more responsive across all 
      participants (n=105) and 68% more responsive for those scoring in the lower half 
      (n=49). The minimal detectable difference of the CCAM was 8.6 across all 
      participants. The CCAM correlated with the COVS, nursing care hours inferred from 
      the RUG-III, and the SES. LIMITATIONS: Some participants were lost to follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The CCAM is a reliable and valid tool to measure gross motor function 
      and physical mobility for elderly people in LTC institutions. It discriminates among 
      functional levels, measures individual functional change, and can contribute to 
      clinical decision making.

TI  - A system-wide analysis using a senior-friendly hospital framework identifies current 
      practices and opportunities for improvement in the care of hospitalized older 
      adults.
PG  - 2163-70
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13097 [doi]
AB  - Older adults are vulnerable to hospital-associated complications such as falls, 
      pressure ulcers, functional decline, and delirium, which can contribute to prolonged 
      hospital stay, readmission, and nursing home placement. These vulnerabilities are 
      exacerbated when the hospital's practices, services, and physical environment are 
      not sufficiently mindful of the complex, multidimensional needs of frail 
      individuals. Several frameworks have emerged to help hospitals examine how 
      organization-wide processes can be customized to avoid these complications. This 
      article describes the application of one such framework-the Senior-Friendly Hospital 
      (SFH) framework adopted in Ontario, Canada-which comprises five interrelated 
      domains: organizational support, processes of care, emotional and behavioral 
      environment, ethics in clinical care and research, and physical environment. This 
      framework provided the blueprint for a self-assessment of all 155 adult hospitals 
      across the province of Ontario. The system-wide analysis identified practice gaps 
      and promising practices within each domain of the SFH framework. Taken together, 
      these results informed 12 recommendations to support hospitals at all stages of 
      development in becoming friendly to older adults. Priorities for system-wide action 
      were identified, encouraging hospitals to implement or further develop their 
      processes to better address hospital-acquired delirium and functional decline. These 
      recommendations led to collaborative action across the province, including the 
      development of an online toolkit and the identification of accountability indicators 
      to support hospitals in quality improvement focusing on senior-friendly care.

      people.
PG  - 96-100
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a scale predicting mortality and other adverse outcomes 
      associated with frailty. DESIGN: Observational study based on Minimum Data Set (MDS) 
      2.0 and mortality data. SETTING: Ontario chronic hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All 
      chronic hospital patients (N = 28,495) assessed with the MDS 2.0 after mandatory 
      implementation in July 1996 followed until May 1999. MEASUREMENTS: MDS 2.0 
      assessments done as part of normal practice mainly by registered nurses or 
      multidisciplinary teams in a chronic hospital. Mortality data are available from the 
      accompanying discharge tracking form. RESULTS: The MDS-Changes in Health, End-stage 
      disease and Symptoms and Signs (CHESS) score is a composite measure addressing 
      changes in health, end-stage disease, and symptoms and signs of medical problems. It 
      is a strong predictor of mortality (P <.0001) independent of the effects of age, 
      sex, activities of daily living impairment, cognition, and do-not-resuscitate 
      orders. It is also strongly associated with physician activity, complex medical 
      procedures, and pain (P <.001 for each dependent variable). CONCLUSIONS: The CHESS 
      score provides a useful new MDS-based test to predict mortality and to measure 
      instability in health as a clinical outcome.

TI  - Residents' autonomy: nursing home personnel's perceptions.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - While delivering quality care, nursing home personnel may unintentionally adversely 
      affect residents' sense of personal autonomy. Faced with the challenge of respecting 
      resident autonomy and simultaneously adhering to nursing home standards, nursing 
      home staff often experience a frustrating ethical conflict. This study examines the 
      effects of sets of independent variables on six autonomy dimensions to examine 
      nursing home personnel's perceptions of how care was provided in their facility. For 
      each of six case studies, respondents were asked the following question: "If Mr. or 
      Mrs. X were at your facility, what would have been decided?" Responses were recorded 
      along a continuum that indicated whether the resident would be allowed to make his 
      or her own decisions or whether the nursing home staff would decide for the 
      resident. Findings indicated staff members' education and race had the greatest 
      effect on their perceptions of personal autonomy. Somewhat surprisingly, staffing 
      levels, turnover rates, and restraint usage did not affect their views of autonomy. 
      Additional research is recommended to more completely examine the complex dimensions 
      of autonomy and to identify what changes nursing home staff and administrators could 
      implement to improve residents' quality of life.

TI  - Circles of care: home care and community support for rural older adults.
PG  - 22-33
AB  - Rural dwelling, frail older adults are a vulnerable population owing to the 
      complexity of health problems superimposed upon limited health care resources. Home 
      care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued 
      independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail 
      older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A 
      major theme identified was "Circles of Care." Grounded in rural culture, the circles 
      assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, 
      maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.

TI  - How to help depressed older people living in residential care: a multifaceted 
      shared-care intervention for late-life depression.
PG  - 477-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a population-based, multifaceted shared-care intervention for 
      late-life depression in residential care as a new model of geriatric practice, to 
      outline its development and implementation, and to describe the lessons learned 
      during the implementation process. SETTING: A large continuing-care retirement 
      community in Sydney, Australia, providing three levels of care (independent living 
      units, assisted-living complexes, and nursing homes). PARTICIPANTS: The intervention 
      was implemented for the entire non-nursing home population (residents in independent 
      and assisted living: N = 1,466) of the facility and their health care providers. Of 
      the 1,036 residents whowere eligible and agreed to be interviewed, 281 (27.1%) were 
      classified as depressed according to the Geriatric Depression Scale. INTERVENTION 
      DESCRIPTION: The intervention included: (a) multidisciplinary collaboration between 
      primary care physicians, facility health care providers, and the local 
      psychogeriatric service; (b) training for primary care physicians and other facility 
      health care providers about detecting and managing depression; and (c) 
      depression-related health education/promotion programs for residents. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The intervention was widely accepted by residents and their health care providers, 
      and was sustained and enhanced by the facility after the completion of the study. It 
      is possible to implement and sustain a multifaceted shared-care intervention for 
      late-life depression in a residential care facility where local psychogeriatric 
      services are scarce, staff-to-resident ratios are low, and the needs of depressed 
      residents are substantial.

TI  - Peer review of the quality of care. Reliability and sources of variability for 
      outcome and process assessments.
PG  - 1573-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Peer assessments have traditionally been used to judge the quality of care, 
      but a major drawback has been poor interrater reliability. OBJECTIVES: To compare 
      the interrater reliability for outcome and process assessments in a population of 
      frail older adults and to identify systematic sources of variability that contribute 
      to poor reliability. SETTING: Eight sites participating in a managed care program 
      that integrates acute and long-term care for frail older adults. PATIENTS: A total 
      of 313 frail older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective review of the medical record with 
      180 charts randomly assigned to 2 geriatricians, 2 geriatric nurse practitioners, or 
      1 geriatrician and 1 geriatric nurse practitioner and 133 charts randomly assigned 
      to either a geriatrician or a geriatric nurse practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Interrater reliabilities for structured implicit judgments about process and 
      outcomes for overall care and care for each of 8 tracer conditions (eg, arthritis). 
      RESULTS: Outcome measures had higher interrater reliability than process measures. 
      Five outcome measures achieved fair to good reliability (more than 0.40), while none 
      of the process measures achieved reliabilities more than 0.40. Three factors 
      contributed to poorer reliabilities for process measures: (1) an inability of 
      reviewers to differentiate among cases with respect to the quality of management, 
      (2) systematic bias from individual reviewers, and (3) systematic bias related to 
      the professional training of the reviewer (ie, physician or nurse practitioner). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Peer assessments can play an important role in characterizing the 
      quality of care for complex patients with multiple interrelated chronic conditions, 
      but reliability can be poor. Strategies to achieve adequate reliability for these 
      assessments should be applied. These strategies include emphasizing outcomes 
      measurement, providing more structured assessments to identify true differences in 
      patient management, adjusting systematic bias resulting from the individual reviewer 
      and their professional background, and averaging scores from multiple reviewers. 
      Future research on the reliability of peer assessments should focus on improving the 
      ability of process measures to differentiate among cases with respect to the quality 
      of management and on identifying additional sources of systematic bias for both 
      process and outcome measures. Explicit recognition of factors influencing 
      reliability will strengthen efforts to develop sound measures for quality assurance.

TI  - A critique of research measures used to assess inappropriate psychoactive drug use 
      in older adults.
PG  - 374-7
AB  - An overview and critique of research measures of inappropriate psychoactive drug use 
      in the treatment of frail older adults is presented. These measures are compared on 
      the basis of six key criteria for the complex determination of inappropriate 
      psychoactive drug use as a research variable. These six instruments/standards are 
      examined also for their advantages and disadvantages as research tools. Based on 
      this review and related literature, recommendations are made that future studies of 
      inappropriate psychoactive drug use include expert clinician assessment, measures of 
      target symptoms and functional status, physiological indicators wherever possible, 
      and drug and dosage classifications according to interdisciplinary consensus-based 
      criteria.

TI  - Transitional care from skilled nursing facilities to home: study protocol for a 
      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial.
PG  - 120

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with 
      multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have 
      experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or 
      acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their 
      caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them 
      to manage serious illnesses at home. METHODS: The study will test the efficacy of 
      Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting 
      seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study 
      setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' 
      home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will 
      transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the 
      Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and 
      their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and 
      Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff 
      create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at 
      home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement 
      the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of 
      the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using 
      study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for 
      discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample 
      and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect 
      a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ 
      linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care 
      periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality 
      of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden 
      and distress. DISCUSSION: Study results will determine the efficacy of an 
      intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for 
      seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute 
      care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) 
      advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care 
      trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was 
      being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to 
      mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study 
      team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications.

TI  - Current challenges to providing personalized care in a long term care facility.
PG  - i-v
AB  - Long term care facilities are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver quality, 
      personalized care to their clients. This is related to: the integration of frail, 
      elderly residents with cognitive impairment and/or behavioural disorders; ethical 
      dilemmas; settings that are not conducive to providing a stimulating and supportive 
      atmosphere which would enhance care delivery; admission of residents with 
      increasingly complex care needs without adequate funding and/or support services, 
      and staff training needs. This paper defines how one organization intends to 
      facilitate the changes required to improve the delivery of quality, personalized 
      care.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of nursing homes residents requiring light-care.
PG  - 210-9
AB  - Rising nursing home (NH) costs and the poor quality of NH care make it important to 
      recognize elders for whom NH care may be inappropriate. As a first step in 
      developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH 
      residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 
      12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we 
      developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III 
      (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance 
      with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no 
      complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the 
      criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal 
      care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining 
      balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still 
      light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as 
      light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer 
      services than NHs.

TI  - An investigation of the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely 
      ill hospitalized older patients with coincidental dementia: a multi-method design.
PG  - 1127-36
AB  - The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the 
      components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly 
      people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the 
      problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design 
      comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived 
      from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently 
      combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and 
      older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of 
      elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer 
      from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey 
      revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were 
      more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. 
      No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had 
      items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. 
      A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were 
      invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to 
      the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of 
      the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between 
      documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within 
      each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care 
      is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. 
      Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide 
      nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by 
      the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method 
      research.

TI  - Minimum data set for home care: a valid instrument to assess frail older people 
      living in the community.
PG  - 1184-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal care for frail elderly patients depends on comprehensive 
      assessment. This is especially true in the complex setting of interdisciplinary home 
      care programs. To facilitate comprehensive assessment, as well as to generate a 
      useful, policy-relevant patient database, standardized, multidimensional, and 
      validated instruments are very helpful. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was 
      to demonstrate that the Minimum Data Set assessment instrument for Home Care 
      (MDS-HC) can be used to detect functional and cognitive impairment as defined by 
      analogous research instruments. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional 
      correlation study. SUBJECTS: We studied 95 patients admitted to home care services 
      of the Health Care Agency of Bergamo (Italy). MEASURES: The MDS-HC form was 
      completed for all patients by well-trained nurses, independently of and with nurses 
      blinded to the results from the research rating scales. The Barthel Activities of 
      Daily Living (ADL) Index, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of Lawton 
      (IADL), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were considered the gold 
      standard. RESULTS: Agreement between the MDS-HC scales and the research rating 
      scales was assessed with Pearson's correlation coefficient. This coefficient was 
      0.74 for MDS-ADL versus Barthel Index, 0.81 for MDS-IADL versus Lawton Index, and 
      0.81 for Cognitive Performance Scale versus MMSE, indicating an excellent agreement. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The MDS-HC scales, when performed by trained nurses using recommended 
      protocols, provide a valid measure of function and cognitive status in frail home 
      care patients. These findings point out the overall validity of the functional and 
      clinical data contained in the MDS-HC assessment. Use of the MDS-HC gives the unique 
      opportunity of setting up a database, a prerequisite for all epidemiological 
      evidence-based medicine studies.

TI  - Managing perplexing patients: the case of Helen.
PG  - 47-63
AB  - The challenges faced in provision of high quality and effective care to geriatric 
      psychiatric inpatients are substantial for all members of the interdisciplinary 
      team. Common care dilemmas, including the interplay of social, medical, and 
      psychiatric factors in treating complex patients, are perhaps best understood by 
      examining such a case. The hypothetical case of "Helen" illustrates the 
      multi-dimensional and often perplexing care needs of patients admitted multiple 
      times for inpatient care. Linked nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions, and 
      interdisciplinary care plans emphasize the changing care needs of such patients.

TI  - The risk of adverse outcomes in hospitalized older patients in relation to a frailty 
      index based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment.
PG  - 127-32
LID - 10.1093/ageing/aft156 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: prognostication for frail older adults is complex, especially when they 
      become seriously ill. OBJECTIVES: to test the measurement properties, especially the 
      predictive validity, of a frailty index based on a comprehensive geriatric 
      assessment (FI-CGA) in an acute care setting in relation to the risk of death, 
      length of stay and discharge destination. DESIGN AND SETTING: prospective cohort 
      study. Inpatient medical units in a teaching, acute care hospital. SUBJECTS: 
      individuals on inpatient medical units in a hospital, n = 752, aged 75+ years, were 
      evaluated on their first hospital day; to test reliability, a subsample (n = 231) 
      was seen again on Day 3. MEASUREMENTS: all frailty data collected routinely as part 
      of a CGA were used to create the FI-CGA. Mortality data were reviewed from hospital 
      records, claims data, Social Security Death Index and interviews with Discharge 
      Managers. RESULTS: thirty-day mortality was 93 (12.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      = 10-15%) of whom 52 died in hospital. The risk of dying increased with each 0.01 
      increment in the FI-CGA: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, (95% CI = 1.04-1.07). People who 
      were discharged home had the lowest admitting mean FI-CGA = 0.38 (±standard 
      deviation 0.11) compared with those who died, FI-CGA = 0.51 (±0.12) or were 
      discharged to nursing home, FI-CGA = 0.49 (±0.11). Likewise, increasing FI-CGA 
      values on admission were significantly associated with a longer length of hospital 
      stay. CONCLUSIONS: frailty, measured by the FI-CGA, was independently associated 
      with a higher risk of death and other adverse outcomes in older people admitted to 
      an acute care hospital.

TI  - Transitions in health care use and expenditures among frail older adults by 
      payor/provider type.
PG  - 550-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess whether transitions in health care expenditures differed over 
      time by payor/provider type: Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), Medicaid-Medicare, and 
      Medicare HMO. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: A large, nonprofit healthcare 
      system in San Diego, California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 frail older people who 
      responded to the baseline and follow-up surveys and who survived the 18-month study 
      period. MEASUREMENTS: Measures included three total expenditure categories for each 
      6-month period: low users (< $4000); medium users ($4000-$19,999); or high users 
      ($20,000+). Seven conceptually meaningful expenditure trajectories over time were 
      identified: (1) consistently low expenditures, (2) consistently medium expenditures, 
      (3) consistently high expenditures, (4) decreasing expenditures, (5) increasing 
      expenditures, (6) U-shaped expenditures, and (7) inverted U-shaped expenditures. 
      MAIN RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed that HMO enrollees were about 
      twice as likely as Medicaid-Medicare beneficiaries to have consistently low 
      expenditures, but no differences were found between the FFS and HMO groups on this 
      trajectory. Other expenditure patterns showed no significant differences by 
      payor/provider group. Significant interactions among payor/provider type, 
      low/medium/ high expenditure status, and time were observed for inpatient hospital 
      care, skilled nursing/rehabilitation care, and home health care. CONCLUSION: This 
      study illustrates the complexity of frail older people with respect to their health 
      care expenditures and service use. Expanded efforts to control health care 
      expenditures for frail older people should focus first on those who are 
      dually-enrolled. In addition, because mean medical expenditures for high users 
      enrolled in different payor/ provider groups were surprisingly similar, the data 
      suggest that containing expenditures for individuals in the highest usage group 
      ($20,000+) presents challenges for physicians practicing in an era of healthcare 
      reform, regardless of payor/ provider setting.

TI  - Helping family members manage medication administration hassles.
PG  - 13-5
AB  - Managing the medication regimens of dependent older adults in the home is a complex 
      issue for family caregivers. The tasks involved can include helping the older adults 
      manage their own medications or may require involvement in the purchasing, 
      scheduling, and administering of multiple medications for serious conditions. The 
      hassles associated with this responsibility are now known to be associated with 
      increased caregiver strain. In this article, we provide an overview of the body of 
      research on medication administration hassles and offer a tool to assess family 
      caregivers who are involved in this important aspect of care.

AB  - This article explores the work of an acute assessment and liaison service for older 
      people, including the role of the older people's specialist nurse in the service. 
      The service screens all patients admitted who are over the age of 75 for problems 
      specific to a frail population and to identify where ongoing specialist support, 
      referral or advice is indicated. Patients with complex problems undergo a 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment. The service has reduced length of stay and 
      resulted in better care for older people.

AB  - High Quality Care for All (Department of Health (DH), 2008) emphasised the 
      centrality of quality within NHS provision based upon a service that is 'fair, 
      personalized, effective and safe'. The challenge of meeting this aspiration is even 
      greater today amid resource constraints and the imperative of transferring more 
      complex care out of hospitals and into primary care and community settings. The 
      quality of care delivered to older people in particular has attracted much negative 
      comment (Ombudsman, 2011), with the values of care and compassion appearing to have 
      evaporated in some services.

TI  - Medication administration hassles reported by family caregivers of dependent elderly 
      persons.
PG  - M412-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even under the new long-term care mantra for increased home- and 
      community-based care options, attention to and an understanding of the ways that 
      family caregivers are managing complex care for dependent elderly persons, for 
      example, with medication administration, have been slow to materialize. METHODS: 
      Twenty-three family caregivers completed semistructured, face-to-face interviews to 
      capture the shared and idiosyncratic experiences of individuals responsible for all 
      aspects of medication administration regimens for elderly, dependent family members. 
      Data analysis consisted of content analysis of the verbatim interview transcripts. 
      This article reports an emerging typology of caregiver medication administration 
      hassles derived from the interviews. RESULTS: Based on 122 separate accounts, three 
      categories of medication administration hassles were identified. The categories 
      (with the percentage of all accounts represented by the category) include (i) 
      scheduling logistics (29.5%), (ii) administration procedures (31.9%), and (iii) 
      safety issues (38.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers must continually 
      reevaluate and simplify medication regimens for dependent elderly persons in the 
      care of family members, and the family caregivers must be given adequate training 
      and access to ongoing information support systems to help them perform safe and 
      effective medication administration responsibilities.

TI  - Age-related hearing loss in the dependent elderly population: a model for nursing 
      care.
PG  - 224-30
AB  - Advancing nursing care through the implementation of evidence-based practice is a 
      legitimate professional ideal. In reality there are many complex issues that need be 
      addressed before such a goal can be achieved. This paper takes an intermediate step 
      towards the realization of this aim in one aspect of continuing care nursing through 
      the presentation of a procedural model. The presented model is designed to stimulate 
      debate as to what could be, and arguably should be the role of the nurse in relation 
      to meeting the auditory rehabilitative needs of dependent elderly patients. The 
      model is based upon a published management model which outlines the auditory 
      rehabilitative process within a psychosocial framework. The original model has been 
      modified as a result of knowledge synthesis from a range of specialist disciplines 
      including nursing. The Audiological Care Model for Nursing is intended to offer an 
      accessible guide to this often neglected aspect of care.

TI  - Assisting older adults with severe disabilities in expressing leisure preferences: a 
      protocol for determining choice-making skills.
PG  - 113-26
AB  - We evaluated a protocol involving two types of choice presentations for assessing 
      leisure choice-making skills of seven older adults with severe disabilities. 
      Initially when presented with pairs of objects representing choices, choice making 
      was validated through demonstration of an object preference. A more complex 
      choice-presentation format was then employed, involving pictures to represent 
      choices. If the preference identified with objects was not demonstrated using 
      pictures, a replication of the object format occurred to ensure changes in choice 
      making using pictures was not due to a preference change. Five participants 
      demonstrated choice-making skills using objects and two demonstrated choices using 
      pictures. These results reflect the importance of assessing choice-making skills 
      prior to presenting choice opportunities. Suggestions for future research focus on 
      expanding the assessment protocol to include a wider array of choice-making skills 
      and training staff to provide choices in a format commensurate with an individual's 
      skill level.

TI  - Discharge of frail older people from acute hospitals across Europe.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - Over the last few years the number of elderly patients in acute hospitals throughout 
      Europe has risen dramatically. The pressure on hospital beds leads to earlier 
      discharge and the task of sending patients home from hospitals is becoming more 
      complex. The provision of health and social services is organized in different ways 
      all over Europe. Therefore, it would be of interest to know more about how different 
      kinds of systems support the professional carers in their effort to satisfy the 
      needs which older people and their significant others experience in the discharge 
      process. A pilot study was set up mainly to provide information on what kinds of 
      problems are inherent in a multicentre, interprofessional research project involving 
      a large number of countries. The findings serve as an important knowledge base in a 
      future project. Experiences from the pilot study and the benefits of it are 
      presented.

TI  - Provider dilemmas with relocation in assisted living: philosophy vs. practice.
PG  - 19-37
AB  - Support for increasing tenant frailty in assisted living (AL) is a complex and 
      challenging issue. Philosophically, older persons, families, providers, and 
      policymakers want to avoid unnecessary relocation. However, there is considerable 
      opportunity for inconsistency in practice. We examined provider perspectives related 
      to implementing aging-in-place, using information obtained from an evaluation of a 
      three-year AL demonstration project in Illinois. We found differences in approaches 
      to explicit move-out criteria, the actual application of move-out criteria, and 
      provider willingness to develop flexible service plans. These findings raise 
      questions for consideration in all states confronted with implementing the 
      philosophy and intent of AL.

TI  - Long-term care residents' preferences for health states on the quality of well-being 
      scale.
PG  - 254-61
AB  - The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) quantifies health-related quality of life with 
      a single number that represents community-based preferences for combinations of 
      symptom/problem complexes, mobility, physical activity, and social activity. The aim 
      of this study was to compare preferences of a long-term care population with those 
      of the general population, determine whether preferences vary by the age of the 
      hypothetical (target) person depicted in the health-state case description, and 
      derive weights for new symptom/problem complexes of particular relevance to frail, 
      older individuals. A sample of 38 female and 12 male long-term care residents with 
      an average age of 86 years was asked to rate health-state scenarios that combined 
      the four health domains of the QWB. This sample rates quality of life 0.10 units 
      lower on average (on a 0-1 scale) than did the general population sample from which 
      the QWB preferences were originally developed. Ratings of the same health state for 
      younger versus older target persons did not differ significantly (all p values > 
      0.05 for t statistics). Weights derived for 11 new symptom/problem complexes were: 
      disturbed sleep (-0.252), sit-to-stand requires maximal effort (-0.259), lonely 
      (-0.265), walking a short distance causes extreme fatigue (-0.273), agitated 
      (-0.284), hallucinating (-0.355), incontinent (0-359), unable to control one's 
      behavior (-0.36), urinary catheter (-0.374), restrained in bed or chair (-0.374), 
      and feeding tube through the nose or stomach (-0.402). These new weights increase 
      the relevance of the QWB for cost-utility evaluations of health interventions for 
      long-term care residents.

TI  - LIFE: Learning Informally From Elders.
PG  - 267-70
AB  - The Better Elder Services Today (BEST) Project helps frail elders maintain healthy, 
      independent living through partnership with their formal and informal caregivers. 
      This article reports on achieving one particular project goal: the development of 
      community forums in which elders engaged in problem-solving with health care 
      professionals and policy makers. The methodology involved community assessment and 
      qualitative analysis of themes in 102 elders' responses to the question, "What has 
      it been like for you trying to remain as independent as possible in the community?" 
      Five predominant themes emerged: safety; problems communicating with health care 
      providers; dissatisfaction with hospital services; complexity in access to community 
      services; and fears about losses.

TI  - Care arrangement choices for older widows: decision participants' perspectives.
PG  - 127-43; discussion 185-7
AB  - This research examines how a wide range of care arrangement decisions for frail 
      older women are made. Interviews were conducted with 11 older women (ten of whom are 
      widows), nine of their family members, and six professional service providers. 
      Maintaining the older woman's independence was identified as a major theme. While 
      all decision participants identified it as an explicit or implicit decision-making 
      goal, their meanings of independence were different. The older women's meanings were 
      flexible, changing in response to changes in their physical condition and need for 
      assistance. Adult children tended to identify their mothers as independent when they 
      did not actually need assistance, or when they received help from other sources 
      (e.g., home health care). Professional service providers were inclined to define 
      independence narrowly, as avoiding nursing home placement. Minor themes associated 
      with independence include responsibility, reciprocity, and the family's importance 
      in maintaining independence. These themes help to clarify the complex dynamics that 
      take place during care arrangement decisions and explain how care arrangement 
      choices are made.
