BACKGROUND: Pain is prevalent among older people, yet is often under-recognised 
and undertreated in people with dementia. The nurse has a central role in 
identifying and appropriately assessing pain in order to provide effective 
treatment. Research however suggests there are significant deficits in this 
area.
AIM: To explore the evidence on nurses' knowledge and attitudes to pain 
assessment in older people with dementia.
DESIGN: A systematic narrative review of peer-reviewed articles published 
between 2000 and 2014.
DATA SOURCES: Seven electronic data bases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Wiley, 
Pubmed, ProQuest and OVID) were searched and articles focusing on nurses 
knowledge and attitudes on pain assessment towards people with dementia.
METHODS: Research participants within the studies reviewed were to include 
registered nurses involved in the assessment and management of pain in older 
adults with dementia from across all healthcare settings (e.g. dementia units, 
nursing homes, community and acute settings).
RESULTS: Data were systematically analysed from 11 papers. Using an inductive 
approach for thematic content analysis informed by the theory of planned 
behaviour, five themes were identified. These included: 1) Challenges in 
diagnosing pain in dementia 2) Inadequacies of pain assessment tools 3) Time 
constraints and workload pressures 4) Lack of interdisciplinary teamwork and 
communication 5) Training and education.
CONCLUSION: Nurses play a key role in the effective management of pain through 
the use of pain assessment tools, behavioural observation, and analgesic choice. 
Pain assessment in dementia remains challenging for nurses due to the complexity 
and individualisation of pain behaviours. The accessibility of appropriate 
training, workforce stability and a standardised approach to pain assessment are 
key to the successful management of pain in older people with dementia.

Cardiff.

This article highlights the vulnerability of people with dementia in the acute 
hospital setting, where they are more likely to experience clinical incidents 
such as falls, contract infections and be prescribed neuroleptic drugs. This 
patient group has a significantly longer length of hospital stay and higher 
mortality rate following discharge compared with those without dementia. As many 
as one third are discharged to institutionalised care. The article explores the 
knowledge gap concerning the complexity of caring for a person with dementia and 
highlights factors that can lead to staff detaching themselves from engaging in 
meaningful communication with patients. It also discusses the syndrome of 
'cascade iatrogenesis' in relation to patients' physical and cognitive decline. 
More emphasis needs to be placed on addressing these issues to ensure the safety 
and welfare of people with dementia in hospitals. A case study from the author's 
clinical practice is used to illustrate the issues.

Our aging population is rapidly growing and accounts for 46% of critical care 
patients and 60% of medical-surgical patients in the hospital. These acutely ill 
patients are challenging to frontline nurses because they frequently have 
multiple chronic conditions. This article provides a tool kit of resources and 
clinical skills to develop safe, quality, and accountable care plans for 
positive patient outcomes; it presents several resources to assist in 
individualized care, the complexity of care, and the issues of transitions of 
care. This article empowers frontline nurses to develop gerontological skills 
and meet the unique needs of our aging population.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors related to the occurrence of urinary tract 
infection associated with urinary catheter use.
METHOD: A longitudinal, retrospective cohort study carried out by analyzing the 
electronic medical records of patients admitted to an intensive care unit of a 
high-complexity hospital from July 2016 to June 2017. Demographic and clinical 
data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical analysis.
RESULTS: The incidence density of urinary tract infection related to urinary 
catheter use was 4.8 per 1000 catheters/day, the majority (80.6%) with no 
indication for catheter use, and there was no prescription for insertion and/or 
maintenance in 86.7%. The mean time between catheter insertion and infection 
diagnosis was 11.3 ± 6.3 days (6 to 28 days). Statistically significant factors 
(p < 0.001) related to urinary infection linked to catheter use were 
hospitalization time in the unit (16.7 ± 9 days), catheter permanence time (12.7 
± 6.9 days), and the use of antimicrobials in the intensive care unit (8.6 ± 6.3 
days).
CONCLUSION: The association of indication absence and the record of the need for 
maintenance possibly potentiated the occurrence of urinary tract infection 
associated to catheter use.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine presence of clinical complications related to 
dysphagia and to explore their operational outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common complication of stroke. The management of 
poststroke dysphagia is multidisciplinary with nurses playing a key role in 
screening for dysphagia risk, monitoring tolerance of food and fluids and 
checking for the development of complications such as fever, dehydration and 
change in medical status. Dysphagia often results in further complications 
including aspiration pneumonia and the need for nasogastric feeding. 
Dysphagia-related complications have been shown to have a significant impact on 
morbidity and mortality, length of stay and cost of admission.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: A total of 110 patients presenting with an ischaemic stroke were 
chart-audited.
RESULTS: Aspiration pneumonia poststroke was found to be significantly 
associated with increased overall length of stay, poorer functional outcomes 
poststroke as well as being associated with a high risk of mortality. The 
presence of a nasogastric tube was also associated with reduced functional 
outcomes poststroke and increased risk of death.
CONCLUSION: High prevalence and cost of complications associated with stroke 
highlight the complexity of providing nursing and allied health care to this 
patient population. This provides a snapshot of dysphagia-related complications 
experienced by stroke patients.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper highlights that poststroke 
complications can significantly impact on patient outcomes and operational 
factors such as cost of admission; therefore, poststroke care requires a 
multidisciplinary approach to management. Furthermore, preventing and managing 
complications poststroke is a key element of nursing care and has the potential 
to significantly reduce incidence of mortality, length of stay and cost of 
hospital admission.

Who often feels lonely? A cross-sectional study about loneliness and its related 
factors among older home-dwelling people.

Sciences, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway.

AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of individuals who often feel 
lonely among a sample of Norwegian older home-dwelling people aged ≥65 years 
old, as well as to identify any possible factors explaining their loneliness.
BACKGROUND: Loneliness is known to be common among older people. To identify 
those older adults who are lonely, and to acquire knowledge about the complexity 
of their loneliness, is important to provide them with adequate help and 
support.
DESIGN: This study employed a cross-sectional design.
METHOD: A questionnaire was mailed to a randomised sample of 6,033 older 
home-dwelling persons aged ≥65 years. A total of 2,052 persons returned the 
questionnaire and were included in the study. The questionnaire consisted of 
questions asking whether the subjects often felt lonely or not, as well as 
health-related and background questions and instruments to measure the 
participants' sense of coherence, mental problems, nutritional screening and 
self-care ability. The data were analysed using univariate and multivariate 
statistical methods.
RESULTS: A total of 11.6% of the participants reported often feeling lonely. Six 
factors emerged to be independently associated with often feeling lonely among 
the respondents: Living alone, not being satisfied with life, having mental 
problems, a weak sense of coherence, not having contact with neighbours and 
being at risk for undernutrition.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that often feeling lonely among older home-dwelling 
persons is a health-related problem that includes social, psychological and 
physical aspects. Moreover, these persons have limited resources to overcome 
feelings of loneliness.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Lasting loneliness among older home-dwelling persons 
requires an overall, person-centred and time-consuming approach by nurses. 
Nurses with advanced knowledge on geriatric nursing may be required to offer 
appropriate care and support. Healthcare leaders and politicians should offer 
possibilities for adequate assessment, support and help.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe our Activation and 
Coordination Team (ACT) model for interprofessional care coordination in primary 
care and examine feasibility of using ACT medical and social complexity criteria 
to categorize patients into Quadrants that determine resource utilization. 
Research questions were: (a) Are there significant differences in demographic, 
medical, and social characteristics by Quadrant; (b) Do patients with combined 
high medical and social complexity differ from those with either high medical or 
social complexity; and (c) Is there an association between initial screening 
risk level and ACT Complexity Quadrant placement?
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive.
SAMPLE: Patients (N = 167) aged 18-65 enrolled in an urban Medicaid managed care 
network.
MEASUREMENTS: Screening and comprehensive health risk assessment questionnaires 
and clinical data collection from electronic health records.
RESULTS: Patient characteristics differed significantly by Quadrant. Combined 
medical and social complexity produced greater impact than additive effects. 
Patients who initially screened low risk nevertheless met ACT criteria for 
medical and/or social complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater effects for individuals with medical and social issues are 
due to interactions among factors. Traditional screening may miss patients with 
complex needs who need care coordination. Care coordination skills should be 
incorporated into population health curricula.

PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: Hyperglycemia can increase the risk for adverse events 
and outcomes in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. The purposes of this 
state-of-the-science review were to explore the complexity of hyperglycemia in 
patients with cancer and to analyze physiologic mechanisms and outcomes in 
individuals with or at risk for cancer.
LITERATURE SEARCH: PubMed® and the Cochrane Library databases were searched, and 
95 articles were included. Findings were evaluated for their methods and 
analyses. Studies assessed as methodologically flawed were not included.
DATA EVALUATION: The synthesis of the articles provided the evidence for 
describing normal and glycemic pathways. Hyperglycemia in patients with cancer 
was explored through chronic inflammatory mechanisms that lead to increased 
risks for adverse events and outcomes.
SYNTHESIS: This article discusses normal glucose regulation and hyperglycemic 
pathways, hyperglycemia in patients with cancer, hyperglycemia and 
cancer-related inflammation, and outcomes (e.g., infections, mortality, 
symptoms).
IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Understanding the contributors to and consequences of 
hyperglycemia can guide the development of screening tools to predict which 
individuals are at the greatest risk for hyperglycemic episodes prior to 
starting cancer therapies. Research can lead to glycemic guidelines specific to 
patients with cancer for better outcomes.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Today's health care climate is composed of patients who 
experience complex conditions with multiple comorbidities, requiring higher 
utilization of acute care services. It is imperative for acute care and primary 
care landscapes to bridge silos and form collaborative relationships to ensure 
safe and effective transitions of care from hospital to home. An 
interprofessional, posthospital follow-up clinic (Discharge Clinic) is one 
approach that can be used to improve transitions of care and decrease 
preventable hospital readmissions. The purpose of the Discharge Clinic is to 
improve transitions of care and decrease 30-day hospital readmission rates. The 
clinic's objective is to utilize an interprofessional care team to improve 
transitions of care posthospital, for complex care patients.
PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: The posthospital Discharge Clinic is an innovative, 
interprofessional clinic located in a large western state that was initiated to 
improve transitions of care for its patients discharged from an acute care 
setting. The interprofessional care team consists of a certified family nurse 
practitioner, a clinical pharmacist, a nurse case manager, and a social worker.
FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: In 2013, Medicare and private coverage data reveal 30-day 
readmission rates of 17.3% and 8.6%, respectively (). From February 2016 to 
September 2016, Discharge Clinic project participants achieved a 30-day 
readmission rate of 2.7%. The Discharge Clinic enrolled 75 patients in the 
project (n = 75). The 30-day readmission rate achieved by the Discharge Clinic 
represents a significant decrease compared with national benchmark data. Two 
patients enrolled in the project were readmitted within 30 days of hospital 
discharge. For fiscal year 2015, the medical group's estimated cost of 
readmissions was $7,156,800 and 30-day all-cause readmission rate was 12.3%. 
This equated to the Discharge Clinic's estimated impact in reducing readmissions 
at 9.63% and an estimated savings of $689,199.84. The Discharge Clinic estimated 
its operating costs at $354,000, which gave a total estimated net savings of 
$335,199.84.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: The current health care landscape is 
composed of an aging population, rising in complexity. New approaches are needed 
to bridge gaps between acute care and primary care settings. The Discharge 
Clinic serves as an innovative model that health systems throughout the country 
can replicate to improve transitions of care for complex patients. The 
interprofessional care team model can be implemented to advance and bridge the 
management of acute and ambulatory care patient populations.

BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers place a significant burden on patients and 
hospitals. Our team developed and tested a pressure ulcer prevention care bundle 
(PUPCB) in a cluster randomized trial. As part of the process evaluation 
conducted alongside the trial, we explored patients' perceptions of the 
intervention.
AIMS: To identify patients' perceptions and experiences of a PUPCB in hospital.
METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study explored the perceptions of a subset 
of patients who participated in a trial testing the PUPCB across four 
intervention hospitals. A trained interviewer conducted semistructured 
interviews, which were digitally recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using 
thematic analysis.
FINDINGS: Nineteen patients were interviewed across the four hospitals. Three 
main themes emerged: (a) importance of personal contact in PUPCB delivery; (b) 
understanding pressure ulcer prevention (PUP) enhances participation; and (c) 
individual factors impact patients' engagement in PUP.
DISCUSSION: The extent to which patients adopted the intervention appeared to be 
influenced by the complexity of education materials, compatibility with 
patients' existing knowledge and beliefs, and perceived advantage of the 
intervention; ability for human interaction; and patient-related facilitators 
and barriers to participating in PUP care.
LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This study found patients accepted a PUPCB that 
encouraged participation in care, particularly as it involved personal and 
positive interactions with nurses and provision of information that was easy to 
understand and resonated with patients.

Temporary Stoppages and Burden of Treatment in Patients With Cancer.

Vachon E(1), Given B(1), Given C(1), Dunn S(2).

Author information:
(1)Michigan State University.
(2)University of Illinois.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of burden of treatment and multimorbidity on 
the relationship between baseline characteristics and oral oncolytic agent (OOA) 
temporary stoppages.
SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: 272 patients newly prescribed OOAs at six National Cancer 
Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers.
METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: Patients were randomly assigned to an adherence and 
symptom management group or a usual care/control group. Temporary OOA stoppages, 
symptom interference, OOA regimen complexity, and multimorbidities were 
explored. Data were collected at four-week intervals for 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Burden of treatment variables and multimorbidity had no significant 
effect on OOA temporary stoppages. Women and those prescribed kinase inhibitors 
were significantly more likely to experience a temporary stoppage.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Oncology nurses are in a crucial position to educate 
patients on self-management of OOAs and symptoms. Nurses should be aware of 
patients who may be more susceptible to severe symptoms, including those with 
multimorbidities. Future research is needed to better understand OOA stoppages 
and factors associated with preventing stoppages.

(2)Universidade de São Paulo. São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: to investigate possible differences in care complexity, functional 
performance and biopsychosocial and health system aspects among hospitalized 
elderly with or without cognitive decline.
METHOD: quantitative, cross-sectional and analytical study in which was used the 
INTERMED method and cognitive and functional screening scales. We investigated 
384 elderly patients admitted to a medical and surgical clinic of a University 
Hospital located in São Paulo/SP.
RESULTS: cognitive decline was present in 40.1% of the sample, most of them were 
longer-lived elderly individuals with less schooling and income, more dependent 
in activities of daily living and had greater vulnerability in different domains 
of INTERMED. After adjustments, the elderly with cognitive decline presented 
greater vulnerability in the psychological domain.
CONCLUSION: the relationship between cognitive decline and psychological 
vulnerability highlights the need to adopt long-term care based on involvement 
of the family, health team and different services, thereby maximizing the 
quality of care.

Nursing Work in Long-Term Care: An Integrative Review.

Montayre J, Montayre J.

Evidence suggests that delivery of good nursing care in long-term care (LTC) 
facilities is reflected in nurses' descriptions of the factors and structures 
that affect their work. Understanding the contemporary nature of nursing work in 
aged care will influence policies for improving current work structures in this 
practice setting. The current review aims to present a contemporary perspective 
of RNs' work in LTC facilities. A comprehensive search and purposeful selection 
of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and 
Google Scholar databases. Nine studies were eligible for review. Common themes 
revealed that nursing work in aged care settings is characterized by RNs 
providing indirect care tasks-primarily care coordination, engaging in 
non-nursing activities, and having an expanded and overlapping role. As care 
providers, aged care RNs do not always provide direct care as part of their 
nursing work. The scope of RN work beyond its clinical nature or performance of 
non-nursing tasks adds complexity in clarifying RN work roles in aged care.

This article describes the management of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant 
Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-Ab) at an acute NHS Foundation Trust. The outbreak 
affected two respiratory wards and the initial outbreak lasted 9 months, with 
the first patient (index case) being identified in April 2015 and the final, 
tenth case, in September 2015. The outbreak was declared closed in January 2016, 
but a further two cases were identified in July and August 2016. Of the 12 
identified patients, eight were colonised with the bacterium and four were 
infected. The four infections were of the respiratory tract with MDR-Ab, of 
identical variable number tandem repeat, isolated from sputum in all cases. All 
12 patients were decolonised and this continued throughout the outbreak. Some 
negative rescreening results were achieved. At the time of the outbreak, 
decolonisation using octenidine had not been reported in any guidelines. The 
sensitivity of MDR-Ab to octenidine was microbiologically tested and 
antibacterial action of octenidine against this organism was demonstrated. The 
use of octenidine appeared to be one element in helping to control this testing 
situation. This report seeks to demonstrate not only the complexity of managing 
and containing an outbreak of MDR-Ab but also how, with the use of a range of 
effective infection prevention measures, the spread of this pathogen can be 
successfully controlled. It is hoped that this article will increase awareness 
among healthcare providers and infection prevention and control (IPC) teams of 
the threat posed by this organism in the healthcare environment.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relation between patient complexity and 
nursing care of total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients. To improve patient care 
and hospital logistics, the aim of this study is to gain insight into the 
relation between patient complexity and the nursing staff's actual and perceived 
workload at an orthopedic ward during admission for a THA.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 45 THA patients in the year 2014. Duration 
and type of nursing care activities were recorded during the first postoperative 
morning. A questionnaire was used to analyze the perceived workload of the 
nursing staff. Both actual and perceived workload were analyzed for their 
relation with patient complexity, expressed in the American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), Katz Activities 
of Daily Life score (Katz-ADL) and Body Mass Index (BMI).
RESULTS: No relation was found between actual workload and measures for patient 
complexity. The perceived workload of the nursing staff was related to two 
complexity measures: ASA (r=0.71; p<0.001) and CCI (r=0.65; p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: Patient comorbidity is related to the perceived workload of the 
nursing staff during admission for a THA. Patient complexity is not related to 
actual workload. This study gives a first insight into the relation between 
patient comorbidity and nursing staff workload, to try to improve staffing 
numbers at the ward as well as patient care in the process.

OBJECTIVE: Although the concept of patient participation has been discussed for 
a number of years, there is still no clear definition of what constitutes the 
multidimensional concept, and the application of the concept in an intermediate 
care (IC) context lacks clarity. Therefore this paper seeks to identify and 
explore the attributes of the concept, to elaborate ways of understanding the 
concept of patient participation for geriatric patients in the context of IC.
METHODS: Walker and Avant's model of Concept analysis [1] based on a literature 
review.
RESULTS: Patient participation in the context of IC can be defined as a dynamic 
process emphasizing the person as a whole, focusing on the establishment of 
multiple alliances that facilitate individualized information and knowledge 
exchange, and ensuring a reciprocal engagement in activities within flexible and 
interactive/dynamic organizational structures.
CONCLUSION: Patient participation in IC means involving patients and their 
relatives in holistic interdisciplinary collaborative decision-making. The 
results highlight the complexity of patient participation and contribute to a 
greater understanding of the influence of organizational structure and 
management.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The present study may provide a practical framework for 
researchers, policy makers and health professionals to facilitate patient 
participation in IC services.

Older people living in residential aged care often experience complex persistent 
pain because of the presence of multiple comorbidities and geriatric syndrome. 
Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional 
burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain 
management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration 
needs to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population 
can be improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary 
suffering.

As many as 233,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer 
each year. Most diagnoses are of low-grade, localized disease, which tends to be 
slow growing and is rarely lethal, even in the absence of intervention. The 
amount and complexity of the information men receive at diagnosis may be 
overwhelming and difficult to process, particularly given the weight of a new 
cancer diagnosis and the potential for long-term, life-altering adverse effects 
from treatment. This review examines the multiple options available for men with 
newly diagnosed, low-risk, localized prostate cancer and explains how nurses can 
help these men and their partners make treatment decisions that are appropriate 
for their particular circumstances.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We will provide insights in the theoretical background and 
key concepts of a Narrative Care approach, such as narrative cultures, narrative 
curiosity, narrative co-composition and narrative reflective practice.
BACKGROUND: Care understood as narrative practice underscores the importance of 
experiences and how these shape identities. Important to the quality of care in 
institutional care settings is the ability of care providers to cope with 
complexities and uncertainties in older adults' stories, which can be realised 
by attending to ways that foster and co-compose evolving and forward-looking 
narratives. Recognising these ongoing co-compositions means that persons living 
in institutional care settings and care providers live, tell, retell and relive 
their experiences. A change in the current institutional culture is necessary to 
implement care as narrative practice. To support such a change, approaches are 
needed that foster a focus on experiences and relationships and make relational 
ethics central to care.
METHODS: The proposed Narrative Care approach is the result of an iterative 
development process involving a literature review, interviews with, and 
observations of, care providers, dialogues with an advisory committee, and 
consultation with experts.
MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS: The proposed Narrative Care approach aims to help care 
providers (a) to recognise the importance of curiosity in a person's verbal and 
embodied narratives-especially for those living with dementia; (b) to take note 
of individual experiences in all of their complexity and uncertainty; (c) to 
respect these narratives; (d) to open up spaces to co-compose new narratives; 
and (e) to allow care providers to engage in narrative reflective practices that 
shape who they are and are becoming.
CONCLUSION: The introduced approach responds to the need of implementing 
strategies to think and work narratively in institutional care settings.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Narrative Care has the potential to reshape 
task-oriented, technical notions of care. Concepts such as embodied narratives, 
relational ethics, narrative co-composition and narrative reflective practice 
must be integrated in the education of all care providers.

Nurses should be familiar with and equipped to address the challenges that arise 
when caring for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer-identified (LGBTQ) 
patients. LGBTQ individuals have increased rates of certain physical diseases 
and are at greater risk of suffering from stress-sensitive mental health issues. 
Negative social attitudes, widespread discrimination and stigma, physical and 
psychological victimization, and less social support with aging contribute to 
the complexity of care for these individuals. Open communication, welcoming and 
accepting attitudes and environments, and sensitivity to unique multidimensional 
issues improve care to LGBTQ patients with serious advanced illness. Nursing can 
reach this vulnerable minority and positively impact the quality of care.

AIMS: To explore breast health awareness and the early diagnosis and detection 
methods of breast cancer from the perspective of women and primary healthcare 
providers in Saudi Arabia.
BACKGROUND: A high incidence of advanced breast cancer exists in Saudi Arabia, 
particularly among younger women. This is due to poor awareness of breast cancer 
and its management, social customs and poor breast health awareness among 
healthcare providers.
DESIGN: Qualitative exploratory study.
METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in eight states across the Jizan 
region of Saudi Arabia. Purposive sampling was used to recruit Saudi women 
(N = 24), general practitioners (N = 20), and nurses (N = 20). Semi-structured 
interviews were conducted from November 2015-February 2016. Inductive thematic 
analysis was undertaken.
RESULTS: Overarching themes centred on culture, religion, and resources. Novel 
key findings from this study confirm that Saudi women require more health 
education about breast cancer and breast cancer screening. The study has 
provided important new knowledge in relation to Islamic concept of preserving 
health, social barriers, cultural taboos, misconceptions, and myths that 
currently exist surrounding breast cancer in Saudi Arabia.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new evidence on the complexity of poor breast 
health awareness and lack of resources in Saudi Arabia. Additional resources are 
needed to remove such barriers and provide targeted health education and 
services.
IMPACT: This research informs breast cancer service provision for Muslim or Arab 
women internationally as they share cultural resources or Islamic principles to 
follow a healthy lifestyle and help promote the uptake of breast cancer 
screening services.

Relationships Between Subjective Cognitive Impairment and Personality Traits: A 
Systematic Review.

Koller OM, Hill NL, Mogle J, Bhang I.

This systematic review examined the relationships between personality traits and 
subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) in older adults without dementia. A 
comprehensive literature search conducted according to PRISMA guidelines 
identified empirical investigations of SCI and at least one of the big five 
personality traits among adults age 60 or older. All articles were critically 
appraised using the weight of evidence framework and findings were compared, 
contrasted, and synthesized across studies. Sixteen of the 797 studies initially 
identified met eligibility criteria. A higher level of SCI was associated with 
higher neuroticism in 88% of the studies reviewed. In addition, a consistent 
negative association was identified between conscientiousness and SCI (57% of 
studies). No consistent relationships between openness, extraversion, or 
agreeableness and SCI were identified. Overall, this review supports the 
oft-cited association between higher neuroticism and greater self-reports of 
cognitive problems; however, the complexity of the relationship between SCI and 
personality is not yet fully understood. Future research should examine the 
extent to which different personality traits predispose individuals to report 
symptoms versus those traits that are associated with increased sensitivity to 
early indicators of pathological change. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 
45(2), 27-34.].

AIM: We sought nurse managers' perspectives on challenges and opportunities with 
technology and how it may influence communication and leadership.
BACKGROUND: e-Leadership is a conceptual framework used to understand and teach 
organisational leaders about the application of technology to leadership. 
Technology is integral to leadership, yet little is understood about how nurse 
managers may use this technology and how they negotiate the complexity of the 
multiple communication systems currently in use.
METHODS: Sixteen nurse managers from individual hospitals within a large US 
healthcare system participated in qualitative open-ended interviews and focus 
groups.
RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the qualitative data regarding the nurse 
managers' perspectives of e-Leadership and their use of information and 
communication technologies: (a) Can't live without it, (b) Too much, too many, 
(c) Poor onboarding education and (d) Difficulty maintaining virtual 
relationships.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Effective and safe patient care is 
dependent on multiple technology applications that require significant knowledge 
and practice. Nursing leadership may consider the need for more supported 
mentorship, and engaging programs to educate nurse managers about the dozens of 
applications required to effectively manage and lead. For technology to be used 
to its full potential it should be designed with nursing involvement.

PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of care complexity individual factors 
documented in the nursing assessment and to identify the risk factors associated 
with hospital readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge.
DESIGN: Observational analysis of a retrospective cohort at a 700-bed university 
hospital in Barcelona, Spain. A total of 16,925 adult patient admissions to a 
ward or intermediate care units were evaluated from January to December 2016. 
Most patients were admitted due to cardiocirculatory and respiratory disorders 
(29.3%), musculoskeletal and nervous system disorders (21.8%), digestive and 
hepatobiliary conditions (17.9%), and kidney or urinary disorders (11.2%).
METHODS: Readmission was defined as rehospitalization for any reason within 30 
days of discharge. Patients who required hospital readmission were compared with 
those who did not. The individual factors of care complexity included five 
domains (developmental, mental-cognitive, psycho-emotional, sociocultural, and 
comorbidity or complications) and were reviewed using the electronic nursing 
assessment records. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to determine 
factors associated with readmission.
FINDINGS: A total of 1,052 patients (6.4%) were readmitted within 30 days of 
hospital discharge. Care complexity individual factors from the comorbidity or 
complications domain were found to be the most frequently e-charted (88.3%). 
Care complexity individual factors from developmental (33.2%), psycho-emotional 
(13.2%), mental-cognitive (7.2%), and sociocultural (0.7%) domains were less 
frequently documented. Independent factors associated with hospital readmission 
were old age (≥75 years), duration of first hospitalization, admission to a 
nonsurgical ward, major chronic disease, hemodynamic instability, 
immunosuppression, and relative weight of diagnosis-related group.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of patients required readmission within 30 
days after discharge. The most frequent care complexity individual factors 
recorded in the nursing assessment at index admission were related to 
comorbidity or complications, developmental, and psycho-emotional domains. 
Strategies related to transition of care that include clinical characteristics 
and comorbidity or complications factors should be a priority at hospital 
discharge and after leaving hospital, but other factors related to developmental 
and psycho-emotional domains could have an important effect on the use of 
healthcare resources.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nurses should identify patients with comorbidity or 
complications, developmental, and psycho-emotional complexity factors during the 
index admission in order to be able to implement an effective discharge process 
of care.

The role of concealment and relationship quality on patient hospitalizations, 
care strain and depressive symptoms in heart failure dyads.

Lyons KS(1), Sadowski T(1), Lee CS(1).

Author information:
(1)William F Connell School of Nursing, Boston College, USA.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization 
among older adults and negatively influences person-reported outcomes of 
patients and their care partners. Moreover, the majority of heart failure 
research examines patients and care partners separately, ignoring the 
interdependent nature of the heart failure dyad.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the interpersonal factors associated 
with depressive symptoms of heart failure patients and spouse care partners, 
patient hospitalizations over the last 12 months and care strain.
METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used to examine 60 
community-dwelling adults with heart failure and their spouse care partners. 
Multilevel modeling controlled for the interdependent nature of the dyadic data.
RESULTS: Patients had significantly worse depressive symptoms than their spouse 
care partners. More patient concealment (i.e. hiding concerns/worries) and worse 
relationship quality were significantly associated with greater depressive 
symptoms for patients, but not spouse care partners. Better relationship quality 
(reported by spouse care partners) was significantly associated with lower 
levels of care strain, whereas better relationship quality (reported by 
patients) was significantly associated with worse care strain. Patients who had 
one or more hospitalizations over the past 12 months were significantly more 
likely to report higher levels of concealment; relationship quality was not 
associated with patient hospitalizations.
CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the interdependent nature of heart failure and 
the complexity of the interpersonal context. Greater focus on how the heart 
failure dyad navigates illness as a unit over time is needed to design and 
tailor innovative lines of clinical intervention to optimize dyadic and 
individual health.

BACKGROUND: The complexity and difficulties involved in the development and 
implementation of health innovations, such as advanced practice nursing roles, 
result in slow and sporadic international acceptance. To manage this complexity, 
it is advisable to deepen understanding of the context in which these innovation 
processes take place. However, there is little research specifically concerned 
with contextual factors that influence the implementation of advanced practice 
nursing roles.
PURPOSE: To integrate results and develop a comprehensive understanding of the 
contextual factors that influence the development and implementation of advanced 
practice nursing in two countries, Canada and Spain.
METHODS: The research method used was qualitative, descriptive, and explanatory. 
Different qualitative methods, a novel data-collection process, and perspectives 
from participants in various professional groups were used to triangulate the 
findings from both settings. Participants with diverse perspectives on practice, 
organization, and health and regulatory environments were engaged to participate 
in semistructured focus groups in Catalonia and individual interviews in Quebec. 
Data gathered were to provide information on a variety of context dimensions: 
understanding of advanced practice nursing; perceived needs to develop the role; 
and perceived barriers and facilitators present in the Catalan and Quebec 
contexts. Thematic analysis was carried out based on the theoretical proposals 
from the framework and triangulated for both sides.
FINDINGS: Thirty interviews were conducted in Quebec and 44 in Catalonia. 
Integration of findings reflected a vast predominance of convergent themes 
despite differences in context and population characteristics. The study 
identified common and divergent contextual factors in advanced practice 
development and implementation in these settings. The same perceived barriers 
and facilitators were prominent almost evenly across all groups, although 
organizational and environmental themes were the most coded and discussed during 
interviews.
DISCUSSION: Understanding contextual factors will ultimately allow better 
understanding of complex phenomena in health care. Further reporting of 
contextual factors that influence the development and implementation of advanced 
practice nursing roles in other countries is required to compare innovative 
processes.

Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder, the genetic etiology of which has 
been well established. Yet despite significant advances in genetics research, 
the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder largely remain unknown. This 
gap has been attributed to the complexity of the polygenic disorder, which has a 
heterogeneous clinical profile. Examining the genetic basis of schizophrenia 
subphenotypes, such as those based on particular symptoms, is thus a useful 
strategy for decoding the underlying mechanisms. This review of literature 
examines the recent advances (from 2011) in genetic exploration of positive and 
negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We searched electronic databases PubMed, Web 
of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature using 
key words schizophrenia, symptoms, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, 
cognition, genetics, genes, genetic predisposition, and genotype in various 
combinations. We identified 115 articles, which are included in the review. 
Evidence from these studies, most of which are genetic association studies, 
identifies shared and unique gene associations for the symptom domains. Genes 
associated with neurotransmitter systems and neuronal development/maintenance 
primarily constitute the shared associations. Needed are studies that examine 
the genetic basis of specific symptoms within the broader domains in addition to 
functional mechanisms. Such investigations are critical to developing precision 
treatment and care for individuals afflicted with schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: By 2050, one-third of US residents will be Latino, with an incidence 
of heart failure (HF) higher than other ethnicities. Culturally linked risk 
factors and socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare 
disparities, and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy 
(HL) and HF are less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease 
management, or preventative health strategies.
OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we analyzed the literature studying older 
Latinos with HF and limited HL.
METHOD: We searched the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. 
Inclusion criteria were research studies, Latinos, HF, and HL.
RESULTS: Eight quantitative studies were identified for final review. Inadequate 
HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL was associated with more 
HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL levels and higher 
medical complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurses and advanced practice nurses serve a pivotal role improving 
access and understanding of health information. Before conducting intervention 
research affecting clinical outcomes, it is essential to describe elderly 
Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. Barriers identified confirm 
the need to alter research protocols for older adults and ensure the 
availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older Latinos with 
HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients with 
limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF 
knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be 
reliable predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, 
and develop, implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their 
health.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of case management in terms of 
population served, interventions, use of services and outcomes such as 
mortality, readmissions, pressure ulcers, falls, drug problems and 
institutionalization.
METHOD: Follow-up study of a cohort, from the RANGECOM Multicentric Registry of 
Andalusia. The study population were patients included in the case management 
services of Health Centres and their family caregivers.
RESULTS: Data from 835 patients with a mean age of 76.8years (SD:12.1), 50.24% 
women, are presented. They had an important comorbidity (Charlson 3.1, SD:2.5) 
and high dependence (Barthel 37.5, SD:31.4). Sixty-two point two percent of the 
interventions deployed by the case managers were grouped into three domains: 
behavioural (26.0%), health system (20.2%) and safety (14.1%). Mortality was 
34.4% and hospital admissions 38.1%. Patients with more hospital readmissions 
had more visits to the Emergency Department (OR:1.41; 95%CI: 1.22-1.63), more 
telephone interventions by case managers (OR:1.12; 95%CI: 1.02-1.24) and imaging 
tests (OR:1.37; 95%CI: 1.17-1.60), together with greater caregiver burden 
(OR:1.31; 95%CI: 1.08-1.59), the presence of medical devices at home (OR:1.69; 
95%CI: 1.00-2.87) and received less "Case Management" intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The patients who absorb the demand of case management nurses 
present high complexity, for which they deploy behavioural interventions, 
navigation through the health system and clinical safety.

Who's Your Family?: African American Caregivers of Older Adults With Dementia.

Epps F, Rose KM, Lopez RP.

The nature and outcome of family caregiving is different for various racial and 
ethnic groups. The purpose of the current study was to use qualitative methods 
to examine and characterize family networks of African American family 
caregivers (N = 26) who provided care to family members with dementia (N = 18). 
Researchers used data generated from a parent study that addressed family 
involvement in health promotion activities for African American older adults 
with dementia. Data were analyzed using sociograms and thematic analysis. Three 
themes that characterized African American family caregiving networks were 
identified: (a) Complexity, (b) Familism, and (c) Religiosity. Findings suggest 
that narrowly defining family caregivers as a dyad of a caregiver and care 
recipient does not reflect how these family networks function. A better 
understanding of the complex functioning of these networks may help explain 
physical and psychological well-being outcomes for individuals with dementia and 
their family members. [Res Gerontol Nurs. 2019; 12(1):20-26.].

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients age 65 and 
older account for 43% of hospital days. The complexity of caring for older 
adults affords nursing students opportunities to assess, prioritize, intervene, 
advocate, and experience being a member of an interdisciplinary health care 
team. However, these multifaceted hospital experiences are not consistently 
available for all students. Nursing clinical simulation (NCS) can augment or 
replace specific clinical hours and provide clinically relevant experiences to 
practice management and leadership skills while caring for older adults. This 
article describes a geriatric management and leadership NCS.

BACKGROUND: Previous research points to challenges related to the home 
healthcare of older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although 
person-centred care has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth 
knowledge on how to enable person-centred and supportive communication in the 
care of older persons.
AIM: The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred 
communication between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home.
METHODS: A descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data 
set from the COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare 
visits between registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method 
for qualitative thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The findings indicate that the attributes of person-centred 
communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older persons. To 
facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness on the 
part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated 
when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older 
persons' views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions.
CONCLUSION: The nurses' attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for 
person-centred communication with older persons. Communication skills are needed 
to recognise, invite and involve older persons in their care and to support 
their health and well-being. Implication for practice The importance of 
communication which facilitate a person-centred approach by nurses should be 
acknowledged when caring for older persons and included in education and 
training.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the influence of the variables sex, age, type of 
anesthesia, occurrence of intraoperative complications, pain and surgical 
complexity on the Aldrete-Kroulik Scoring System in patients in the immediate 
postoperative period, in the post-anesthesia care unit.
METHOD: Non-experimental, longitudinal study, with a quantitative approach, 
conducted with 241 surgical patients. Descriptive analysis, Student's t-test, 
Pearson and Spearman Correlation Indexes and multiple linear regression were 
used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Correlations between the Aldrete-Kroulik Scoring System and pain 
(r=-0.13; p=0.05) and surgical complexity (r=-0.12; p=0.05) were statistically 
significant. The type of anesthesia and pain (p<0.01) influenced the decrease of 
the Aldrete-Kroulik System's scores.
CONCLUSION: Considering the vulnerability of patients in the immediate 
postoperative period, it is essential for the nurse to know the factors that can 
influence the Aldrete-Kroulik Scoring System to provide a safe and optimal 
post-anesthesia recovery.

BACKGROUND: Priority setting and decision-making in relation to self-management 
of multiple conditions is particularly challenging for both patients and health 
professionals. The aim of this study was to validate a conceptual model of 
self-management priority setting and decision-making in multimorbidity and 
confirm factors that influence self-management prioritizing and decision-making 
in a sample of patients with acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
METHODS: This was a qualitative study using deductive directed content analysis. 
A purposive sample of 21 participants with acute coronary syndrome and type 2 
diabetes mellitus that were admitted to a Shanghai hospital were interviewed.
RESULTS: Participants provided evidence to confirm all but one of the factors 
from the conceptual model. Internal factors influencing self-management 
predominated. Agreement with recommended treatment, functional capacity and 
perceived synergies, antagonistic effects, or interactions among the conditions 
and prescribed treatments, was emphasized. The facilitators and barriers to 
priority setting and decision-making were related to available resources, 
provider communication and, to a lesser extent, confusion about recommendations, 
and treatment complexity. Some participants were also concerned about treatment 
side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Internal factors (personal beliefs, preferences, and attitudes) and 
facilitators and barriers (knowledge, finances, social support, and 
transportation) were related to changes in priority setting and decision-making 
and self-management behavior in this sample. Health education, which includes 
case studies with shifting self-management priorities is recommended, rather 
than a unique disease-specific focus. Further research, exploring the 
relationship between these factors and changes in the dominant condition and 
related management, using valid and reliable instruments that capture these key 
factors, is recommended.

Objective To analyze the complexity of nursing care with use of the Perroca 
scale in a Palliative Care Unit. Method Retrospective descriptive study of 
quantitative analysis. Results Between 2008 and 2016, the total of 2,486 
patients were hospitalized, and their median length of hospital stay was 12 
days. Of these patients, 1,568 had at least one Perroca scale evaluation. Nine 
hundred and ten patients (58%) were classified as minimal or intermediate care. 
Of these, 602 (66%) were discharged. As semi-intensive and intensive care were 
classified 658 (42%) patients, of whom 64% died and only 36% were discharged. 
Conclusion The Perroca scale is a tool to identify patients with greater need 
for care and the possible prognosis for hospitalized patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore research participants' 
(adults, age 50-65) perceptions of receiving cardiovascular risk information.
METHODS: Five focus group interviews (N = 31) were performed with research 
participants aged 50-65 who participated in the Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage 
Study (SCAPIS). The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: The categories; the complexity of cardiovascular risk; insufficient 
presentation of test result; emotional responses; and health examinations 
provides confirmation, emerged. The test results were written in medical terms 
and lacked recommendations for further action which made it difficult for lay 
people to understand and use, and for some, also caused unnecessary worry.
CONCLUSION: There was inadequate guidance concerning the implications of the 
test results, especially for participants without clinical findings. In order to 
allow research participants to obtain better cognitive and behavioral control, 
improvements are needed with regard to how personal risk information is 
communicated in research projects connected to health services.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The participants largely relied on physical signs when 
assessing their own cardiovascular risk. Health examinations are crucial for 
helping to add nuance to individuals' risk perceptions. For personal health 
information to have any real value for individuals, it must be designed from a 
user perspective.

Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased 
vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, 
hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and 
operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of 
frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a 
number of conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that 
have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a 
consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the 
large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, 
indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., 
oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, 
inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or 
risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes 
(morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the 
weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex 
phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and 
physiological inquiry.

RATIONALE: Since health care is facing challenges, with fewer caregivers 
providing care to more clients, eHealth plays a crucial role. Through eHealth, 
people are expected to be more involved in their own care. On the part of health 
care users, eHealth requires use of everyday technology such as telephones and 
computers, and services through the Internet which might be challenging for 
older adults with cognitive impairment.
AIM: To investigate experiences of using eHealth in contact with health care 
among older adults with cognitive impairment.
METHOD: Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine 
participants, aged 65-84 years, with cognitive impairments of varying origins. A 
constructivist Grounded Theory approach was used. Data collection and analysis 
were performed simultaneously using a constant comparative method.
ETHICAL ISSUES: Ethical approval (Dnr: 2014/906-32) was obtained from the 
regional ethical committee, Stockholm.
RESULTS: The core category, the eHealth staircase supported by habits, is 
presented as a model that visualises the result. The model includes three steps 
showing different ways of being in contact with health care through the use of 
technological devices and services that mirrors different levels of complexity 
of eHealth use as follows: (i) Analogue use, (ii) One-way-use and (iii) 
Interactive use. The participants' location on the eHealth staircase was 
affected by several aspects described in three categories united by habits; A 
stable relationship with technology: a prerequisite for use; The importance of 
interpersonal relationships within health care and Being supported by 
significant others: a prerequisite in contact with health care.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with cognitive impairments seemed to prefer common and 
less complex eHealth when contacting health care. Therefore, it is necessary 
that health care providers offer different possibilities for patients to contact 
them, that is, both through the Internet and by personal telephone service.

Packed Red Blood Cell Transfusion in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.

Jones AR, McGhan G, Deaver J.

Most packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion research focuses on younger 
patient populations (younger than 65) given the complexity of care and presence 
of comorbidities in older adults. The purpose of the current study was to 
critically examine the current evidence related to PRBC transfusion among older 
adults (age ≥65). PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched for randomized 
controlled trials that evaluated blood transfusion in any manner (e.g., 
prevention, associated outcomes). Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the search resulted in 10 studies 
focused on cardiac, orthopedic, and gastrointestinal surgery patients. SQUIRE 
(Standards for QUality Improvement Reporting Excellence) guidelines were used to 
evaluate studies for bias; the average bias score was 13.0 (SD = 3.4), 
indicating a low level of bias. Greatest sources of bias were methods to assess 
completeness/accuracy of data, details about missing data, and costs associated 
with the study. Interventions to prevent PRBC transfusion in older adults vary 
widely, and outcomes associated with PRBC transfusion in older adults require 
further evaluation. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 44(3), 39-46.].

When exposed to adversity, some individuals are at an increased risk of 
posttraumatic stress disorder, experiencing persistent biopsychosocial 
disturbances, whereas others adapt well, described as resilience. Resilience is 
a complex biopsychosocial phenomenon conceptualized as adaptation to adversity 
influenced by an individual's genetic variants, epistasis, epigenetics, and 
gene-by-environment interactions. Studies on psychological resilience have 
focused on behavioral and psychosocial variables with far less examination of 
the genetic contributions. The purpose of this review is to identify specific 
genetic variants contributing to the biological capacity for psychological 
resilience. PubMed and PsycINFO were searched using the following key words: 
psychological resilience AND genotype(s). Additional articles were identified 
from the Human Genome Epidemiology Navigator using the term resilience, 
psychological. Ten studies met the criteria. Six genes were empirically 
associated with psychological resilience: serotonin-transporter-linked 
polymorphic region ( 5-HTTLPR), dopamine receptor D4, brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor ( BDNF), corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1, oxytocin receptor 
and regulator of G-protein signaling 2 . The findings of this systematic review 
suggest that the L/L or L'/L' genotype of 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 in 
children/adolescents and the S/S or S'/S' genotype in adults are most frequently 
related to resilience. Additionally, the Val/Val genotype of rs6265 in BDNF in 
Caucasians was also associated with resilience. There are numerous factors 
contributing to the complexity of determining the genetic influence on 
resilience including analysis of rs25531, assumptions of the mode of 
inheritance, operationalization of resilience, demographic and population 
characteristics, sample size, and other types of genetic influence including 
epistasis and epigenetics. While current evidence is supportive, further 
investigation of the genetic influence on resilience is required.

Aging together with multimorbidity, polymedication and various social factors 
are some of the determinants that lead to increasing complexity of care in the 
elderly, thus making it difficult for health systems to meet their needs. To 
approach this new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal 
health and social care systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing 
specialists trained to address the needs of older people from a perspective of 
comprehensive care, both for healthy aging, and for the different health 
problems of this population group, characterized by the consequences of aging 
and chronicity, towards dependence, and develop the powers established by law in 
the framework of an interdisciplinary team, for those who have been trained and 
accredited, thus adding value to the response that health systems have to 
provide for this growing problem of the 'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.

ICA-EMA: A Tool for Assessing Nursing Complexity of Patients With 
Oncohematologic Disease in an Italian Center.

Iovino P, Scudeller L, Ferretti VV, Arcaini L, Dellafiore F.

Inpatients with hematologic cancer (HC), particularly in an aging population, 
often require levels of nursing care that feel very demanding. Therefore, it is 
important to assess nursing complexity in this care environment. The purpose of 
this study is to assess nursing complexity of inpatients with HC. A prospective 
observational study was carried out on 131 patients admitted to an adult 
hematologic center in northern Italy. The following variables were analyzed by 
means of the Index of Caring Complexity (ICA): age, sex, diagnostic category, 
purpose of admission, presence of transplant, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and 
length of stay. A total sample of 131 patients were enrolled. Patients older 
than 65 years, with a history of transplant, admitted for complications, and 
with a diagnosis of myeloma or myelodysplasia had higher ICA scores. Therefore, 
patients in these groups are more likely to exhibit a higher nursing complexity 
than other patients. The study results can help health-care professionals 
identify, at an early stage, patients who need higher levels of nursing care; 
promote a more efficient allocation of nursing staff to the patient needs based 
on their group; and qualify the need for higher levels of nursing care in order 
to improve nursing care quality and achieve higher standards of care in Italian 
hematologic centers.

PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate evidence regarding the unmet supportive care 
needs of men affected by penile cancer and their partners to create a holistic 
model of care and inform clinical practice guidelines.
METHODS: We searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane 
Library (CCRT and CDSR) controlled trials databases and clinicaltrial.gov from 
1990 to April 2020. This review was reported according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement.
RESULTS: 18 articles were included, reporting the results from 17 studies. 
Included reports used qualitative (seven studies) and survey (ten studies). 
Across these studies, men reported that the diagnosis and subsequent treatment 
of penile cancer affected physical, psychological and sexual well-being with 
each facet impacting and being intertwined with the other at varying degrees. 
There was varying complexity of unmet needs in men and partners pre-surgery, 
post-surgery and into survivorship.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate evidence exists that men affected by penile cancer 
experience a range of unmet supportive care needs across the international 
literature. Further work to evaluate the impact of penile cancer on partners is 
required.

Along with a variety of distressing symptoms, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM) 
brings with it substantial physical, psychosocial, and financial costs. Research 
shows that self-management is an effective means to manage FM and can lead to 
fewer healthcare visits. Yet due to the complexity of this disorder, healthcare 
providers need to be able to tailor treatment to individual patients by 
understanding effective treatment interventions. Home healthcare nurses (HHNs) 
are in a unique position to assess and implement effective treatment 
recommendations in the home setting and as such could consider incorporating 
self-management strategies into the home visit with the FM patient. Therefore, 
the purpose of this article is to use a case study to describe the assessment of 
FM patient's functional ability and quality of life and how the HHN may 
integrate self-management teaching into the established home care visit. A 
review of the literature and discussion of self-management interventions for the 
FM patient is presented. A summary of the case study and proposed clinical 
implications is offered.

Norway.

AIM: To identify critical aspects of nursing competence to care for older 
patients in the context of municipal in-patient acute care.
BACKGROUND: An increasingly complex and advanced primary healthcare system 
requires attention to the extent of nursing competence in municipal services. 
However, competence in complex and advanced care settings must be explored using 
perspectives which acknowledge the complexity of nurses' performance.
DESIGN: A phenomenological hermeneutic, qualitative approach with individual 
in-depth interviews was used. COREQ reporting guidelines have been applied.
METHODS: A sample of eight nurses and two physicians employed in municipal 
in-patient acute care units (MAUs) were purposively recruited to participate. 
Data were collected between May and June of 2017. Analysis and interpretation 
were conducted systematically in three steps: naïve reading, structural analysis 
and comprehensive understanding.
FINDINGS: Two main themes were revealed. The first was the following: "The 
meaning of the individual nursing competence" including the themes "Having 
competence in clinical assessments, decision-making, and performing 
interventions"; "Having competence to collaborate, coordinate and facilitate"; 
and "Being committed." The second was the following: "The meaning of 
environmental and systemic factors for nursing competence," included the themes 
"Having professional leadership"; "Having a sufficiently qualified staff"; and 
"Working in an open, cooperative and professional work environment."
CONCLUSION: Individual nursing competence in MAUs should include the capability 
to detect patient deterioration and to care for older patients in a holistic 
perspective. In addition, the professional environmental culture, supportive 
leadership and systemic factors seemed to be crucial to success.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study illustrates the nurses' 
responsibility for older patients' safety and quality of care in the MAUs. These 
findings can act as a foundation for the development and adaptation of 
educational programmes to accommodate requirements for nursing competence in 
MAUs. The broad perspective of nursing competence can give directions for 
quality improvements in MAUs.

Healthy ageing is a multi-dimensional concept which appertains to all older 
adults. This study reviewed the intervention characteristics, intervention 
content and effectiveness of multi-dimensional healthy ageing interventions 
(MHAIs) addressing physical, mental and social health among independent 
community-dwelling older adults. A search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, 
Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO for studies published from Jan 2007 to October 
2016. 18 publications were included, accounting for 15 studies. The review 
reflected the complexity, variations and methodological considerations of 
developing a comprehensive MHAI. It demonstrated the possibility of integrating 
person-focused to environment-focused content topics in future MHAIs, beyond the 
physical, mental and social health dimensions. Among the reviewed studies, 
health education programs reported improvements in quality of life and life 
satisfaction while health assessment and education programs promoted positive 
health behaviors. Future MHAIs studies need to employ more robust research 
methods and greater contextual information reports to build stronger evidence 
base.

Being a spectator in ambiguity-Family members' perceptions of assisted bodily 
care in a nursing home.

Sweden.

AIM: The aim of this study was to explore family members' perceptions of 
assisted bodily care in a nursing home.
BACKGROUND: Many older people living in nursing homes need assisted bodily care, 
provided by assistant nurses. This means exposedness, as the assistance is often 
provided under stress, but also brings pleasure. Family members, who may wish to 
and often benefit from continuing to provide assisted bodily care, are perceived 
as visitors and are expected to relinquish the assisted bodily care to the 
assistant nurses.
DESIGN: This study has a qualitative design with a phenomenographic approach.
METHODS: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews (n = 13) with 
family members of older people who were aged > 80, permanently living in a 
nursing home, suffering from multimorbidity, and in daily need of assisted 
bodily care. The data were analysed using a phenomenographic method.
RESULTS: Three categories of description presenting an increasing complexity 
were identified. The family members perceived that assisted bodily care is built 
upon a respect for the older person's self-determination, practically supported 
by assistant nurses, and complemented by family members.
CONCLUSIONS: In the family members' perceptions, assisted bodily care signifies 
ambiguity, as they find themselves balancing between the older persons' need for 
self-determination and need for help, and, further, between their trust in the 
assistant nurses' skills and their own perceived inadequacies in intimate 
assisted bodily care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Policies that address the family members' role in 
nursing homes are needed. Furthermore, time for collaboration is needed for 
assistant nurses to inform and explain care decisions, become aware of the 
family members' perceptions of their situation and learn from them.

BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to incorporate information about older people in 
pre-licensure nursing programs, there are inconsistent results from studies 
examining student nurses' perceptions towards the aging population. There is 
research suggesting that healthcare settings and nursing practice is 
perpetuating negative perspectives towards older people.
OBJECTIVE: To gain an understanding of how social contexts are influencing 
student nurses' experiences when learning to work with older people.
DESIGN: Descriptive case study guided by the theoretical framework of social 
learning theory.
SETTING: A university in Western Canada that offers a pre-licensure nursing 
program.
PARTICIPANTS: 28 student nurses and 13 faculty in the nursing program.
METHODS: Participant interviews and focus groups were conducted with nursing 
faculty and students.
RESULTS: Key findings from this study are that students' previous experiences 
with older people, through family or work experiences, and their first clinical 
experience in long- term care negatively influenced their perceptions about 
working with older people. Clinical nurses and faculty influenced students' 
perceptions about nursing practice with older people, sometimes in subtle ways, 
underscoring that students are learning from what they see and hear in practice. 
Students were ill-prepared for the complexity of the aging population, 
particularly those with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Learning activities that engage students in active learning, such 
as simulation, providing students with a positive lexicon of how to describe 
older patients, and more overt attention to the perspectives students and 
faculty bring to the learning environment need to be carefully explored. 
Meaningful learning experiences with older people in multiple contexts are 
needed to thoughtfully plan how to disrupt negative perceptions that might 
emerge through the nursing education program.

AIM: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many 
family care partners are involved in making help-seeking choices. The aim of 
this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with 
dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care 
possible while still maintaining their own dignity.
METHODS: Data were collected in 2009-2010 in open semi-structured interviews and 
follow-up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with 
dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design 
based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an in-depth data 
analysis.
RESULTS: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three 
specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the 
dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity 
as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in 
terms of excuses and justifications.
CONCLUSION: This study provides an important insight into the connection between 
different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity 
behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with 
dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better 
understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the follow-up of 
policy for older people.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of the fundamentals of care for 
people with a cancer diagnosis, from diagnosis to after adjuvant treatment.
BACKGROUND: More focus is needed on the experience of people living with cancer, 
as current cancer care more emphasises on independence and resilience without 
fully acknowledging that there will be moments in the cancer journey where 
patients will need "basic nursing care" to manage their symptoms and care 
pathways.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of qualitative data.
METHOD: Secondary thematic analysis of interview data from 30 people with a 
diagnosis of breast (n = 10), colorectal (n = 10) or prostate (n = 10) cancer 
was undertaken.
RESULTS: The findings revealed vivid descriptions of the fundamentals of care 
(i.e., basic needs) and participants described physical, psychosocial and 
relational aspects of the delivery of care. Both positive (e.g., supportive and 
kind) and negative (e.g., humiliating) experiences related to the relationship 
with the healthcare professionals were re-counted and affected the participants' 
experiences of the fundamentals of care. Participants' accounts of their 
fundamental care needs were provided without them identifying who, within the 
healthcare system, was responsible for providing these needs. Specific nursing 
interventions were seldom described.
CONCLUSION: Some people with a cancer diagnosis have to strive for help and 
support from the nursing staff to manage to regain control over their recovery. 
Nurses in cancer care need to focus on the patients' fundamental care needs to 
optimise their patients' recovery.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Cancer patients require support with their 
fundamental care needs and nurses need to be more aware of this and integrate it 
into the caring relationship. It is imperative that the complexity of the 
nurse-patient relationship is acknowledged and that models of care which honour 
this complexity are used.

AIM: To examine the factors and complexity that account for physical restraints 
use and their alternatives as nurses' protect the safety of older adults.
BACKGROUND:  Research on physical restraints has repeatedly shown the human, 
financial and work costs associated with their use, but their use continues to 
be a major quality issue across hospitals and across countries for older 
persons.
METHOD: Interviews with medical surgical nurses in a Midwestern hospital in the 
United States were recorded and interpreted using grounded theory.
RESULTS: Using data that described the complexity of initiating, maintaining, or 
discontinuing restraints, we captured the density of these processes and showed 
how nurses made decisions about restraint use. The tasks carried out to protect 
the older person's safety often involved using restraints or their alternatives 
and these tasks then set in motion a cascade of other types of tasks or work, 
e.g., diagnostic, comfort, articulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The study extended the work on chronic illness trajectories and 
formulated a framework for understanding the complexity of the use of restraints 
and their alternatives. Using a tracing approach we were able to predict the 
types of situations that would most likely result in the initiation, maintenance 
and discontinuation of restraints or the use of alternative procedures.
RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: The study has identified a process of 'safety work' that 
identified the risk associated with the problem, the work to cope with the 
problem and risk, the conditions that influenced the process and the 
consequences or outcomes of the work strategies to maintain the older person's 
safety.

Wales, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: The number of adults with congenital heart disease has increased with 
improvements in surgical and medical management, posing a challenge for regional 
and rural settings, which might have difficulties accessing specialised 
professionals with congenital heart disease services. This study aims to 
ascertain the demographics and management of adults with congenital heart 
disease seen by a cardiology practice in regional Australia to better understand 
the needs of regional adults with congenital heart disease.
DESIGN: A descriptive study using data from clinical notes collected between 
April 2013 and April 2016.
SETTING: A private cardiology practice in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales. The 
practice has a treating cardiologist, senior sonographer, visiting 
cardiothoracic surgeon and visiting paediatric cardiologist.
PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred-and-one adults with congenital heart disease (age: 
16-88 years; 55 women).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Congenital heart disease defect, lesion severity, 
referral reason, past surgery, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac surgery during 
the study, mortality, adherence with follow-up plans and specialist referral.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients had simple congenital heart disease, 24 had 
congenital heart disease of moderate complexity and 11 had congenital heart 
disease of great complexity. Most were referred for surveillance, seven were 
referred due to pregnancy and eight were new diagnoses. Six patients died, nine 
had cardiac operations and five were treated for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. Overall adherence to the treating cardiologist's follow-up plans 
was 84%. All patients with congenital heart disease of great complexity were 
referred to congenital heart disease specialists.
CONCLUSION: A substantial number of patients had complex pathology, new 
diagnoses or required surgery, highlighting the importance of developing 
integrated services with the close support of outside specialists in managing 
adults with congenital heart disease in regional settings.

University of Exeter, Exeter, England.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the process of implementing an oral care 
intervention in nursing homes in a Danish municipality.
BACKGROUND: Older people with aged natural dentition require preventive and 
curative oral health care. An intervention based on principles of situated 
learning was implemented to establish closer cooperation between dental and 
nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to improved oral hygiene in nursing home 
residents.
DESIGN: An embedded multiple-case study combined with principles of realist 
evaluation unfolded in three phases: Formulation of initial programme theory, 
Testing and Refining the programme theory. The COREQ checklist is followed in 
reporting.
METHODS: Observations, six group interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with 
dentists, dental practitioners, nursing home managers, care professionals and 
residents were conducted in three nursing homes (n = 41).
RESULTS: Three main outcomes of a programme theory were identified, relating to 
(a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) interdisciplinary 
working, in the form of professional pride in performing sufficient oral care; 
(c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased interdisciplinary 
knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the creation of 
relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care professionals as 
well as nursing home management taking responsibility for structure, planning 
and knowledge sharing.
CONCLUSION: The situated learning perspective supported residents and care 
professionals' competencies in performing sufficient oral care. The shared oral 
care intervention supports an individual and multidisciplinary assessment of 
nursing home residents' ability to self-care concerning oral care. Contextual 
factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms influence the intervention's 
success.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding the complexity within 
interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and unravelling the necessary 
properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health care are areas of 
improvement for care service in nursing homes.

Caring for the older person with cognitive impairment in hospital: Qualitative 
analysis of nursing personnel reflections on fall events.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore nurse and nursing assistant reflections on the 
care of older patients with cognitive impairment who have experienced a fall.
BACKGROUND: While there are evidence-based clinical guidelines for the 
prevention and management of falls and for the care of older people with 
cognitive impairment, the falls rates for older people with cognitive impairment 
are three times as high as those without.
DESIGN: Critical incident technique.
METHODS: Eleven registered and two enrolled nurses and four assistants in 
nursing working in one subacute and two acute wards within two hospitals of a 
tertiary level health service in south-east Queensland. Individual 
semistructured interviews focused on two past events when a patient with 
cognitive impairment had fallen in hospital: one when there was minimal harm and 
the second when there was significant harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken. 
The COREQ checklist was followed.
RESULTS: Three themes emerged from 23 reflective accounts of fall events: 
"direct observation is confounded by multiple observers" and "knowing the person 
has cognitive impairment is not enough," and "want to rely on the guideline but 
unsure how to enact it." While participants were aware of the falls prevention 
policy and techniques available to prevent falls, the implementation of these 
was challenging due to the complexity of care required by the older person with 
cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Falls prevention for older people with cognitive impairment is 
complex and belies the simple application of policy.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: To reduce falls, nurses can involve the family 
to support "knowing the patient" to enable prediction of impulsive actions; 
shift the focus of in-service from lectures to specific case presentations, with 
collaborative analysis on person-focused strategies to prevent falls in older 
people with cognitive impairment; and reconsider the sitter role from simple 
observer to assistant, focused on ambulation and supporting independence in 
activities of daily living.

The chaos of hospitalisation for patients with critical limb ischaemia 
approaching major amputation.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To illuminate the hospital experience for patients and 
families when major amputation has been advised for critical limb ischaemia 
(CLI).
BACKGROUND: CLI creates significant burden to the health system and the family, 
particularly as the person with CLI approaches amputation. Major amputation is 
often offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked 
deterioration of an ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced 
mobility, intractable pain, infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of 
clinical outcome data on CLI and amputation exists internationally, little is 
known about the patient/family-centred experience of hospitalisation to inform 
preservation of personhood and patient-centred care planning.
DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative study using Heideggerian phenomenology.
METHODS: Fourteen patients and 13 family carers provided a semistructured 
interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation followed, a second 
interview (6 months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients and seven 
family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and 
transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed.
RESULTS: Hospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of 
chaos, characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile 
body and fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift 
within uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation 
and unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages 
(multiple stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful 
decision-making in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic 
process occurring within a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the 
care complexity and burden of family advocacy.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A coordinated, interprofessional response should 
improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation scheduling and 
discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a sense of 
safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should be 
actively facilitated.

In a context of economic crisis and policies to reduce the public deficit, the 
budgets of the Catalan Health Institute (CHI) were cut by 15.33% between 2010 
and 2014.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the perceived impact on nurses' work conditions of measures 
to contain health spending.
METHOD: The study design was descriptive and transversal. A sample of 1,760 
nurses from the province of Barcelona answered a questionnaire on the perceived 
impact of health spending containment measures implemented in their workplace 
during the early years of the crisis.
RESULTS: Among the main aspects of the perceived impact of these measures, 86.6% 
of the nurses identified a pay cut and an increase in the following relevant 
parameters of their working conditions: number of hours worked (66.7%), final 
ratio of treated patients (35.2%), task complexity and workload (75.3%), 
rotation through various departments (31.5%), work shifts (21.4%) or work areas 
(23.4%), job insecurity (58.4%) and loss of employment by dismissal (6.6%) or 
non-renewal of contract (9%).
CONCLUSIONS: The perceived impact of the crisis showed a triple negative 
component: Pay cut, work overload and job insecurity. As a combined effect of 
this multiple trend, the nurses acknowledged a deterioration in their working 
conditions and quality of working life.

AIM: Provide insight into the concept of stress in the context of challenging 
behaviour of nursing home residents with dementia and its causes and 
consequences.
BACKGROUND: Challenging behaviour is frequent in residents with dementia, but 
consequences for nursing staff are unclear.
INTRODUCTION: Challenging behaviour of residents can be enervating for nurses 
and may lead to stress. Although stress in general is associated with negative 
outcomes, an overview of stress in this context would be a welcome addition to 
the field.
METHOD: Concept analysis according to Walker and Avant.
RESULTS: Identified antecedents of stress: physical and verbal aggression, 
conflicts, excessive demands and being unresponsive (residents), age, 
experience, tenure, nursing level and training (nursing staff). Defining 
attributes: disturbed homoeostasis and the personal appraisal of the situation. 
Identified consequences regard health, psychological aspects and behaviour.
DISCUSSION: Intervening in the identified factors may contribute to prevention 
of stress in nursing staff.
LIMITATIONS: Given a lack of strong empirical studies, our analysis is not based 
on a high level of evidence and needs to be tested. Papers from before 1990 
might have been missed.
CONCLUSION: The concept analysis revealed that nursing staff stress in the 
context of challenging behaviour may result from resident and nursing staff 
factors. Besides health and psychological consequences, behavioural consequences 
can enormously impact the well-being of residents.
IMPLICATIONS: Application in daily care to support teams in influencing resident 
and nursing staff factors could prevent stress, for instance using behavioural 
management training or recruiting higher educated nursing staff. Given the 
increasing complexity of care, creating specialized units with specifically 
trained staff for different groups of people with dementia may be desirable.

and Graduate Studies Co-ordinator, Cardiff Metropolitan University.

Ancient remedies in wound care have been used for millennia and are now being 
rediscovered; in particular, the use of honey. The purpose of this study was to 
capture and explore the meanings that participants assign to their lived 
experiences when using medical-grade honey to treat wounds. Six participants 
were recruited from a Lindsey Leg Club support group. Semi-structured interviews 
were conducted and the verbatim transcriptions were analysed using 
interpretative phenomenological analysis. Two themes were identified: 
experiences of using medical-grade honey and perceptions of honey as a natural 
folkloric medicine. This study revealed the complexity of using medical-grade 
honey to treat wounds and highlights patients' experiences and perceptions. The 
findings are reviewed and discussed in relation to the literature and 
implications for further research and clinical practice are suggested.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the health/functioning of the older adult who consumes 
psychoactive substances through the International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability and Health, considering the theory of complexity.
METHOD: Qualitative case study, with 11 older adults, held between December 2015 
and February 2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, using interviews, documents 
and non-systematic observation. It was approved by the ethics committee. The 
analysis followed the propositions of the case study, using the complexity of 
Morin as theoretical basis.
RESULTS: We identified older adults who consider themselves healthy and show 
alterations - the alterations can be exacerbated by the use of psychoactive 
substances - of health/functioning expected according to the natural course of 
aging such as: systemic arterial hypertension; depressive symptoms; dizziness; 
tinnitus; harmed sleep/rest; and inadequate food and water consumption. Final 
consideration: The assessment of health/functioning of older adults who use 
psychoactive substances, guided by complex thinking, exceeds the accuracy limits 
to risk the understanding of the phenomena in its complexity.

Patients with lung cancer who undergo surgery may potentially be cured. The 
resulting pathological staging gives an indication of 5-year survival and 
whether further treatment is recommended. To date, there is little research 
evidence regarding the way potential recurrence is communicated to patients by 
staff. This qualitative research used case studies to explore how information 
disclosure about possible recurrence was managed following lung cancer surgery 
and aimed to identify practice implications for clinical teams. Twelve patients 
were recruited and first postoperative surgical and subsequent oncology or 
follow-up consultations were recorded and transcribed. The perspective of the 
professionals involved in these clinics was ascertained through 30 in-depth 
interviews. Key themes in the data were identified using Framework Analysis. 
Recurrence risk was communicated to patients in a number of ways and levels of 
clarity and openness. Information provided by participants about early warning 
signs of recurrence varied. Findings indicate information provided was linked to 
the patient's prognosis and individual professionals' underlying communication 
approach. This study provides a unique insight into the views of lung cancer 
specialists regarding information disclosure and reveals the challenging nature 
and complexity of discussing recurrence following lung cancer surgery.

of people with dementia concerning the management of their care recipients' 
functional disabilities, and their experiences and opinions of using mobile 
health (mHealth) applications in health information seeking.
BACKGROUND: Functional disability is a significant problem among people with 
dementia and management can be challenging for family carers. Evidence suggests 
that mHealth applications can support knowledge needs of patients and families.
DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive exploratory study.
METHODOLOGY: In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 
family carers using a semi-structured interview guide. An inductive thematic 
analysis method was used. The COREQ reporting guideline was followed.
RESULTS: Five spousal and five child carers participated in this study. Four key 
themes were identified: (a) Challenges faced that contribute to psychological 
distress and burden; (b) Essential role of support systems in dementia care; (c) 
Information and educational needs of family carers, and (d) Experiences and 
attitudes of mHealth applications as an educational and supportive resource.
CONCLUSION: Providing functional care is demanding, challenging and stressful, 
and leads to carer burden. The complexity of dementia is a barrier in the 
organisation of functional care and access to a support network is vital to care 
provision. The information needs of family carers can potentially be addressed 
through an mHealth application.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study provides important information on 
family carers' needs, and the barriers and challenges related to functional care 
for people with dementia. Findings from this study can assist nurses and other 
health professionals in the planning of educational and supportive programs for 
family carers. Furthermore, the use of mHealth applications could positively 
contribute to the delivery of these programs.

UK. m.dunham@shu.ac.uk

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To synthesise current evidence about the experience of 
older people with cancer pain and consider how exploration of this may inform 
clinical practice and research.
BACKGROUND: Cancer is more prevalent in older age. Evidence suggests that older 
people's pain is generally under-recognised and under treated. Pain is a 
significant concern for many people living and dying with cancer and may be of 
particular concern for older people who may have complex biopsychosocial needs. 
There is mounting evidence that older people and their families experience high 
level of unmet need generally and suboptimal pain in particular.
DESIGN: Narrative literature review.
METHOD: A comprehensive search of five electronic databases was undertaken 
between the years 1996-2010 inclusive. Inclusion criteria were primary research 
papers relating older peoples' experiences of cancer pain, incorporating the 
verbal report or narrative account of experience of cancer.
RESULTS: Seventeen papers met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Three 
major themes emerged from the literature: (1) emotional experience identified by 
older people with cancer pain, (2) effects of pain on life and living, and (3) 
how communication affects the experience or expression of cancer pain including 
subthemes of validating, trust and cultural effects on the communication of 
pain.
CONCLUSION: There is limited research about older people's cancer pain from the 
perspective of the person experiencing the pain. This review highlights the need 
for further research into living and dying with cancer pain which incorporates 
the unique and individual experience of older people.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding the complexity and nature of older 
people's cancer pain experience should inform appropriate effective care that 
improves quality of life and promotes independence and dignity. Culturally 
sensitive training in communication may enhance understanding of the needs of 
older people with cancer pain.

Cognitive Reserve and Physical Function in Older African-Americans.

Talley CH, Talley HC.

This study examined the relationship between cognitive reserve and 
physicalfunction in older African-Americans. The concept of cognitive reserve 
postulates that aspects of life experience (e.g., education, occupational 
complexity, leisure activity, and socioeconomic status) may provide cognitive 
reserve, in theform of a set of skills or repertoires, that allow some people to 
cope better than others with illness and alter the clinical expression of 
decline in functional status. This study used a descriptive correlational 
design. Physicalfunction was assessed with the SF-36 (physicalfunction 
subscale). The mean scorefor the SF-36 PF subscale was 47 (SD = 10), indicating 
that the participants had good physical functioning. Physical function was 
associated with occupational complexity, educational attainment, and income. The 
study provides baseline data about the relationship between cognitive reserve 
and physicalfunction.

Older women, intimate partner violence and mental health: a consideration of the 
particular issues for health and healthcare practice.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a 
history of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of 
mental health.
BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and 
well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate 
partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women 
has not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence 
to address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older 
women's experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental 
health issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole.
DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic synthesis of qualitative evidence.
METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search 
included articles published up until the end of December 2015.
RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence exerts a 
significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner 
violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the 
boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both 
within the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and 
practice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of 
intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of 
evidence of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being 
of those who experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with 
intimate partner violence, there are specific implications and health 
professionals and service providers need to be aware of these.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and healthcare professionals are 
professionally accountable for the effective management and support of women who 
have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they are able to understand 
and identify the possible complexity of presentations of abuse and this includes 
older women.

The complexity and cost of diabetes care are barriers to a free health clinic 
attempting to provide quality care to uninsured patients. The alphabet strategy 
intervention was selected to increase the number of patients with diabetes 
receiving care according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines because 
it is simple and cost-effective. The project results revealed statistically 
significant increases in clinic uptake of diabetes education, blood pressure 
interventions, proteinuria, glucose control measurement and intervention, eye 
exams, and foot exams. The findings may be useful to other free health clinics 
attempting to provide quality care to their patients with diabetes.

Charleston Area Medical Center (Mss White, Payne, and Hardway), Charleston, West 
Virginia.

Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly 
frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 
trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission 
of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model 
enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity 
patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly 
trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs 
led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored 
to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP 
(TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 
1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP 
cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the 
TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per 
admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p = .016). A 
significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were 
discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a significantly lower 
percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 
51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in 
substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution. Future 
research will focus on examining the association of positive outcomes with 
specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current practice 
model.

lmbellury@gmail.com

The intersection of ageing and cancer in the phase of post-treatment 
survivorship represents a large and growing population with unique needs.
PURPOSE: The goal of this work is to review and integrate the current 
gerontology and oncology literature relevant to elderly cancer survivorship, to 
identify knowledge gaps and research opportunities and to propose a conceptual 
model to guide future research. The long-term, global goal is the prevention of 
morbidity and mortality in elderly cancer survivors by identification of 
vulnerable elders, maintenance of independence, tailoring of treatment, 
establishing intervention guidelines and planning for necessary resources within 
the entire trajectory of cancer survival for older survivors.
METHODS: Targeted and integrative review of selected literature from multiple 
disciplines. Search engines included PubMed, article reference lists and 
internet searches for epidemiological data (US Census, World Health 
Organization, American Cancer Society, Canadian Cancer Cancer Society, etc).
RESULTS: A conceptual model that incorporates the gerontologic, oncologic and 
personal characteristics of older cancer survivors is proposed that may provide 
a comprehensive approach by which to frame elderly survivorship research.
CONCLUSION: Cancer survivorship among the elderly is quantitatively and 
qualitatively different from cancer survivorship among other age groups. The 
current large numbers and predicted increase in elderly cancer survivors in the 
near future mandate attention to this population. Future research must consider 
the complexity of intersecting needs in the gero-oncology population.

Our cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of cognitive impairment among 
people living with HIV (PLWH) aged 60 years or older. The sample, composed of 
250 PLWH, was recruited from 2 clinics in Hunan, China. Structured 
questionnaires guided face-to-face interviews, including items addressing 
demographic characteristics, regimens of antiretroviral therapy, and cognitive 
status as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Findings revealed 
cognitive function of this population was significantly lower than that of 
uninfected individuals based on historical comparisons; 87.2% (n = 218) of PLWH 
in our study had cognitive impairment. Global cognitive function as well as the 
domains of language and orientation decreased with age. Global cognitive 
function was associated with sex and education, but not with antiretroviral 
therapy regimens. These findings support an urgent need to include routine 
screening for cognitive function in older PLWH and the need to consider the 
complexity of the evaluation process.

High-reliability organizations (HROs) demonstrate unique and consistent 
characteristics, including operational sensitivity and control, situational 
awareness, hyperacute use of technology and data, and actionable process 
transformation. System complexity and reliance on information-based processes 
challenge healthcare organizations to replicate HRO processes. This article 
describes a healthcare organization's 3-year journey to achieve key HRO features 
to deliver high-quality, patient-centric care via an operations center powered 
by the principles of high-reliability data and software to impact patient 
throughput and flow.

High complexity chronic heart failure management programmes: programme 
characteristics and 12 month patient outcomes.

Oldland E, Driscoll A, Currey J.

Chronic heart failure management programmes (CHF-MPs) have been developed to 
improve, clinical outcomes in response to the high burden of disease from 
chronic heart failure (CHF). Programmes vary in model, duration, complexity of 
interventions and incorporation of evidence-based guidelines for programme 
delivery. Few studies have explored patient outcomes at 12 months from enrolment 
in a CHF. The aim of the current study was to explore the characteristics and 
clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in four high complexity CHF-MPs at 12 
months after initial enrolment. A secondary aim was to explore the adoption of 
key evidence-based CHF management strategies in these programmes. After ethics 
approval, a multisite mixed methods design was implemented incorporating survey 
and chart audit. Programme characteristics and interventions used in four 
CHF-MPs were surveyed in Stage 1. Stage 2 involved a chart audit of patients 
enrolled in the programmes (N = 135) on or after the 1/1/07. Primary endpoints 
were all-cause hospitalisation and/or mortality at 12 months. Data were analysed 
using descriptive and inferential statistics. All programmes implemented a high 
complexity of evidence-based interventions consistent with national guidelines. 
However, documentation of New York Heart Association functional class was rare; 
limiting quantifiable evaluation of response to therapy throughout programme 
enrolment. The majority of patients (73%) had severe systolic heart failure with 
high co-morbidities reflected in a mean Charlson's total co-morbidity score of 3 
(± 2.1). The high rate of baseline evidence-based, pharmacothe- rapy 
(beta-blocker: 86%, n = 112 and ACE inhibitor: 76%, n = 103) was maintained at 
12 months (71% and 84% respectively). At 12 months all cause hospitalisation 
and/or mortality was 57% (n = 77). The CHF-MPs in this study implemented complex 
evidence-based interventions resulting in high rates of key medication 
prescription. However, despite the implementation of several evidence-based 
interventions, over a period of 12 months, more than half of the patients were 
rehospitalised or died.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem. The purpose of this 
qualitative study was to describe nephrology nurses' experiences in assessing 
and managing pain in patients who were receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 
outpatient units within a tertiary care institution. Semi-structured interviews 
were conducted with seven nurses, and a thematic analysis was used to analyze 
data. Themes emerged related to the complexity of pain assessment and management 
in these patients, who were often elderly. Nurses had to ascertain whether the 
pain was related to hemodialysis treatment, renal failure, or comorbidities. 
Nurses described managing pain within the context of the hemodialysis unit, and 
this required working as a team. Nurses also described the need for a palliative 
approach in patient care.

BACKGROUND: Old age-based discrimination is observed as the most tolerated 
prejudice in society and has also been witnessed in healthcare institutions.
AIMS: The aim of this study is to explore age-based discrimination in healthcare 
institutions as perceived by seniors and students of Medicine and Nursing.
RESEARCH DESIGN: A multi-method study design, by involving a triangulation 
design.
PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: A purposeful sample of individuals aged 65+ 
(n = 80) and medical and nursing students (n = 100) in the eastern region of 
Poland.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical approval of the research protocol was received 
from the Ethics Committee at the Medical University of Lublin.
FINDINGS: 'Old age' was perceived by groups of participants based on three 
themes: (a) positive, (b) negative and (c) neutral connotations. The negative 
connotations predominated. The beginning of old age was defined by the metric of 
age and described by showing the complexity of the ageing process involving 
subjective, objective and societal aspects. Experience of age discrimination in 
healthcare institutions was reported by 24 (30%) seniors and witnessed by 47 
(47%) students surveyed and for both groups occurred mainly at the hospital 
level and by physicians. Only 48 students (48%) declared a willingness to work 
with the older people in the future, and barriers were reported at the personal 
and professional levels, and also in some visions of older people.
CONCLUSION: The conceptualization of old age as reported by seniors and students 
mainly carried negative connotations, reflecting the profoundly based 
stereotypes within society regarding the older people. Seniors have reported 
being exposed to ageism and have witnessed ageism episodes in HCIs; also, 
students have faced ageism episodes during their clinical education. There is a 
need for ethical education within medical and nursing courses to shape positive 
attitudes towards the older people. A positive vision of ageing should be 
promoted not only among young people but also among adults and older people to 
avoid self-stereotyping of older people and seeing old age from negative 
perspective.

The six dimensions of wellness and cognition in aging adults.

Strout KA(1), Howard EP.

Author information:
(1)Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA. kelley.a.strout@gmail.com

OBJECTIVE: Examine how wellness in six dimensions (occupational, social, 
intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual) protects cognition in aging 
adults.
BACKGROUND: cognitive impairment increases with age. Baby boomers represent a 
significant percent of the population at risk for cognitive impairment. 
Cognitive impairment has a negative impact on nursing resources, health care 
finances, patient mortality, and quality of life. Wellness and prevention is one 
focus of Institute of Medicine's vision for the future of nursing.
METHOD: Literature was retrieved from Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature and MEDLINE. Research that examined the affect of wellness in 
each of the six dimensions on cognition in older adults was included.
RESULTS: One or more of the following may protect cognition in aging: midlife 
occupation complexity, marriage, social networks, formal education, intellectual 
activities, physical activity, healthy nutrition, motivational ability, purpose 
in life, and spirituality.
CONCLUSION: Wellness in one or more of the six dimensions may protect cognition 
in aging. The cognitive protective benefits may increase when wellness in more 
than one dimension is demonstrated. High wellness in one dimension may protect 
cognition by compensating for low wellness in another dimension. The 
interconnectedness of each of the dimensions signifies the importance of 
evaluating older adults holistically. Wellness throughout the life span may 
result in improved cognition in aging.
APPLICATION: Future research is needed to examine the relationship between the 
six dimensions of wellness and cognition, and to determine if one dimension of 
wellness is a significant predictor of cognitive health in aging adults.

The prison population is aging at an alarming rate and many older persons have 
the potential to develop dementia while in prison. This case report aims to 
explore the needs of older people living with dementia in prison and discusses 
the interventions that exist to address these needs. As the condition 
progresses, persons with dementia become increasingly reliant on the support of 
others for their health and well-being because of the increasing complexity of 
physical healthcare and psychosocial needs. Very few interventions are cited in 
the research literature regarding the use, acceptability, and/or effectiveness 
of programming for people living with dementia in prison. To support the unique 
and complex needs of these persons, research is needed to guide the development 
of evidence-informed dementia programs and services as well as consideration of 
interdisciplinary collaboration with community organizations.

BACKGROUND: The patient satisfaction rate is considered a challenge for nurse 
leaders, especially among patients with cancer, due to the complexity of the 
disease, diagnostic procedures, and treatment.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of structured nurse 
leader rounds (NLRs) on satisfaction with nursing care among patients with 
cancer. Moreover, we assessed the relationship among NLRs, patient satisfaction, 
and demographical variables.
METHODS: A two-group posttest design was used in four adult inpatient oncology 
units in a specialized oncology center. A stratified random sampling technique 
was utilized to select 169 patients for the experimental group (80 patients) and 
control group (89 patients). Structured leader rounds were conducted by nurse 
leaders using a scripted nurse leader tool to standardize the rounds in the 
experimental group, while the unstructured leader round was conducted in the 
control group. Patient satisfaction was measured using the Patient Satisfaction 
with Nursing Care Quality Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that there was a significant difference in total 
score of patients' satisfaction between study groups (t = -9.213, p > .001). 
Conversely, the structured leader round has a significant impact on the 
patient's experience with nurse concern and caring (t = -2.054, p = .042).
CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of a structured NLR has a significant impact on improving 
patient satisfaction in an oncology setting where patients receive care from 
many disciplines, such as surgical, medical, radiotherapy, and radiology.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Efficient structured NLRs of nursing professionals are 
important for enhancing the quality of nursing care and patient satisfaction.

A paucity of research has explored the older adult's experience of falling in 
the hospital. Understanding the central concepts associated with a fall while 
hospitalized is essential for further fall prevention research and practice. The 
purpose of this paper is to describe the process of selecting a theoretical 
framework to guide a qualitative study exploring the older adult's experience of 
falling while hospitalized. An analysis of six established illness 
self-management theories and models from nursing and psychology was conducted 
using Walker and Avant's framework for theory analysis. The Health Belief Model 
was selected as the most appropriate theoretical framework, as it entails 
concepts applicable to the experience of falling and captures the complexity of 
the phenomenon of inpatient falls, which is important for nursing.

Cyprus.

Individualized nursing care, a form of person-centered care delivery, is 
accepted as best practice, yet its implementation into actual care is far from 
complete. Appropriate measures of this elusive concept are needed to better 
understand barriers to implementation. This study explored and tested the 
convergent validity and the reliability of 2 individualized nursing care 
measures. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data using the 
Individualized Care Scale and the Individualized Care Instrument (ICI) from a 
sample of nurses (n = 263, response rate 71%) working in older peoples' care 
settings in Finland, and the data were analyzed statistically. Cronbach's alpha 
coefficients for the ICI scales (.63-.80) and ICS-A and B subscales (both α = 
.91) demonstrated only moderate correlation between the 2 instruments (r = -.39 
to .50) and possibly the complexity of measuring "individualized care." The 
study acknowledges the latent influence of culture and care approach to the 
conceptualization of individuality. It concludes that the concept may best be 
measured at this point with the use of other factors in addition to instruments 
to capture its multiple domains.

We examined whether women who had regular jobs throughout life performed better 
cognitively than older adult housewives. Linear regression was used to compare 
global cognitive performance scores of housewives (G1) and women exposed to work 
of low (G2) and high (G3) complexity. The sample comprised 477 older adult 
Brazilian women, 430 (90.4%) of whom had performed lifelong jobs. In work with 
data, the G2 group's cognitive performance scores were 1.73 points higher (p 
=.03), and the G3 group scored 1.76 points (p =.02) higher, than the G1. In work 
with things and with people, the G3 scored, respectively, 2.04 (p <.01) and 2.21 
(p <.01) cognitive test points higher than the G1. Based on our findings we 
suggest occupation of greater complexity is associated with better cognitive 
performance in women later in life.

The complexity of pain assessment in older people.

Gregory J(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Manchester.

Pain is common in older people and its assessment is an important part of the 
nurse's role. Asking people about their pain is considered the most accurate and 
reliable assessment because of the subjective nature of pain. A number of simple 
and easy-to-administer self-rating scales are available to measure pain 
intensity. To rate their pain, however, people need to understand the request, 
as well as recall and interpret the painful signal. Observing specific 
behaviours associated with pain is advocated when communication and cognitive 
function are impaired, for example, in people with advanced dementia. A number 
of pain assessment tools have been developed that involve observation of some or 
all of the behaviours. The aim of this article is to highlight the importance of 
pain assessment, discuss the various pain assessment scales and tools available 
and identify some of the factors that can make comprehensive assessment of pain 
in older people and those with cognitive impairment complex.

BACKGROUND: Older adults are more susceptible to water imbalance and ensuring 
they drink sufficiently is a complex and challenging issue for nurses. The 
factors that promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older 
people from drinking are not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the complexity of issues associated 
with the hydration and hydration care of older people.
DESIGN: A qualitative study using multiple methods.
SETTINGS: Two healthcare sites providing care for older people in the South West 
of England: a hospital ward in a major hospital and a care home providing 
personal and nursing care.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one older people aged 68-96 years, were recruited to the 
study from the hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older 
people to participate were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion 
criteria were being unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or 
distressed to take part in the study. The staff participants of nurses and 
health care assistants totalled 21. The inclusion criterion for staff was any 
nurse or health care assistant providing hydration care. Seven friends or 
relatives participated by making anonymous comments via a suggestion box 
available to all friends and relatives.
METHODS: Data were collected via interviews with older people, focus group 
discussions involving staff, suggestion box comments made by friends and 
relatives and twelve hours observation of hydration practice. The data were 
analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to 
promote drinking including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in 
older people's hands and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their 
experience of drinking was diminished by a variety of factors including a 
limited aesthetic experience and a focus on fluid consumption rather than on 
drinking as a pleasurable and social experience.
CONCLUSION: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with drinking were 
lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social interaction was 
underplayed in both settings. Hydration practice which supports the individual 
needs of older people is complex and goes beyond simply ensuring the consumption 
of adequate fluids.

BACKGROUND: Risk-stratified care management requires knowledge of the complexity 
of chronic disease and comorbidity, information that is often not readily 
available in the primary care setting. The purpose of this article was to 
describe a population-based approach to risk-stratified care management that 
could be applied in primary care.
METHODS: Three populations (Medicaid, Medicare, and privately insured) at a 
regional health plan were divided into risk-stratified cohorts based on chronic 
disease and complexity, and utilization was compared before and after the 
implementation of population-specific care management teams of nurses.
RESULTS: Risk-stratified care management was associated with reductions in 
hospitalization rates in all three populations, but the opportunities to avoid 
admissions were different.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of population complexity is critical to the development 
of risk-stratified care management in primary care, and a complexity matrix can 
help nurses identify gaps in care and align interventions to cohort and 
population needs.

OBJECTIVE: Persons seeking cancer genetic counseling mainly aim to obtain 
information and certainty about their medical situation. However, the 
information that counselees receive often involves many uncertainties. To 
develop strategies to enable optimal communication about uncertainties, the 
spectrum of uncertainty expressed within cancer genetic counseling needs to be 
established. This study aimed to gain insight into the uncertainties verbally 
expressed by counselors and counselees.
METHODS: Twenty-five consultations were audiotaped, transcribed and 
qualitatively analyzed. A coding scheme identifying all uncertainties was 
developed parallel to the coding of the transcripts.
RESULTS: Several uncertainties were identified varying in their source (i.e. the 
cause of uncertainty) and the issues involved (i.e. the topic to which 
uncertainty pertained). The main sources of uncertainty were the 
unpredictability of the future and a lack of knowledge. Counselees also 
expressed uncertainty related to the amount and complexity of the information. 
Counselors expressed uncertainties mainly related to scientific issues, whereas 
counselees' uncertainty mainly related to personal and practical issues.
CONCLUSION: A wide range of uncertainties was expressed by both groups. 
Counselors differ from counselees in the degree and types of uncertainty they 
express.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Counselors should address scientific uncertainties during 
genetic counseling to increase awareness and understanding in counselees.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether seniors consolidate their home medications or if 
there is evidence of unnecessary regimen complexity.
METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 200 community-dwelling 
seniors >70 years in their homes. Subjects demonstrated how they took their 
medications in a typical day and the number of times a day patients would take 
medications was calculated. A pharmacist and physician blinded to patient 
characteristics examined medication regimens and determined the fewest number of 
times a day they could be taken by subjects.
RESULTS: Home medication regimens could be simplified for 85 (42.5%) subjects. 
Of those subjects not optimally consolidating their medications, 53 (26.5%) 
could have had the number of times a day medications were taken reduced by one 
time per day; 32 (16.0%) reduced by two times or more. The three most common 
causes of overcomplexity were (1) misunderstanding medication instructions, (2) 
concern over drug absorption (i.e. before meals), and (3) perceived drug-drug 
interactions.
CONCLUSION: Almost half of seniors had medication regimens that were 
unnecessarily complicated and could be simplified. This lack of consolidation 
potentially impedes medication adherence.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health care providers should ask patients to explicitly 
detail when medication consumption occurs in the home.

Perceptions of adults with overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain: 
An interpretative phenomenological analysis.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the lived experience of adults with 
overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Knowledge gained will 
inform healthcare professionals about the complexity of the weight-pain 
relationship and enable more effective engagement with this population.
BACKGROUND: Quantitative studies show links between weight and pain. Adults with 
overweight/obesity are more likely to experience comorbidity; however, 
qualitative research describing the complexities of the relationship is limited.
METHODS: A purposive sample of adults with overweight/obesity and chronic 
musculoskeletal pain participated in face-to-face interviews. Interviews were 
audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretive 
phenomenological analysis.
RESULTS: Eighteen adults (16 female) aged 29-71, body mass index ≥25-46, 
participated in this study. Three superordinate themes emerged: "pain as a 
motivator and barrier to weight loss"; "fear of weight causing more damage"; and 
"activity is positive." Pain motivates some individuals to lose weight while 
simultaneously inhibiting weight loss efforts. Participants' perception that 
extra pressure caused by their weight further damaged joints contributed to fear 
and catastrophising. Fear is often exacerbated by healthcare professionals' 
descriptions of musculoskeletal damage, or participants' perception of 
healthcare professionals' attitude towards people with overweight/obesity. 
Conversely, individuals acknowledged the benefits of increased activity.
CONCLUSION: Adults with overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain in 
this study identified a bidirectional relationship between their weight and pain 
that challenged their weight loss efforts. Overweight/obesity contributed to 
fear and catastrophising, which resulted in avoidance of exercise that would 
have assisted their weight loss.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals need to understand the 
complex relationship between weight and pain, and their patients' understanding 
of that relationship. Healthcare professionals should use therapeutic 
communication to reduce the fear of weight causing damage, and thus promote 
physical activities that will contribute to weight loss. It is also important to 
ensure that the language used with this patient group does not stigmatise 
individuals, or cause or exacerbate fear of normal movement.

Elder abuse remains a significant problem nationally and globally. Early 
definitions of abuse, however, oversimplified the phenomena and while the 
complexity of elder abuse, in nature and scale, has also been growing recently 
there remains some confusion conceptually and in practice in terms of what is 
meant by and can be identified as abusive practice. The lack of conceptual 
clarity is evident across professional and agency boundaries. The authors 
suggest that a potential way forward is through the development of 
interprofessional learning as an integral part of education and training in 
respect of safeguarding older adults. This article highlights a number of 
complexities in the context of safeguarding and raises areas for further 
reflection and possible debate.

Cancer patients' experiences of communicating and dealing with their older 
parents: A qualitative study.

Primary Care, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

PURPOSE: In 2017 almost 25,000 Belgians between 40 and 60 years (38% of new 
diagnoses) were diagnosed with cancer. With increasing life expectancy the 
chance augments that these patients still have older parents alive. This implies 
that oncology care should also take into account the impact cancer may have on 
(the relationship with) older parents. The purpose of this study was to explore 
how cancer patients communicate and deal with their older parents during the 
illness trajectory.
METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 cancer patients. 
Interview transcripts were analysed using the principles of the constructivist 
Grounded Theory Approach.
RESULTS: Depending on the situation, the time frame and the person the patients 
are talking about, cancer patients oscillate between perspectives (I, They and 
We). A common denominator in all three perspectives is silence fuelled by 
different forms of solicitude (self-protection and other-protection). This 
solicitude underpins the cancer patients' communicative behaviours and ways of 
relating towards their parents.
CONCLUSIONS: Present findings underline the importance of health care providers 
considering the often hidden complexity of giving information and talking about 
feelings. Nurses' strategies must be designed not to harm the existing mechanism 
of solicitude and the diligent management of the patients' relationship with 
their parents. Conversations about functionality of avoiding certain topics and 
the impetus behind certain communicative patterns should be put forward instead 
of consensually advising open communication.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to better understand how beliefs influence medication 
adherence in asthma.
METHODS: All participants were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid for a 
diagnosis of asthma. Each participant completed a survey consisting of: Beliefs 
about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire 
(B-IPQ) and Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). Adherence 
to inhaled corticosteroids was elicited using the Medication Adherence Report 
Scale (MARS). Multiple linear regression with interaction effects was used to 
identify significant predictors of medication adherence and interactions between 
beliefs.
RESULTS: A total of 198 participants completed the survey. The mean(±SD) MARS 
score was 19.2(±4.5). A multivariable model (adjusted R2 = 0.39) predicted 
adherence using: age, asthma hospitalisation, timeline (B-IPQ) subscale, 
necessity and concern (BMQ) subscales, doctor (MHLCS) subscale and the two 
interaction effects (concerns [BMQ] moderated by chance [MHLCS] and treatment 
control [B-IPQ] moderated by understanding [B-IPQ]).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of 
the role of beliefs in medication adherence in asthma. Certain beliefs 
meaningfully interrelate and change the relationship they have with medication 
adherence.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: If these beliefs are causally related to medication 
adherence and can be intervened upon, the findings are useful for providing 
targets to personalise adherence support.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore endometrial cancer patients' perceptions of the 
disease and the influence of favourable prognoses on their experiences.
BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is associated with favourable prognoses, which 
may imply that patients experience distress to a lesser extent than other cancer 
patients with less positive treatment outcomes. However, most people with cancer 
report reduced quality of life and, despite endometrial cancer being prevalent 
worldwide, experiences of the disease have been little explored.
DESIGN: Ethnographic fieldwork with participant observations and interviews.
METHODS: Observations during clinical consultations at two Danish hospitals and 
interviews with women with endometrial cancer (n = 18) over a period of 
6 months. The article adheres to the COREQ guidelines for reporting qualitative 
research.
RESULTS: We identify how patients consider cancer in general very likely to be 
fatal, while clinicians in contrast characterise endometrial cancer specifically 
as "good" because of favourable prognoses. We employ the concept of bricolage to 
illustrate how bits and pieces of biomedical knowledge and statistical evidence 
become intertwined with patients' past experiences and subjective ways of 
knowing, suggesting that patients' perceptions of endometrial cancer as a 
disease are somewhat dynamic.
CONCLUSIONS: Public stories and everyday life experiences of cancer provide a 
central framework for illness perceptions. As a result, patients retain the idea 
of a close connection between cancer and death, while also adopting the notion 
of endometrial cancer as "good". This influenced how women responded to 
treatment and care. Framing endometrial cancer as "good" is not always helpful, 
as the impact of a cancer diagnosis per se is rarely favourable.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In providing women with endometrial cancer with 
optimal support through diagnosis and treatment, clinicians should attend to the 
complexity of patients' illness understandings and be aware that assuring 
patients of a good prognosis not always has the expected impact.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) dyadic self-care science is advancing rapidly, as 
evidenced by recent theoretical work, literature reviews, and multiple empiric 
studies. Typologies, once considered archaic, are now viewed as person-oriented 
classification systems that allow a whole-system view of information patterns. 
This whole-system view is particularly needed to understand complex tasks like 
dyadic HF self-care.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to review the initial conceptualization 
of an HF care dyadic typology and the present advances in our thinking and 
suggest future directions for this clinically relevant classification system.
CONCLUSIONS: Development and testing of the typology across 5 studies resulted 
in a well-characterized, pragmatic and parsimonious, person-oriented 
classification system for understanding how patients and informal caregivers 
conduct patients' HF self-care at home. The 4 types are characterized as 2 
individually oriented types-type I, patient oriented; type II, caregiver 
oriented; and 2 relationally oriented types-type III, collaboratively oriented; 
and type IV, incongruently oriented. We have devised a single-item measure of 
typology group that can be assessed in the clinical setting. Once this 
information is ascertained, the clinician can personalize the plan of care to 
the realities of the dyad.
IMPLICATIONS: Dyads that disagree on who is responsible for self-care may forego 
or delay action, resulting in self-care failures with subsequent HF advancement, 
hospitalization, and mortality. As the HF dyadic self-care science has advanced, 
we have come to appreciate the complexity that arises when 2 individuals work 
together on 1 complex task-HF self-care.

A concept analysis of individualized aging.

Cline DD.

AIM: This analysis sought to define the concept of individualized aging.
BACKGROUND: The growing older adult population and shortage of health 
professionals with adequate knowledge of their specialized needs will strain the 
health care system. The National League for Nursing's Advancing Care Excellence 
for Seniors (ACES) project has addressed this challenge. The ACES framework 
identifies three unique concepts integral to delivering high quality care. 
Clarification of these concepts is needed for educational and research purposes.
METHOD: Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used.
RESULTS: The analysis identified two antecedents (past experiences and 
biological aging processes), three attributes (heterogeneity, living with 
age-related changes and multiple chronic conditions, and risk for 
complications), and two consequences (complexity of care over time and 
variability in health outcomes).
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the antecedents, attributes, and consequences of 
individualized aging will allow health care providers to improve the care of 
older adults.

Workplace Health and Safety Hazards Faced by Informally Employed Domestic 
Workers in the United States.

Informally employed domestic workers encounter a range of workplace hazards, 
though these have been poorly documented and are typically left unacknowledged. 
Safety concerns include exposure to toxic cleaning products, a high prevalence 
of ergonomic injuries, and inadequate access to medical care. Presenting the 
results of an in-person survey of 2,086 informally employed nannies, 
housecleaners, and caregivers in 14 U.S. cities, this article documents the 
range of common health and safety hazards faced by domestic workers and suggests 
some interventions that could improve their working conditions. The survey was 
conducted in nine languages and data were collected from workers from 71 
countries, including a substantial proportion with irregular immigration status. 
We observed that substandard workplace health and safety conditions are shaped 
by three aspects of domestic work: long-standing exclusions from federal 
employment protections, the common disregard of the home as a workplace, and the 
complexity of care work and the bonds of intimacy that often form through 
caregiving. Together these factors have served to perpetuate substandard working 
conditions. Regulatory reforms, as well as worker and employer education, are 
necessary to improve health outcomes for domestic workers.

Characteristics and Correlates of Caregivers' Perceptions of Their Family 
Members' Memory Loss.

BACKGROUND: Understanding caregiver's perceptions of their family member's 
memory loss is a necessary step in planning nursing interventions to detect and 
address caregiver burden.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize caregivers' perceptions 
of their family members' memory loss and identify potential correlates within 
Leventhal's common sense model (CSM).
METHODS: This secondary analysis used baseline data from a larger randomized 
controlled trial. Patients with memory loss and their caregivers (N = 83 dyads) 
from the community were included. The adapted Brief Illness Perception 
Questionnaire (BIPQ) assessed caregivers' illness perceptions. Eight additional 
instruments measured correlates within the CSM. Responses were described; 
multiple linear regression was used to predict BIPQ dimension scores, and 
logistic regression was used to predict dichotomized BIPQ scores.
RESULTS: Most caregivers were female, White, and spouses of the patients; they 
reported a range of perceptions on the nine BIPQ dimensions. Patients' cognitive 
function consistently emerged as a significant correlate of caregivers' illness 
perceptions, explaining the most variance in caregivers' perceived consequences, 
identity, and treatment control (p < .01). Caregivers' reactions to patients' 
behavioral symptoms and caregivers' trait anxiety were associated with perceived 
illness coherence (p < .01). Caregivers with higher severity of daily hassles 
and White caregivers perceived that their family members' memory loss would last 
longer (p < .001).
DISCUSSION: Caregivers' perceptions of family members' memory loss varied; 
distinct dimensions of caregivers' illness perception were associated with a 
range of clinical and psychosocial factors. This exploratory study demonstrates 
the complexity of applying the CSM to caregivers of persons with memory loss.

Activity-limiting pain is common among older home care patients and pain 
management is complicated by the high prevalence of physical frailty and 
multimorbidity in the home care population. A comparative effectiveness study 
was undertaken at a large urban home care agency to examine an evidence-based 
pain self-management program delivered by physical therapists (PTs). This 
article focuses on PT training, methods implemented to reinforce content after 
training and to encourage uptake of the program with appropriate patients, and 
therapists' fidelity to the program. Seventeen physical therapy teams were 
included in the cluster randomized controlled trial, with 8 teams (155 PTs) 
assigned to a control and 9 teams (165 PTs) assigned to a treatment arm. 
Treatment therapists received interactive training over two sessions, with a 
follow-up session 6 months later. Additional support was provided via emails, 
e-learning materials including videos, and a therapist manual. Program fidelity 
was assessed by examining PT pain documentation in the agency's electronic 
health record. PT feedback on the program was obtained via semistructured 
surveys. There were no between-group differences in the number of PTs 
documenting program elements with the exception of instruction in the use of 
imagery, which was documented by a higher percentage of intervention therapists 
(p = 0.002). PTs felt comfortable teaching the program elements, but cited time 
as the biggest barrier to implementing the protocol. Possible explanations for 
study results suggesting limited adherence to the program protocol by 
intervention-group PTs include the top-down implementation strategy, competing 
organizational priorities, program complexity, competing patient priorities, and 
inadequate patient buy-in. Implications for the implementation of complex new 
programs in the home healthcare setting are discussed.

The complexity of older adults' social support networks.

Chaichanawirote U, Higgins PA.

The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed snapshot of the diversity of 
social support networks of 95 independent-living older adults (mean age = 76). 
Participants in the convenience sample were recruited from senior centers and a 
retirement community. Using the Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule and 
egocentric network analysis, participants' networks are described in terms of 
patterns, density, size of positive networks (available and utilized), size of 
negative networks (available and utilized), support need, and support 
satisfaction. Each participant and the identified members of his or her network 
were considered a complex adaptive system. Network boundary was 7 members; 
average network size was 6.22 members (SD = 1.50); network density was moderate 
(mean = 0.53, SD = 0.33); positive interaction networks were larger than 
negative networks; and overall, participants reported moderate support need 
(mean = 2.5, SD = 0.7) and high support satisfaction (mean = 5.9, SD = 1.0).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and factors associated with constipation in 
adult critical care patients.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Intensive care unit (ICU) of a high-complexity hospital from November 
2015 to October 2016.
PATIENTS: Adults who were hospitalized for at least 72h in the ICU were followed 
from their admission to the ICU until their departure.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the 157 patients followed up, the incidence of 
constipation was 75.8%. The univariate analysis showed that constipated patients 
were younger, used more sedation and showed more respiratory and postoperative 
causes for hospitalization, while non-constipated patients were hospitalized 
more for gastrointestinal reasons. The use of vasoactive substances, mechanical 
ventilation and haemodialysis was similar between the constipated and 
non-constipated patients. Multivariate analysis, days of use of 
docusate+bisacodyl (HR: .79; 95% CI: .65-.96) of omeprazole or ranitidine (HR: 
.80; 95%CI: .73-.88) and lactulose (HR: .87; 95%CI: .76-.99) were independent 
protection factors for constipation.
CONCLUSION: Constipation has a high incidence among adult critical care 
patients. Days of drug use acting on the digestive tract (lactulose, 
docusate+bisacodyl and omeprazole and/or ranitidine) are able to prevent this 
outcome.

BACKGROUND: Mid- to late-stage dementia is often characterized by behavioural 
and psychological symptoms, including, but not limited to physical and verbal 
aggression.
INTRODUCTION: Although there is a considerable research about the prevalence, 
aetiology, and management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, 
there is limited research about the experience of caring for people with such 
symptoms in long-term aged care facilities.
AIM: The aims of the study were to describe: (i) nurses' experiences of caring 
for people with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in long-term 
aged care facilities, and (ii) strategies nurses used to deal with these 
symptoms.
METHODS: A qualitative exploratory and descriptive design, involving focus group 
interviews with 30 nurses from three long-term aged care units in Australia. The 
transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis.
RESULTS: The findings revealed five interrelated themes: (i) working under 
difficult conditions, (ii) behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: 
an everyday encounter, (iii) making sense of behavioural and psychological 
symptoms of dementia, (iv) attempting to manage behavioural and psychological 
symptoms of dementia, and (v) feeling undervalued.
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the difficult conditions under which nurses 
worked and the complexity of caring for individuals who have behavioural and 
psychological symptoms of dementia.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Organizational efforts to enhance 
the quality of care for individuals with behavioural and psychological symptoms 
of dementia in long-term aged care facilities should extend beyond staff 
education to heed nurses' concerns about organizational barriers to 
interpersonal care.

AIM: The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of 
community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on 
symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive 
geriatric assessment.
BACKGROUND: Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a 
high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting 
to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a 
single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with 
multimorbidity.
DESIGN: Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory 
Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT).
METHODS: Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial 
Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at 
baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group 
received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive 
geriatric assessment in addition to usual care.
RESULTS: Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over 
time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 
2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent 
and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in 
the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found 
between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or 
trajectory of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a 
persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at 
an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the 
burden of symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Carers of patients with palliative care needs require careful 
assessment and support to undertake their role effectively. The carer component 
of palliative care is embedded in complex situations that necessarily focus on 
the patient.
AIMS: To explore experiences of specialist palliative care nurses in 
identifying, assessing and planning care to support those looking after patients 
with palliative care needs.
RESULTS: Findings identified gaps in identifying carers and their role, and in 
assessing carers' needs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the complexity in assessing carers' needs 
within the palliative care context, that practice gaps exist and positive 
outcomes result when routine processes were adopted. Future research should 
explore how to systematically make improvements in supporting carers in all 
palliative care contexts, including specialist and non-specialist settings.

Sciences, Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Thunder Bay, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Tube feeding (TF) is frequently prescribed for adults admitted to 
acute care facilities to prevent or ameliorate malnutrition, yet little is known 
about patients' needs and experiences with receiving this therapy. Patients' 
perspectives regarding the factors influencing their experiences, as well as 
their information and support needs, are required to inform healthcare 
providers' (HCPs') patient-centered practices.
METHODS: Based on an interpretive description qualitative approach, 12 
unstructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with participants admitted 
to acute care hospitals in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.
RESULTS: Analysis of data revealed variations in participants' perceptions of 
the necessity for TF and the discomfort resulting from this therapy. Perceived 
necessity was influenced by interrelated themes: the meaning of TF (beyond 
necessity), the trust held in HCPs, and the resilience of participants in 
response to all that they were experiencing. Collectively, these findings are 
encompassed within the central theme, phrased as a question, about the 
experience of TF: "A necessary evil?" Participants' answers to this question 
revealed the nature of their overall response throughout TF therapy (ie, 
indifferent, resistant, relieved, or tolerant).
CONCLUSIONS: The range of perceptions and the complexity of patients' 
experiences during TF revealed in the data can inform HCPs' patient-centered 
approaches to TF care. Assessing and incorporating patients' values, beliefs, 
needs, and goals into, and exploring their choices in, nutrition care planning 
can promote resilience in response to TF therapy. HCPs may then well enhance 
patients' comfort and overall experience with TF therapy.

Network.

St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London.

Thousands of patients live with urinary catheters and the potential 
complications deriving from long-term use. Disjointed community services may 
result in patients attending the emergency department (ED) to manage catheter 
complications.
AIM: to conduct a service review of catheterised patients attending the ED of a 
large London hospital; to describe incidence, reasons for attendance and cost to 
inform future planning for out-of-hospital care.
METHOD: a catheter collaborative, consisting of multidisciplinary health 
professionals and patients, formulated survey questions. Patients were 
identified from the electronic patient record by searching for the code 
'urological complaint'. One month of clinical records were retrospectively 
reviewed and analysed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: 287 patients attended the department with urological complaints: 41 
(14%) had urinary catheter problems, of these 24 (59%) patients were discharged 
and 17 (41%) were admitted for further treatment. Stays in ED varied from 1 hour 
13 minutes to 17 hours (mean = 4.8 hours). A total of 9 patients (38%) were sent 
home during antisocial hours (9 pm to 7 am), 4 patients were discharged between 
midnight and 2 am. Patients admitted had mean stays of 4.11 days. Most 
admissions were short term for intravenous (IV) treatments; 3 patients were 
hospitalised for 20 days. A total of 14 patients (34%) were diagnosed with 
catheter-related infections: 11 (79%) had bladder infections and 3 (21%) had 
septicaemia. All 14 patients (100%) had urine-culture-confirmed infections, 
mainly from coliform, proteus and pseudomonas species. A total of 20 patients 
(49%) received antibiotic treatment. The majority of patients received an 
initial IV dose followed, where required, by oral treatment on discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: many catheterised patients had complex needs with high rates of 
urinary infections and admissions for urosepsis. High attendance related less to 
old age but more to complexity of history, such as neurological conditions and 
disability. Only a proportion of these patients could be safely treated by 
district nurse teams. A significant proportion would require more responsive 
community services with several spells of short-term input (e.g. daily or more 
than once-daily visits) and access to diagnostics, microbiology, pharmaceutical 
input and IV treatments.

The aim of our study was to assess the incidence of pain flare and the 
effectiveness of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in pain management of 
patients with bone oligometastases. We evaluated 48 patients accounting for 54 
treatments. The Edmonton Classification System for Cancer Pain (ECS-CP) was 
applied to identify indicators of treatment-resistant pain, in patients with 
active pain (NRS ≥ 2) at baseline. Statistical analysis was performed to 
identify predictors of pain flare and pain control. Pain flare occurred in 38% 
of treated patients (n = 18/48): No correlation was found between pain flare and 
patient- or treatment-related variables. In the subset of patients with active 
pain at baseline (n = 23), pain control was obtained in 62% of patients at 
1 year; median time to pain progression after SBRT was 29 months (CI95% 
6-52 months). Presence of ≥2ECS-CP features was correlated with earlier pain 
progression (4 vs. 30 months, p = 0.012). Pain flare occurred in 38% of cases 
irrespectively of steroid premedication and dose regimen. In patient with 
baseline active pain, durable pain control was obtained. Presence of ≥2 
complexity indicators at the ECS-CP assessment was correlated with impaired pain 
control and may deserve future investigation in prospective studies.

Less is known about the experiences of older adults (65+ years of age) with 
co-occurring mental health and alcohol and other drug use disorders (dual 
diagnosis) than is known about the experiences of their younger counterparts. 
This exploratory qualitative study sought to interview individuals receiving 
case management from an inner Melbourne community mental health service to 
determine their experiences of living with dual diagnosis and explore their 
interactions with mental health and addiction treatment, and general medical 
services alike. Six older adults with a dual mental health and substance 
disorder agreed to participate in a semi-structured interview process and 
provided their perspectives about living with complex mental illness and alcohol 
and other drug use. Several key themes emerged throughout the interview process, 
mirroring the notion of dual diagnosis being a complex phenomenon involving a 
number of interrelated factors: these include medical complexity, poor service 
engagement and long-term use of alcohol and other drugs. Interviews also 
demonstrate the challenges inherent in providing care to this cohort, with the 
participants frequently describing their experiences with services as being 
fraught with difficulty. The increased understanding of the perspectives of 
older adults with dual diagnosis provides the foundation for further research 
into this population in addition to influencing future nursing care provided to 
this cohort.

Complexity of Care: A Concept Analysis of Older Adult Health Care Experiences.

Cline DD.

PURPOSE: To define the term complexity of care.
BACKGROUND: The aging population and lack of gerontological preparation in 
pre-licensure nursing programs are pressing issues. The NLN Advancing Care 
Excellence for Seniors (ACE.S) project developed a framework to facilitate 
faculty and student understanding of older adults' care needs. Integral to the 
framework is the concept of complexity of care.
METHOD: Rogers and Knafl's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used.
RESULTS: The analysis identified three antecedents (focus on treatment and cure 
of disease, multiple comorbidities, and life experiences and culture), five 
attributes (polypharmacy, use of advanced technologies, novel care models, a 
fragmented health care system, and the relational nature of caregiving), and two 
consequences (impact on quality of life and impact on quality of care).
CONCLUSION: Defining the concept of complexity of care will facilitate student 
understanding of the unique health care needs of older adults.

(2)Oregon Health and Science University.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To use dyadic analyses to identify determinants of patients' 
and family members' perceptions of the positive and negative aspects of the 
decision-making process in families living with lung cancer.  .
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.  .
SETTING: Community setting in Greater Portland, Oregon. .
SAMPLE: 109 family care dyads (patient and family member) recruited from a 
statewide cancer registry.  .
METHODS: Surveys were completed in-person, separately, and privately by each 
member of the family care dyad. Secondary analysis was completed using 
multilevel modeling.  .
MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Negative and positive aspects of the decision process. 
 .
FINDINGS: Level 1 data revealed significant variability across care dyads' 
positive or negative perceptions of the decision-making process. Level 2 results 
for negative perceptions of decision making indicated that patient and family 
member perceptions were significantly associated with their own depressive 
symptoms and feelings of not being listened to by others. Level 2 results for 
positive perceptions of decision making indicated that patient and family member 
perceptions were significantly inversely associated with their own feelings of 
not being listened to and being in nonspousal relationships. In addition, family 
members' perceptions were more positive when the patients were older.  .
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the complexity of the decision-making 
process in families with lung cancer, and underscored the importance of the care 
dyad feeling listened to by family members in the context of life-threatening 
illnesses.  .
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses assisting families with decisions about lung 
cancer should be aware of the dynamics of the care dyad and how the decision 
process is perceived by patients and their family members.

Transforming emergency services for frail older people in hospital.

Thompson D(1), Rumley-Buss M, Conroy S.

Author information:
(1)Acute Frailty Network, London.

Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a 
difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and 
the likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we 
improve services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also 
changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this 
in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to 
meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles 
that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can 
be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver 
better outcomes for patients.

Chemotherapy at home: keeping patients in their "natural habitat".

[Article in English, French]

Crisp N, Koop PM, King K, Duggleby W, Hunter KF.

Escalating cancer rates and an increase in the complexity and duration of 
chemotherapy regimens have brought the issue of cancer treatment at home to the 
forefront. For the participants of this study, home chemotherapy was offered as 
a potential treatment choice. Ten patients who accepted home chemotherapy were 
interviewed using the methodology of interpretive description. They shared their 
experiences of receiving chemotherapy at home, and identified home as being a 
"natural habitat" in which they were better able to adapt to their 
circumstances. Patients were able to redistribute their resources including 
time, energy, and finances in ways that were meaningful to them. They felt the 
care provided was enhanced and they were more receptive to teaching. Lastly, 
participants viewed themselves as being less ill and better able to cope with 
their treatments. Given the results of this study and other research available, 
chemotherapy at home should be considered an option for patients with cancer.

Influence of Teamwork on Health Care Workers' Perceptions About Care Delivery 
and Job Satisfaction.

Dahlke S, Stahlke S, Coatsworth-Puspoky R.

The aim of the current study was to examine the nature of teamwork in care 
facilities and its impact on the effectiveness of care delivery to older adults 
and job satisfaction among health care workers. A focused ethnography was 
conducted at two care facilities where older adults reside. Analysis of 
interviews with 22 participants revealed perceptions of teamwork and 
understandings about facilitators of and barriers to effective teamwork. 
Participants indicated that team relationships impacted care provided and job 
satisfaction. Participants also identified trust and reciprocity, communication, 
and sharing a common goal as critical factors in effective teamwork. In 
addition, participants identified the role of management as important in setting 
the tone for teamwork. Future research is needed to understand the complexity of 
supporting teamwork in residential settings given the challenges of culture, 
diversity, and individuals working multiple jobs. [Journal of Gerontological 
Nursing, 44(4), 37-44.].

BACKGROUND: Patient-related complexity of nursing care in acute care hospitals 
has increased in recent years, in part due to shorter hospital stays and the 
increase in multimorbid patients. However, little research has been conducted on 
how nurses experience complex nursing care situations.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of how nurses 
experience complex nursing care situations in Swiss acute care hospitals.
METHODS: This qualitative study utilised focus group interviews and thematic 
analysis. Focus groups facilitate different perspectives of the topic. Thematic 
analysis is suitable for the analysis of everyday stories. Participants were 24 
Registered Nurses with experience in their field, from four Swiss hospitals. The 
evaluation was performed in six steps according to themes. Participation was 
voluntary. This study was part of a multicentre research project that had been 
approved by the responsible ethics committees.
RESULTS: Three main themes regarding the experience of complex nursing care 
situations were found: complexity as a challenge, complexity as an overwhelming 
burden and mediating factors. Mediating factors included time resources and 
teamwork and interprofessional collaboration as contextual conditions. 
Additionally, nurses' individual characteristics such as their professional 
experience and expertise, as well as their personal and professional values and 
beliefs were considered as mediating factors. These mediating factors may 
determine whether complex nursing care situations are experienced as challenging 
or overwhelming.
LIMITATIONS: The findings from this study are limited as only experienced nurses 
participated in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are ambivalent with regard to how they experience complex 
nursing care situations. The contextual conditions and the nurses' personal 
characteristics play a key role in whether nurses perceive complex nursing care 
situations as positive challenges or overwhelming burdens. These findings are 
important for managers, as they can support nurses to master complex nursing 
care situations.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dancing activity based on 
different dance styles, in groups as well as with a partner, on mobility 
performance, quality of life and social engagement in a sample of older adults. 
One hundred and sixty-three older adults (mean age, 70 years; SD = 4 years) 
participated in a supervised dancing activity programme for 16 weeks. The 
dancing activity included different dance routines and was progressive in terms 
of motor complexity. Data on mobility, health-related quality of life and social 
engagement were collected before and after a 16-week training period. 
Significant improvements in mobility, quality of life and social engagement were 
noted in single as well as dual-task performance after the intervention. Our 
results emphasise the benefit of a 16-week dance training on multidimensional 
features, including physical and psychosocial domains, which are important for 
successful ageing.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to examine how case managers, taking a 
holistic, patient-centered approach that is grounded in advocacy, have a crucial 
role to play in the opioid crisis response. This includes providing education, 
support, and resources to prevent misuse of and addiction to opioids prescribed 
for pain management and intervening with more resources to help combat the 
nonmedical use of prescription opioids and heroin.
PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: In addition to case managers in acute care, workers' 
compensation, and palliative care, who have frequent contact with patients who 
are prescribed opioid medications for pain management, all case managers may 
interact with patients and support systems/families who are directly or 
indirectly impacted by opioid use, misuse, and addiction.
IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: The broad scope of the opioid 
epidemic necessitates individualized interventions to address the multiple needs 
of individuals. The case manager, particularly one who is board-certified, has 
the expertise and knowledge to assess individual needs, identify treatment and 
other resources, and provide education and support to the patient and 
family/support system. In addition, given the complexity and life-or-death 
consequences associated with the opioid crisis, a timely and comprehensive 
approach is essential, bringing together multiple disciplines in health care, 
public health, addiction, pain management, social work, mental health 
counseling, pharmacology, and case management.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate nurses' use of a single parameter track and 
trigger chart to inform implementation of the National Early Warning Scoring 
tool. To report the characteristics of patients with triggers, the frequency of 
different triggers, and the time taken to repeat observations. To explore the 
barriers and facilitators perceived by nursing staff relating to patient 
monitoring.
BACKGROUND: Sub-optimal care of the deteriorating patient has been described for 
almost two decades. Organisations have responded by implementing strategies that 
improve monitoring and facilitate a timely response to patient deterioration. 
While these systems have been widely adopted the evidence-base to support their 
use is inconsistent.
DESIGN: A mixed method service evaluation was carried out in an acute University 
hospital.
METHODS: Physiological triggers (n = 263) and characteristics of triggering 
patients (n = 74) were recorded from surgical and medical wards. Descriptive 
statistics were displayed. Questionnaires were distributed (n = 105) to student 
nurses, health care assistants and registered nurses. Themes and sub-themes were 
identified from content analysis.
RESULTS: Hypotension was the most frequent abnormality. There was variability in 
the time to repeat observations following a trigger. A high proportion of 
triggers were identified in older patients, as was a trend of longer time 
intervals between trigger and repeat observations. Nurses reported a number of 
barriers and facilitators to monitoring patients including: 'workload', 
'equipment', 'interactions between staff' and 'interactions with patients'.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a number of barriers and facilitators to 
monitoring and escalation of abnormal vital signs, highlighting the complexity 
of the process and the need for a system-wide approach to a deteriorating 
patient.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The trend of longer delays following a trigger 
in older patients has not been identified previously and could reflect a 
knowledge gap of the physiological changes and response to acute illness in 
older people.

Visiting nurses' posthospital medication management in home health care: an 
ethnographic study.

Research Unit, Aalborg Universityhospital, Aalborg, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Medication management is the most challenging component of a 
successful transition from hospital to home, a challenge of growing complexity 
as the number of older persons living with chronic conditions grows, along with 
increasingly specialised and accelerated hospital treatment plans. Thus, many 
patients are discharged with complex medication regimen instructions, 
accentuating the risk of medication errors that may cause readmission, adverse 
drug events and a need for further health care.
AIM: The aim of this study was to explore visiting nurses' medication management 
in home health care after hospital discharge and to identify key elements in 
patient medication for improved patient safety.
METHOD: Inspired by the ethnographic research cycle, participant observations 
and informal interviews were conducted at 12 initial visits by a nurse in a 
patient's home after hospital discharge. Data consisted of field notes and 
photographs from the patients' homes, medication lists and medical records. 
Field notes were analysed in four steps.
FINDINGS: The analysis showed 12 stages in medication management in which nurses 
strove to adjust medication management to the patients' actual health status by 
mediating on knowledge of the patient, information to the patient and on rules 
and regulations and by establishing order in medication lists and medications in 
the home.
CONCLUSION: The nurse-patient relationship, the integration of care and the 
context of care challenged patient safety in visiting nurses' medication 
management in patients' homes after hospital discharge. The implications for 
practice were the following: to ensure nurses' opportunities to continuously 
evolve their observation skills and skills in making sound clinical judgements; 
to establish interprofessional working processes which support the continuous 
assessment of patients' needs and the adjustment of care and treatment; to 
clarify expectations to nurses' responsibility and patients' privacy.

In skilled home healthcare (SHHC), communication between nurses and physicians 
is often inadequate for medication reconciliation and needed changes to the 
medication regimens are rarely made. Fragmentation of electronic health record 
(EHR) systems, transitions of care, lack of physician-nurse in-person contact, 
and poor understanding of medications by patients and their families put 
patients at risk for serious adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to 
develop and test the HOME tool, an informatics tool to improve communication 
about medication regimens, share the insights of home care nurses with 
physicians, and highlight to physicians and nurses the complexity of medication 
schedules. We used human computer interaction design and evaluation principles, 
automated extraction from standardized forms, and modification of existing EHR 
fields to highlight key medication-related insights that had arisen during the 
SHHC visit. Separate versions of the tool were developed for physicians/nurses 
and patients/caregivers. A pilot of the tool was conducted using 20 SHHC 
encounters. Home care nurses and physicians found the tool useful for 
communication. Home care nurses were able to implement the HOME tool into their 
clinical workflow and reported improved communication with physicians about 
medications. This simple and largely automated tool improves understanding and 
communication around medications in SHHC.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To develop and psychometrically test the Essentials of 
Magnetism II in nursing homes.
BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers and complex needs of older people in nursing 
homes strain the nursing workforce. Fewer adequately trained staff and increased 
care complexity raise concerns about declining quality. Nurses' practice 
environment has been reported to affect quality of care and productivity. The 
Essentials of Magnetism II © measures processes and relationships of practice 
environments that contribute to productivity and quality of care and can 
therefore be useful in identifying processes requiring change to pursue 
excellent practice environments. However, this instrument was not explicitly 
evaluated for its use in nursing home settings so far.
DESIGN: In a preparatory phase, a cross-sectional survey study focused on face 
validity of the essentials of magnetism in nursing homes. A second 
cross-sectional survey design was then used to further test the instrument's 
validity and reliability.
METHODS: Psychometric testing included evaluation of content and construct 
validity, and reliability. Nurses (N = 456) working at 44 units of three nursing 
homes were included.
RESULTS: Respondent acceptance, relevance and clarity were adequate. Five of the 
eight subscales and 54 of the 58 items did meet preset psychometric criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: All essentials of magnetism are considered relevant for nursing 
homes. The subscales Adequacy of Staffing, Clinically Competent Peers, Patient 
Centered Culture, Autonomy and Nurse Manager Support can be used in nursing 
homes without problems. The other subscales cannot be directly applied to this 
setting.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The valid subscales of the Essentials of Magnetism II 
instrument can be used to design excellent nursing practice environments that 
support nurses' delivery of care. Before using the entire instrument, however, 
the other subscales have to be improved.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the profile of patients evaluated by Nurse Care 
Management in an Emergency Department and identify the type of alternative 
healthcare resource assigned and report the results of clinical practice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up, on admission to the Emergency 
Department in an acute hospital and on discharge from the alternative healthcare 
resource, of patients assessed by Nurse Care Management, from July to December 
2015. The patient characteristics, social environment and results of clinical 
practice were studied.
RESULTS: 190 patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 
(59.8%) cases from the Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate 
care facilities, 71 (34.8%) cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were 
referred to an acute care hospital and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to 
intermediate care were more complex, presented geriatric syndromes as their 
reason for admission and diagnosed with dementia, while those referred to home 
care presented more respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean 
Barthel Index and polypharmacy before emergency admission were higher than at 
the time of discharge from the alternative healthcare resource (p <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with advanced age, complexity, comorbidity, are 
referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary care, they are admitted 
to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other patients. After being 
discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional capacity and 
present less polypharmacy.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Heart failure is a complex syndrome in which abnormal heart 
function results in clinical symptoms and signs of low cardiac output and/or 
pulmonary or systemic congestion. Heart failure is common among long-term care 
residents, and is associated with significant morbidity and acute care 
utilisation. Heart failure guidelines endorse standard therapies, yet long-term 
care residents are less likely to receive recommended treatments. The objective 
of this study is to understand the perceptions and potential role of unregulated 
care providers in contributing to better heart failure management among 
long-term care residents.
DESIGN: Focus group interviews.
METHODS: This qualitative study employed focus groups to explore perceptions 
from 24 unregulated care providers in three Ontario, Canada long-term care 
homes, about barriers to the optimal management of heart failure.
RESULTS: Three overarching concepts emerged characterising unregulated care 
providers' experiences in caring for residents with heart failure in long-term 
care: (1) the complexity of providing heart failure care in a long-term care 
setting, (2) striving for resident-centred decision making and (3) unregulated 
care providers role enactment nested within an interprofessional team in 
long-term care. These concepts reflect the complex interplay between individual 
unregulated care providers and residents, and heart failure-related, 
socio-cultural and organisational factors that influence heart failure care 
processes in the long-term care system.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimising the management of heart failure in long-term care is 
contingent on greater engagement of unregulated care providers as active 
partners in the interprofessional care team. Interventions to improve heart 
failure management in long-term care must ensure that appropriate education is 
provided to all long-term care staff, including unregulated care providers, and 
in a manner that fosters greater and more effective interprofessional 
collaboration.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Active and collaborative engagement unregulated 
care providers has the potential to improve the management of heart failure in 
long-term care residents.

Older adults often experience functional losses during hospitalization. Clinical 
care activities have been increasingly promoted as a way to help older 
hospitalized patients offset these losses and recover from acute illness. Little 
research exists to objectively measure clinical care activities. This study 
evaluated the utility and feasibility of using the Actiheart, a combined heart 
rate monitor and accelerometer, to measure heart rate and motion (activity 
counts) during five clinical care activities. Fifty-four adults, aged 65 and 
older, scheduled for surgery, participated in a simulation of activities. The 
Actiheart successfully measured motion and heart rate during each of the five 
activities. One-way repeated measures analyses of variance showed that the 
Actiheart discriminated significant differences within and across the five 
activities. This study supports the use of an activity monitor to quantify 
clinical care activities in research studies that can be translated into 
clinical care. However, the complexity associated with data collection and 
analysis using the Actiheart could limit its direct use in clinical research.

A longitudinal study of the health status of a community of religious sisters: 
addressing the advantages, challenges, and limitations.

Gaspar PM, Bautch JC, Strodthoff CM.

Longitudinal studies are recognized as contributing to understanding the 
complexity of aging and generating insights that cannot be gained using other 
research methods. However, conducting longitudinal studies is recognized as 
challenging, especially among older adults. The purpose of the current review is 
to describe how the authors addressed the limitations and challenges of 
longitudinal studies in a study of the health status of a community of religious 
sisters. Methods of this specific longitudinal study are presented to provide 
background to the discussion. Challenges, limitations, and advantages of the 
current longitudinal study are organized into three categories (i.e., sample, 
method, and data analysis) that have been addressed in the literature as 
contributing to the fidelity of longitudinal studies. The unique characteristics 
of the current study sample, particularly their access to health care, creates a 
comparison group for the study of older women in general.

Disability intervention model for older adults with arthritis: an integration of 
theory of symptom management and disablement process model.

Shin SY(1).

Korea. Electronic address: syshin@inje.ac.kr.

To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to 
understand the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper 
aims to introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which 
to construct a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for 
Older Adults with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom 
experience, symptom management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond 
to the Theory of Symptom Management. These main concepts influence or are 
influenced by contextual factors that are situated within the domains of person, 
environment, and health/illness. It accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic 
interactions among all components within the model representing the 
comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its interventions in older 
adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some limitations such as confusion 
or complexity within the model, the Disability Intervention Model for Older 
Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it encompasses the majority of the 
concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate for the limitations of the 
two models, and aims to understand the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on a 
patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health status, socioeconomic 
status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a guiding theoretical 
framework for arthritis care and research to improve the functional status of 
older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

Ageing out of place: The meaning of home among hispanic older persons living in 
the United States.

AIM: To explore the meaning of home among older Hispanic immigrants who are 
"aging out of place."
BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence supports the concept of older persons ageing in 
place. Nurse researchers have demonstrated that older person who age in place 
have better physical, psychological and cognitive outcomes. Less, however, is 
known about older persons who are "aging out of place," meaning out of their 
country of origin. With the growth of home health care, there is a need to 
understand the older immigrants' meaning of home when ageing out of their 
country of origin.
DESIGN AND METHOD: An inductive, qualitative descriptive research design was 
used. Seventeen Hispanic participants, ranging in age from 65 to 83 years were 
interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol.
FINDINGS: Two major finding of the study focused on participants' descriptions 
of home in their country of origin and in the USA. The majority of participants 
described their home in their native country as the community, countryside or 
town (pueblo) and in the U.S.A. as family. The level of social isolation and 
loneliness among participants was evident.
CONCLUSIONS: Older Hispanic immigrants who are "aging out of place" integrate 
their past experiences of sense of place in their native country with their 
present experiences of home in the USA. The need to understand the role of the 
community and the family in the provision of nursing care in the home may be 
more important than the physical structure or setting in which it is delivered. 
Further intra- and cross-national studies are needed to provide a framework for 
understanding the issues of ageing and immigration globally.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Gerontological nurses need to recognise the 
complexity of family relationships for older Hispanic persons who are ageing out 
of place of origin and their risk of depression, social isolation, and 
loneliness.

How is continuity of care experienced by people living with chronic kidney 
disease?

Brand S(1), Pollock K(2).

Author information:

UK.
(2)School of Health Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' perceptions of continuity of care 
within a hospital-based specialist service.
BACKGROUND: Patient journeys through health care are becoming increasingly 
complex. For patients with chronic conditions, the longevity of their illness 
and common multiple co-morbidities make this complexity more pronounced. 
Continuity of care is most challenging to provide for these patients. A 
multifaceted model of continuity is widely accepted, but despite this, much 
literature focuses exclusively on relational aspects. In addition, the majority 
of the literature has focused on primary and family care settings whilst 
continuity within specialist and hospital care has not been widely researched.
DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used.
METHODS: Thirteen semi-structured interviews with patients accessing services as 
at a Renal and Transplant Unit at a UK hospital were conducted in 2014. Data 
were analysed thematically to identify commonality as well as diversity amongst 
participants.
RESULTS: Five themes of time, being known, knowledge, knowing the system and 
responsibility were identified within patient experiences of continuity. The 
multidisciplinary team was more important in relational continuity than 
literature has previously suggested. Patients' expectations in relation to 
continuity were notably different in their interactions with hospital-based 
services in comparison with community and family-based care.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients accessing specialist care services may perceive continuity 
differently to those receiving care in the community. Generic guidance concerned 
with patient experience outcomes may be difficult to implement in practice.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses and the wider healthcare team play a 
fundamental role within the provision of continuity, even in predominantly 
medically led specialist services. The differences between primary and secondary 
care in terms of patient expectation and experience should be recognised to 
ensure effective models of care are implemented which both meet patient 
expectations and improve their experience of care.

Complementary therapies in rehabilitation: stroke patients' narratives. Part 2.

van der Riet P(1), Dedkhard S, Srithong K.

Author information:
(1)School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 
Australia. Pamela.vanderriet@newcastle.edu.au

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To document the narratives of nursing staff and patients in 
a Thailand Rehabilitation Centre where complementary therapies are used and to 
discuss perceived progress of these stroke patients. Specific complementary 
therapies used at this Rehabilitation Centre include Thai massage and herbal 
therapies.
BACKGROUND: Whilst there has been a small amount of quantitative research on 
stroke patients and complementary therapies there has been no qualitative 
research on the experience of stroke patients and the use of complementary 
therapies.
DESIGN: Qualitative pilot study using narrative inquiry and discourse analysis 
framed by poststructural theory.
METHOD: Six stroke patients were interviewed about their involvement in 
complementary therapy practice and treatments and their experiences of these 
therapies in rehabilitation.
RESULTS: This study represents a reflective mining of patients' stories and 
captures the main theme of changes in stroke patients' embodiment and a main 
discourse of attending to and enabling progress. Throughout the storylines there 
are many other discourses such as hope, desire, helplessness, despair, fear, 
motivation, gratefulness, gladness and fragility.
CONCLUSION: Threaded throughout the stroke patients' stories of their 
rehabilitation there is a layering of discourses involving tensions and a 
longing to overcome their disability. There are twists and detours in their 
stories that show the complexity of the illness experience. Progress is not 
straightforward with a quick recovery. Many contexts or variables influence 
progress such as spatiality, temporality and people.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: What is offered here is the reality of the 
rehabilitation process for stroke patients. Through the use of narrative inquiry 
the contexts of people, spatiality (environment) and temporality (time) are an 
important part of rehabilitation process.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationships between optimism, 
self-efficacy, symptom distress, treatment complexity, illness appraisal, 
coping, and mood disturbance in patients with advanced-stage cancer. .
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. .
SETTING: Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven in Connecticut, an outpatient 
comprehensive cancer center. .
SAMPLE: A convenience sample of 121 adult patients with stages III-IV cancer 
undergoing active chemotherapy. .
METHODS: Participants completed common self-report questionnaires to measure 
variables. Treatment hours and visits were calculated from data retrieved from 
medical record review. Mediation and path analysis were conducted to identify 
direct and indirect pathways from the significant antecedent variables to mood 
disturbance. .
MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Dispositional optimism, self-efficacy, social support, 
treatment complexity, symptom distress, illness appraisal, coping, and mood 
disturbance. .
FINDINGS: Greater optimism and self-efficacy were associated with less negative 
illness appraisal, less avoidant coping, and decreased mood disturbance. 
Conversely, greater symptom distress was associated with greater negative 
illness appraisal, greater avoidant coping, and greater mood disturbance. In the 
final model, optimism and symptom distress had direct and indirect effects on 
mood disturbance. Indirect effects were partially mediated by illness 
appraisal. .
CONCLUSIONS: Mood disturbance resulted from an interaction of disease stressors, 
personal resources, and cognitive appraisal of illness. Avoidant coping was 
associated with greater disturbed mood, but neither avoidant nor active coping 
had a significant effect on mood in the multivariate model.  .
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Illness appraisal, coping style, and symptom distress 
are important targets for intervention. Optimism is a beneficial trait and 
should be included, along with coping style, in comprehensive nursing 
assessments of patients with cancer.

Instrument to measure health literacy about complementary and alternative 
medicine.

Shreffler-Grant J, Weinert C, Nichols E.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Health literacy is an essential skill for today's health 
care consumers. The growth in use of complementary and alternative medicine 
(CAM) adds to the complexity of being sufficiently health literate. The purpose 
of this article is to describe the initial psychometric evaluation of the 
"Montana State University (MSU) CAM Health Literacy Scale," a newly developed 
instrument to measure an individual's health literacy about CAM.
METHODS: Exploratory factor analyses, reliabilities, and conceptual 
considerations were used.
RESULTS: The outcome is a 21-item instrument with Cronbach's alpha of .753 and 
42.27% explained variance. Convergent validity assessments revealed weak but 
significant correlations between the scale and measures of general health 
literacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The MSU CAM Health Literacy Scale has promise for use in future 
research and clinical endeavors.

Clinical considerations for care of older adult cancer survivors.

Johnson W(1), Cadogan MP.

Author information:
(1)University of California Los Angeles, School of Nursing, Los Angeles, CA 
90095, USA. wajohnson@ucla.edu

The number of cancer survivors has been steadily increasing due in part to the 
aging population and advancements in cancer care and treatment. Of the current 
13.7 million cancer survivors in the United States, most are 65 or older. Aging 
changes and the presence of comorbidities add complexity to the care of cancer 
survivors. In addition. common long-term cancer-related symptoms and late 
effects of cancer treatments provide challenges to nurses and other health 
professionals caring for older cancer survivors. Transition from oncology care 
to primary or shared care requires understanding of detailed information about 
the specific cancer diagnosis, treatments received, and recommendations for 
follow-up care to prevent recurrence, recognize treatment-associated health 
effects, and understand strategies for health promotion. Nurses in all practice 
areas will care for cancer survivors and must be prepared to deliver safe and 
effective care.

Author information:
(1)Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, Nottingham. bill.varnam@nottshc.nhs.uk

AIM: The aim of this study was to determine which intervention used to assist 
people with dementia from sitting to a standing position was the most effective 
approach to aid movement.
METHOD: Focus groups were held with care and therapy staff working in dementia 
settings to find out the difficulties they encountered when helping someone with 
dementia to a standing position, and the interventions to overcome these 
difficulties. Suggested interventions were substantiated against the literature 
and efficacy of intervention attempts was recorded in a diary. Participants also 
completed a post-intervention questionnaire to establish their views on how 
results should be used.
RESULTS: Appropriate interventions led to a positive outcome for participants as 
they were able to assist people with the minimum of fuss and complexity, and for 
patients because they received the care they required. No single intervention 
emerged as being particularly effective and other factors must be considered 
when interpreting the results.
CONCLUSION: Participants agreed that interventions should be included in patient 
handling training programmes.

The U.S. population is aging, supported in part by continued development of 
life-prolonging medical therapies and technologies. These innovations, including 
kidney replacement therapies, have been effective in providing additional 
options to patients facing serious illness, but they have also introduced a new 
level of complexity in the provider assessment of treatment for these patients. 
Health care providers are being tasked to decide if medical care is appropriate 
for an aging and medically complex population, a decision complicated by a 
variety of factors. Patient-focused conversations surrounding goals of care, 
prognosis, medical futility, and quality of life need to become part of the 
routine practice pattern for nephrology care in the United States.

Perception of risk for older people living with a mental illness: Balancing 
uncertainty.

Risk is commonly defined as a negative threat which needs to be controlled and 
mitigated; as a concept, it takes high priority in contemporary mental health 
services. Health-care organizations and clinicians are now required to use 
levels of risk as a benchmark for clinical decision-making. However, perceptions 
of risk change according to the lens through which it is viewed. A qualitative, 
exploratory research study was undertaken in an aged persons' mental health 
programme in Victoria, Australia, to explore the notion of risk from the 
multiple perspectives of service providers and consumers. Data were obtained 
through in-depth interviews, and analysis was based on the framework of Ritchie 
and Spencer. Balancing uncertainty emerged as a major theme, and comprised two 
subthemes: (i) complexity of risk from the perspective of providers of services; 
and (ii) complexity of safety from the perspectives of recipients of services. 
These differences emphasize a significant disjuncture between perceptions of 
risk and the potential for the individual needs and concerns of consumers to be 
subsumed under broader organizational issues. The uncertainty this tension 
highlights suggests the need to reconceptualize risk, incorporating the views 
and experiences of all stakeholders, particularly consumers and carers, to 
enhance recovery-oriented services and facilitate consumer participation within 
mental health services.

Measuring health literacy - the Swedish Functional Health Literacy scale.

Wångdahl JM(1), Mårtensson LI.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health and Caring Science, Social medicine, Uppsala 
University, Uppsala, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of health promotion efforts vary due to a complexity of 
reasons. One possible reason for an absence of effects is the level of 
functional health literacy among the individuals that participate in the 
interventions. Thus, valid and reliable instruments that capture these kinds of 
skills are needed. The aim of this study was to develop a Swedish Functional 
Health Literacy scale to use in health promotion and health prevention by 
translating the Japanese Functional Health Literacy scale into Swedish and 
testing some aspects of its validity and test-retest reliability.
METHODS: The research project comprised six phases including translation and 
back translation, validity tests of the two first versions of the instrument 
based on interviews with professionals and representatives for the target group 
of the instrument, and a test-retest of the first version among target groups.
RESULTS: The items in the first two versions were experienced as unclear, which 
led to improvements of the next version. The final version of the translated 
instrument (the Swedish Functional Literacy scale) showed evidence of content 
validity, and the test-retest confirmed that the instrument had stability over 
time with a percentage agreement for the items ranging from 63% to 92% (M = 
77.2%).
CONCLUSION: The items in the Swedish version of the scale are equivalent to the 
original Japanese scale in terms of language and contents and cover the major 
aspects of functional health literacy as it is defined in the literature. The 
translated instrument shows stability over time, that is, reliability, at least 
for a part of the Swedish population. More validity tests of the Swedish 
Functional Health Literacy scale based on a broader population are needed.

A pre-emptive pain management protocol to support self-care following 
vitreo-retinal day surgery.

McCloud C(1), Harrington A, King L.

Author information:
(1)School of Nursing and Midwifery, Flinders University, Bedford Park, SA, 
Australia.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the development and evaluation of a pre-emptive 
and multimodal pain management protocol that aims to improve patient experiences 
following vitreo-retinal day surgery.
BACKGROUND: Vitreo-retinal surgery has been increasingly performed as day 
surgery that requires patients to undertake postoperative self-care, including 
the management of pain. While vitreo-retinal surgery is known to be painful in 
the convalescent period, pain management following day surgery has been 
described as problematic across many surgical specialties.
DESIGN: One hundred patient audit and in-depth qualitative interviews with nine 
participants.
METHODS: A pain management protocol was developed from research evidence, 
established knowledge and expert opinion, then implemented and evaluated.
RESULTS: The pre-emptive and multimodal protocol used intravenous Parecoxib in 
conjunction with regional ocular anaesthesia and oral paracetamol. Parecoxib 40 
mg was administered prior to discharge, and participants were instructed to take 
the paracetamol six hours post-regional anaesthesia. Rescue analgesia was also 
provided. Following implementation of the protocol in a single clinical site, 
low levels of pain were reported in the audited patient cohort and confirmed in 
the qualitatively explored experiences of nine participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study were encouraging, in that post 
vitreo-retinal day surgery pain appeared to have been successfully self-managed 
with a multimodal and pre-emptive protocol. The protocol was flexible and 
sensitive to patient comorbidities, surgical complexity, previous experiences 
and medical preferences. Further research is required to consolidate the success 
of this protocol to effectively support patients' self-care pain management and 
provide capacity to generalise the findings.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Knowledge developed through this clinically 
based research has the potential for informing future patient care across many 
sites where day surgery is an integral component of treatment for people with 
vitreo-retinal disease.

Predictors for postoperative recovery after colorectal cancer surgery are 
usually investigated in relation to length of stay (LoS), readmission, or 30-day 
morbidity. This study describes patient characteristics and surgery-related 
factors associated with patient-reported recovery 1 and 6 months after surgery. 
In total, 153 consecutively included patients who were recovering from 
colorectal cancer surgery reported their level of recovery using the 
Postoperative Recovery Profile. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used 
to calculate associations with recovery, defined as good or poor, divided into 
five recovery dimensions: physical symptoms, physical functions, psychological, 
social and activity. Better preoperative health predicted good recovery 
regarding three dimensions 1 month after surgery. Regarding all dimensions 
1 month after surgery, poor recovery was predicted by a poor recovery on the day 
of discharge within corresponding dimensions. Higher age was associated with 
good recovery 6 months after surgery, while chemotherapy showed negative 
associations. Overall, a majority of factors had a negative impact on recovery, 
but without any obvious relation to one specific dimension or point in time. 
Those factors were: high Body Mass Index, comorbidity, abdominoperineal 
resection, loop ileostomy, colostomy and LoS. This study illustrates the 
complexity of postoperative recovery and a need for individualised follow-up 
strategies.

Utilization and perceived benefits of hospice may vary across populations. In a 
population-based survey, we examined the prevalence of hospice utilization, 
caregiver sociodemographic characteristics, and quality and complexity of 
end-of-life (EOL) care, as reported by community caregivers to people who died 
in the prior year. The 2009 to 2010 Allegheny County, PA Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System Health Survey, a population-based telephone survey of 5442 
adult residents, included an 8-item EOL caregiver module. Overall, 7.8% (95% 
confidence interval = 7.0-8.6) of respondents reported having arranged or 
provided care for a close friend/family member who died in the previous 12 
months. Caregivers of decedents who utilized hospice reported positive quality 
outcomes and greater involvement in care. Utilization of hospice services was 
associated with beneficial outcomes at EOL, but with increased involvement of 
EOL caregivers.

Nursing care complexity in a psychiatric setting: results of an observational 
study.

Petrucci C(1), Marcucci G, Carpico A, Lancia L.

Author information:
(1)University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.

For nurses working in mental health service settings, it is a priority to 
perform patient assessments to identify patients' general and behavioural risks 
and nursing care complexity using objective criteria, to meet the demand for 
care and to improve the quality of service by reducing health threat conditions 
to the patients' selves or to others (adverse events). This study highlights 
that there is a relationship between the complexity of psychiatric patient care, 
which was assigned a numerical value after the nursing assessment, and the 
occurrence of psychiatric adverse events in the recent histories of the 
patients. The results suggest that nursing supervision should be enhanced for 
patients with high care complexity scores.

A portrait of resilience in caregiving.

Ewen HH, Chahal JK, Fenster ES.

The current study investigated biopsychosocial resilience in an older adult 
caregiver. A case study was selected for in-depth exploration of resilience in 
caregiving identified through biopsychosocial (i.e., salivary cortisol) methods. 
An exemplar of a woman caring for an adult child dying from a genetic disease is 
presented in the context of multiple stressors. Significant stress was found to 
be buffered by cognitive reframing and acceptance of interpersonal limits. Early 
experiences in caregiving for others with terminal illnesses provided a frame of 
reference, and difficult family dynamics added a layer of complexity. During 
periods identified as stressful, cortisol levels rose outside of normal bounds. 
The study implications are that mixed-methods (i.e., biopsychosocial) studies 
yield important results on individual differences within similar contexts.

Detection and management of the deteriorating ward patient: an evaluation of 
nursing practice.

Odell M(1).

Author information:
(1)Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, Reading, Berks, UK.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To audit ward nursing practice in the adherence to an early 
warning scoring protocol in the detection and initial management of the 
deteriorating ward patient and investigate factors that may impact on practice.
BACKGROUND: Hospital inpatients can experience unexpected physiological 
deterioration leading to poor outcomes and death. Although deterioration can be 
signalled in the patients' physiological symptoms, evidence suggests that ward 
staff can miss, misinterpret or mismanage the signs. Rapid response systems have 
been implemented to address this problem. The rapid response systems consists of 
two phases: the afferent phase involves monitoring the patient, recognising 
deterioration and referring to more expert help and the efferent phase involves 
expert teams assessing and treating the patient. Research has tended to 
concentrate on the efferent phase of the process and has so far failed to show a 
significant impact on patient outcome.
METHODS: Using cardiac arrest as a surrogate marker for deterioration, patient 
records were retrospectively reviewed during the 12 hours prior to the cardiac 
arrest event. Data relating to nursing practice and adherence to the early 
warning scoring protocol were extracted and analysed.
FINDINGS: The findings suggest that ward nurses' monitoring of patients' 
observations has improved compared with earlier research, but errors in early 
warning scoring and nonadherence to referral protocols are still a problem. A 
number of potentially influential factors on nursing practice were tested, but 
only deterioration occurring outside normal weekdays was associated with a 
reduced quality of nursing adherence to protocol.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of rapid response systems may have been an 
oversimplified solution to the highly complex problem of undetected patient 
deterioration. There are a multitude of contributory factors to the problem of 
noncompliance to early warning scoring protocols, and possible solutions will 
need to reflect the breadth, depth and complexity of the problem if we are to 
improve patient experience and outcome.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: An audit of nursing practice against an early 
warning scoring protocol based on national recommendations and standards in the 
recording of and response to physiological deterioration in the ward patient has 
shown that vital signs recording has improved, but early warning scoring 
accuracy and referral to more expert help remain suboptimal. By identifying 
areas of suboptimal practice, strategies for education and training and service 
development can be better informed. More in-depth evidence on factors that may 
impact the quality of nursing practice has been identified. Problems with rapid 
response systems assumptions have been highlighted, which may facilitate the 
implementation of more realistic solutions for managing the deteriorating ward 
patient.

PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Ineffective Self-Health Management 
(ISHM) (00078) and its related factors in polymedicated patients over the age of 
65 years.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. A home interview was 
conducted with each participant (N = 375) for data collection.
FINDINGS: The prevalence of ISHM was 37.3%. The risk factors associated were 
social risk, depression, noncompliance, medication errors, and confusion with 
medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Among polymedicated elderly patients, the prevalence of ISHM is 
high. The diagnosis is closely connected to the compliance and complexity of the 
treatment regimen, in addition to those relating strictly to social and 
emotional factors.
IMPLICATIONS: Nursing methodology encompasses instruments that allow nurses in 
clinical practice to evaluate the issue of compliance.

A population-based care transition model for chronically ill elders.

Hewner S.

Elders with chronic illness are hospitalized more often than those without major 
chronic disease, and nearly one-fifth of hospitalizations result in re-admission 
within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. Care transition management 
programs address chronic disease complexity to reduce unnecessary 
hospitalization, improve quality of care, and reduce medical expense. This 
report describes how informatics influenced the transformation of a regional 
managed care organization from one focused on specific chronic disease 
prevalence to one targeting population-specific chronic conditions based on 
complexity. The key implication of these results is that population-based 
informatics can amplify the impact of programs designed to improve quality and 
prevent avoidable admissions and, at the same time, speed the rate of 
translation of evidence-based interventions to entire populations. This approach 
demonstrated an effective, efficient way to translate evidence-based research to 
the Medicare population, smoothing the transition back into the community, and 
preventing avoidable hospital admissions.

Author information:

Nursing Program, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In long-term care (LTC), the complexity of residents' conditions and their 
treatment requirements present challenges for nurses managing medications. The 
purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore medication 
management as described by licensed nurses working in LTC. A total of 22 
licensed nurses from 2 LTC facilities located in the Canadian province of 
Ontario participated in 4 focus groups. Thematic content analysis was used to 
organize data into themes and a conceptual model was developed. The overarching 
theme was that nurses are "racing against time" to manage medications and 3 
subthemes described how they coped with this important care process: preparing 
to race, running the race, and finishing the race. Barriers to safe medication 
management included time restraints, knowledge limitations, interruptions and 
distractions, and poor communication. The findings can be used to better inform 
health-care providers and to guide future research. They also have the potential 
to directly impact outcomes related to safe medication management in LTC.

Sleep, mood, and quality of life in patients receiving treatment for lung 
cancer.

Dean GE(1), Redeker NS, Wang YJ, Rogers AE, Dickerson SS, Steinbrenner LM, 
Gooneratne NS.

Author information:

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To distinguish relationships among subjective and objective 
characteristics of sleep, mood, and quality of life (QOL) in patients receiving 
treatment for lung cancer.
DESIGN: Descriptive, correlational study.
SETTING: Two ambulatory oncology clinics.
SAMPLE: 35 patients with lung cancer.
METHODS: The following instruments were used to measure the variables of 
interest: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Lung (FACT-L), a sleep diary, 
and a motionlogger actigraph.
MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Sleep, mood, and QOL.
FINDINGS: Significant differences were found between sleep diary and actigraph 
measures of sleep efficiency (p = 0.002), sleep latency (p = 0.014), sleep 
duration (p < 0.001), and wake after sleep onset (p < 0.001). Poor sleepers 
(PSQI score greater than 5) were significantly different from good sleepers 
(PSQI score of 5 or lower) on sleep diary measures of sleep efficiency and sleep 
latency and the FACT-L lung cancer symptom subscale, but not on mood or 
actigraphy sleep measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with lung cancer may report an overall acceptable 
sleep quality when assessed by a single question, those same patients may still 
have markedly increased sleep latencies or reduced total sleep time. The 
findings indicate the complexity of sleep disturbances in patients with lung 
cancer. Lung cancer symptoms had a stronger association with sleep than mood. 
Research using prospective methods will help to elucidate their clinical 
significance.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Patients receiving treatment for lung cancer are at an 
increased risk for sleep disturbances and would benefit from routine sleep 
assessment and management. In addition, assessment and management of common 
symptoms may improve sleep and, ultimately, QOL.
KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION: A high frequency of sleep disturbances in patients 
receiving treatment for lung cancer was evident, and poor sleepers had lower 
QOL. Sleep disturbances may be more related to lung cancer symptoms than anxiety 
or depression. Improving lung cancer symptoms such as dyspnea may improve sleep.

CE: critical care recovery center: an innovative collaborative care model for 
ICU survivors.

Five million Americans require admission to ICUs annually owing to 
life-threatening illnesses. Recent medical advances have resulted in higher 
survival rates for critically ill patients, who often have significant 
cognitive, physical, and psychological sequelae, known as postintensive care 
syndrome (PICS). This growing population threatens to overwhelm the current U.S. 
health care system, which lacks established clinical models for managing their 
care. Novel innovative models are urgently needed. To this end, the 
pulmonary/critical care and geriatrics divisions at the Indiana University 
School of Medicine joined forces to develop and implement a collaborative care 
model, the Critical Care Recovery Center (CCRC). Its mission is to maximize the 
cognitive, physical, and psychological recovery of ICU survivors. Developed 
around the principles of implementation and complexity science, the CCRC opened 
in 2011 as a clinical center with a secondary research focus. Care is provided 
through a pre-CCRC patient and caregiver needs assessment, an initial diagnostic 
workup visit, and a follow-up visit that includes a family conference. With its 
sole focus on the prevention and treatment of PICS, the CCRC represents an 
innovative prototype aimed at modifying post-critical illness morbidities and 
improving the ICU survivor's quality of life.

Hospital readmission: Older married male patients' experiences of life 
conditions and critical incidents affecting the course of care, a qualitative 
study.

BACKGROUND: Despite the frequency of hospital readmissions, there is still a 
relatively incomplete understanding of the broader array of factors pertaining 
to readmission in older persons. Few studies have explored how older persons 
experience readmission and their perceptions of circumstances affecting the 
course of care. Research indicates that males experience poorer health outcomes 
and are at higher risk of readmission compared to women.
AIM: To explore life conditions and critical incidents pertained to hospital 
readmission from the perspective of older males.
METHODS: The study used a qualitative explorative design using the Critical 
Incident Technique. A purposive sample of four males aged 65-75 were recruited 
from two internal medical wards. Data were collected through narrative double 
interviews. The study was registered by the North Denmark Region's joint 
notification of health research (ID 2008-58-0028).
FINDINGS: The analysis revealed four themes of life conditions: 'Ambiguity of 
ageing', 'Living with the burden of illness', 'Realisation of dependency' and 
'Growing sense of vulnerability and mortality'. Critical incidents comprised 
four areas: 'Balancing demands and resources in everyday life', 'Back home again 
- a period of recovery', 'Care interaction' and 'Navigating within and between 
healthcare system(s)'.
CONCLUSION: This study illustrated the interconnectedness, dynamics and 
complexity of life conditions and critical incidents that over time and across 
diverse healthcare sectors affected the course of care in older persons. 
Hospital readmissions seem related to a complex web of interacting life 
conditions and critical incidents rather than growing age or specific illnesses.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) amongst individuals who have a high frequency of presentations to 
the Emergency Department and their carers.
BACKGROUND: Patients with COPD are amongst the most frequent attenders in the 
Emergency Department despite the chronic nature of their condition. Good 
self-management has previously been identified as a key to maintaining health 
and reducing COPD exacerbations. There has been limited investigation of those 
with COPD who frequently attend the Emergency Department.
DESIGN: Descriptive qualitative phase of a mixed methods study.
METHODS: Individuals who had attended an Emergency Department within a single 
health district at least three times in the previous year for COPD were invited 
to participate in semistructured face-to-face interviews. A total of 19 
individuals consented to participate, of whom 12 were male. Half of the 
interviews included both those with COPD and carers. Data were audio-recorded 
and transcribed, before being analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Five main themes emerged from the data, namely (i) a sense of grief, 
loss and guilt, yet hope for the future; (ii) the impact on carers; (iii) the 
end point of self-management; (iv) the healthcare experience; and (v) the 
primary care experience.
CONCLUSION: The experience of individuals with COPD who frequently present to 
the Emergency Department and their carers highlights the complexity of living 
with this disease. Providing effective intervention to manage exacerbation 
requires an understanding of the issues that are faced by patients and their 
carers. Clear systems and skills for sharing information are essential to 
decrease avoidable use of the Emergency Department.

Social provision and loneliness among older people suffering from chronic 
physical illness. A mixed-methods approach.

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Health Sciences, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied 
Sciences, Oslo, Norway; Department of Public Health, Hedmark University College, 
Elverum, Norway.

AIMS: To describe and compare the perceived social provision for a group 
reporting never feeling lonely with that of a group reporting feeling lonely and 
to explore the meaning of loneliness.
SUBJECTS: Participants (N = 101) were recruited from geriatric wards. Inclusion 
criteria were as follows: aged 65 years or more, the absence of dementia, one or 
more chronic physical disorders and plans to be discharged from the hospital to 
their home. The mean age was 81.3 years (range: 65-96 years), 68% were women, 
and 66% lived alone.
MEASURES: Assessments of social provisions and loneliness were collected by a 
subjective report using the Social Provision Scale (SPS), and the 
Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess 
depression. The participants were also asked whether they felt lonely and were 
then asked to describe the meaning of loneliness if they had indicated feeling 
lonely. Narratives were then condensed by the participants into short sentences.
RESULTS: Seventy-five per cent of the participants reported feeling lonely, of 
these 54% were living alone, and 18% identified with depression. Three subscales 
of SPS scores were significantly lower in the lonely group: attachment (p < 
0.001), a sense of reliable alliance (p = 0.001) and the obtaining of guidance 
(p = 0.01). The overall view of the experience of loneliness was dominated by 
emptiness and negative emotions. The following themes were identified: Emotions 
were dominated by sadness, anxiety and restlessness, anger and guilt. 
Relationships were dominated by being left alone, being confined and feeling 
useless. Existential dimensions were characterised by emptiness, endless 
boredom, isolation and the potential for change.
CONCLUSION: The study shows that loneliness is prevalent among older people 
suffering from chronic physical illness and confirms the complexity of the 
concept. A mixed-methods design contributed to nuanced and detailed information 
about the meaning of loneliness.

Sibling cooperative and externalizing behaviors in families raising children 
with disabilities.

RN, PhD, ANEF, is Professor; and Donna Freeborn, PhD, FNP-BC, CNM, is Assistant 
Professor, College of Nursing, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah.

BACKGROUND: Raising a child with a disability (CWD) in the home is increasing 
across the globe. Because of caregiver burden and the complexity of care, there 
is growing concern for typically developing sibling (TDS) outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine whether caregiver burden, 
parenting style, and sibling relationships in families raising a CWD are 
associated with cooperative and externalizing behaviors in TDS.
METHODS: This correlational study included 189 families raising both a CWD and a 
TDS. Multilevel modeling was used to identify which variables were most 
predictive of TDS outcomes and if there were parent gender effects.
RESULTS: Authoritative parenting was positively associated with cooperative 
behaviors. Authoritarian parenting was positively associated with externalizing 
behaviors. Multilevel modeling revealed caregiver burden was a significant 
predictor of sibling behaviors in the first model. When parenting style was 
added as a predictor, it was also significant. When sibling relationships were 
added as predictors, they were significant predictors for both cooperative and 
externalizing TDS behaviors; however, caregiver burden was no longer 
significant. Authoritarian parenting significantly predicted externalizing 
behaviors, and authoritative parenting was significantly related to cooperative 
behaviors.
DISCUSSION: In families raising a CWD, positive sibling relationships may help 
negate the effects of caregiver burden and are more predictive of TDS outcomes 
than some parenting practices.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting early and 
intermediate hospital-to home transition outcomes of older adults with 
preexisting diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used. A sample of 96 hospitalized older 
adults with a prior diagnosis of diabetes were recruited within 4 hours of 
discharge. Data reflective of general health status, diabetes status, perceived 
discharge readiness (Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale), hospitalization, 
and anticipated postdischarge support were gathered upon enrollment. Transition 
outcome data including unplanned care encounter occurrences, perceived 
transition quality (Care Transition Measure-15), and postdischarge difficulty 
(scale and free responses to the Post-Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale [PDCDS]) 
were obtained by telephone interview 7 and 30 days after discharge. Three 
unique, dichotomous variables were created from recurrent subthemes that emerged 
during content analysis of free-response data and were used in statistical 
testing. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictive factors 
for an unplanned care encounter within 30 days of discharge.
RESULTS: Multimorbidity was prevalent in participants. Difficulties managing 
medications, blood glucose, and chronic illnesses other than diabetes were 
common problems. Higher PDCDS scores 7 and 30 days following discharge and 
difficulty managing a nondiabetes chronic health problem were predictive of an 
unplanned care encounter within 30 days of discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity complicates home recovery of older adults with 
diabetes. Diabetes adds complexity to hospital-to-home care transitions. 
Transition difficulties predict higher risk for an unplanned care encounter. 
More intensive follow-up of older adults with diabetes during the first month 
following discharge is recommended.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to systematically explore the 
motives for patients with head and neck cancer to contact a specialist nurse 
during two years postdiagnosis.
BACKGROUND: Research focusing on the role of specialist nurses in cancer care 
almost exclusively concern cancers other than head and neck cancer.
DESIGN: Qualitative, descriptive study based on the contacts between patients 
with head and neck cancer and a specialist nurse.
METHODS: Patients were invited to contact a specialist nurse by telephone. The 
specialist nurse took systematic field notes, that is, she registered who 
contacted her, the nature of the call and the outcome. Sixty patients were 
included.
RESULTS: In descending order, the motives for contact were questions about 
practical and uncomplicated matters, consultations about medical 
troubles/worries, presenting a report of the patient's situation, requests for 
additional information about the treatment plan and requests for medical 
information. The pattern of the patients' motivations for calling was not 
related to medical or social factors, suggesting that the initiative to make 
contact is very much a question of the complexity of individual life 
circumstances. Very few referrals were sent from the specialist nurse to other 
professionals.
CONCLUSIONS: The specialist nurse turned out to be more than just a coordinator 
of health-care resources. The findings bring up questions about the potential of 
the nurse's function as a coordinator, but also as a potential attachment 
figure, and questions about the nurse's relationships to other professionals.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: When implementing a specialist nurse function, 
it is important to decide whether the function should be inspired by a broader 
relational perspective. In addition to the indispensible competence and 
experience in the clinical field of head and neck cancer, training in 
counselling and acquaintance with object-relational psychology will then be 
desirable.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was exploring the experience of male caregivers 
living with a partner with multiple sclerosis (MS).
DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted following a grounded 
theory approach. Twenty-four men-husbands or partners of a woman diagnosed with 
MS-were interviewed in-depth. A thematic analysis was carried out and involved 
line-by-line coding with codes deriving from narratives.
FINDINGS: Five major themes emerged: caregiving as a full-time job; changes in 
the couple; the importance of social support and social life; gender 
specificities; and fear of the future.
CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the complexity of issues surrounding this 
specific form of caregiving. Social expectations referring to the marital 
relationship and to gender norms play a central role.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings can help in developing ad hoc interventions to 
support male spousal caregivers to care for their partners.

BACKGROUND: To deliver adequate care to patients with congenital heart disease 
(CHD), it is important to know which patients use what type of care. This 
knowledge is valuable, as modification of these factors may be used as means to 
regulate healthcare use. Our objective was to examine the predictive value of 
psychological characteristics for future healthcare use, independent of clinical 
characteristics.
METHODS: In total 845 adult CHD-patients participated in a longitudinal 
questionnaire study, with a two-year follow-up period. Linear regression 
analyses with negative binomial log link function were performed predicting 
healthcare used during the previous year. Psychological predictors were Type D 
personality, quality of life (QoL), depressive symptoms, trait-anxiety, 
happiness, optimism, and illness perceptions, independent of the number of 
co-morbidities, disease complexity and functional status. To control for 
clustering we included the variable type of centre (regional versus tertiary 
referral).
RESULTS: Patients who reported more healthcare use had a complex defect, a poor 
functional status, no Type D personality, and a poor QoL. They moreover felt 
their CHD had a severe impact on their life and believed their CHD could be 
managed by themselves or treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare use is not entirely determined by disease complexity and 
functional status but also by psychological patient characteristics. It can by 
hypothesised that reducing the negative impact experienced and informing 
patients about strategies to manage their CHD, will modify their future 
healthcare use. Additional research is necessary to examine this possibility.

Psychometric testing of the clinical nurse leader staff satisfaction instrument.

Spiva L, Hart PL, Wesley ML, Gallagher E, McVay F, Waggoner J, Jarrell N, 
Threatt JL.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient care is changing rapidly with increased 
complexity of care, patient volumes, and financial constraints with rising 
health care costs and limited reimbursements. In response, the clinical nurse 
leader (CNL) role was developed. No appropriate instrument exists to measure 
staff satisfaction with the CNL role. This study describes the development and 
testing of an instrument designed to measure staff satisfaction with 
implementation of the CNL role.
METHODS: The psychometric properties and factor structure of the Clinical Nurse 
Leader Staff Satisfaction (CNLSS) instrument was examined.
RESULTS: A 2-factor solution was discovered for the CNLSS. Cronbach's alpha 
coefficients were acceptable for the subscales and instrument.
CONCLUSION: The CNLSS is a valid and reliable instrument. Future research should 
focus on establishing test-retest reliability and construct validity.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether the number of nursing diagnoses on hospital 
admission is an independent predictor of the hospital length of stay.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study was carried out. A sample of 2,190 
patients consecutively admitted (from July to December 2014) in four inpatient 
units (two medical, two surgical) of a 1,547-bed university hospital were 
enrolled for the study.
METHODS: Data were collected from a clinical nursing information system and the 
hospital discharge register. Two regression analyses were performed to 
investigate if the number of nursing diagnoses on hospital admission was an 
independent predictor of length of stay and length of stay deviation after 
controlling for patients' sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender), 
clinical variables (disease groupers, disease severity morbidity indexes), and 
organizational hospital variables (admitting inpatient unit, modality of 
admission).
FINDINGS: The number of nursing diagnoses was shown to be an independent 
predictor of both the length of stay (β = .15; p < .001) and the length of stay 
deviation (β = .19; p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of nursing diagnoses is a strong independent predictor 
of an effective hospital length of stay and of a length of stay longer than 
expected.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The systematic inclusion of standard nursing care data in 
electronic health records can improve the predictive ability on hospital 
outcomes and describe the patient complexity more comprehensively, improving 
hospital management efficiency.

Transitioning the older adult in the ambulatory care setting.

Nelson JM(1), Carrington JM.

Author information:
(1)University of Colorado College of Nursing, Aurora, USA.

Transitions between care settings are periods of vulnerability for patients. 
This is especially true for older adults, for whom comorbidities and functional 
impairments can increase the complexity of care and the need for multiple 
caregivers can compromise safety. Poor care transitions can result in costly 
hospital admissions. For this reason, leading health care organizations have 
initiated programs to improve the quality of transitions; however, to date, the 
ambulatory surgical setting has not been a focus of these initiatives. The 
ambulatory setting serves an increasingly complex patient population and 
provides the majority of elective surgeries, and adapting some of the transition 
tools that have been tested in other settings will benefit health care providers 
and patients in the ambulatory setting. Identifying periods of transition and 
risk, implementing electronic health records across all phases of patient care, 
and using evidence-based tools at each transitional stage can optimize the 
quality and safety of patient care.

BACKGROUND: The increased incidence of health challenges with aging means that 
nurses are increasingly caring for older adults, often in hospital settings. 
Research about the complexity of nursing practice with this population remains 
limited.
OBJECTIVE: To seek an explanation of nursing practice with hospitalised older 
adults.
METHODS: Design. A grounded theory study guided by symbolic interactionism was 
used to explore nursing practice with hospitalised older adults from a nursing 
perspective. Glaserian grounded theory methods were used to develop a mid-range 
theory after analysis of 375 hours of participant observation, 35 interviews 
with 24 participants and review of selected documents.
RESULTS: The theory of orchestrating care was developed to explain how nurses 
are continuously trying to manage their work environments by understanding the 
status of the patients, their unit, mobilising the assistance of others and 
stretching available resources to resolve their problem of providing their older 
patients with what they perceived as 'good care' while sustaining themselves as 
'good' nurses. They described their practice environments as hard and 
under-resourced. Orchestrating care is comprised of two subprocesses: building 
synergy and minimising strain. These two processes both facilitated and 
constrained each other and nurses' abilities to orchestrate care.
CONCLUSIONS: Although system issues presented serious constraints to nursing 
practice, the ways in which nurses were making meaning of their work environment 
both aided them in managing their challenges and constrained their agency.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses need to be encouraged to share their important 
perspective about older adult care. Administrators have a role to play in giving 
nurses voice in workplace committees and in forums. Further research is needed 
to better understand how multidisciplinary teams influence care of hospitalized 
older adults.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment of a mental health service user with 
safeguarding needs.

North C(1).

Author information:
(1)Older People's Mental Health Services, Bradford District Care NHS Foundation 
Trust.

This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of 
the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical 
settings. CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's 
medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and 
environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it 
can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This 
article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was 
receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had 
significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for 
patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these 
conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects 
on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also 
highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary 
care in community settings.

Perceptions of HIV-Related Stigma in Portugal Among MSM With HIV Infection and 
an Undetectable Viral Load.

Pereira H, Caldeira D, Monteiro S.

We explored perceptions of HIV-related stigma using a qualitative approach based 
on the findings of in-depth e-mail asynchronous interviews with 37 
self-identified Portuguese men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV infection 
and undetectable viral loads. Participants were asked to answer an online 
interview. Major findings concerned external perceptions of HIV-related stigma, 
HIV status disclosure, the impact of HIV on everyday life, the presence of 
double discrimination, and general perceptions of HIV-related stigma. Results 
revealed (a) stigmatizing and discriminatory behaviors and practices in 
psychosocial and inter-relational events, but not in accessing and receiving 
health care; (b) double exposure to stigma associated with being gay and having 
HIV; and (c) undetectability as an autonomous identity with important 
connections to social and interpersonal interactions. An important implication 
was related to multilevel risk perceptions and the psychosocial complexity and 
challenges of HIV infection. In Portugal, HIV is still a socially disabling 
disease.

Hospital, Peel Regional Cancer Centre, Mississauga, ON,Canada. jekim@cvh.on.ca

OBJECTIVE: Health care professionals may assume questionnaires are burdensome to 
patients, and this limits their use in clinical settings and promotes 
simplification. However, patient adherence may improve by optimizing 
questionnaire attributes and contexts.
METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used Contingent Valuation methods to 
directly elicit patient preference for conventional monitoring of symptoms, 
versus adding a tool to monitoring. Under explicit consideration was the 
10-question Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). In the questionnaire, 
attributes of ESAS were sequentially altered to try and force preference 
reversal. A separate group of participants completed both questionnaire and 
interviews to explore questionnaire reliability, and extend validity.
RESULTS: Overall, 24 of 43 participants preferred using ESAS. Most important 
attributes to preference were frequency, specificity, and complexity. Where 
preference is initially against ESAS, it may reverse by simplifying the tool and 
its administrative processes. Interviews in 10 additional participants supported 
reproducibility and validity of the questionnaire method.
CONCLUSIONS: Preference for using tools increases when tools are made relevant 
and used more appropriately.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Questionnaires completed by patients as screening tools 
or aids to communication may be under-utilized. Optimization of ESAS and similar 
tools may be guided by empirical findings, including those obtained from 
Contingent Valuation methodologies.

Understanding the reasons why patients delay seeking treatment for oral cancer 
symptoms from a primary health care professional: an integrative literature 
review.

(1)Catherine McAuley School of Nursing and Midwifery, Brookfield Health Sciences 
Complex, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. Electronic address: 
b.noonan@ucc.ie.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this integrative literature review was to investigate 
existing research on the reasons why patients delay in seeking treatment for 
oral cancer symptoms from a primary health care professional.
METHOD: The systematic approach developed by Cooper (1984) was the guiding 
framework for this integrative review. Cooper (1984) identifies the process of 
conducting an integrative review as encompassing the following five stages: (a) 
problem formulation, (b) data collection, (c) evaluation of data points, (d) 
data analysis and interpretation, and (e) public presentation of results.
RESULTS: Despite different research designs employed and sample sizes ranging 
from 15 to 559, three major themes emerged from the 16 studies included in the 
review, all of which are directly related to the reasons why people delay 
seeking treatment for oral cancer symptoms: Patient Sociodemographic 
Characteristics; Health Related Behaviours, and Psychosocial Factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this integrative review demonstrates the complexity 
surrounding the reasons why patients delay in seeking help for oral cancer 
treatment. The association between knowledge and patient delay has implications 
for information provision about cancer to those at risk of developing the 
disease. The relationship between socioeconomic status and patient delay 
behaviour warrants further investigation as this has been shown to be an 
influential factor in the study of patient delay. The meaning of many of the 
investigated psychosocial factors (e.g. an individuals' symptom 
interpretation/attribution, disclosure of symptoms to significant others, social 
priorities), have not been discussed in detail and the research is not theory 
driven.

(3)Crittenton Hospital, Rochester, Michigan, USA.

AIM: This article reports on a qualitative study of nurse perceptions of caring 
nurse practice in the complex adaptive system of health care.
BACKGROUND: Caring nurse practice encompasses technical skills and caring 
behaviours. Maternity care in the USA has seen worsening maternal and neonatal 
outcomes and safety has become a priority. As a result, hospital systems have 
begun efforts to improve outcomes, initiating safety and quality programmes that 
standardize care and implementing nursing frameworks that enhance relationships.
DESIGN: Qualitative hermeneutic phenomenology.
METHODS: A qualitative design analysed 13 nurses' perspectives on caring 
practice during the second stage of labour. In June and July of 2012, interviews 
were conducted with 13 labour and delivery nurses located in a hospital that had 
adopted a perinatal safety initiative and relationship-focused nursing model. 
The nurses described caring nurse practice and the factors that affected its 
provision. Transcripts of audio recordings and notes taken during interviews 
were analysed for themes and fundamental meanings.
FINDINGS: Nurses' perspectives about the provision of caring nurse practice was 
affected by the complexity of the healthcare system, interactions with team 
members, challenges related to documentation; and respect for natural birth.
CONCLUSION: Nurses at all levels of practice can use these perspectives to 
identify patterns in the complex adaptive healthcare system to improve quality 
and safety. Best practices include enhancing teamwork, implementing safety 
initiatives and promoting a Relationship-Based framework. Continued study of 
caring nurse practice could lead to establishment of additional safety and 
quality protocols vital to improving patient outcomes.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe how the included items in three different 
scales, Downton Fall Risk Index, the short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment 
and the Modified Norton Scale are associated to severe outcomes as falls, weight 
loss and pressure ulcers.
BACKGROUND: Falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are common adverse events 
among nursing home residents and risk scoring are common preventive activities, 
mainly focusing on single risks. In Sweden the three scales are routinely used 
together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention.
DESIGN: Longitudinal quantitative study.
METHODS: Descriptive analyses and Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: Only 4% scored no risk for any of these serious events. Longitudinal 
risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating increased risks. 
This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general condition. 
There were no statistical significant differences between residents categorised 
at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but 
decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of 
general health were most important.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk tendencies for falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are 
high in nursing homes, and when measure them at the same time the majority will 
have several of these risks. Items assessing mobility or items affecting 
mobility were of most importance. Care processes can always be improved and this 
study can add to the topic.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A more comprehensive view is needed and 
prevention can not only be based on total scores. Mobility is an important 
factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both as a risk factor and a protective 
factor. This involves a challenge for care--to keep the inmates physical active 
and at the same time prevent falls.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of readmission from the 
perspective of the stroke survivor and family caregiver.
BACKGROUND: Older stroke survivors are at an increased risk for readmission with 
approximately 40% being readmitted in the first year after stroke. Patients and 
their families are best positioned to provide information about factors 
associated with readmission, yet their perspectives have rarely been elicited.
DESIGN: Descriptive qualitative study.
METHODS: This study included older stroke survivors who were readmitted to acute 
care from home in the six months following stroke, and their family caregivers. 
Participants were interviewed by telephone at approximately two weeks after 
discharge and a sub-set was also interviewed in person during the readmission. 
Interviews were audio-taped and content analysis was used to identify themes.
RESULTS: From the 29 semi-structured interviews conducted with 20 stroke 
survivors and/or their caregivers, the following themes were identified: 
preparing to go home after the stroke, what to expect at home, complexity of 
medication management, support for self-care in the community and the influence 
of social factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the critical perspective of the stroke survivor 
and family caregiver into furthering our understanding of readmissions after 
stroke. Participants identified several areas for intervention including better 
discharge preparation and the need for support in the community for medication 
management and self-care. The findings suggest that interventions designed to 
reduce readmissions after stroke should be multifaceted in approach and extend 
across the continuum of care.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The hospital level has been the focus of 
interventions to reduce preventable readmissions, but the results of this study 
suggest the importance of community-level care. The individual nature of each 
situation must be taken into account, including the postdischarge environment 
and the availability of social support.

The global population is aging, and with that comes new challenges. Optimal care 
must be delivered to minimize the time spent in the acute care setting. Avoiding 
costly complications and focusing on health promotion rather than disease 
management will be key. Geriatrics is a complex patient population and basic 
nursing care is essential to prevent unnecessary complications if our health 
care system is to survive. Our profession is ill prepared to optimally care for 
this patient population.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The focus of this research was to standardise an emergency 
observation chart, the Adult Emergency Department Flow Chart, which incorporates 
elements designed to allow clinicians to more readily recognise the trends of 
patient deterioration.
BACKGROUND: Patients present to the Emergency Department with some form of 
instability. Core skills and principles of Emergency Department care are to 
rapidly and continually assess the clinical condition of the patient, prioritise 
their care and treat accordingly. Often, however, deterioration of these 
patients is missed. The incidence of missed deterioration is set within a 
background of increasing presentations to Emergency Departments, greater 
complexity of the patient health status, longer length of stay within the 
Emergency Department and an ageing population.
DESIGN: This quantitative research study comprised a retrospective medical 
record audit. Only those records containing notes relating to an Emergency 
Department admission were included.
METHODS: An online data collection tool based on the Adult Emergency Department 
Flow Chart was developed. A total of 181 medical records were reviewed: 80 
during the pre-implementation audit and 101 during the post-implementation 
audit.
RESULTS: The Adult Emergency Department Flow Chart enabled clinicians to better 
identify deteriorating patients, with a higher number of abnormal vital signs 
being identified at the post-implementation audit. Identification of pain also 
dramatically increased at the post-implementation audit. Documentation of 
notification to Medical Officers also increased, as did documentation of the 
number of patients receiving medication to help treat the abnormal vital sign.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of the Adult Emergency Department Flow Chart 
facilitated the essential role of nurses in the identification, documentation 
and monitoring of the unstable or deteriorating patient in the Emergency 
Department. Further research is required with larger samples to determine the 
impact of the Adult Emergency Department Flow Chart on the timely management of 
abnormal vital signs.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The Adult Emergency Flow Chart provides a 
valuable tool for the early identification and subsequent management of an 
unstable / deteriorating adult in the emergency department, particularly for 
clinicians with limited experience.

Program (Mr Knisely); Assistant Professor (Dr Ellis); and Associate Dean for 
Research and Scholarship, Professor, Sally Reahard Chair, and Director of the 
Center for Enhancing Quality of Life in Chronic Illness (Dr Carpenter), Indiana 
University School of Nursing, Indianapolis.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to identify medication-related 
considerations for clinical nurse specialist practice by presenting a case 
report detailing the complexities of medication management, unresolved 
medication discrepancies, and reconciliation across care transitions.
BACKGROUND: Care transitions are a vulnerable time for medication-related 
problems to occur. Unresolved medication discrepancies can lead to adverse drug 
events and other poor health outcomes, including hospital readmissions and 
increased healthcare costs. Reconciling medication discrepancies during care 
transitions has been identified as a national patient safety goal to prevent 
medication-related problems. Clinical nurse specialists are uniquely qualified 
to lead and manage efforts to mitigate these problems during care transitions.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old male patient diagnosed with oral cancer 
underwent 8 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Throughout these 8 
weeks, the patient was seen by 4 providers and admitted to the hospital for 
neutropenia. As a result, a total of 19 new medications were prescribed and 5 
medications were discontinued. Medication reconciliation was completed at each 
visit and at admission and discharge at the hospital. At discharge, the 
patient's medication regimen was complex, with 38 separate doses of 17 different 
medications per 24-hour period. Understanding and organizing the daily 
medication regimen were a consistent challenge for the patient during his 
illness.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexities of medication regimens and 
opportunities to improve medication management and reconciliation across care 
transitions. This case underscores the need for and importance of quality 
patient-provider communication, assessing and managing medication regimen 
complexity, evaluating medications against the American Geriatrics Society Beers 
Criteria, evaluating potential drug-drug or drug-food interactions, and 
recognizing at-risk behaviors that may lead to medication discrepancies and 
errors at care transitions. Potential opportunities where clinical nurse 
specialists could intervene to promote safe and effective medication management 
across care transitions are presented.
CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: Clinical nurse specialists have the unique ability to 
make key contributions and influence medication management and reconciliation 
across care transitions to promote medication effectiveness and safety.

Readiness for and predictors of evidence-based practice of acute-care nurses: a 
cross-sectional postal survey.

Nursing Professional Practice Development, Landspitali University Hospital, 
Reykjavík, Iceland.

BACKGROUND: Nurses' adoption of evidence-based practice (EBP) remains limited 
although most nurses are familiar with EBP and belief in its value for patient 
care. Efforts to accelerate nurses' EBP activities have met with limited 
success. Knowledge of predictors of nurses' EBP activities is lacking.
AIMS: To describe nurses' readiness for EBP as measured by their information 
needs, skills in using electronic bibliographical databases (EBDs) and awareness 
of available EBP-needed resources; EBP beliefs and frequency of EBP activities, 
and identify predictors of EBP activities and beliefs.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey, distributed to a homogeneous, 
consecutive sample of 546 acute-care nurses. Response rate was 64.3%; responses 
from direct-care nurses (n = 298) and administrators (n = 45) were analysed. 
Descriptive statistics were used to describe readiness for EBP, frequency of 
certain EBP activities and EBP beliefs. Logistic regression analyses were 
performed to identify predictors of EBP activities and multiple regression 
analysis to identify predictors of EBP beliefs.
RESULTS: The nurses generally seldom participated in the EBP activities studied, 
in spite of familiarity with and positive beliefs towards EBP. Evidence-based 
practice beliefs predicted all three activities studied. Skills in using EBDs 
predicted information-seeking and evaluating research. Awareness of available 
EBP-needed resources predicted information-seeking, role predicted evaluating 
research, while familiarity with EBP predicted using research in practice. Six 
predictors explained nearly 40% of the variance in EBP beliefs.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurses' EBP activities must be facilitated and accelerated. The 
findings provide empirical support to the primacy of EBP beliefs in nurses' 
engagement in EBP and of the complexity of EBP. While the identified predictors 
of EBP activities and beliefs are susceptible to change, diverse strategies are 
needed to influence each one. Strategies should focus on influencing EBP 
beliefs, that is, by increasing skills in using EBDs, discussion about EBP in 
the clinical environment and familiarity with EBP.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the motivation and confidence of people with 
coexisting diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension to take their 
medicines as prescribed.
BACKGROUND: These comorbidities are major contributors to disease burden 
globally. Self-management of individuals with these coexisting diseases is much 
more complicated than that of those with single diseases and is critical for 
improved health outcomes.
DESIGN: Motivational interviewing telephone calls were made with participants 
with coexisting diabetes, CKD and hypertension.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥18 years with diabetes, CKD and systolic hypertension 
were recruited from outpatient clinics of an Australian metropolitan hospital 
between 2008-2009. An average of four motivational interviewing telephone calls 
was made with participants (n = 39) in the intervention arm of a randomised 
controlled trial. Data were thematically analysed using the modified Health 
Belief Model as a framework.
RESULTS: Participants' motivation and confidence in taking prescribed medicines 
was thwarted by complex medicine regimens and medical conditions. Participants 
wanted control over their health and developed various strategies to confront 
threats to health. The perceived barriers of taking recommended health action 
outweighed the benefits of taking medicines as prescribed and were primarily 
related to copious amounts of medicines.
CONCLUSION: Taking multiple prescribed medicines in coexisting diabetes, CKD and 
hypertension is a perpetual vocation with major psychosocial effects. 
Participants were overwhelmed by the number of medicines that they were required 
to take. The quest for personal control of health, fear of the future and the 
role of stress and gender in chronic disease management have been highlighted. 
Participants require supportive emotional interventions to self-manage their 
multiple medicines on a daily basis.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Reducing the complexity of medicine regimens in 
coexisting diseases is paramount. Individualised psychosocial approaches that 
address the emotional needs of patients with regular follow-up and feedback are 
necessary for optimal chronic disease self-management.

The first generation of Turkish and Northwest African immigrants in Belgium are 
ageing and at risk for developing cancer. Relatives play an important role and 
provide both emotional and practical care, including mental support and acting 
as a contact person and/or a translator for improving access to healthcare, as 
most patients and their spouses have only a limited command of the language. 
Although access to professional interpreters has shown to be the best guarantee 
for qualitative healthcare, oncology health providers working with relatives as 
interpreters is much more common than professional interpreters. The aim of this 
study was to provide insight into the process wherein relatives balance 
truth-telling in translating for an older family member diagnosed with cancer. 
This was a qualitative research study, with elements of constructivist grounded 
theory. Twenty-eight loosely structured interviews were conducted. Most 
relatives consider it their responsibility to contribute to a positive attitude 
of the patient. Relatives decided to what extent they inform the patient, based 
on several motives and embedded in their assessment of the patient's emotional 
strength, understanding and need to be informed. What they decide influences the 
way they act as a translator and/or a contact person between the patient and 
health professional(s). Some considered it best to omit medical information 
while others considered it best to inform the patient fully. The results 
emphasise the importance for healthcare providers to take into account the 
complexity and unpredictable character of the process of balancing truth-telling 
when family members translate for their ill older relative.

BACKGROUND: There has been limited examination of uncertainty after stroke. The 
effects of stroke extend beyond the stroke survivor to impact on the family, and 
thus, an exploration of uncertainty with the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad is 
important to gain a fuller understanding.
METHODS: Stroke survivors and their family caregivers (n = 33) participated in 
eight focus groups. Transcripts from the focus groups were examined for 
recurrent themes using content analysis. Mishel's theory of uncertainty was used 
as a framework to classify the themes.
RESULTS: Participants reported uncertainty about (a) future events, in 
particular, recurrent stroke; (b) signs and symptoms of stroke; (c) stroke risk 
factor management; and (d) resources for poststroke care. The uncertainty was 
brought on by the lack of predictability of these future events, lack of 
information, and the complexity of poststroke care and corresponded to Mishel's 
four key elements of ambiguity, deficient information, lack of clarity, and 
unpredictability.
CONCLUSIONS: The fear of recurrent stroke was a pervasive theme and may 
represent a window of opportunity to work actively with stroke survivors in 
managing their risk factors. Although certain aspects of uncertainty after 
stroke cannot be eliminated, we can intervene with stroke survivors and family 
caregivers to assist them in reframing their responses to uncertainty and to 
foster coping and promote health.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated how well women from diverse race/ethnic groups 
were able to take a quantitative cancer risk statistic verbally provided to them 
and report it in a visual format.
METHODS: Cross-sectional survey was administered in English, Spanish or Chinese, 
to women aged 50-80 (n=1160), recruited from primary care practices. The survey 
contained breast, colorectal or cervical cancer questions regarding screening 
and prevention. Women were told cancer-specific lifetime risk then shown a 
visual display of risk and asked to indicate the specific lifetime risk. Correct 
indication of risk was the main outcome.
RESULTS: Correct responses on icon arrays were 46% for breast, 55% for colon, 
and 44% for cervical; only 25% correctly responded to a magnifying glass 
graphic. Compared to Whites, African American and Latina women were 
significantly less likely to use the icon arrays correctly. Higher education and 
higher numeracy were associated with correct responses. Lower education was 
associated with lower numeracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Race/ethnic differences were associated with women's ability to 
take a quantitative cancer risk statistic verbally provided to them and report 
it in a visual format.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Systematically considering the complexity of intersecting 
factors such as race/ethnicity, educational level, poverty, and numeracy in most 
health communications is needed.

Back pain consists of a spectrum of conditions, with no common etiology and 
therefore no dominant method of treatment. The purpose of this study is to 
describe the complexity of a collection of 8000 back pain patients who appeared 
in an integrative medicine clinic, as a prelude to conducing comparative 
effectiveness research on CAM alternatives to conventional therapy. 
Approximately 23% of all clinic patients were diagnosed at some time with back 
pain. Nearly half had treatment periods of less than one month, while more than 
25% were treated for back pain for more than two years. Women were represented 
more than twice as often as men. The initial diagnosis categories that occurred 
most frequently were lumbar symptoms, cervical symptoms, and a general category, 
with smaller numbers having lumbar anatomic, thoracic symptom, brachial 
neuritis, or sciatica diagnoses. There were few strong relationships between 
initial diagnosis pattern and length of back pain treatment period. While 77% of 
back pain patients presented with diagnoses in only a single category, there 
were many composite categories each of which was sparsely represented. Between 
50% and 75% of patients used some CAM service, depending on their initial 
diagnosis pattern. Patients with complex initial diagnosis patterns strongly 
tended to chose CAM, and among CAM-users those with complex diagnoses tended 
toward chiropractic, as opposed to acupuncture or bodywork. The CAM usage 
patterns of men and women were highly similar. Again among CAM users, 82% used 
only a single type of CAM service, and multiple service uses tend to be combined 
at random. Between two-thirds and three-quarters of multiple CAM service users 
had very simple temporal patterns of use, dominated by use of one type of CAM at 
a time.

Nurse managers describe their practice environments.

Hospital work environments that support the professional practice of nurses are 
critical to patient safety. Nurse managers are responsible for creating these 
professional practice environments for staff nurses, yet little is known about 
the environments needed to support nurse managers. Domains of nurse managers' 
practice environment have recently been defined. This is a secondary analysis of 
2 cross-sectional studies of organizational characteristics that influence nurse 
manager practice. Content analysis of the free text comments from 127 nurse 
managers was used to illustrate the 8 domains of nurse managers' practice 
environments. Nurse managers valued time spent with their staff; therefore, 
workloads must permit meaningful interaction. Directors demonstrated trust when 
they empowered nurse managers to make decisions. Administrative leaders should 
build patient safety cultures on the basis of shared accountability and mutual 
respect among the health care team. The expectations of nurse managers have 
greatly expanded in the volume and complexity of direct reports, patient care 
areas, and job functions. The nurse managers in this analysis reported 
characteristics of their practice environments that limit their role 
effectiveness and may negatively impact organizational performance. Further 
research is needed to understand the effects of nurse managers' practice 
environments on staff and patient outcomes.

Clinical outcomes associated with screening and referral for depression in an 
acute cardiac ward.

AIM: The aim of this paper is to describe the implementation of a depression 
screening and referral tool in two cardiac wards of a major metropolitan public 
hospital. The tool consisted of two sections: (1) screening for depression risk 
(Cardiac Depression Scale-5) and (2) consequential referral actions.
BACKGROUND: Prior research has shown that depression in patients with heart 
disease is associated with significantly impaired quality of life, decreased 
medication adherence, increased morbidity and increased use of healthcare 
services.
DESIGN: A prospective in-patient study design.
METHOD: A consecutive sample of 202 patients admitted to either the cardiac 
medical (n = 145) or surgical (n = 57) wards of a major Melbourne metropolitan 
hospital were recruited into the study over an 18-week period.
RESULTS: Just over half (54%) of the patients were identified as 'at risk' of 
depression. Of these, 19% were assessed as moderate risk and 35% high risk. Of 
those patients, 91% had the risk score documented in their medical history, 90% 
had engaged in discussions with clinicians regarding their risk score, 85% had 
their risk score communicated formally to the medical team and 25% were formally 
referred for appropriate follow-up - significantly more than prior to 
implementation of the screening and referral tool.
CONCLUSIONS: By providing a formalised mechanism for detecting depression, 
documented screening and referral rates improved for those with comorbid 
depression and heart disease affording an opportunity for early intervention. 
These findings support a move towards integrated approaches to screening of 
depression to become standard practice in the acute cardiac setting.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Such mechanisms also have the potential to 
initiate the development of new models of care that acknowledge the complexity 
of comorbid depression and heart disease and provide pathways from speciality to 
primary care which integrate the physical and psychosocial domains inclusive of 
screening, referral, systematic monitoring and streamlined behavioural and 
physical care.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients' 
experiences with a partnership-based nursing practice programme in the home 
setting.
BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suffer from 
psychological and physiological problems, especially when they return home after 
hospitalisation from exacerbation. Many express a need for information and 
knowledge about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Partnership as practice 
is a patient-centred framework providing an individualised practice for each 
patient. This study intends to achieve a nuanced and improved understanding of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients' experiences with a 
partnership-based nursing practice programme comprising home visits from a 
respiratory nurse after hospital discharge, alongside interdisciplinary 
collaboration.
DESIGN: This study has a qualitative design with interviews.
METHODS: Six individual semi-structured interviews collected in 2012-2013 
constitute the material. Interviews were recorded, transcribed to written text 
and analysed using systematic text condensation.
RESULTS: Three key themes were identified: to be seen, talked with and 
understood; healthcare support at home-continuity, practical support and 
facilitation; and exchange of knowledge. However, there were two generic themes 
that permeated the material: feeling safe and comforted, and motivation to 
achieve better health.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can experience 
feeling safe and comforted, and be motivated to make changes in order to achieve 
better health after participating in a partnership-based nursing practice 
programme that includes home visits from a respiratory nurse and 
interdisciplinary cooperation after hospital discharge. To feel safe is of great 
importance, and how this relates to the patient's ability to cope with illness 
should be explored in further research.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results suggest that the partnership-based 
nursing practice programme that includes home visits and interdisciplinary 
collaboration can be a good approach to meeting the complexity of the chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease patient's health needs.

AIM AND OBJECTIVES: This study explored the experiences and perspectives of 
community psychiatric nurses, day centre managers and social workers about 
supporting clients living with and without dementia attending a generic day care 
service. The purpose of the study was to elucidate approaches that enable 
clients living with dementia to access and derive benefit from the service.
BACKGROUND: In the light of international ageing demographics and strategy 
towards social inclusion, it is anticipated that demand for generic day care 
services for clients living with and without dementia will increase.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive qualitative design utilised three focus groups 
for data collection. Community psychiatric nurses (n = 4), day centre mangers 
(n = 4) and social workers (n = 12) participated in the study. Data analysis 
informed a narrative description of the approaches that support adults living 
with dementia in day care.
FINDINGS: An exhaustive description is encapsulated in five key themes. These 
are "easing the transition to day care," "proactively managing supervision and 
complexity of need," "sustaining the person and family carer," making the best 
of what we have" and "encountering a need for change," The data conveyed a 
sensitivity to the life story and needs of clients with dementia. Whilst the 
data revealed deficits in the physical environment of the centres, there were 
indications of the generation of a positive social environment.
CONCLUSIONS: A generic day care service that provides an integrated blend of 
care and treatment and social and recreational support to older adults, 
irrespective of whether they have or have not dementia, is realistic and 
manageable. The routine of day centre attendance may have value in sustaining 
clients with dementia and family care-giving relationships.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Approaches to support the attendance of clients with 
dementia at day care include home visits, life story work, proactive supervision 
and careful planning of social groupings and recreational activities.

Better understanding of how Hispanic older adults describe their chronic pain 
might suggest ways to support Hispanic older adults to talk about important pain 
information with their practitioner. The study aim was to describe how Hispanic 
older adults communicate pain information, including the amount of pain 
information and communication processes employed. A secondary analysis with a 
descriptive design was used. The data were from a larger primary study that 
tested the effect of practitioner pain question phrasing on the amount of pain 
information described by older adults with osteoarthritis pain. The sample for 
this secondary analysis was composed of the 24 Hispanic older adults with 
chronic osteoarthritis pain. In the primary study older adults watched and 
orally responded to a videotape of a practitioner asking about their pain. Pain 
content from the patient responses was content analyzed by two independent 
raters. Communication processes were also content analyzed by two independent 
raters using a priori criteria from communication accommodation theory (clarity, 
syntax, complexity, explicitness, and staying on topic). Participants described 
a mean of 5.5 (SD 3.39) items of pain information. The majority stayed on topic, 
and one-half spoke clearly and explicitly. Hispanic older adults with 
osteoarthritis pain concisely describe clinically important pain information 
when given the opportunity to do so.

In view of the likelihood that the complexity of care required by those admitted 
to nursing homes will continue to increase, an expert consensus study was 
conducted to reach consensus on the competencies which distinguish 
baccalaureate-educated registered nurses from other nursing staff working in 
nursing homes. Thirty-one international experts, identified through literature 
and our professional network, participated in a two-round web-based survey and 
an expert meeting. Experts reached consensus on 16 desirable competencies, 
including some not traditionally associated with nursing expertise e.g. being a 
team leader, role model and coach within the nursing team. These findings 
suggest that revision of current nursing curricula, nurse training programs and 
nursing home job profiles might be needed to meet the medically and 
psychologically complex needs of nursing home residents.

University Hospital, Jeonju, Korea.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of Korean patients with 
end-stage renal disease awaiting kidney transplantation.
BACKGROUND: The need for kidney transplantation has increased worldwide, while 
the number of kidney donors has not increased commensurately. This mismatch is a 
serious issue in South Korea. Prolonged waits for transplantation may cause 
physical and psychosocial issues and lead to poor outcomes. Nevertheless, the 
experience of waiting for kidney transplantation in South Korea has never been 
explored in depth.
DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used.
METHODS: The participants were eight patients diagnosed with end-stage renal 
disease on the waiting list for kidney transplantation in South Korea. Data were 
collected through individual in-depth interviews. All conversations during 
interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcribed data were 
analysed using conventional content analysis.
RESULTS: The experience of waiting for kidney transplantation consisted of six 
categories: (1) the light at the end of the tunnel, (2) being on call without 
any promise, (3) a tough tug of war between excitement and frustration, (4) 
doubts in the complexity, (5) A companion on the hard journey and (6) getting 
ready for D-day.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation candidates experience psychosocial 
difficulties and concerns while waiting for long periods of time without any 
assurance of resolution. Systematic education and psychosocial support from 
health care professionals and family members help patients get through what they 
describe as a difficult journey. Comprehensive management programs for kidney 
transplantation candidates are needed.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Health care professionals need to recognise the 
psychosocial concerns of patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Clinicians 
should provide patients with information and support throughout the waiting 
period.

BACKGROUND: This study analysed the validity and reliability of a food frequency 
questionnaire designed for African-American patients with low literacy. This 
instrument was designed specifically to meet the need for a tool that was short, 
easy to understand, and met clinical reliability and validity standards.
OBJECTIVES: Assessing patient nutritional status and dietary intake is crucial 
to the care of patients in end stage kidney disease. The development of a quick 
and reliable nutritional assessment tool for patients with low literacy could 
increase nutritional counselling effectiveness and improve patient outcomes.
DESIGN: The renal food frequency questionnaire (RFF) and a standard 24-hour 
recall were administered to a general population of African-American patients 
undergoing dialysis. Registered Dieticians and statistical analyses were used to 
validate the content and structural validity and reliability of the RFF to 
adequately measure dietary intake.
PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 30 African-American patients who 
received dialysis treatment at a regional teaching hospital facility.
RESULTS: The RFF was found to be a simple, easy to understand instrument with 
low reading complexity (grade level 4.4). Inter-rater reliability was found to 
be high (.81-1.00), and statistical analysis determined a high level of clinical 
validity.
CONCLUSION: The RFF was found to be a valid dietary recall tool that is 
appropriate for patients with limited literacy. It was found to have acceptable 
reliability and validity when compared with a standard 24-hour recall and has 
potential for use as a dietary intake and monitoring tool in patients undergoing 
dialysis.

Home healthcare teams' assessments of pain in care recipients living with 
dementia: a Swedish exploratory study.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Pain assessment in people living with dementia is a challenge due to 
the complexity of pain and dementia and the difficulties in self-reporting. In 
home healthcare, nurses are frequently involved in pain assessment situations 
and there is a need to explore how home healthcare teams' manage pain assessment 
in this setting.
AIM: The study aimed to explore home healthcare teams' experiences of pain 
assessment among care recipients with dementia.
DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative design was used.
METHODS: Open-ended individual interviews were conducted with thirteen 
registered nurses and ten nursing assistants, working in three different home 
healthcare teams in one municipality in western Sweden. Philosophical 
hermeneutics was utilised to interpret the home healthcare teams' experiences.
RESULTS: Four interpretations emerged: the need for trusting collaboration, the 
use of multiple assessment strategies, maintenance of staff continuity in care 
and assessment situations, and the need for extended time to assess pain.
CONCLUSIONS: The home healthcare teams recognise pain assessment in people with 
dementia as involving a complex interaction of sensory, cognitive, emotional and 
behavioural components in which efforts to acquire understanding of behavioural 
changes mainly guides their assessments. The solid team coherence between 
registered nurses and nursing assistants aided the assessment procedure. To 
assess pain, the teams used multiple methods that complemented one another. 
However, no systematic routines or appropriate evidence-based pain tools were 
used.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The team members'concern for care recipients when 
assessing pain is evident and needs to be acknowledged by the organisation which 
is responsible for the quality of care. Future studies should focus on further 
exploration of nurses' experiences with pain and dementia in home healthcare 
settings and address what nurses identify and how they deal with their findings. 
It is imperative to investigate how organisations and nurses can ensure best 
practices and how the implementation of evidence-based routines for assessing 
pain may aid in pain assessment situations.

Jersey, 101 Vera King Farris Dr., Galloway, NJ 08240, USA. colonm@stockton.ed

This study explores the referral experience of physicians who refer Latinos to 
end-of-life care and challenges associated with the referral process. 
Qualitative data were collected in New Jersey through semistructured, open-ended 
interviews. Six physicians participated in this study: 1 oncologist, 2 
internists, 1 gerontologist, and 2 infectious disease specialists. The study 
reveals that language barriers, level of family involvement, and generational 
group of the patient and the family contribute to the complexity of the 
physician's experience. Physicians' comments evidence the importance of 
culturally competent training in medical school and continued education on this 
topic for physicians who did not receive such training. Bilingual bicultural 
hospice admissions' staff available at the physician's office could enhance the 
referral experience.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences and 
expectations of both women with breast cancer and the health professionals who 
care for them, in relation to the management of menopausal symptoms.
METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory study using a combination of focus groups and 
in depth individual interviews was carried out to collect data from women with 
breast cancer (14) and Health Professionals (15).
KEY RESULTS: A number of categories arose including breast cancer experience, 
menopausal symptoms, seeking support, taking control; with a number of 
contributory factors.
CONCLUSION: The findings illustrated the complexity of supporting women 
experiencing menopausal symptoms following their breast cancer diagnosis. They 
also captured the difficulty women have in isolating these symptoms from their 
experiences of breast cancer and associated management from diagnosis and 
beyond. The results indicate that health professionals are working and reacting 
to individual requests for support in isolation of the team. There is a need to 
assess and manage women both individually and within a multidisciplinary 
context. This would allow complex issues that span across the pre, peri, or 
post-menopausal stages, to be identified and resolved effectively.

BACKGROUND Predicting recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) remains 
difficult.
METHODS: We employed a retrospective cohort design. Granular electronic medical 
record (EMR) data had been collected from patients hospitalized at 21 Kaiser 
Permanente Northern California hospitals. The derivation dataset (2007-2013) 
included data from 9,386 patients who experienced incident CDI (iCDI) and 1,311 
who experienced their first CDI recurrences (rCDI). The validation dataset 
(2014) included data from 1,865 patients who experienced incident CDI and 144 
who experienced rCDI. Using multiple techniques, including machine learning, we 
evaluated more than 150 potential predictors. Our final analyses evaluated 3 
models with varying degrees of complexity and 1 previously published model. 
RESULTS Despite having a large multicenter cohort and access to granular EMR 
data (eg, vital signs, and laboratory test results), none of the models 
discriminated well (c statistics, 0.591-0.605), had good calibration, or had 
good explanatory power. CONCLUSIONS Our ability to predict rCDI remains limited. 
Given currently available EMR technology, improvements in prediction will 
require incorporating new variables because currently available data elements 
lack adequate explanatory power. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol

Measuring nursing care workload in non-intensive cardiac surgery: an 
observational study.

Author information:
(1)School of Nursing, ASL, Roma H, Italy.

BACKGROUND: An understanding of the time nurses spend assessing and meeting 
patients' needs is key to improve nursing outcomes and support organizational 
well-being.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to determine whether the use of an 
assessment scale with some clinical parameters indicative of hemodynamic, 
neurological, respiratory and mobility functions could be able to estimate 
nursing care workload in non-intensive cardiac surgery patients.
METHODS: A correlational descriptive study was designed. Two types of inpatients 
were included in the study: those waiting for cardiac surgery and those who had 
already undergone cardiac surgery. Using specific indicators, patient's clinical 
status was classified in 10 levels of complexity and nursing care interventions 
were divided into three categories: clinical activities, educational activities 
and organizational activities. For each of this categories the correlation 
coefficient between the nursing time and the level of patient's complexity was 
measured.
RESULTS: Per hour of hospitalization, nurses spent an average of 11 minutes and 
49 seconds providing care to each patient. A good correlation coefficient 
between the amount of the nursing time spent for clinical activities and the 
level of patient's complexity was found. Educational activities were minimal 
compared with the clinical and organizational activities, but they were mostly 
conducted during the preoperative phase.
CONCLUSIONS: The assessment scale tested in this study, including some 
information about the patient's clinical status, allowed to estimate clinical 
nursing workload in non-intensive cardiac surgery patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of infection due to 
Escherichia coli sequence type ST131.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING: All healthcare settings in Olmsted County, Minnesota (eg, community 
hospital, tertiary care center, long-term care facilities, and ambulatory 
clinics).
PATIENTS: Ambulatory and hospitalized children and adults with extraintestinal 
E. coli isolates.
METHODS: We analyzed 299 consecutive, nonduplicate extraintestinal E. coli 
isolates submitted to Olmsted County laboratories in February and March 2011. 
ST131 was identified using single-nucleotide polymorphism polymerase chain 
reaction and further evaluated through pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. 
Associated clinical data were abstracted through medical record review.
RESULTS: Most isolates were from urine specimens (90%), outpatients (68%), and 
community-associated infections (61%). ST131 accounted for 27% of isolates 
overall and for a larger proportion of those isolates resistant to 
fluoroquinolones (81%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (42%), gentamicin (79%), 
and ceftriaxone (50%). The prevalence of ST131 increased with age (accounting 
for 5% of isolates from those 11-20 years of age, 26% of isolates from those 
51-60 years of age, and 50% of isolates from those 91-100 years of age). ST131 
accounted for a greater proportion of healthcare-associated isolates (49%) than 
community-associated isolates (15%) and for fully 76% of E. coli isolates from 
long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. Multivariable predictors of ST131 
carriage included older age, LTCF residence, previous urinary tract infection, 
high-complexity infection, and previous use of fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and 
extended-spectrum cephalosporins. With multivariable adjustment, 
ST131-associated infection outcomes included receipt of more than 1 antibiotic 
(odds ratio [OR], 2.54 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-5.17]) and persistent 
or recurrent symptoms (OR, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.08-5.96]). Two globally predominant 
ST131 pulsotypes accounted for 45% of ST131 isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: ST131 is a dominant, antimicrobial-resistant clonal group 
associated with healthcare settings, elderly hosts, and persistent or recurrent 
symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: to identify the average direct cost of maintaining the patency of 
totally implanted central venous catheter with heparin at a Day Hospital of a 
public hospital of high complexity specialized in the treatment of cancer 
patients, and estimate the average direct cost of replacing heparin with sodium 
chloride 0.9%.
METHOD: quantitative, exploratory-descriptive study, with a sample of 200 
non-participant observations of the maintenance of totally implanted central 
venous catheters with heparin. The average direct cost was calculated by 
multiplying the (clocked) time spent by professionals to complete the procedure 
by the direct unit cost of workforce, added to the cost of materials and 
solutions.
RESULTS: the estimated total direct cost of catheter maintenance with heparin 
was US$ 9.71 (SD=1.35) on average, ranging from US$ 7.98 to US$ 23.28. The 
estimated total direct cost of maintenance with 0.9% sodium chloride in the 
place of heparin was US$ 8.81 (SD=1.29) on average, resulting in a reduction of 
US$ 0.90 per procedure.
CONCLUSION: the results contributed to propose strategies to assist in cost 
containment/minimization in this procedure. The replacement of heparin by 0.9% 
sodium chloride proved to be an option to reduce the total average direct cost.

BACKGROUND: Use of oral chemotherapy agents to treat cancer has increased. 
Patients are responsible for adhering to complex regimens while managing 
symptoms from adverse effects of the chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined an intervention to manage symptoms and adherence 
to oral agents.
METHODS: A 3-group pilot study determined how an Automated Voice Response (AVR) 
system alone (n = 40), or the AVR with strategies to manage symptoms and 
adherence (n = 40), or the AVR with strategies to manage adherence (n = 39) 
reduced symptom severity and improved adherence. Participants received a Symptom 
Management Toolkit, completed a baseline interview, and were randomized to 
receive 8 weekly AVR calls. An exit interview occurred at 10 weeks.
RESULTS: Mean age was 59.6 years, with 70% female and 76% white, and 42% were 
nonadherent, with missed doses increasing with regimen complexity. Symptom 
severity declined over time in all groups. No difference was found in adherence 
rates, and higher adherence was related with lower symptom severity across 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence, a significant clinical problem, can affect efficacy of 
the cancer treatment. The AVR intervention alone was just as effective as the 
AVR plus the nurse intervention at promoting adherence and managing symptoms 
from adverse effects.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses need to focus on patient education by ensuring 
patient understanding of oral agent regimen and the need to adhere to the oral 
agent for efficacious cancer treatment. Nurses can promote the use of medication 
reminders and self-management of symptoms from adverse effects, to support 
adherence to the oral agent.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the nature, frequency and factors associated 
with care that was rushed or missed by health care aides in western Canadian 
nursing homes.
BACKGROUND: The growing number of nursing home residents with dementia has 
created job strain for frontline health care providers, the majority of whom are 
health care aides. Due to the associated complexity of care, health care aides 
are challenged to complete more care tasks in less time. Rushed or missed 
resident care are associated with adverse resident outcomes (e.g. falls) and 
poorer quality of staff work life (e.g. burnout) making this an important 
quality of care concern.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of health care aides (n = 583) working in a 
representative sample of nursing homes (30 urban, six rural) in western Canada.
METHODS: Data were collected in 2010 as part of the Translating Research in 
Elder Care study. We collected data on individual health care aides (demographic 
characteristics, job and vocational satisfaction, physical and mental health, 
burnout), unit level characteristics associated with organisational context, 
facility characteristics (location, size, owner/operator model), and the outcome 
variables of rushed and missed resident care.
RESULTS: Most health care aides (86%) reported being rushed. Due to lack of 
time, 75% left at least one care task missed during their previous shift. Tasks 
most frequently missed were talking with residents (52% of health care aides) 
and assisting with mobility (51%). Health care aides working on units with 
higher organisational context scores were less likely to report rushed and 
missed care.
CONCLUSION: Health care aides frequently report care that is rushed and tasks 
omitted due to lack of time.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Considering the resident population in nursing 
homes today--many with advanced dementia and all with complex care needs--health 
care aides having enough time to provide physical and psychosocial care of high 
quality is a critical concern.

Increasing effort in response to a complex workload is detrimental to workers' 
health and may explain the negative health consequences experienced by millions 
of family caregivers who are the primary workforce for older adult care in the 
United States. This cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study used survey 
data from 110 family caregivers of community-dwelling older adults to 
theoretically explain caregiving effort (as perceived exertion) and to examine 
the relationship between effort and depressive symptoms, a particularly 
persistent adverse caregiver health outcome. Visual analog scales and exemplar 
quotes explicated physical, mental, emotional, and time-related effort. Notably, 
effort was considered too multidimensional by several caregivers to discretely 
categorize. Among the relationships tested, effort was statistically 
significantly correlated with workload proxies (time, difficulty, overload), 
caregiver health and depressive symptoms, and care receiver function. Using 
regression analysis, effort and workload did not have direct effects on 
depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, effort was not decreased for caregivers who 
had formal or informal caregiving help. These findings support an energetical 
conceptualization in caregiving and highlight the complexity of a caregiving 
workload assessment. Practice suggestions are offered toward tailored health 
promotion strategies to benefit the families who constitute this essential, 
global caregiving workforce.

BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a 
potential cure for a variety of diseases but is also associated with significant 
risks. With HSCT the donor is either a relative, most often a sibling, or an 
unrelated registry donor.
PURPOSE: The aim was to explore patients' experiences, immediately before 
transplantation, regarding having a sibling as donor.
METHOD: Ten adult patients with sibling donors were interviewed before admission 
for HSCT. The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and 
subjected to qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: The main theme Being in no man's land is a metaphor for the patients' 
complex situation with its mixture of emotions and thoughts prior to 
transplantation. The three subthemes Trust in the sibling donor, Concern about 
others and Loss of control cover the various experiences. The patient's 
experiences are influenced by their personal situation and the quality of the 
relationship with the sibling donor. While patients feel secure in having a 
sibling donor, they are dependent for their survival on the cell donation and 
feel responsible for the donor's safety during donation. These emotions 
intensify the patients' sense of dependency and loss of control.
CONCLUSIONS: In caring for HSCT patients the nurses should be aware of the 
complexity of the patients' situation and keep in mind that having a sibling 
donor might imply extra pressure, including a sense of responsibility. Caring 
for both patients and sibling donors optimally is a challenge, which needs 
further improvement and exploration.

The search for a higher power among terminally ill people with no previous 
religion or belief.

Road, Larbert, Scotland. margery.collin@btinternet.com

In a palliative care setting, there is evidence from the practice of spiritual 
care delivery to suggest that some terminally ill patients may seek, with 
varying degrees of openness and articulation, to connect with a higher power, or 
God, despite having expressed no previous interest in religion or belief. 
Developing a better understanding of the thoughts and feelings of such patients 
requires insight into the initial triggers of their search. In this small 
qualitative study involving six patients, fear, hope, and a natural connection 
are posited as possible prompts. The results highlight the complexity of 
ambivalent feelings toward a transcendent being that can be the focus of anger 
and blame while simultaneously offering a source of comfort and hope for an 
afterlife. Moreover, the study revealed something of the extent to which health 
professionals may feel limited in facilitating necessary discussion by a need to 
protect patients and themselves from entering an unfamiliar and complex area.

What impact do anxiety, depression, perceived control and technology capability 
have on whether patients with chronic heart failure take-up or continue to use 
home tele-monitoring services? Study design of ADaPT-HF.

BACKGROUND: Home tele-monitoring (HTM) is used to monitor the clinical signs and 
symptoms of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) in order to reduce 
unplanned hospital admissions. However, not all patients who are referred will 
agree to use HTM, and some patients choose to withdraw early from its use.
AIMS: ADaPT-HF will investigate whether depression, anxiety, low perceived 
control, reduced technology capability, level of education, age or the severity 
or complexity of a patient's illness can predict refusal of, or early withdrawal 
from, HTM in patients with CHF.
METHODS: The study will recruit 288 patients who have been recently admitted to 
hospital with heart failure who have been referred for HTM. At the time of 
referral, patients will complete depression (nine-item Patient Health 
Questionnaire), anxiety (seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), 
perceived control (eight-item revised Controlled Attitudes Scale) and technology 
capability (ten-item Technology Readiness Index 2.0) screening questionnaires. 
In addition, data on demographics, diagnosis, clinical examination, 
socio-economic status, history of comorbidities, medication, biochemistry and 
haematology will be recorded. The primary outcome will be a composite of refusal 
of or early withdrawal from HTM. The principle analysis will be made using 
logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: By establishing which factors influence a patient's decision to 
refuse or withdraw early from HTM, it may be possible to redesign HTM referral 
processes. It may be that patients with CHF who also have depression, anxiety, 
low control and poor technology skills should not be referred until they receive 
appropriate support or that they should be managed differently when they do 
receive HTM. The results of ADAPT-HF may provide a way of making more efficient 
and cost-effective use of HTM services.

AIM:   This article is a report of a study exploring health-related quality of 
life in adults with congenital heart disease and the extent to which it is 
associated with patients' illness beliefs and emotional health.
BACKGROUND:   A reduction in mortality in patients with congenital heart disease 
has led to an increasingly older population that faces new challenges. Studies 
in a younger adult population have reported inconsistent findings regarding 
health-related quality of life. Factors such as, the complexity of the 
congenital heart defect, have not been found to be associated with quality of 
life. The association between illness beliefs and health-related quality of life 
has not previously been reported.
METHOD:   A cross-sectional questionnaire study of adults with congenital heart 
disease attending an outpatient clinic in a specialist centre in the United 
Kingdom between October 2007 and May 2008.
RESULTS:   The mean age of the study population was 37·2 years. Participants 
reported poorer physical functioning, role functioning and general health than a 
general population. High levels of anxiety were reported in 38% and high levels 
of depression in 17%. In multivariate analysis, higher levels of anxiety and 
depression were associated with poorer mental functioning and higher levels of 
depression with poorer physical quality of life.
CONCLUSION:   We have reported that high levels of anxiety and depression in an 
older population of patients with congenital heart disease are associated with 
poorer quality of life. This highlights the need to routinely assess anxiety and 
depression in this patient group and to provide psychological support 
appropriately.

A qualitative study of recently bereaved people's beliefs about death: 
implications for bereavement care.

Draper P(1), Holloway M, Adamson S.

Author information:
(1)Department of Health Professional Studies, University of Hull, Hull, UK.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the beliefs of recently bereaved people 
about death and to explore the implications of these beliefs for bereavement 
care.
BACKGROUND: Little is known about recently bereaved people's beliefs about 
death, although there is evidence that these beliefs may have an impact on 
health. The funeral provides an opportunity for bereaved people to reflect on 
their beliefs about death.
DESIGN: A qualitative approach.
METHODS: This paper describes one aspect of an interdisciplinary study of the 
spirituality of contemporary funerals. We obtained access to 46 funerals through 
funeral directors and other contacts, and interviewed principal mourners to 
explore their beliefs. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and 
analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Three themes emerged that reflected the beliefs and experiences of 
bereaved people. The first theme describes people's understanding of death in 
terms of five positions: religious, dualist, eco-spiritualist, materialist and 
death-as-transition. The second theme addresses a range of views about the 
possibility of life after death: resurrection, reuniting and reincarnation. The 
third theme describes ways in which people felt that their relationship with the 
deceased person continues after death: continuity as sense of presence and 
continuity as memory, legacy and love. Some people were reluctant to express a 
firm view about death.
CONCLUSIONS: People express a spectrum of beliefs about death. Their beliefs are 
infrequently linked to formal religious or spiritual perspectives but seem to 
have an important role in coping with bereavement.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This is a unique study illustrating the 
complexity of bereaved people's beliefs about death. The study provides a 
research-based framework within which to understand contemporary beliefs about 
death, and contributes to our understanding of how health professionals can 
support recently bereaved people.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of knowledge about sibling stem cell donors' 
experiences pre-donation and the waiting period before the donation might have 
been long. The donors and their corresponding sibling recipients were 
simultaneously included in two different interview studies. The results from the 
recipient study have been presented in a separate paper.
PURPOSE: The aim was to explore the experiences of being a stem cell donor for a 
sibling, prior to donation.
METHOD: Ten adult sibling donors were interviewed prior to stem cell donation. 
The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to 
qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: The main theme Being a cog in a big wheel describes the complex process 
of being a sibling donor prior to donation, covering a mixture of emotions and 
thoughts. The four subthemes Being available, Being anxious, Being concerned and 
Being obliged cover the various experiences. The sibling donors' experiences are 
influenced by the quality of the relationship with the sick sibling.
CONCLUSIONS: Sibling stem cell donors go through a complex process once they 
have accidentally got involved in. They have been asked to become a donor; it 
was not a voluntary choice. In caring for sibling stem cell donors the nurses 
should be aware of the complexity of the process they experience and take into 
consideration their personal situation and needs. Providing optimal care for 
both sibling donors and their corresponding recipients is a challenge, and 
further improvement and exploration are needed.

OBJECTIVE To examine variation in antibiotic coverage and detection of resistant 
pathogens in community-onset pneumonia. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING A 
total of 128 hospitals in the Veterans Affairs health system. PARTICIPANTS 
Hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia from 2009 through 2010. 
METHODS We examined proportions of hospitalizations with empiric antibiotic 
coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (PAER) and with initial detection in blood or respiratory cultures. 
We compared lowest- versus highest-decile hospitals, and we estimated adjusted 
probabilities (AP) for patient- and hospital-level factors predicting coverage 
and detection using hierarchical regression modeling. RESULTS Among 38,473 
hospitalizations, empiric coverage varied widely across hospitals (MRSA lowest 
vs highest, 8.2% vs 42.0%; PAER lowest vs highest, 13.9% vs 44.4%). Detection 
rates also varied (MRSA lowest vs highest, 0.5% vs 3.6%; PAER lowest vs highest, 
0.6% vs 3.7%). Whereas coverage was greatest among patients with recent 
hospitalizations (AP for anti-MRSA, 54%; AP for anti-PAER, 59%) and long-term 
care (AP for anti-MRSA, 60%; AP for anti-PAER, 66%), detection was greatest in 
patients with a previous history of a positive culture (AP for MRSA, 7.9%; AP 
for PAER, 11.9%) and in hospitals with a high prevalence of the organism in 
pneumonia (AP for MRSA, 3.9%; AP for PAER, 3.2%). Low hospital complexity and 
rural setting were strong negative predictors of coverage but not of detection. 
CONCLUSIONS Hospitals demonstrated widespread variation in both coverage and 
detection of MRSA and PAER, but probability of coverage correlated poorly with 
probability of detection. Factors associated with empiric coverage (eg, 
healthcare exposure) were different from those associated with detection (eg, 
microbiology history). Providing microbiology data during empiric antibiotic 
decision making could better align coverage to risk for resistant pathogens and 
could promote more judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Infect Control

Power relations in patient's experiences of suffering during treatment for 
cancer.

Author information:
(1)Division of Nursing, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, 
Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden. lotta.saarnio@ki.se

AIM: This paper is a report of how patients who have cancer experience suffering 
in the context of power relations.
BACKGROUND: Many studies in Sweden and in other countries have detected 
inequality in healthcare use and resources, including unseen influences that can 
be connected to gender and distribution of resources. Few studies have examined 
how multiple relations of power - such as gender, ethnicity, age and education - 
influence how people with cancer experience suffering during treatment.
METHOD: A hermeneutic design was used. Qualitative interviews were conducted 
with 12 women and 14 men receiving treatment for a variety of cancer diagnoses. 
The data collection was done at two hospitals in Sweden during 2008-2009. The 
interpretation of data was based on two theoretical perspectives - suffering and 
intersectionality.
RESULTS: The results highlight patients suffering where two or more positions of 
power relations interacted with each other. Three main themes were identified: 
the complexity of control, the vulnerable effects of body changes, and the 
internal battle of survival.
CONCLUSION: A vulnerable social situation for people with cancer concretely 
increased their suffering. Social inequalities, seemingly linked to social 
hierarchy, increased the suffering of people with cancer. For example, women 
with cancer with a low education belonging to an ethnic minority suffered more 
than highly educated patients belonging to the ethnic majority.

The wicked question answered: positive deviance delivers patient-centered care.

Gary JC(1).

Author information:
(1)Jodie C. Gary, PhD, RN, has more than 20 years of healthcare experience, 
including field emergency medical management (from emergency dispatch to 
paramedic), clinical and laboratory research experience, and hospital-based 
primary care nursing including supervisory positions in telemetry and critical 
care. Her primary research is aimed at bedside nursing practice and the delivery 
of patient-centered care within the framework of Complexity Science. Currently, 
she is a faculty member for the Texas A&M University Health Science Center 
College of Nursing. She teaches adult health/medical-surgical and research 
didactic contact as well as in clinical content in the acute care setting.

BACKGROUND: How nurses respond when faced with the dilemma of providing 
patient-centered care in the absence of patient-centered practice guidelines 
remains relatively unreported. Standards may not be available to guide nurses or 
may not be realistic for implementation at the point of care. Nurses may be 
forced to react creatively to meet the needs of their patients.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to understand nursing care when standard practice 
guidelines did not meet patient-specific care needs and to develop various 
viewpoints related to the use of positive deviance in providing patient-centered 
care.
METHODS: Complexity theory and the framework of a wicked question were used to 
guide a 3-round online national Delphi study from November 2011 to February 
2012. The panel was accessed through the American Association of Critical Care 
Nurses to expose the care provided when standard practice guidelines were 
lacking.
RESULTS: Findings support the presence of positive deviance and expose care 
provided by nurses when standard practice guidelines lacked the ability to 
provide patient-centered care. Dominant themes of positive deviance are 
recommended as priorities for future research.
DISCUSSION: Better guidelines are needed that work for nurses, instead of 
against them, that would not force a nurse into actions that are not patient 
centered. Guidelines should guide practice and assist in allowing nurses to 
provide care that is centered on the best needs of the patient in the specific 
care situation.

BACKGROUND: To improve patients' quality of life (QoL) we need to identify 
modifiable determinants, such as illness perceptions. Patients' illness 
perceptions are known to regulate emotional responses and health-behaviour. 
Illness perceptions comprise several components: consequences, control, 
coherence, changeability and emotional representations.
AIMS: To examine (a) the relation between patient characteristics and illness 
perceptions, and (b) the independent predictive value of illness perceptions for 
future QoL.
METHODS: A longitudinal study in 845 patients with congenital heart disease was 
conducted. Patients completed three questionnaires: the IPQ-R (illness 
perceptions) and two years later the SF-36 and TAAQOL-CHD (QoL). Linear 
regression analyses were performed relating illness perceptions to patient 
characteristics (sex, age, disease complexity and functional status) and QoL.
RESULTS: Patients with a complex defect or poor functional status reported poor 
illness perceptions. Independent of patient characteristics, poor illness 
perceptions (i.e. a strong belief that the illness has severe consequences; a 
weak belief that you have a coherent illness understanding and that the illness 
can be controlled by treatment; and a strong belief that the illness is 
changeable and causes negative emotions) were predictive of future QoL.
CONCLUSION: Illness perceptions independently predict QoL, suggesting that QoL 
may be improved by altering patients' beliefs about their illness. For example, 
increasing patients' knowledge regarding their disease and informing them about 
treatment opportunities may enhance their QoL.

BACKGROUND: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their 
increased risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In 
the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been 
developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made 
care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a 
general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care 
process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has 
shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its 
implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach 
is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and 
frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating 
factors and barriers.
DESIGN: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design.
SETTINGS: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: Practice nurses (n=7), GPs (n=12), occupational therapists (n=6) 
and physical therapists (n=20) participated in the process evaluation. 
Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (≥ 70 years) were 
included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, 
were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were 
unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded.
METHODS: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from 
all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with 
a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare 
professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four 
focus group discussions.
RESULTS: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, 
healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care 
approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric 
primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older 
people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in 
handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the 
interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the 
implementation of the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging 
and some parts of the protocol need special attention.

Chronic back pain is globally acknowledged as a common reason why people seek 
help from health professionals. The complexity of persistent chronic pain can 
undermine the person's self-esteem and present a number of challenges to an 
individual's ability to manage their pain. Multi-professional person-centered 
care is advocated as a key strategy to support people with chronic back pain. 
However, the impact of these approaches on restoring the person's independence 
is unclear, and little is known about whether and how person-centered approaches 
restore autonomy and influence the person's ability to manage their pain. The 
aim of this grounded theory study was to generate understanding about 
person-centered care from the perspectives of people with chronic back pain and 
the multi-professional teams who cared for them. Semi-structured interviews were 
used to collect data from 17 people with chronic back pain over one year. A 
constant comparative analytical approach identified five key categories: the 
skeptical professional, validation, becoming a person, regaining control, and 
restoring faith. These categories formed the "conditional partnership" as a 
theory to explain person-centered care, which related to the way in which the 
partnership developed between the patients and teams. The findings suggest that 
person-centered care was influenced by the participants' need to be believed and 
the relationship developed with health care providers. Crucially, these findings 
suggest that legitimizing the pain experience through person-centered approaches 
to care can empower people with chronic back pain to regain control of their 
lives and their pain.

Potential prescription drug misuse in assisted living.

Castle NG, Handler SM, Wagner LM.

Prescription drug misuse among older adults includes inappropriate and harmful 
use of these drugs. In this study, prescription drug misuse in assisted living 
settings as reported by direct care workers (DCWs) was examined. Data came from 
DCWs in 45 assisted living settings located in Pennsylvania. A total of 944 DCWs 
completed a questionnaire on their opinions of prescription drug misuse. DCWs 
believed most assisted living residents take prescription medications. In 
addition, 10% of DCWs observed or had evidence that residents used unnecessarily 
high doses, 30% were preoccupied with the cost of prescription drugs, and 26% 
had problems understanding the complexity of their drug treatment regimen. 
Prescription drug misuse may be a problem of importance in assisted living 
settings. Assisted living has experienced rapid growth in capacity, yet the 
ability of these settings and their residents to manage prescription drugs may 
not have kept pace with this growth.

OBJECTIVE: to investigate the factors associated with mortality in patients 
undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in a cardiovascular referral hospital 
in Santa Catarina.
METHOD: quantitative, exploratory, descriptive and retrospective study. The 
medical records of 1447 patients, from 2005 to 2013, were analyzed for 
statistically related variables, these being: profile, hospitalization 
diagnosis, risk factors for coronary artery disease, complications recorded 
during the hospitalization, length of hospitalization and cause of death.
RESULTS: the mortality rate was 5.3% during the study period. Death was more 
common in females and those of black skin color, with a mean age of 65 years. 
Acute myocardial infarction was the most common hospitalization diagnosis. The 
majority of the complications recorded during hospitalization were characterized 
by changes in the cardiovascular system, with longer hospitalization periods 
being directly related to death from septic shock.
CONCLUSION: the data provide subsidies for nursing work with preventive measures 
and early detection of complications associated with coronary artery bypass 
grafting. This reinforces the importance of using the data as quality 
indicators, aiming to guarantee care guided by reliable information to guide 
managers in planning patient care and high complexity health services.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of chronic heart failure management 
programmes (CHF-MPs) according to a scoring algorithm used to quantify the level 
of applied interventions-the Heart Failure Intervention Score (HF-IS).
BACKGROUND: The overall efficacy of heart failure programmes has been proven in 
several meta-analyses. However, the debate continues as to which components are 
essential in a heart failure programme to improve patient outcomes.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of patients participating in heart failure 
programmes.
METHOD: Forty-eight of 62 (77%) programmes in Australia participating in a 
national register of CHF-MPs were evaluated using the HF-IS: derived from a 
summed and weighted score of each intervention applied by the CHF-MP (27 
interventions overall). The CHF-MPs were prospectively categorised as relatively 
low (HF-IS < 190 - n = 39 programmes & 407 patients) or high (HF-IS ≥ 190 - n = 
9 programmes & 166 patients) in complexity. Six-month morbidity and mortality 
rates in 573 consecutively recruited patients with systolic dysfunction and in 
New York Heart Association Class II-IV were prospectively examined.
RESULTS: Patients exposed to CHF-MPs with a high HF-IS had a lower rate of 
unplanned, all-cause hospitalisation (n = 24, 14% vs. n = 102, 25%) compared 
with CHF-MPs with a low HF-IS within six months. On an adjusted basis, CHF-MPs 
with a high HF-IS were associated with a reduced risk of unplanned 
hospitalisation and/or death within six months and remained event-free longer.
CONCLUSION: High complexity CHF-MPs applying more evidence-based interventions 
are associated with a higher event-free survival over six months.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The HF-IS is an easy-to-use evidence-based tool 
to assist programme coordinators to improve the quality of their heart failure 
programme which may also improve patient outcomes.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore nurse perceptions of the feasibility of 
integrating the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale into practice within the 
inpatient palliative care setting.
BACKGROUND: Delirium occurs frequently in palliative care inpatient populations, 
yet is under-recognised. Exploring feasibility of delirium screening tools in 
this setting can provide insights into how recognition can be improved.
DESIGN: This was a qualitative study using a focus group methodology.
METHOD: Four semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 21 nurses working 
in two Australian palliative care units. Focus groups were digitally recorded 
and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the 
data.
RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: (1) Delirium screening using the 
Nursing Delirium Screening Scale is feasible, but then what? (2) Nuances, 
ambiguity and clinical complexity; and (3) Implementing structured processes 
requires firmer foundations. Themes describe how nurses perceived the Nursing 
Delirium Screening Scale to be an easy and brief screening tool which raised 
their awareness of delirium. They were largely willing to adopt it into 
practice, yet had uncertainty and misunderstandings of the tool specifically and 
delirium screening generally, application in a palliative care context, 
interventions for delirium and impact of screening on medical practice.
CONCLUSION: The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale is feasible for use in a 
palliative care inpatient setting, but requires investigation of its 
psychometric properties before routine use in this patient population.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses require understanding of delirium, 
tailored guidance and a united approach with doctors to support their effective 
use of a delirium screening tool in the palliative care unit. Delirium practice 
change in this setting will also require nurses to become more active leaders 
and collaborators within their interdisciplinary teams.

Long-Term Care Nurse Residency Program: Evaluation of New Nurse Experiences and 
Lessons Learned.

Salmond SW, Cadmus E, Black KK, Bohnarczyk N, Hassler L.

Transitioning to long-term care environments presents a significant challenge 
for new nurses and their directors of nursing. The complexity of this 
environment, instability of the workforce, and the lack of support structures 
frequently affect a new nurse's decision not to apply to long-term care, but to 
look for positions in acute care hospitals. To address these issues, a long-term 
care new nurse residency program was developed, implemented, and evaluated in 
New Jersey through the work of the New Jersey Action Coalition. The purpose of 
this study was to determine the effects of the residency program on new nurses' 
confidence, competence, retention, job satisfaction, and perceptions of 
organizational safety. J Contin Educ Nurs. 2017;48(10):474-484.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse patient and professional perceptions about (in)equity of 
care and rehabilitation of chronic pain patients from primary health care to 
assessment at a specialty rehabilitation clinic.
SETTING AND METHODS: This qualitative study consists one focus group interview 
with eight general practitioners who refer patients to pain rehabilitation 
clinics, 10 individual interviews with patients who were assessed at a pain 
rehabilitation clinic and seven interviews with professionals participating in 
multimodal assessment teams at a pain rehabilitation clinic. Interview analysis 
was conducted by the grounded theory method.
RESULTS: The core category Via Dolorosa, the way of suffering and pain, captured 
how gender and sociocultural context may contribute to advantages and 
disadvantages during patient journeys from primary health care to a pain 
rehabilitation clinic. Patients and professionals perceived pain as a 
low-ranking illness, and women and men used different gendered strategies to 
legitimise the pain and to be taken seriously. Being 'a proper patient ready to 
change' and having 'likeness' between patients and professionals were viewed as 
advantageous in rehabilitation of pain patients. Patients with higher 
educational levels were perceived as easier to interact with and had better 
access to health care. Professional thoughts about gender norms influenced the 
rehabilitation options. The rehabilitation programme was seen by several 
professionals to be better suited for women than men, which could lead to 
unequal care.
CONCLUSION: From an equity and gender perspective, our study highlights the 
complexity in rehabilitation of chronic pain patients - both from patient and 
professional perspectives. Awareness of gendered and the biased preconceptions 
and norms is crucial when professionals struggle to offer equitable health care 
and rehabilitation.

Factors influencing the adoption of home telecare by elderly or chronically ill 
people: a national survey.

j.peeters@nivel.nl

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The primary aim is to provide insight into client 
characteristics and characteristics of home telecare contacts, which may 
influence the adoption of home telecare. Secondary aim is to examine the 
applicability of four perceived attributes in Rogers' diffusion of innovations 
theory, which may influence the adoption: relative advantage, compatibility, 
complexity and observability.
BACKGROUND: Western countries face strongly increasing healthcare demands. At 
the same time, a growing nursing shortage exists. The use of home telecare may 
be instrumental in improving independence and safety and can provide support to 
older and chronically ill people, but a precondition for its uptake is that 
clients consider it as a useful and helpful technological tool.
DESIGN: A survey conducted among clients of seven home care organisations in the 
Netherlands connected to a home telecare system.
METHODS: In 2007, a postal questionnaire was distributed to 468 older or 
chronically ill clients: 254 responded (54%). The data were analysed by 
regression techniques, employing a theoretical model.
RESULTS: This study showed that clients' perceived attributes - relative 
advantage, compatibility, complexity and observability - have a significant 
effect on adoption of home telecare explaining 61% of the variance. The chance 
of adoption is higher when a client already receives long-term personal and/or 
nursing care, he/she lives alone and when there are fixed daily contacts via the 
home telecare system. The perception of possible benefits can still be enhanced.
CONCLUSIONS:   The concept of perceived attributes, derived from Rogers' 
diffusion of innovation theory, has been useful to explain clients' adoption of 
home telecare.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Home care organisations can best focus on 
clients already in care and people living alone, in offering home telecare. 
Nurses, who aim to enhance the client's adoption of home telecare, have to take 
into account clients' perceived attributes of such new technology.

Uncertainty in illness among patients with chronic heart failure is less in 
person-centred care than in usual care.

Dudas K(1), Olsson LE, Wolf A, Swedberg K, Taft C, Schaufelberger M, Ekman I.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Many patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) experience 
uncertainty regarding the treatment and characteristics of their illness. 
Person-centred care (PCC) emphasizes patient involvement in care. We have 
previously shown that PCC improved outcomes such as length of hospital stay and 
activities of daily living in patients with CHF. The impact of PCC on 
self-reported uncertainty in illness among patients hospitalized for CHF is 
still unknown.
AIM: To evaluate whether PCC is associated with less self-reported uncertainty 
in illness compared with usual care in patients hospitalized for worsening CHF.
METHODS: Using a controlled before-and-after design, eligible CHF patients were 
assigned to either a usual care group or a PCC intervention group. 
Patient-reported uncertainty in illness was assessed at hospital discharge with 
the Cardiovascular Population Scale (CPS). The CPS consists of two domains: 1) 
Ambiguity (about illness severity); and 2) Complexity (of treatment and system 
of care).
RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients were included in the study; 123 in 
the usual care group and 125 in the PCC intervention. The PCC group had better 
scores than the usual care group in the CPS domains complexity (M=15.2, SD=4.7 
vs. M=16.8, SD=4.7; p=0.020) and ambiguity (M=27.8, SD=6.6 vs. M=29.8, SD=6.9; 
p=0.041).
CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF were less uncertain in their illness after PCC, 
which may help to equip and empower patients to manage their illness. Together 
with earlier findings of shortened hospital stay and improved activities of 
daily living, this indicates that PCC should be a standard approach for hospital 
care of patients with worsening CHF.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Older Adults: Part I: Case Study.

Brandt NJ, Cook H.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a distressing respiratory 
disease that may greatly impact a patient's quality of life. Although many 
treatment options exist, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
Disease Guidelines outline management strategies based on severity of daily 
symptoms and exacerbations. Although it is important to weigh the risks and 
benefits of medication use, involvement of patients in their overall care plan 
is imperative to optimal outcomes. According to recent studies, the prevalence 
of COPD in older adults is increasing, along with the complexity of care due to 
comorbidities, drug interactions, and side effects. A thorough evaluation of a 
patient case provides insight into the everyday challenges of COPD management.

Patient participation in the medical decision-making process in 
haemato-oncology--a qualitative study.

Cancer patients are showing increased interest in shared decision-making. 
Patients with haematological illnesses, however, express considerably less 
desire for shared decision-making as compared with other oncological patient 
groups. The goal of the current project was to identify the reasons for the 
lower desire for shared decision-making among patients with haematological 
illness. We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 11 
haematological patients (39-70 years old) after the beginning of therapy 
concerning the course and evaluation of medical shared decision-making. The 
patients were often overwhelmed by the complexity of the illness and the therapy 
and did not want to assume any responsibility in medical decision-making. They 
reported a great deal of distress and very traditional paternalistic role 
expectations with regards to their health care providers, which limited the 
patients' ability to partake in the decision-making process. In contrast to the 
socio-cultural support for many other oncological diseases, haematological 
diseases are not as well supported, e.g. there is a lack of self-help materials, 
systematic provision of information and support groups for patients, which may 
be related to a lower empowerment of this patient population. Results show the 
limits of patient participation in the context of highly complicated medical 
conditions. In addition to already researched preferences of the physicians and 
patients for shared decision-making, future research should pay greater 
attention to the process and other variables relevant to this aspect of the 
doctor-patient relationship.

Why take part in personalised cancer research? Patients' genetic misconception, 
genetic responsibility and incomprehension of stratification-an 
empirical-ethical examination.

Therapeutic misconception is a well-known challenge for informed decision-making 
for cancer research participants. What is still missing, is a detailed 
understanding of the impact of "personalised" treatment research (e.g. 
biomarkers for stratification) on research participants. For this, we conducted 
the first longitudinal empirical-ethical study based on semi-structured 
interviews with colorectal cancer patients (n = 40) enrolled in a biomarker 
trial for (neo)adjuvant treatment, analysing the patients' understanding of and 
perspectives on research and treatment with qualitative methods. In addition to 
therapeutic misconception based on patients' confusion of research and 
treatment, and here triggered by misled motivation, information paternalism or 
incomprehension, we identified genetic misconception and genetic responsibility 
as new problematic issues. Patients mainly were not aware of the major research 
aim of future stratification into responders and non-responders nor did they 
fully acknowledge this as the aim for personalised cancer research. Thus, 
ethical and practical reflection on informed decision-making in cancer treatment 
and research should take into account the complexity of lay interpretations of 
modern personalised medicine. Instead of very formalistic, liability-oriented 
informed consent procedures, we suggest a more personalised communication 
approach to inform and motivate patients for cancer research.

Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments can be used to 
alleviate the symptoms of fibromyalgia, although none of them are completely 
effective at present. In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of different 
therapies in three groups of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The sample for 
this randomized controlled trial was made up of 66 people diagnosed with 
fibromyalgia in southern Catalonia. In turn, this sample was divided into three 
groups of 22 participants each, who were treated with: i) cervical infiltration 
with botulinum toxin, ii) group problem-solving therapy, or iii) both therapies. 
The variables recorded were quality of life, suicidal thoughts, perception of 
pain, quality of sleep, and satisfaction. Female patients composed 96.9% 
(n = 64) of the study sample. Satisfaction with the infiltration was 5.1 ± 2.7 
points, while in group problem-solving therapy it was 6.6 ± 3.2. Self-perceived 
health in the infiltration group (p = .016) and the therapy group (p = .001) 
improved after the intervention took place. The risk of suicide decreased in the 
both treatments/groups (p = .049). Pain was reduced by 31.8% with infiltration, 
13.6% with therapy, and 22.7% with both treatments. Anxiety/depression decreased 
by 45% with therapy, 36.3% with infiltration, and 36.3% with both treatments. 
The results also showed that the use of both treatments significantly reduces 
suicidal thoughts (p = .049). In conclusion, this study showed the complexity of 
reducing chronic pain and increasing the quality of life of people with 
fibromyalgia.

AIM: To explore older men's prehospital experiences of their first myocardial 
infarction (MI).
BACKGROUND: The delay between the onset of symptoms to the initiation of medical 
care is a major determinant of prognosis in MI. The majority of people 
experiencing MI are men. But few studies have been conducted solely on men's 
experiences before seeking medical care for MI. The objective of this study was 
to explore older men's experiences of symptoms and their reasoning during the 
prehospital phase of their first MI.
METHOD: Data collection was carried out through individual interviews with 20 
men representing the age range 65-80 (mean 71) years. The participants were 
interviewed 3 days after admission for a confirmed first MI. The interviews were 
designed to prompt the men to describe their symptoms and their reasoning up to 
the decision to seek care. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse 
the interviews.
FINDINGS: The prehospital phase in older men was found to be a complex and 
extended journey. The symptoms were perceived from diffuse ill-being to a 
cluster of alarming symptoms. The participants dealt with conceptions about MI 
symptoms. They were unsure about the cause of their symptoms, which did not 
correspond to their expectations about an MI, and whether they should seek 
medical care. They had difficulty making the final decision to seek care and 
strived to maintain a normal life. They initially tried to understand, reduce or 
treat the symptoms by themselves. The decision to seek medical care preceded a 
movement from uncertainty to conviction.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding older men's prehospital experiences of MI is 
essential to reduce their patient decision times. This requires knowledge about 
the complexity and dynamic evolvement of symptoms, beliefs and strategies to 
maintain an ordinary life.

Understanding the complex role of a hospice spiritual counselor.

Lillis BS(1).

Author information:
(1)1McLean Hospice, Simsbury, CT, USA.

Hospice's professional roles in end-of-life care can be widely misunderstood by 
physicians, patients, and family members as well as others who do not work 
directly with them. The role of the spiritual counselor may be the most 
misunderstood due to the nature of this professional title. Hospice care at the 
end of life is holistic in that it is important to meet physical, emotional, and 
spiritual needs of the patient and their family. In order to provide the most 
complete and beneficial end-of-life care, it is important to understand the 
complexity and the importance of the role of the spiritual counselor.

This study, which is a part of action research, aims to explore how supportive 
communication can impact individuals' adaptation to a permanent colostomy in a 
Chinese cultural context. Two Chinese rectal cancer patients with complexity and 
difficulty in living with a permanent colostomy were selected using a 
qualitative case study approach. The researcher (H.T.) interacted with the 
participants along their journey from the preoperative period until the third 
postoperative month after discharge via face-to-face or telephone interviews. 
Content analysis was applied. Supportive communication was characterized by 
"communication as a supportive tool," which consisted of 4 elements: respect, 
description, empathy, and empowerment. The nursing strategies included (1) 
developing a collaborative relationship with patients and families; (2) 
understanding patients' concerns and problems; (3) discussing potential 
solutions; (4) encouraging patients to take action; (5) bringing out emotional 
expression; (6) normalizing negative emotions; and (7) protecting hope. The 
findings of this study informed that supportive communication is a valuable tool 
for nurses to provide informational and emotional support to Chinese patients in 
order to enhance their adaptation to living with a permanent colostomy. 
Developing an operational manual to enhance supportive communication for 
patients with colostomy is suggested.

Pressure ulcer knowledge in medical residents: an opportunity for improvement.

Levine JM(1), Ayello EA, Zulkowski KM, Fogel J.

USA.

With the aging population and increasing complexity of patients with pressure 
ulcers (PrUs), as well as regulatory requirements, PrUs have become an important 
concern for physicians. Although there are some studies that measure nurses' 
knowledge of PrUs, there is a paucity of literature about physician knowledge of 
PrUs. Given that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is holding 
physicians accountable for documenting PrU status on admission to hospitals and 
the increased need for collaboration with revisions to long-term-care 
documentation MDS 3.0: Skin Condition, physicians' knowledge regarding PrUs 
takes on new urgency. This study reports on PrU knowledge of physicians using 2 
tools: the Pieper Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Tool and a wound photograph test. 
Physicians' mean scores of 69% on the Pieper Tool were well below average scores 
of nurses' 76%. Physicians had greatest difficulty identifying suspected deep 
tissue injury and unstageable ulcers. Pressure ulcer content, including 
prevention, identification, staging, and treatment, needs to be included in 
physician education.

PURPOSE: This article describes the evaluation of the implementation of a 
nursing intervention, that is, the Systematic Activation Method (SAM), among 
inpatients with late life depression (LLD).
METHODS: A qualitative study in four clinical units for old age psychiatry.
RESULTS: We identified facilitators and barriers relating to patient and nurse 
characteristics, as well as to contextual factors, from the perspective of 
mental health nurses. The nature of the LLD and the quality of the therapeutic 
relationship were major aspects that affected the implementation of the SAM.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Given the complexity of the implementation process, 
careful supervision and monitoring, with the active participation of management 
and the multidisciplinary team, are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Reducing patient delay for patients afflicted by an acute myocardial 
infarction is a task of great complexity, which might be alleviated if more 
factors that influence this delay could be identified. Although a number of 
self-reported instruments associated with patient delay exist, none of these 
taps the content of the appraisal process related to patients' subjective 
emotions.
AIM: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire aimed at 
assessing patients' appraisal, emotions and action tendencies when afflicted by 
an acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: An item pool was generated based on themes conceptualized in a recent 
qualitative study of acute myocardial infarction patients' thoughts, feelings 
and actions preceding the decision to seek medical care. The 'Think-Aloud 
Protocol' and test-retest analysis at item level were performed. The modified 
item pool was administered to 96 patients when treated for acute myocardial 
infarction. Explorative factor analysis and principal component analysis with 
the non-linear iterative partial least squares algorithm were performed to 
examine the underlying factor structure of the items.
RESULTS: The findings indicated three core dimensions corresponding to three 
subscales, namely, 'symptom appraisal'; 'perceived inability to act'; 'autonomy 
preservation'. The results demonstrated acceptable measures of reliability and 
validity Conclusions: The PA-AMI questionnaire demonstrated satisfactory 
psychometric properties. Assessment of the included core dimensions may 
contribute to greater understanding of the appraisal processes for patients 
afflicted by an acute myocardial infarction.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this cohort study was to evaluate the effect of a 1-year 
intervention of an electronic medical record wound care template on the 
completeness of wound care documentation and medical coding compared to a 
similar time interval for the fiscal year preceding the intervention.
METHODS: From October 1, 2006, to September 30, 2007, a "good wound care" 
intervention was implemented at a rural Veterans Affairs facility to prevent 
amputations in veterans with diabetes and foot ulcers. The study protocol 
included a template with foot ulcer variables embedded in the electronic medical 
record to facilitate data collection, support clinical decision making, and 
improve ordering and medical coding.
RESULTS: The intervention group showed significant differences in complete 
documentation of good wound care compared to the historic control group (χ = 
15.99, P < .001), complete documentation of coding for diagnoses and procedures 
(χ = 30.23, P < .001), and complete documentation of both good wound care and 
coding for diagnoses and procedures (χ = 14.96, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: An electronic wound care template improved documentation of 
evidence-based interventions and facilitated coding for wound complexity and 
procedures.

Elders adapting to a chronic diagnosis within a nursing refuge.

Hegge M(1), Dinndorf-Hogenson G.

Author information:
(1)South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD, USA. margaret.hegge@sdstate.edu

The increasing numbers of people seeking care for chronic disease has placed 
unparalleled demands on nurses who journey with them as they grasp the meaning 
of their altered health status. The complexity of the newly diagnosed chronic 
disease can be overwhelming. Newly diagnosed elder patients need a refuge in 
which to explore the uncertainties and challenges in managing a chronic illness. 
Reactions to a new diagnosis are uniquely shaped by the elder person's culture, 
age, life circumstances, and previous coping strategies. Six dichotomous 
response pairs are posed: relief versus devastation, courage versus cowardice, 
disease obsession versus disease aversion, rational thinking versus intuition, 
reawakening versus stuck, and self-reliance versus dependence. Nurses can create 
a sanctuary for elderly patients with protected space, presence, partnership, 
past to future orientation, and perspective on life. Nurses who embrace this 
mission may find themselves returning to the reasons they sought a nursing 
career, to support and strengthen elderly people in the most vulnerable moments 
of their lives.

Prevention of functional decline in older hospitalized patients: nurses should 
play a key role in safe and adequate care.

Hoogerduijn JG(1), Grobbee DE, Schuurmans MJ.

Author information:
(1)Research Group Care for the Chronically Ill, University of Applied Sciences 
Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

This paper presents a discussion of knowledge and awareness regarding prevention 
of functional decline in older hospitalized patients. Functional decline is 
experienced by 30-60% of the older hospitalized patients, resulting in decreased 
independence and other adverse health outcomes. One literature study and four 
cohort studies (total n = 1628) were conducted to develop and validate an 
instrument to identify older hospitalized patients at risk for functional 
decline. An evidence-based best practice was developed to improve the quality of 
care for older patients. This paper shows the relevance and the complexity of 
this problem and shows that patients at risk can be recognized by four simple 
questions. Due to their ability to observe and guide patients and their 24-h 
patient supervision, nurses should play a key role in strategies to prevent 
functional decline. Nurses should assess the geriatric needs in patients at risk 
and based on these initiate and coordinate multi-professional interventions. 
Given the growing number of older people in western society and the growing need 
for care, action to prevent functional decline cannot be withheld. Knowledge of 
the ageing process, implementation of an evidence-based programme and a 
multidisciplinary approach is a basic ingredient to prevent functional decline.

Facilitators and barriers to safe emergency department transitions for community 
dwelling older people with dementia and their caregivers: a social ecological 
study.

BACKGROUND: Internationally, older adults visit the ED at a rate higher than 
other age groups. Little attention has been given to ED care for older people 
with dementia, although concern for such care is growing with the increasing 
number of individuals worldwide affected by this significant disabling problem. 
It is critical to understand ED transitional processes and consequences because 
the complexity of dementia care poses multiple challenges to optimizing safety, 
effectiveness and quality of care during admission, assessment, and treatment in 
this setting.
METHOD: Using an interpretive, descriptive exploratory design with three 
iterative, interrelated phases, we conducted interviews, created a photographic 
narrative journal (PNJ), and finally held photo elicitation focus groups to 
identify factors that facilitate or impede safe transitional care for community 
dwelling older adults with dementia in two Canadian emergency departments, and 
to identify practice solutions for nurses. We purposively sampled to recruit ten 
older adult-family caregiver dyads, ten ED RNs, and four Nurse Practitioners. 
Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis.
RESULTS: Four interconnected reinforcing consequences emerged from our analysis: 
being under-triaged; waiting and worrying about what was wrong; time pressure 
with lack of attention to basic needs; and, relationships and interactions 
leading to feeling ignored, forgotten and unimportant. Together these 
consequences stem from a triage system that does not recognize atypical 
presentation of disease and illness. This potentiated a cascade of vulnerability 
in older people with dementia and their caregivers. Nurses experienced time 
pressure challenges that impeded their ability to be responsive to basic care 
needs.
CONCLUSIONS: In an aging population where dementia is becoming more prevalent, 
the unit of care in the ED must include both the older person and their family 
caregiver. Negative reinforcing consequences can be interrupted when nurses 
communicate and engage more regularly with the older adult-caregiver dyad to 
build trust. System changes are also needed to support the ability of nurses to 
carry out best practices.

Ethical considerations on the value of patient knowledge in long-term care: a 
qualitative study of patients suffering from Korsakoff 's syndrome.

AIM: This study explores experiences of patients suffering from Korsakoff's 
syndrome. It contributes to improved reflection on the value of patient 
knowledge.
BACKGROUND: An ethics of care perspective states the importance of moving to 
patients in their vulnerable state of being, and to figure out patients' 
individual needs necessary to provide good care. The information given by 
patients suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome might be mistaken, invented and 
even not true. The value of these patients' experiences and knowledge had not 
been researched to date.
METHOD: Data from six in-depth interviews were analysed concurrently through the 
constant comparative method.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The principles of voluntariness, confidentiality and 
anonymity were respected during the research process.
FINDINGS: Four important themes within patients' knowledge emerged: health 
condition, involuntary admission into the nursing home, the daily routine and 
interpretation of the caring abilities of healthcare professionals. The findings 
show that our respondents were able to provide a window into their inner 
perspective.
CONCLUSION: This study deepens our understanding of the value of patient 
knowledge in situations where patients see the world in a different manner as do 
healthcare professionals. The conversations revealed personal subjective 
knowledge which our respondents create and live by. Healthcare professionals are 
encouraged to discover and affirm the understandings of these patients, and not 
be prepossessed due to the diagnosis or general nursing home rules. 
Understanding patients' unique knowledge through appreciation of the complexity 
and richness of different views on the situation can assist to give a more 
humane response to individual needs and pain. Health staff in healthcare 
institutions are encouraged to evaluate the - unintended - effect of rigidly 
applied nursing home rules, and the government is challenged to rethink its 
policy about care, and provide more resources permitting relational care that 
nurtures the dignity of patients suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome.

BACKGROUND Valid comparison between hospitals for benchmarking or 
pay-for-performance incentives requires accurate correction for underlying 
disease severity (case-mix). However, existing models are either very simplistic 
or require extensive manual data collection. OBJECTIVE To develop a disease 
severity prediction model based solely on data routinely available in electronic 
health records for risk-adjustment in mechanically ventilated patients. DESIGN 
Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS Mechanically ventilated patients from a 
single tertiary medical center (2006-2012). METHODS Predictors were extracted 
from electronic data repositories (demographic characteristics, laboratory 
tests, medications, microbiology results, procedure codes, and comorbidities) 
and assessed for feasibility and generalizability of data collection. Models for 
in-hospital mortality of increasing complexity were built using logistic 
regression. Estimated disease severity from these models was linked to rates of 
ventilator-associated events. RESULTS A total of 20,028 patients were initiated 
on mechanical ventilation, of whom 3,027 deceased in hospital. For models of 
incremental complexity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
ranged from 0.83 to 0.88. A simple model including demographic characteristics, 
type of intensive care unit, time to intubation, blood culture sampling, 8 
common laboratory tests, and surgical status achieved an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.86-0.88) with adequate 
calibration. The estimated disease severity was associated with occurrence of 
ventilator-associated events. CONCLUSIONS Accurate estimation of disease 
severity in ventilated patients using electronic, routine care data was feasible 
using simple models. These estimates may be useful for risk-adjustment in 
ventilated patients. Additional research is necessary to validate and refine 
these models.

Behavioral Symptoms of Dementia that Present Management Difficulties in Nursing 
Homes: Staff Perceptions and Their Concordance With Informant Scales.

Davison TE, McCabe MP, Bird M, Mellor D, MacPherson S, Hallford D, Seedy M, 
O'Connor DW.

The current study aimed to profile behaviors associated with dementia that pose 
management difficulties for staff and determine whether existing rating scales 
capture these reported behaviors. Staff in 17 nursing homes described the 
behavioral symptoms of 229 residents with predominantly moderate-severe dementia 
associated with management difficulties. Behaviors were categorized by an expert 
clinical panel and compared to items in four dementia behavior rating scales. 
Staff reported 59 discrete behavioral symptoms, with physically agitated, 
aggressive verbal, non-aggressive verbal, and aggressive physical behaviors most 
common, followed by resistance to care and inappropriate social and sexual 
behaviors. Results suggested that some scales omit important behaviors reported 
by staff for residents with particularly challenging behaviors. The current 
study highlights the clinical complexity faced by nursing home staff in managing

The care of older adults in hospital: if it's common sense why isn't it common 
practice?

Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To present three converging myths that underlie the 
perception that nursing care for older persons in hospital is simple in 
comparison with its actual complexity.
BACKGROUND: Literature provides strong evidence indicating that the myths we 
discuss inherently arise from ageism, the social value of older patients and the 
economic burden of being an older patient in hospital. These powerful social 
discourses promote harm to older patients. Harm emerges from both the omission 
of gerontological nursing knowledge and skill and the commission of acts that 
unintentionally harm. A corresponding ethical challenge results for acute care 
nurses.
DESIGN: A discursive paper.
METHODS: We illuminate gerontological issues by discussing three myths. In myth 
one, we detail four clusters of distinguishing characteristics in older 
hospitalised people. In the second myth, we challenge the idea that the role of 
the acute care hospital is to attend only to acute medical concerns. Finally, in 
the third myth, we address the issue of incorporating functional assessment into 
the acute care nursing assessment. We argue that functional assessment is poorly 
integrated and becomes acceptable only as long as the medical regimen is managed 
appropriately.
CONCLUSION: Safe quality care in hospital for older adults requires a hybrid 
practice that integrates acute care specialty knowledge with gerontological 
nursing knowledge and skill. Clinical reasoning that integrates this type of 
nursing knowledge can prevent harm.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Integrating key elements of acute care nursing 
specialty knowledge with gerontological nursing principles aids to prevent the 
omission of care that is known to be harmful to older people. Conversely, the 
commission of gerontologically sensitive acute care can enhance safety and 
promote quality care in hospital.

AIM: To explore health-care professionals' documentation of patient wellbeing in 
the first five months after open heart surgery.
BACKGROUND: Open heart surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting or heart valve 
replacement) is an intervention aimed at relief of symptoms and increased 
wellbeing. It is a complex procedure with deep experiences encompassing 
physiological, psychological and social aspects. Health-care professionals' 
documentation of expressions of decreased wellbeing related to open heart 
surgery is an important basis for decisions and for the understanding of 
patients' overall health situation.
METHOD: Eighty medical records were examined by means of qualitative and 
quantitative methods in order to explore documentation of patient wellbeing at 
four points in time. The analysis was performed by content analysis and 
descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Documentation of physical wellbeing was dominant on all occasions, 
while psychological wellbeing was moderately well documented and social aspects 
of wellbeing were rarely documented.
CONCLUSION: The medical records did not adequately reflect the complexity of 
undergoing open heart surgery. Hence the holistic approach was not confirmed in 
health-care professionals' documentation.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Managers need to support and work for a 
patient-centred approach in cardiac care, resulting in patient documentation 
that reflects patient wellbeing as a whole.

A prospective, descriptive study to assess the reliability and usability of a 
rapid foot screen for patients with diabetes mellitus in a complex continuing 
care setting.

Inlow's 60-second Diabetic Foot Screen is a paper-pencil tool developed to guide 
professionals in the completion of a quick foot assessment of persons with 
diabetes mellitus to determine recommended frequency of assessments. The tool 
has been used in various healthcare settings and its reliability and validity 
previously tested in acute and long-term care settings. The purpose of this 
study was to assess content, time to complete assessment, ease of use, and 
reliability of the tool in a complex continuing care setting. The tool includes 
questions about 10 variables; skin, nails, deformities, footwear, temperature, 
range of motion, sensation, pulses, dependent rubor, and erythema. Answers 
convert to a score ranging from 0 (low risk, yearly screenings) to 23 (high 
risk, weekly screenings). Using the tool, the study questionnaire, and a watch, 
three nurse assessors experienced in assessing the feet of persons with diabetes 
completed 70 assessments on 35 patients during a period of 30 days. Content 
areas assessed included significance of comorbidities and interval screening 
times. Mean time to complete the assessment was 7 minutes (range 2 to 21 
minutes); 39% of assessments took 6 to 7 minutes. Times to perform assessment 
varied widely due to the functional and cognitive well-being of the patient. 
Inter-rater reliability was low (ICC 0.608 [95% confidence interval 
0.349-0.781]), perhaps due to varying interpretations of assessment parameters 
related to the complexity of the study patient population. Comments suggest that 
some tool revisions may increase ease of use as well as tool validity and 
reliability, especially for complex care patients with multiple comorbidities.

Exploration of the family's role and strengths after a young woman is diagnosed 
with breast cancer: views of women and their families.

Drive Meadowbrook, Queensland 4131, Australia. e.coyne@griffith.edu.au

PURPOSE: This exploratory descriptive study examined the role and strengths of 
the family when supporting the younger woman (<50 years) after a diagnosis of 
breast cancer. The perspectives of women and family members were sought.
METHOD: Participants were recruited from oncology outpatient units in Australia. 
Semi-structured interviews guided by the Family Resiliency Framework were 
undertaken with 14 young women with breast cancer and 11 family members who 
reflected on the roles of family. Transcripts were analysed individually and in 
family groupings.
RESULTS: Women with breast cancer and their family members experienced a range 
of emotions during the treatment period. Roles within the family changed as 
members responded to their circumstances. Analysis of interview transcripts 
identified the following primary themes; 'just being there', 'paradox of help' 
and 'buffer from society'. A secondary theme related to support, specifically 
'the changing role of support for family members', highlighting the strengths 
and experiences of family.
CONCLUSION: Recognition needs to be given to the complexity of changing roles 
experienced by young women with breast cancer and their families. Young women 
with breast cancer require unique forms of support because of the nature of 
their experience. Family roles were shaped through a shared sense of commitment 
and open communication amongst members. Families may demonstrate a range 
of strengths but are also vulnerable during this stressful period. Health 
professionals need to be aware of the possible needs of families, assess their 
adaptation to changing circumstances, and intervene through the provision of 
information, and counselling to enhance coping.

OBJECTIVE: to identify factors associated with occupational exposure to 
biological material among nursing professionals.
METHOD: a cross-sectional study was conducted in a high complexity hospital of a 
city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Nursing professionals were interviewed 
from March to November 2015. All ethical aspects were observed.
RESULT: among the 226 professionals interviewed, 17.3% suffered occupational 
exposure to potentially contaminated biological material, with 61.5% being 
percutaneous. Factors such as age (p=0.003), professional experience in nursing 
(p=0.015), and experience at the institution (p=0.032) were associated with the 
accidents with biological material.
CONCLUSION: most accidents with biological material among nursing professionals 
were percutaneous. Age, professional experience, and experience at the 
institution were considered factors associated with occupational exposure.

Corps Air Station, Iwakuni, Japan. elle.watson@pac.dodea.edu

There are many established benefits of exercise for older adults. Emerging 
studies suggest that it may even be able to slow the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) in older adults with the disease. However, it is yet unknown how 
bedside nurses can monitor ongoing exercise participation in this population due 
to the complexity and impact of AD symptoms. The purpose of this study is to 
provide bedside nurses with tools to capture actual received exercise doses to 
ensure adequate exercise participation by older adults with AD. This study is a 
secondary data analysis of a master study in which 8 participants who were 
clinically diagnosed with AD participated in moderate intensity aerobic exercise 
for 10 to 45 minutes, three times per week, for 6 months. The results show that 
participants were able to meet the overall exercise prescription 74.3% of the 
time. The findings of this study suggest that bedside nurses are able to monitor 
the actual exercise delivery (frequency, intensity, and duration) to ensure 
exercise participation.

Front-line managers as boundary spanners: effects of span and time on nurse 
supervision satisfaction.

Meyer RM(1), O'Brien-Pallas L, Doran D, Streiner D, Ferguson-Paré M, Duffield C.

Author information:

of Nursing, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. raquel.meyer@utoronto.ca

AIM: To examine the influence of nurse manager span (number of direct report 
staff), time in staff contact, transformational leadership practices and 
operational hours on nurse supervision satisfaction.
BACKGROUND: Increasing role complexity has intensified the boundary spanning 
functions of managers. Because work demands and scope vary by management 
position, time in staff contact rather than span may better explain managers' 
capacity to support staff.
METHODS: A descriptive, correlational design was used to collect cross-sectional 
survey and prospective work log and administrative data from a convenience 
sample of 558 nurses in 51 clinical areas and 31 front-line nurse managers from 
four acute care hospitals in 2007-2008. Data were analysed using hierarchical 
linear modelling.
RESULTS: Span, but not time in staff contact, interacted with leadership and 
operational hours to explain supervision satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: With compressed operational hours, supervision satisfaction was 
lower with highly transformational leadership in combination with wider spans. 
With extended operational hours, supervision satisfaction was higher with highly 
transformational leadership, and this effect was more pronounced under wider 
spans.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Operational hours, which influence the 
manager's daily span (average number of direct report staff working per 
weekday), should be factored into the design of front-line management positions.

The health professional-patient-relationship in conventional versus 
complementary and alternative medicine. A qualitative study comparing the 
perceived use of medical shared decision-making between two different approaches 
of medicine.

University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. berger.stephanie@rocketmail.com

OBJECTIVE: To explore differences between conventional medicine (COM) and 
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) regarding the attitude toward and 
the perceived use of shared decision-making (SDM) from the health professional 
perspective.
METHODS: Thirty guideline-based interviews with German GPs and nonmedical 
practitioners were conducted using qualitative analysis for interpretation.
RESULTS: The health professional-patient-relationship in CAM differs from that 
in COM, as SDM is perceived more often. Reasons for this include external 
context variables (e.g., longer consultation time) and internal provider beliefs 
(e.g., attitude toward SDM). German health care policy was regarded as one of 
the most critical factors which affected the relationship between GPs and their 
patients and their practice of SDM.
CONCLUSION: Differences between COM and CAM regarding the attitude toward and 
the perceived use of SDM are attributable to diverse concepts of medicine, 
practice context variables and internal provider factors. Therefore, the 
perceived feasibility of SDM depends on the complexity of different occupational 
socialization processes and thus, different value systems between COM and CAM.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Implementation barriers such as insufficient 
communication skills, lacking SDM training or obedient patients should be 
reduced. Especially in COM, contextual variables such as political restrictions 
need to be eliminated to successfully implement SDM.

INTRODUCTION:   Nursing models and terminologies can contribute to research the 
nature of nursing care.
AIM:   The aim of this study was to describe nursing diagnoses in acute- and 
long-term elderly care.
METHODS:   A point prevalence survey was conducted on 240 patients. The 
International Classification for Nursing Practice was used to describe nursing 
diagnoses, and a conceptual model was used to categorize them in nursing needs.
RESULTS:   A total of 2,673 diagnoses were detected. Mean was higher in nursing 
home than in hospital (t test =-3.688; p = .0003). Prevalent diagnoses were 
significantly different.
DISCUSSION:   High complexity, with different issues for nurses, was observed 
both in acute- and in long-term settings.
CONCLUSION:   The results could help to comprehend the nature of older persons 
needs and could contribute to the development of an International Classification 
for Nursing Practice catalogue for elderly care.

AIMS: This paper is a report of a study of quality of care delivered by an 
emergency department fast track unit where both doctors and an emergency nurse 
practitioner treated patients.
BACKGROUND: Fast track units were established in Australian emergency 
departments to meet the needs of low complexity emergency department patients. 
Few studies have reported on the overall quality of care delivered by these 
units.
METHODS: A convenience sample of adult patients triaged to an Australian 
emergency department fast track unit between April 2010 and April 2011 were 
randomised to care by a doctor or an emergency nurse practitioner. Quality of 
care was measured using patient satisfaction, follow up health status using 
Short Form 12 and adverse event rate (missed fractures or unplanned 
representations).
RESULTS: A total of 320 patients were enrolled into the study. Of the 236 
patients who submitted completed survey forms, median satisfaction scores were 
22 out of 25 with 84% of patients rating care as "excellent" or "very good". At 
two week follow up, health status score was comparable to normal healthy 
populations. When comparing study groups, patient satisfaction scores were 
significantly higher in the ENP group compared to DR group.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients received high quality of care in this fast track unit 
where both nurse practitioner and doctors treated patients. Emergency nurse 
practitioners were associated with higher patient satisfaction.

and Assistant Professor (Dr Hewner), School of Nursing, University at Buffalo, 
State University of New York; and Postoctoral Research Fellow (Dr Li), Perelman 
School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if the pattern of monthly 
medical expense can be used to identify individuals at risk of dying, thus 
supporting providers in proactively engaging in advanced care planning 
discussions.
BACKGROUND: Identifying the right time to discuss end of life can be difficult. 
Improved predictive capacity has made it possible for nurse leaders to use large 
data sets to guide clinical decision making.
METHODS: We examined the patterns of monthly medical expense of Medicare 
beneficiaries with life-limiting illness during the last 24 months of life using 
analysis of variance, t tests, and stepwise hierarchical linear modeling.
RESULTS: In the final year of life, monthly medical expense increases rapidly 
for all disease groupings and forms distinct patterns of change.
CONCLUSION: Type of condition can be used to classify decedents into distinctly 
different cost trajectories. Conditions including chronic disease, system 
failure, or cancer may be used to identify patients who may benefit from 
supportive care.

Self-reported depressive symptoms in women hospitalized for acute coronary 
syndrome.

Sanner JE(1), Frazier L, Udtha M.

Author information:
(1)University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Nursing, 
Houston, TX, USA.

The purpose of this cross-sectional observational study was to explore 
depressive symptoms, among 377 women, during hospitalization for acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS). Women were screened for depressive symptoms using the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Pearson chi-squared tests for independence 
were used for comparisons between categorical variables and t-tests for 
independent samples were used for comparisons between continuous variables. 
Tukey's honestly significant difference test along with one-way anova test was 
used to conduct multiple comparisons between the three defined age groups 
ranging from 29-49, 50-64 to ≥65 years. A total of 118 women screened positive 
for depression (BDI-II score ≥ 14). The percentage of women that met the 
criteria for a positive depression screening was significantly different between 
the three age groups. The proportion of depressed women who reported feelings of 
sadness, past failures, punishment, self-dislike, agitation, worthlessness, 
sleep disturbances and irritability varied significantly by age group. Study 
findings indicate that symptom experience and severity may differ across a 
lifetime. These results support the need to understand the complexity of 
depressive symptoms experienced by women. The ability to understand and 
recognize depressive symptoms in women, with ACS, may assist healthcare 
professionals with the management of a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor.

The increasing complexity of healthcare systems is driving changes in the 
academic preparation of nurse leaders. The number of doctorate of nursing 
practice programs has increased. Leaders in the Council on Graduate Education 
for Administration in Nursing (CGEAN) were interested in learning how graduate 
nursing leadership programs have responded. An electronic survey was 
administered to CGEAN members to understand the emphasis of their graduate 
curricula. Results demonstrate good alignment between academic programs, 
American Association of College of Nursing essentials, and American Organization 
of Nurse Executives competencies.

lisa.kuhn@acu.edu.au.

BACKGROUND: Minimising time to treatment onset for acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) in the emergency department (ED) is essential, yet little is understood 
about the interactions between variables affecting it. The aim of this study was 
to develop a regression tree model explicating the influence of patient and 
non-patient factors on the time taken to commence treatment for patients with 
AMI in Victorian EDs.
METHODS: A regression tree model for variables impacting time to treatment was 
developed on retrospective data for patients aged 18-85 years with AMI treated 
in Victorian EDs from 2005 to 2010 (n=21,080). Data were partitioned into three 
subsets, with a complexity parameter set at 0.0005.
RESULTS: Four variables emerged in the final regression tree model: triage 
score; mode of arrival; area of residence; and patient sex. The variable most 
influencing time to treatment onset for AMI was triage category. For 
undertriaged patients, treatment time patterns were affected by arrival mode, 
residential location and their sex, significantly extending delays to treatment 
onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between specific variables influenced whether patients 
with AMI were treated with equity in Victorian EDs, resulting in previously 
unidentified evidence-practice gaps and an improved understanding of which 
patient groups were vulnerable to delayed treatment for AMI.

Few researchers have examined how the components of the Practice Environment 
Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) relate to nurses' well-being at 
multiple organizational levels. The objective of the study was to perform a 
multilevel assessment of the relationships of the PES-NWI subscales with three 
nurse outcomes: job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and turnover intentions. 
Additionally, we tested the multilevel factor structure of the PES-NWI. In a 
sample of 699 full-time registered nurses in 79 units and 9 branches of a 
hospital system, relationships of the NWI with nurse outcomes were fairly 
consistent across levels of analysis. However, subscales contributed differently 
to the three outcomes, demonstrating the complexity of environmental influences 
on nurses' work experience.

wounds.

Infirmary, UK.

Orthopaedic limb reconstruction patients often have wounds that are difficult to 
heal either due to the underlying problems, their surgery, underlying 
comorbidities or a combination of these factors. Negative pressure wound therapy 
(NPWT) is a useful tool with which to manage these wounds; however, many systems 
are not ideal for use in the patient's home, due in part to size and complexity. 
There are also staff training issues if transferring patients to an area which 
does not routinely use negative pressure systems. This paper reports the 
outcomes for some of the patients who were treated with a novel, single-use NPWT 
device in a orthopaedic trauma/limb reconstruction unit.

As life expectancies increase, nurses will care for more individuals with 
chronic conditions, one of which is chronic renal disease. Increasing diversity 
and complexity of older adult healthcare needs signals a need to reconceptualize 
perceptions of successful aging. By emphasizing health promotion and adaptation, 
successful aging is possible for those with chronic renal disease. This article 
provides an overview of theory-based strategies for fostering successful aging 
in the patient with chronic renal disease.

Psychosocial needs of cancer patients living in the Adirondacks: a needs 
assessment.

Riley-Clark A, Pieper BB.

As the national conversation on solutions to healthcare factors such as 
affordability and access is likely to intensify, health inequities continue to 
persist in rural areas. National studies suggest a growing, aging, rural 
population impacting the revenues of local healthcare facilities, as well as 
contributing to complexity of care. This paper examines factors influencing the 
health of rural citizens in upstate New York and offers the results of an 
initial needs assessment looking at the psychosocial healthcare needs of cancer 
patients living in the Adirondack Park region. Patients were surveyed regarding 
their perceptions of psychosocial needs and experiences as a cancer patient. 
Psychosocial factors while acknowledged as important influences on recovery and 
healing remain an underdeveloped intervention toward improving the quality of 
cancer care. Recommendations are made based on the results to enhance the 
quality of life for this vulnerable population.
