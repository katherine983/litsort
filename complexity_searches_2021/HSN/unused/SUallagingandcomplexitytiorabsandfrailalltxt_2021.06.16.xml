        <ab>The burden of age-associated fragility fracture of the pelvis has gradually amplified over the years. Commonly used clinical tools cannot fully explain age-associated fracture risk increase, and microstructural analysis could be required to elucidate pubic bone strength decline in elderly. The study sample encompassed 46 pubic bones obtained from cadaveric donors divided into a young women (&lt;45 years, n = 11), aged women (&gt;60 years, n = 11), young men (&lt;45 years, n = 12) and aged men group (&gt;60 years, n = 12). Micro-computed tomography was used to evaluate the cortical and trabecular microstructure of pubic bone samples. Apart from age-associated loss in quantitative trabecular parameters, significant alteration of micro-CT parameters that more closely reflect internal trabecular microarchitectural complexity may contribute to pubic bone strength decline in men and women of advanced age (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, decreased cortical thickness and increased Ct.Po, Po.Dm and Po.N were found in the anterior and posterior cortical surface of pubic bone samples from the aged individuals (p &lt; 0.05). The more pronounced alteration was noted in aged female donors, illustrated in a significant deterioration trend of the Tb.N, Tb.Sp, and thinner posterior cortical surface with decreased pore spacing (p &lt; 0.05). Our data suggest that age-associated deterioration in trabecular and cortical pubic bone micro-architecture could unravel a morphological basis for decreased pubic bone strength and increased pubic bone fragility, which leads to fracture predilection in the elderly women. Thus, the individual fracture risk assessment should be advised in the elderly, with a particular accent on aged women. [Display omitted] • Pelvic fractures are considered as growing health concern worldwide. • Pelvic fractures are more common in the elderly females with osteoporosis. • Micro-CT analysis could improve understanding of age-associated bone fragility. • Our data elucidate a morphological base for pubic fracture predilection in aged woman. • Fracture risk estimation is necessary in elderly patients (in aged woman particularly).</ab>

        <ab>The concept of physical resilience may help geriatric medicine objectively assess patients' ability to 'bounce back' from future health challenges. Indicators putatively forecasting resilience have been developed under two paradigms with different perspectives: Critical Slowing Down and Loss of Complexity. This study explored whether these indicators validly reflect the construct of resilience in geriatric inpatients. Geriatric patients (n = 121, 60% female) had their heart rate and physical activity continuously monitored using a chest-worn sensor. Indicators from both paradigms were extracted from both physiological signals. Measures of health functioning, concomitant with low resilience, were obtained by questionnaire at admission. The relationships among indicators and their associations with health functioning were assessed by correlation and linear regression analyses, respectively. Greater complexity and higher variance in physical activity were associated with lower frailty (β = −0.28, p =.004 and β = −0.37, p &lt;.001, respectively) and better ADL function (β = 0.23, p =.022 and β = 0.38, p &lt;.001). The associations of physical activity variance with health functioning were not in the expected direction based on Critical Slowing Down. In retrospect, these observations stress the importance of matching the resilience paradigm's assumptions to the homeostatic role of the variable monitored. We present several lessons learned. • Quantifying physical resilience may help assess recovery potential in the elderly. • Complexity Science offers quantitative indicators to capture aspects of resilience. • Critical Slowing Down and Loss of Complexity assess different underlying mechanisms. • Physical activity complexity and variance coincided with better health functioning. • The assumptions of the paradigm must match the homeostatic roles of the variables.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Improved methods of communication are needed among professionals in related fields to address the increasing complexity of clinical situations and various levels of functioning experienced by older adults who live in nursing homes. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore function-focused clinical communication among nurses and providers based on the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) approach toward interdisciplinary collaboration to maintain function among nursing home residents and to identify the characteristics of SBAR flows in nursing homes. Methods: Detailed interviews with 28 interdisciplinary professionals working in four nursing homes were conducted. Directed qualitative content analysis was used to identify the internal attributes of SBAR-based communication. Case analysis was conducted to identify SBAR flows. Results: Four themes emerged as key factors for function-focused interdisciplinary staff communication in nursing homes. Effective nursing care to maintain function among nursing home residents requires accurate awareness of abnormal circumstances. Knowledge of assessment and resident background are needed to address situations requiring intervention and identify the problems underlying a resident's current state. The optimal therapeutic environment is created by sharing roles and tasks among practitioners through referrals. Twelve generalized situations requiring function-focused communication (i.e., dislocation of body line because of joint contracture, change in walking, difficulty of moving because of pain, difficulty in eating, fever, change in sleep pattern, change in excretion pattern, change in weight, change in condition, change in problematic behavior, decrease in cognitive function, and change in relationships) and the related nurse-centered SBAR pathways were identified. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: These results represent a first prototype for developing practical communication guidelines for nursing-home-specific function-focused care and provide new insights into the interdisciplinary approach.</ab>

        <ab>Background: As the population of older adults increases, the complexity of care required to support those who choose to remain in the community amplifies. Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP), through earlier identification of healthcare needs, is evidenced to improve quality of life, decrease aggressive interventions, and prolong life. With patient acceptability of growing importance in the design, implementation, and evaluation of healthcare interventions, this study reports on the acceptability of a primary care based ACP intervention on the island of Ireland. Methods: As part of the evaluation of a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) testing an ACP intervention for older people at risk of functional decline, intervention participants [n = 34] were interviewed in their homes at 10-week follow-up to determine acceptability. The intervention consisted of home visits by specifically trained registered nurses who assessed participants' health, discussed their health goals and plans, and devised an anticipatory care plan in collaboration with participants' GPs and adjunct clinical pharmacist. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview data. The feasibility cRCT involved eight general practitioner (GP) practices as cluster sites, stratified by jurisdiction, four in Northern Ireland (NI) (two intervention, two control), and four in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) (two intervention, two control). Participants were assessed for risk of functional decline. A total of 34 patients received the intervention and 31 received usual care. Findings: Thematic analysis resulted in five main themes: timing of intervention, understanding of ACP, personality &amp; individual differences, loneliness &amp; social isolation, and views on healthcare provision. These map across the Four Factor Model of Acceptability ('4FMA'), a newly developed conceptual framework comprising four components: intervention factors, personal factors, social support factors, and healthcare provision factors. Conclusion: Acceptability of this primary care based ACP intervention was high, with nurses' home visits, GP anchorage, multidisciplinary working, personalized approach, and active listening regarded as beneficial. Appropriate timing, and patient health education emerged as vital.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric syndromes are symptoms and signs, such as falls, incontinence, delirium, pressure ulcers, dysphagia and so on, that often threaten the independence of older adults, rather than the disease itself. Although the syndromes are very common in older people, it is difficult to treat those by modern medicine due to their complexity. To mitigate the intractable geriatric symptoms, we review the efficacy of aromatherapy, especially for dysphagia, dyspnea, cognitive dysfunction and falls in geriatric syndrome. Olfactory stimulation using a volatile black pepper oil on institutional residents improved the swallowing reflex, which is a crucial risk factor of aspiration pneumonia. Brain imaging study showed that olfactory stimulation using volatile black pepper oil activated cerebral regions of the anterior cingulate and the insular cortex, which play a role in controlling appetite and swallowing. Also, aromatherapy with volatile l‐menthol decreased the sense of dyspnea and improved the efficacy of exercise therapy. The fragrance of the combination of rosemary and lemon oils in the morning, and the combination of lavender and orange oils in the night‐time were reported to improve cognition and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, respectively. Also, the combination of lavender and lemon balm oils was reported to be effective for irritability‐related agitation in older adults. Furthermore, aromatherapy with lavender fragrance could improve both static and dynamic balance, resulting in a reduction in the number of fallers and the incidence rate in older people. Thus, aromatherapy is a promising remedy for geriatric syndrome. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2021; 21: 377–385.</ab>

        <ab>Complete macroscopic tumor resection is the strongest prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer, which requires complex surgery for achievement. Based on the mostly advanced tumor stage and high symptom burden many patients are classified as frail which may limit optimal surgical outcome. Aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive ability of Frailty Index for surgical outcomes in patients with ovarian cancer. This prospective study enrolled patients with ovarian cancer undergoing cytoreductive surgery. We classified frailty proposed by Mitnitski et al. regarding the cumulative deficit model of frailty. Utilizing Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression, we determined predictive clinical factors for severe postoperative complications. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for overall survival analysis. Out of f 144 enrolled patients, the overall prevalence of frailty based on a Frailty Index &gt;0.26 and Frailty Index &gt;0.15 was 33% and 74%, respectively. The logistic regression shows that frail patients with a Frailty Index &gt;0.26 (Odds ratio (OR): 3.64, 95% CI: 1.34–9.85, p = 0.01), ECOG PS &gt; 1 (OR 6.33, 95% CI:1.31–30.51, p = 0.02) and high surgical complexity score (OR 8.86, 95% CI:1.88–41.76, p = 0.006) had a significant higher risk for severe postoperative complications. According to multivariable cox regression Frailty Index &gt;0.15 (hazard ratio (HR) (HR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.01–3.47, p = 0.048), residual tumor &lt;1 cm (HR 2.75, 95%CI: 1.53–4.99, p = 0.001), residual tumor &gt;1 cm (HR 5.00, 95% CI: 2.74–9.13, p &lt; 0.001) and albumin&lt;35.5 g/dl (HR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.08–3.43, p = 0.03) resulted as significant parameters for poor overall survival. Resulted as significant parameters for poor overall survival. Next to surgical complexity score, ECOG PS &gt; 1 and recurrent surgery, Frailty Index &gt;0.26 is associated with severe postoperative complications in patients with ovarian cancer. Besides tumor residuals and low albumin levels a Frailty Index &gt;0.15 predicts poor survival. • Frailty Index &gt;0.26 is associated with severe postoperative complications in patients with ovarian cancer. • Frailty Index can help surgeons to estimate the risk of postoperative complications in ovarian cancer. • Besides tumor residuals and low albumin levels a Frailty Index &gt;0.15 predicts poor survival in patients with ovarian cancer.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Multimorbidity is increasing among older adults, but the impact of these recent trends on the extent and complexity of polypharmacy and possible variation by sex remains unknown. We examined sex differences in multimorbidity, polypharmacy (5+ medications) and hyper-polypharmacy (10+ medications) in 2003 vs 2016, and the interactive associations between age, multimorbidity level, and time on polypharmacy measures. Methods and findings: We employed a repeated cross-sectional study design with linked health administrative databases for all persons aged ≥66 years eligible for health insurance in Ontario, Canada at the two index dates. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted; models included interaction terms between age, multimorbidity level, and time period to estimate polypharmacy and hyper-polypharmacy probabilities, risk differences and risk ratios for 2016 vs 2003. Multimorbidity, polypharmacy and hyper-polypharmacy increased significantly over the 13 years. At both index dates prevalence estimates for all three were higher in women, but a greater absolute increase in polypharmacy over time was observed in men (6.6% [from 55.7% to 62.3%] vs 0.9% [64.2%-65.1%] for women) though absolute increases in multimorbidity were similar for men and women (6.9% [72.5%-79.4%] vs 6.2% [75.9%-82.1%], respectively). Model findings showed that polypharmacy decreased over time among women aged &lt; 90 years (especially for younger ages and those with fewer conditions), whereas it increased among men at all ages and multimorbidity levels (with larger absolute increases typically at older ages and among those with 4 or fewer conditions). Conclusions: There are sex and age differences in the impact of increasing chronic disease burden on changes in measures of multiple medication use among older adults. Though the drivers and health consequences of these trends warrant further investigation, the findings support the heterogeneity and complexity in the evolving association between multimorbidity and polypharmacy measures in older populations.</ab>

        <ab>Worldwide population ageing is partly due to advanced standard of care, leading to increased incidence and prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as frailty and disability. Hence, the age at the onset of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) keeps growing as well. Moreover, ageing is a risk factor for both frailty and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Frailty and CVD in the elderly share pathophysiological mechanisms and associated conditions, such as malnutrition, sarcopenia, anemia, polypharmacy and both increased bleeding/thrombotic risk, leading to a negative impact on outcomes. In geriatric populations ACS is associated with an increased frailty degree that has a negative effect on re-hospitalization and mortality outcomes. Frail elderly patients are increasingly referred to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs after ACS; however, plans of care must be tailored on individual's clinical complexity in terms of functional capacity, nutritional status and comorbidities, cognitive status, socio-economic support. Completing rehabilitative intervention with a reduced frailty degree, disability prevention, improvement in functional state and quality of life and reduction of re-hospitalization are the goals of CR program. Tools for detecting frailty and guidelines for management of frail elderly patients post-ACS are still debated. This review focused on the need of an early identification of frail patients in elderly with ACS and at elaborating personalized plans of care and secondary prevention in CR setting.</ab>

        <ab>Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and strength/function, is a prototypical geroscience condition. The dissection of muscle-specific molecular pathways through analyses of tissue biopsies has provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of sarcopenia. However, such an approach is unsuitable for capturing the dynamic nature of the condition. Furthermore, the muscle sampling procedure may be perceived as burdensome especially by multimorbid, frail older adults. To overcome these limitations, sophisticated statistical methods have been devised for the simultaneous analysis of circulating factors related to the multiple domains of sarcopenia. This approach has shown potential for achieving a more comprehensive appraisal of the condition, unveiling new therapeutic targets, and identifying meaningful biomarkers. Here, we discuss the main pathogenetic pathways of sarcopenia, with a focus on mediators that are currently in the spotlight as biomarkers and potential treatment targets. • Sarcopenia is a prototypical geriatric condition recapitulating all aging hallmarks. • Molecular analyses on muscle biopsies do not capture dynamic muscle changes. • Cost-effective and accessible biomarkers of sarcopenia are highly sought after. • Inflammatory and metabolic mediators are candidate biomarkers of sarcopenia. • Multimarker analysis may assist in capturing the complexity of sarcopenia.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives of the study: Demographic changes alongside medical advances have resulted in older adults accounting for an increasing proportion of emergency hospital admissions. Current measures of illness severity, limited to physiological parameters, have shortcomings in this cohort, partly due to patient complexity. This study aimed to derive and validate a risk score for acutely unwell older adults which may enhance risk stratification and support clinical decision-making. Methods: Data was collected from emergency admissions in patients ≥65 years from two UK general hospitals (April 2017- April 2018). Variables underwent regression analysis for in-hospital mortality and independent predictors were used to create a risk score. Performance was assessed on external validation. Secondary outcomes included seven-day mortality and extended hospital stay. Results: Derivation (n = 8,974) and validation (n = 8,391) cohorts were analysed. The model included the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), clinical frailty scale (CFS), acute kidney injury, age, sex, and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool. For mortality, area under the curve for the model was 0.79 (95% CI 0.78–0.80), superior to NEWS2 0.65 (0.62–0.67) and CFS 0.76 (0.74–0.77) (P&lt;0.0001). Risk groups predicted prolonged hospital stay: the highest risk group had an odds ratio of 9.7 (5.8–16.1) to stay &gt;30 days. Conclusions: Our simple validated model (Older Persons' Emergency Risk Assessment [OPERA] score) predicts in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay and could be easily integrated into electronic hospital systems, enabling automatic digital generation of risk stratification within hours of admission. Future studies may validate the OPERA score in external populations and consider an impact analysis.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Discharge teaching by nurses during hospitalization is essential to provide multimorbid inpatients with the knowledge and skills to self-manage their health conditions. However, available disease-specific teaching guidelines do not address the cumulative complexity of multiple chronic diseases that occur with greater frequency in older adults. Therefore, there is a need for a discharge teaching intervention which uses concepts that specifically address the needs of these patients, such as considering their level of activation (i.e. knowledge, skills and confidence to self-manage their health) and the burden of multimorbid disease. The objectives of this pragmatic study will be to (1) test the feasibility of implementing a nursing discharge teaching intervention and (2) conduct a preliminary test of this novel discharge teaching intervention with adult inpatients age 50 or greater who have multiple comorbid conditions. Methods: This study uses a two-group pre-posttest design. Participants are drawn from medical units in three hospitals in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The implementation of the intervention will be facilitated by implementation strategies from the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behavior Change Wheel and will target change in nurses' teaching behaviours. Implementation outcomes will include measures of feasibility of the implementation strategies and the intervention process. Participants in the intervention group will receive tailored discharge teaching by trained teaching nurses. Patient outcomes will inform the preliminary testing of the intervention and will be measured with validated questionnaires assessing patients' activation level, health confidence, perceived readiness for discharge, experience with the discharge process and rate of and time to readmission. Discussion: The study takes a pragmatic approach to examining the feasibility of implementing the discharge teaching intervention to contribute to the knowledge development within the context of the real-world practice setting. Results will provide the foundation for clinical trials to build evidence for widespread adoption of this intervention. Trial registration: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04253665) on the 30 of January 2020 and has been approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Vaud in Switzerland (2020-00141).</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Frailty is an increasingly recognised concept, with 25–50% of over 85’s estimated to be frail1,. Previous research considered medical students’ attitudes towards older people2, yet despite the correlation between frailty and increased age3, little is known about attitudes of healthcare professionals towards frailty. We researched attitudes towards, and understanding of, frailty in undergraduate and postgraduate trainees, with a view to guiding future educational interventions. Method: Approval was granted by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHCT) Research and Development department, Newcastle University’s Research Management Group and the HRA. 3 cohorts were recruited; 3rd year Newcastle University MBBS Students, 5th year Newcastle University MBBS Students and Foundation Year 2 and Core Medical Trainees working for NHCT (junior doctors). Data was collected during scheduled teaching at NHCT and individuals were invited to participate via email prior to this. Those not participating were still required to attend the teaching. Participants provided written consent. Within each cohort, small group discussions around frailty and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) were prompted using open questions (e.g. “what does frailty mean to you?”), during which participants anonymously submitted phrases to an online word-cloud generator. Discussions were audio recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions and word-clouds were analysed using Simple Content Analysis. The overarching themes within each cohort were identified and compared with other cohorts. Interpretations were reviewed by an independent researcher to enhance rigour. Results: Each cohort associated frailty with older age and weakness, and often used it as a byword for complexity. Frailty was described as an abstract construct composed of personal experiences rather than an objectively defined descriptor. All associated it with negative emotions. Cohorts differed in their approach, with 3rd year students primarily focussed on defining frailty, whereas junior doctors prioritised the clinical challenges it presented. Junior doctors demonstrated limited understanding of CGA whilst undergraduate students were almost universally ignorant of it. Conclusions: The lack of understanding around frailty and CGA is concerning given its high prevalence.The identification of negative emotions increases this concern. To challenge this, focussed educational interventions addressing understanding and attitudes ought to be developed for tomorrow’s doctors.</ab>

        <ab>An integrated smart home system (ISHS) is an effective way to improve the quality of life of the elderly. The elderly's willingness is essential to adopt an ISHS; to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the elderly's perception of ISHS. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the elderly's perception of the ISHS by comprehensively evaluating its possible benefits and negative responses. A set of sensors required for an ISHS was determined, and interviews were designed based on four factors: perceived comfort, perceived usability, perceived privacy, and perceived benefit. Subsequently, technological trials of the sensor-set followed by two focus group interviews were conducted on nine independently living elderly participants at a senior welfare center in South Korea. Consistent with previous studies, the results of this investigation indicate that elderly participants elicited negative responses regarding usability complexity, and discomfort to daily activities. Despite such negative responses, after acquiring enough awareness about the ISHS's benefits, the elderly acknowledged its necessity and showed a high level of willingness. Furthermore, these results indicate that for a better adoption of an ISHS, sufficient awareness regarding its benefits and development of elderly-friendly smart home sensors that minimize negative responses are required.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Optimizing the approach to older adults with cancer is now a priority given the increasing frequency of new cancer diagnoses that are made in the older population. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the gold‐standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of frail older persons, and (3) designing person‐tailored interventions. Materials and methods: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach to older patients with cancer. Results and discussion: A widespread use of this standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The importance of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) as critical implementation drivers emerged from this case study conducted with three pioneer sites implementing integrated care for older persons in Ireland as part of the Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP). We describe the practices of MDTs learning to deliver integrated care in service delivery settings, including the framework, resourcing, strategies, challenges and barriers they encounter. The study was conducted by a team of researchers in collaboration with ICPOP at both national programme and pioneer site levels. Qualitative methods of participant observation, workshopping, and documentary analysis were used to build a rich description, and using organisational and systems lenses identification of critical factors as both themes and resources for learning. The case study suggests the MDT is an essential driver of integrated care delivery. For example, ICPOP MDTs working across pioneer sites develop new service models and care opportunities, troubleshoot and challenge the systemic status quo, and disrupt professional silos. However, they also deliver on programme goals. Nonetheless, progress is constrained by organisational factors including fragmented funding structures, high turnover of senior level decision-makers, a lack of multiannual funding and complex professional arrangements. This study finds ICPOP offers practical and timely insight to inform health system reform. It embraces the complexity of delivery at national, local and community levels. The MDT emerges as an essential mechanism to manage such complexity and deliver on wider reform goals such as patient-centredness and timely access.</ab>

        <ab>Activity recognition can provide useful information about an older individual's activity level and encourage older people to become more active to live longer in good health. This study aimed to develop an activity recognition algorithm for smartphone accelerometry data of older people. Deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were evaluated in this study. Smartphone accelerometry data of free-living activities, performed by 53 older people (83.8 ± 3.8 years; 38 male) under standardized circumstances, were classified into lying, sitting, standing, transition, walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. A 1D CNN, a multichannel CNN, a CNN-LSTM, and a multichannel CNN-LSTM model were tested. The models were compared on accuracy and computational efficiency. Results show that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model achieved the best classification results, with an 81.1% accuracy and an acceptable model and time complexity. Specifically, the accuracy was 67.0% for lying, 70.7% for sitting, 88.4% for standing, 78.2% for transitions, 88.7% for walking, 65.7% for walking downstairs, and 68.7% for walking upstairs. The findings indicated that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model was feasible for smartphone-based activity recognition in older people.</ab>

        <ab>• Metabolism plays a key role in the regulation of aging at different levels. • Age-dependent metabolic reprogramming occurs in different organisms at whole-body and tissue-specific levels. • Interventions that extend lifespan often exhibit reversal of age-dependent metabolic reprogramming. • Targeting of any one of over a hundred different targets in specific metabolic pathways can extend lifespan in different organisms. Metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of aging at different levels, and metabolic reprogramming represents a major driving force in aging. Metabolic reprogramming leads to impaired organismal fitness, an age-dependent increase in susceptibility to diseases, decreased ability to mount a stress response, and increased frailty. The complexity of age-dependent metabolic reprogramming comes from the multitude of levels on which metabolic changes can be connected to aging and regulation of lifespan. This is further complicated by the different metabolic requirements of various tissues, cross-organ communication via metabolite secretion, and direct effects of metabolites on epigenetic state and redox regulation; however, not all of these changes are causative to aging. Studies in yeast, flies, worms, and mice have played a crucial role in identifying mechanistic links between observed changes in various metabolic traits and their effects on lifespan. Here, we review how changes in the organismal and organ-specific metabolome are associated with aging and how targeting of any one of over a hundred different targets in specific metabolic pathways can extend lifespan. An important corollary is that restriction or supplementation of different metabolites can change activity of these metabolic pathways in ways that improve healthspan and extend lifespan in different organisms. Due to the high levels of conservation of metabolism in general, translating findings from model systems to human beings will allow for the development of effective strategies for human health- and lifespan extension.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Age-associated increases in medical complexity, frailty, and cognitive impairment may compromise reliable reporting of medical history.&lt;bold&gt;Objective: &lt;/bold&gt;To evaluate the influence of increasing age and cognitive impairment on concordance between reported history of stroke and cerebral infarction, and reported history of diabetes and elevated hemoglobinA1c in community-dwelling older adults.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;The association between participant-specific factors and accurate reporting of stroke or diabetes was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression in 1,401 participants enrolled in longitudinal studies of memory and aging, including 425 participants with dementia (30.3%). Stroke and diabetes were selected as index variables as gold standard measures of both were obtained in all participants: magnetic resonance neuroimaging for cerebral infarcts and hemoglobinA1c (≥6.5%) for diabetes.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Concordance between reported history of stroke and imaging-confirmed cerebral infarction was low (sensitivity: 17.4%, 8/46; specificity: 97.9%, 799/816). Small infarcts were strongly associated with inaccurate reporting (OR = 265.8; 95% CI: 86.2, 819.4), suggesting that occult/silent infarcts contributed to discordant reporting. Reporting accuracy was higher concerning diabetes (sensitivity: 83.5%, 147/176; specificity: 96.2%, 1100/1143). A history of hypertension (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.2), higher hemoglobinA1c (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.5, 2.4), and hemoglobinA1c compatible with impaired glucose tolerance (OR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.8, 5.3) associated with increased odds of discordant reporting. Cognitive impairment and increased age were not independently associated with reliable reporting.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/bold&gt;Factors beyond advancing age and cognitive impairment appear to drive discordance in reported medical history in older participants. Objective testing for cerebral infarcts or diabetes should be performed when relevant to diagnostic or therapeutic decisions in clinical and research settings.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Detecting infection in frail elderly is a challenge due to lack of specific signs and symptoms. We highlight the complex situation when an elderly woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;A descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is explored in the discussion.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;The latent content analysis of the daughter's story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women recovers quickly.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/bold&gt;The healthcare system should embrace the complexity in the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage "correctly" for later placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption of complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Evaluation of human postural stability is important to prevent falls. Recent studies have been carried out to develop postural stability evaluation in an attempt to fall prevention. The postural stability index (PSI) was proposed as a measure to evaluate the stability of human postures in performing daily activities. The objective of this study was to use the PSI in developing the stability scales for human daily activities. The current study used two open datasets collected from mobile devices. In addition, we also conducted three experiments to evaluate the effect of age, velocity, step counts, and devices on PSI values. The collected datasets were preprocessed using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), then the complexity index from each intrinsic mode function (IMF) was calculated using the multiscale entropy (MSE). From the evaluation, it can be concluded that the PSI can be applied to do daily monitoring of postural stability for both young and older adults, and the PSI is not affected by age. The revised stability scales developed in this current study can give better suggestions to users than the original one.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Clinical decision-making (CDM) is an important competency for young doctors especially under complex and uncertain conditions in geriatric emergency medicine (GEM). However, research in this field is characterized by vague conceptualizations of CDM. To evolve and evaluate evidence-based knowledge of CDM, it is important to identify different definitions and their operationalizations in studies on GEM.&lt;bold&gt;Objective: &lt;/bold&gt;A scoping review of empirical articles was conducted to provide an overview of the documented evidence of findings and conceptualizations of CDM in GEM.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;A detailed search for empirical studies focusing on CDM in a GEM setting was conducted in PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, EMBASE and Web of Science. In total, 52 publications were included in the analysis, utilizing a data extraction sheet, following the PRISMA guidelines. Reported outcomes were summarized.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Four themes of operationalization of CDM emerged: CDM as dispositional decisions, CDM as cognition, CDM as a model, and CDM as clinical judgement. Study results and conclusions naturally differed according to how CDM was conceptualized. Thus, frailty-heuristics lead to biases in treatment of geriatric patients and the complexity of this patient group was seen as a challenge for young physicians engaging in CDM.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;This scoping review summarizes how different studies in GEM use the term CDM. It provides an analysis of findings in GEM and call for more stringent definitions of CDM in future research, so that it might lead to better clinical practice.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: How disability manifests itself in an individual is a highly complex process influenced by a wide range of individual and environmental factors. Its complexity makes the search for generalizable characteristics of the disablement process a challenging task. Consequentially, little is known about how the effect on other health outcomes such as life expectancy are modified after the onset of chronic ailments. In this paper we posit an alternative approach to generalize health trajectories of older people with disability and then analyze how socioeconomic conditions affect the longevity within these trajectory groups. Methods: Individual level information about the first three successive onsets of chronic disability after age 50 is transformed into state-sequences. We extract trajectory groups based on onset time and the time spent in a certain state. Mortality hazards are then estimated with a Gompertz proportional hazards model to compare effects of different socioeconomic measures within the trajectory groups. Results: Three distinct trajectory groups are identified, the mild (1), the early severe (2), and late severe (3) pathway. Estimates of the mortality analysis suggest that social inequalities in longevity are less pronounced after onset of old-age disability. We found a consistent survival prolonging effect for individuals who engage in daily activities (such as meeting with friends, walking) that ranged between 33.2% and 77.3%. The importance of other variables varies between trajectory groups. Discussion: This study shows how health trajectories of individuals with disability can be generalized when information on the onset and severity of single conditions is available. Such an approach may help us to better predict health and care expenditures and help families and individuals with their personal care planning. The findings from the subsequent survival analysis suggest a substantial reduction of socioeconomic mortality differences after onset of old-age disability, which appears to be independent of its nature.</ab>

        <ab>An aging population, whose multi-morbidities and risk of frailty increase with age results in significant health and social care consumption. Increasing complexity amplifies fragmentation of care and results in sub optimal care outcomes. Ireland, in keeping with other jurisdictions seeks to implement integrated care for older persons as a policy response. There is growing evidence base supporting effective service responses for older persons. These typically include multidisciplinary, community based teams providing services in or near to the older person's home (the 'what'). However, examples of systemic implementation are confined to smaller regions notably in Catalonia (Spain), Scotland and Singapore. This reflects the fact that the implementation of integrated care is problematic at scale. The need to attend to methods that support high autonomy professionals tasked with local implementation (the 'who') is a neglected area. This is especially important in light of the fact managerial and clinical leaders already have operational and clinical imperatives to attend to. Whilst ideologically committed, the change management challenge presented by integrated care is daunting as they may lack the capacity (time, resources, structures) required to test a new care model. In addition, most change methodologies fail to recognise powerful social dynamics that reflect the characteristics of a complex adaptive system (the 'how'). This paper proposes a framework to implementing integrated care for older persons. In addition, it offers some initial empirical evidence that this approach has utility among managers and clinicians. In doing so seeks to bridge the implementation gap associated with systemic change.</ab>

        <ab>Several societies have published recommendations for evaluating older adults with cancer in standard conditions. It is vital to assure a proper systematic patient condition evaluation, not only in the oldest (geriatric assessment) but in all adult patients. We have investigated the feasibility of a systematic evaluation of the general condition of all patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies, and the degree of acceptance by the clinical team, in a prospective cohort of 182 consecutive adults, by using the ECOG performance status scale (ECOG, age 18 and over, 18+), Lee Index for Older Adults (LEE, 50+), Geriatric Assessment in Hematology (GAH, 65+), and the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA, 75+). Clinical team acceptance was analyzed with a visual analogue scale, and the objective feasibility was calculated as the proportion of patients that could be finally evaluated with each tool. Acceptance was high, but the objective feasibility was progressively lower as the complexity of the different tools increased (ECOG 100%, LEE 99.4%, GAH 93.2%, and CGA 67.9%). LEE and GAH categories showed a weak concordance (Cohen's Kappa 0.24) that was slight between LEE and CGA (Kappa 0.18). Unexpectedly, we found no significant association between the GAH and CGA categories (p = 0.16). We confirm that a systematic evaluation of all adult patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies is feasible in daily practice by using an age-adapted approach. Direct comparisons among the different predictive tools in regard to patients' tolerance to treatments of different intensities must be a priority research subject in the coming years.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the effectiveness of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in suppressing virus replication, chronic inflammation remains one of the cardinal features intersecting HIV-1, cART, drug abuse, and likely contributes to the accelerated neurocognitive decline and aging in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) that abuse drugs. It is also estimated that ~30–60% of PLWH on cART develop cognitive deficits associated with HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), with symptomatology ranging from asymptomatic to mild, neurocognitive impairments. Adding further complexity to HAND is the comorbidity of drug abuse in PLWH involving activated immune responses and the release of neurotoxins, which, in turn, mediate neuroinflammation. Premature or accelerated aging is another feature of drug abusing PLWH on cART regimes. Emerging studies implicate the role of HIV-1/HIV-1 proteins, cART, and abused drugs in altering the inflammasome signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) cells. It is thus likely that exposure of these cells to HIV-1/HIV-1 proteins, cART, and/or abused drugs could have synergistic/additive effects on the activation of inflammasomes, in turn, leading to exacerbated neuroinflammation, ultimately resulting in premature aging referred to as "inflammaging" In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of inflammasome activation, neuroinflammation, and aging in central nervous system (CNS) cells such as microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in the context of HIV-1 and drug abuse.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Our first aim was to examine the main and interacting effects of accelerometer-based sedentary time (ST) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with BMI and the likelihood of being overweight/obese in Hong Kong and Ghent (Belgium) older adults. Second, we examined whether these main associations and interactions between MVPA and ST were moderated by socio-demographics (gender, education) and objective neighbourhood attributes supposed to be associated with healthy food intake (food outlet density, neighbourhood-level SES). Finally, we determined whether the associations and interactions were generalisable across study sites. Methods: Data from the ALECS (Hong Kong) and BEPAS Seniors studies (Ghent), two comparable observational studies, were used. Older adults (n = 829, 65+) provided self-reported socio-demographic information and objective MVPA and ST data using Actigraph accelerometers. Annual household income data and GIS software were used to assess neighbourhood-level SES and food outlet density. Generalised additive mixed models were conducted in R. Results: ST was linearly and positively related to both weight outcomes in the overall sample, while MVPA was not. The overall-sample analyses including the two-way interaction between MVPA and ST showed no interactions between these behaviours on weight outcomes. Three site-specific findings were identified, showing distinct associations in Hong Kong compared to Ghent. Study site moderated the interaction between ST and MVPA on both weight outcomes, the interaction between education and ST on both weight outcomes and the interaction between the number of food outlets and ST on being overweight/obese. Conclusions: The country-specific effects confirm the cultural dependency and complexity of the associations between PA, ST and weight outcomes. Future longitudinal international studies including older adults from multiple regions assessing PA, ST, weight outcomes and dietary intake should be encouraged. Such studies are needed to refine the recommendations regarding ST and PA in older adults in light of preventing overweight and obesity.</ab>

        <ab>The three Ds of geriatric psychiatry—delirium, dementia, and depression are common and challenging diagnoses among elderly. Delirium is often difficult to diagnose and is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older adults. Dementia also affects a significant number of older adults and is associated with delirium, depression, frailty, and failure to thrive. It is well known that depression too increases with increasing age. These three syndromes can exist simultaneously in the same patient, and often confer increased risk for each other, especially in the geriatric population. Early identification, classification, and differential diagnosis are important at the primary care level for the timely management of these common problems of old age. We present a case of concurrent findings and complexity in the medical literature.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many family care partners are involved in making help‐seeking choices. The aim of this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still maintaining their own dignity. Methods: Data were collected in 2009–2010 in open semi‐structured interviews and follow‐up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an in‐depth data analysis. Results: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the follow‐up of policy for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The complexity of drug regimens among older people tend to increase over time, as multiple medications are required to treat a single condition. Aim: This study examined the association of the drug burden index (DBI) and polypharmacy with patient health outcomes among cognitively intact older residents in aged care facilities (ACFs). Methods: A review of prescribed medications and related outcomes was conducted in a cross‐sectional sample of older adults (≥60 years), recruited from 11 ACFs in Peninsular Malaysia. Frailty and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated using the Groningen frailty indicator and 'Older People's Quality of Life – 35' questionnaire, respectively; patients' exposure to anticholinergic and sedative medicines was quantified using the DBI; and the mental health of residents was evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: More than two‐thirds of a sampled population received at least one anticholinergic or sedative medication and more than one‐quarter was exposed to polypharmacy. Exposure to DBI‐associated medications was noted in three of every four frail participants and was significantly correlated with frailty (r = 0.184, p = 0.023). The frail population had significantly increased risk of polypharmacy (odds ratio 6.07; 95% confidence interval 1.71–21.56; p = 0.005), but exposure to DBI‐associated medications was not significantly associated with overall QoL and activity of daily living measures. Conclusion: Polypharmacy and anticholinergic and sedative burden were noticed in a substantial number of older adults in residential aged care facilities and were associated with frailty. Investing in the recruitment of pharmacists may benefit recognition of residential ACF quality of care, because pharmacy services (including pharmacists) are virtually non‐existent in Malaysian residential ACFs.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Acutely ill and frail older adults have complex social and health care needs. It is important to understand how this complexity affects acute outcomes for admission to hospital. We validated a frailty index using routine admission laboratory tests with outcomes after patients were admitted to hospital.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;In a prospective cohort of older adults admitted to a large tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom, we created a frailty index from routine admission laboratory investigations (FI-Laboratory) linked to data comprising hospital outcomes. We evaluated the association between the FI-Laboratory and total days spent in hospital, discharge to a higher level of care, readmission and mortality.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Of 2552 admissions among 1750 older adults, we were able to generate FI-Laboratory values for 2254 admissions (88.3% of the cohort). More than half of admitted patients were women (55.3%) and the mean age was 84.6 (SD 14.0) years. We found that the FI-Laboratory correlated weakly with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS; r2 = 0.09). An increase in the CFS and the equivalent of 3 additional abnormal laboratory test results in the FI-Laboratory, respectively, were associated with an increased proportion of inpatient days (rate ratios [RRs] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.52; and 1.47, 95% CI 1.41-1.54), discharge to a higher level of care (odd ratios [ORs] 1.39, 95% CI 1.27-1.52; and 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.47) and increased readmission rate (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.37; and 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.26). Increases in the CFS and FI-Laboratory were associated with increased mortality HRs of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28-1.51) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.37-1.54), respectively.&lt;bold&gt;Interpretation: &lt;/bold&gt;We determined that FI-Laboratory, distinct from baseline frailty, could be used to predict risk of many adverse outcomes. The score is therefore a useful way to quantify the degree of acute illness in frail older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a condition that predominantly affects older people. It is imperative that clinical management considers the other significant illnesses that people with PD accumulate as they age in conjunction with their resilience to cope with physiological change. Multimorbidity and frailty act synergistically to heighten the risk of adverse outcomes for older people with PD. These states are associated with increased likelihood of hospitalization, polypharmacy, adverse drug effects including the anticholinergic burden of medications, drug-disease and drug-drug interactions. Management should be integrated, holistic and individualised to meticulously balance the risks of interventions considering the vulnerability of the individual to recover from disturbance to their environmental, physical and cognitive equilibrium.</ab>

        <ab>• Knee extensor torque complexity is reduced in the presence of frailty syndrome. • Frail participants showed a reduction in body mass, peak knee extensor torque and decreased physical performance. • The relationship between complexity and force levels was similar in all groups. Frailty syndrome is characterized by a marked reduction in physiological reserves and a clinical state of vulnerability to stress. Torque complexity analysis could reveal changes in the musculoskeletal systems that are the result of having the syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the complexity of submaximal isometric knee extensor torque in frail, pre-frail, and non-frail older adults. A secondary aim was to analyze the torque complexity behavior in different force levels in each group. A cross-sectional study was conducted. Forty-two older adults were divided into three groups: non-frail (n = 15), pre-frail (n = 15), and frail (n = 12). The data collected included body composition, five times sit-to-stand test, walking speed, and isometric knee extensor torque at 15, 30, and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. The knee extensor torque variability was evaluated by coefficient of variation, and the torque complexity was evaluated by approximate entropy and sample entropy. The frail group presented a reduction in body mass and peak torque value compared to the non-frail group. Also, the frail group showed worse physical performance (on the five times sit-to-stand test and walking speed) compared to the pre-frail and non-frail groups. In addition, the frail older adults showed reduced torque complexity compared to the non-frail group. Finally, the association between torque complexity and force levels remained similar in all groups. Torque complexity is reduced in the presence of frailty syndrome.</ab>

        <ab>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading cause of disability globally. Frailty is a high-impact geriatric condition that increases the risk of negative health outcomes and imposes remarkable health and social burden. Both frailty and T2DM show multifaceted pathophysiology, phenotypic heterogeneity, and fluctuating manifestations that challenge their management, especially when the two conditions co-occur. Muscle wasting and its correlates (e.g., metabolic perturbations and functional decline) that underlie frailty may exacerbates clinical manifestations of T2DM in older people, resulting in worse prognosis. The intrinsic complexity of frailty and T2DM has hampered the identification of clinically meaningful biomarkers to track the clinical progression of the two conditions over time and to monitor the efficacy of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions. Here, we propose an innovative approach for biomarker identification that couples multi-platform analytical determinations with chemometric modeling strategies. This novel multi-marker discovery process is described in the context of the "Metabolic biomarkers of frailty in older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus" (MetaboFrail) study that aimed at identifying metabolic biomarkers of frailty in functionally limited older persons with T2DM. • Frailty and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are prevalent high-impact condition in older adults. • Muscle wasting and functional decline that underlie frailty may exacerbate clinical manifestations in older people with T2DM. • The complexity of frailty in T2DM should be approached through a multi-marker strategy. • MetaboFrail proposes a novel biomarker discovery process for frailty in T2DM.</ab>

        <ab>King Lear has been extensively used by Shakespearean critics in South Africa for the discussion of land ownership issues. This essay alludes to the work of Martin Orkin and Nicholas Visser, who brought postcolonial and materialistic critiques to bear upon the play in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The essay itself carries the investigation forward to present times, when the text asks to be read in relation to expropriation without compensation: a land proposal being ventilated at the highest political level. The issues which emerge are diverse and unexpected. King Lear's gifts of land to his daughters are actually 'deals' requiring the compensation of their public declarations of love for him. For various reasons this strategy fails. The reader is then invited by the play's imagery to see the body of the old king as a piece of 'real estate' that is incrementally expropriated by the ageing process and the onset of dementia. Spenser's allegory of the House of Temperance in Book II of The Faerie Queene is discussed as a likely influence here. By the end of the play, Lear is divested of his own bodily health and cognitive ability by the arch expropriator, 'time', and its subaltern, the fallible human cell. With regard to critical reception, this essay argues that King Lear has complexity and substance enough to engage the interest of postcolonialists, materialists and universalists alike - even in relation to a topic as specific as land.</ab>

        <ab>The world's populations and workforces are aging and older adults are now the fastest growing group of internet users. Unfortunately, age-related declines may prevent older adults from performing web-based tasks with the same ease as their younger counterparts. Recent studies have suggested that peripheral navigation may exacerbate age-related online performance gaps as older adults fail to adequately search peripheral elements. Such studies have however relied on the use of preexisting websites with no control for layout, complexity, or prior familiarity. This study tested whether age-related differences in online performance and search behavior exist across various navigational layouts. Participants (N = 47) completed four online tasks with purpose-built websites of equivalent difficulty, length, and content type, yet with varying navigational layouts (center; left-periphery; top-periphery; inconsistent). Participants' performance (i.e., accuracy/efficiency), search behavior (i.e., eye gaze/fixation), and satisfaction were examined. Identifiable differences between age-groups and navigational layouts were found, with top-peripheral navigation proving most detrimental to the online performance and satisfaction of both younger and older adults. The results inform design principles that aim to increase older adults' online functionality, and provide an extensive platform for further research.</ab>

        <ab>The present study addresses how task constraints and aging influence isometric force control. We used two tasks requiring either force maintenance (straight line target force) or force modulation (sine-wave target force) around different force levels and at different modulation frequencies. Force levels were defined relative the individual maximum voluntary contraction. A group of young adults (mean age ± SD = 25 ± 3.6 years) and a group of elderly (mean age = 77 ± 6.4 years) took part in the study. Age- and task-related effects were assessed through differences in: (i) force control accuracy, (ii) time-structure of force fluctuations, and (iii) the contribution of deterministic (predictable) and stochastic (noise-like) dynamic components to the expressed behavior. Performance-wise, the elderly showed a pervasive lower accuracy and higher variability than the young participants. The analysis of fluctuations showed that the elderly produced force signals that were less complex than those of the young adults during the maintenance task, but the reverse was observed in the modulation task. Behavioral complexity results suggest a reduced adaptability to task-constraints with advanced age. Regarding the dynamics, we found comparable generating mechanisms in both age groups for both tasks and in all conditions, namely a fixed-point for force maintenance and a limit-cycle for force modulation. However, aging increased the stochasticity (noise-driven fluctuations) of force fluctuations in the cyclic force modulation, which could be related to the increased complexity found in elderly for this same task. To our knowledge this is the first time that these different perspectives to motor control are used simultaneously to characterize force control capacities. Our findings show their complementarity in revealing distinct aspects of sensorimotor adaptation to task constraints and age-related declines. Although further research is still needed to identify the physiological underpinnings, the used task and methodology are shown to have both fundamental and clinical applications.</ab>

        <ab>Older persons' involvement in theater often focuses on health, educational, and therapeutic benefits. Though less examined, artistic depictions of aging help bridge gerontological and humanities approaches to this topic. Qualitative textual script analysis was used to analyze the representation of older adults in six plays produced on and off Broadway, 1991–2017. Traditional character constructions of age and older adults emerged – frailty, fear, caregiving burden – with counternarratives of resilience, resistance, and self-reflexivity also present. Uncovered dyadic pairs (e.g. frailty/resistance) served as examples of the complexity of age portrayed on stage. From this dyadic tension present in the plays emerged a way to build upon and expand traditional, and often more limited, societal notions of aging.</ab>

        <ab>Memory consolidation is well known to occur during sleep, but might start immediately after encoding new information while awake. While consolidation processes are important across the lifespan, they may be even more important to maintain memory functioning in old age. We tested whether a novel measure of information processing known as network complexity might be sensitive to post-encoding consolidation mechanisms in a sample of young, middle-aged, and older adults. Network complexity was calculated by assessing the irregularity of brain signals within a network over time using multiscale entropy. To capture post-encoding mechanisms, network complexity was estimated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest before and after encoding of picture pairs, and subtracted between the two rest periods. Participants received a five-alternative-choice memory test to assess associative memory performance. Results indicated that aging was associated with an increase in network complexity from pre- to post-encoding in the default mode network (DMN). Increases in network complexity in the DMN also were associated with better subsequent memory across all age groups. These findings suggest that network complexity is sensitive to post-encoding consolidation mechanisms that enhance memory performance. These post-encoding mechanisms may represent a pathway to support memory performance in the face of overall memory declines.</ab>

        <ab>As people in developed countries live longer, assessing the fall risk becomes more important. A major contributor to the risk of elderly people falling is postural instability. This study aimed to use the multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis to evaluate postural stability during a timed-up-and-go (TUG) test. This test was deemed a promising method for evaluating fall risk among the elderly in a community. The MSE analysis of postural instability can identify the elderly prone to falling, whereupon early medical rehabilitation can prevent falls. Herein, an objective approach is developed for assessing the postural stability of 85 community-dwelling elderly people (aged 76.12 ± 6.99 years) using the short-form Berg balance scale. Signals were collected from the TUG test using a triaxial accelerometer. A segment-based TUG (sTUG) test was designed, which can be obtained according to domain knowledge, including "Sit-to-Walk (STW)," "Walk," "Turning," and "Walk-to-Sit (WTS)" segments. Employing the complexity index (CI) of sTUG can reveal information about the physiological dynamics' signal for postural stability assessment. Logistic regression was used to assess the fall risk based on significant features of CI related to sTUG. MSE curves for subjects at risk of falling (n = 19) exhibited different trends from those not at risk of falling (n = 66). Additionally, the CI values were lower for subjects at risk of falling than those not at risk of falling. Results show that the area under the curve for predicting fall risk among the elderly subjects with complexity index features from the overall TUG test is 0.797, which improves to 0.853 with the sTUG test. For the elderly living in a community, early assessment of the CI for sTUG using MSE can help predict the fall risk.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Person-centred care (PCC) focusing on personalised goals and care plans derived from "What matters to you?" has an impact on single disease outcomes, but studies on multi-morbid elderly are lacking. Furthermore, the combination of PCC, Integrated Care (IC) and Pro-active care are widely recognised as desirable for multi-morbid elderly, yet previous studies focus on single components only, leaving synergies unexplored. The effect of a synergistic intervention, which implements 1) Person-centred goal-oriented care driven by "What matters to you?" with 2) IC and 3) pro-active care is unknown.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;Inspired by theoretical foundations, complexity science, previous health service research and a patient-driven evaluation of care quality, we designed the Patient-Centred Team (PACT) intervention across primary and secondary care. The PACT team collaborate with the patient to make and deliver a person-centred, integrated and proactive multi-morbidity care-plan. The control group receives conventional care. The study design is a pragmatic six months prospective, controlled clinical trial based on hospital electronic health record data of 439 multi-morbid frail elderly at risk for emergency (re) admissions referred to PACT and 779 propensity score matched controls in Norway, 2014-2016. Outcomes are emergency admissions, the sum of emergency inpatient bed days, 30-day readmissions, planned and emergency outpatient visits and mortality at three and six months follow-up.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;The Rate Ratios (RR) for emergency admissions was 0,9 (95%CI: 0,82-0,99), for sum of emergency bed days 0,68 (95%CI:0,52-0,79) and for 30-days emergency readmissions 0,72 (95%CI: 0,41-1,24). RRs were 2,3 (95%CI: 2,02-2,55) and 0,9 (95%CI: 0,68-1,20) for planned and emergency outpatient visits respectively. The RR for death at 3 months was 0,39 (95% CI: 0,22-0,70) and 0,57 (95% CI: 0,34-0,94) at 6 months.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/bold&gt;Compared with propensity score matched controls, the care process of frail multi-morbid elderly who received the PACT intervention had a reduced risk of high-level emergency care, increased use of low-level planned care, and substantially reduced mortality risk. Further study of process differences between groups is warranted to understand the genesis of these results better.&lt;bold&gt;Trial Registration: &lt;/bold&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02541474 ), registered Sept 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background In the United Kingdom, the 2010 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report 'An Age Old Problem' outlined significant shortcomings in the perioperative care of older people. Other than hip fractures, the care of older patients under surgical specialities is largely devoid of routine geriatrician input. In August 2018, we introduced daily geriatric reviews (GR) on the gastrointestinal surgical wards, aiming to improve length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Methods All acute general surgery admissions for patients ≥70 years were reviewed between September and October 2017 (pre-introduction) and 2018 (post-introduction), and outcomes compared. For 2018, comparisons were also made between those who had GR and those who didn't. Results There were 173 admissions in 2017, vs 190 in 2018. In both 2017 and 2018, median age was 80, median LOS was 4 days, and clinical frailty scale (CFS) 4. Twenty-two percent (38/173) of patients had a surgical procedure in 2017, vs 33% (63/190) in 2018. Inpatient mortality was 8% (13/173) in 2017 (median CFS 6), vs 6% (11/190) in 2018 (median CFS 6). In 2018, 21% (40/190) of patients had GR: median time to review 3 days. 54% (n=22) of the patients with GR underwent a surgical procedure, 37% (n=15) were admitted to ICU, and inpatient mortality was 5% (n=2), vs 28% (n=42), 4% (n=6) and 6% (n=9) respectively for those without GR. 30 day readmission for those with GR was 12.5% (n=5), vs 18.4% (n=28) for those not seen. Conclusion While more surgical procedures were performed in 2018 (post-introduction), overall LOS remained unchanged and improved mortality was observed compared to 2017. Geriatricians are seeing more post-operative and ICU patients, and despite presumed increased complexity, both mortality and readmission rates remain low. Screening for frailty and specific inclusion criteria may improve rates of GR.</ab>

        <ab>Background With increasing numbers of older multi-morbid people being exposed to polypharmacy, research needs to focus on medication-related outcomes affecting quality-of-life (QoL). This study examines older-patients' medication-related QoL (MRQoL), its relationship to medication burden/complexity, frailty, health-related QoL (HRQoL) and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs. Methods A cross-sectional-study was conducted in older-patients attending out-patients and day-hospital services of a tertiary-teaching-hospital. Participants were aged ≥65 years, first-time attendees, taking ≥5 chronic-medications for ≥3 chronic-conditions and mini-mental state examination score ≥26/30. Demographic, medication, comorbidity, frailty status, PIMs(STOPP/STARTv.2 criteria), MRQoL (MRQoL-LS v1.0) HRQoL (Short-form-12; SF-12) and medication burden (Living with Medicines Questionnaire v.2; LMQv2) data were collected. Drg compliance was measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). Lower MRQoL-LS v1.0 scores indicate better MRQoL (range 0-84). Higher LMQv2 scores indicate higher medication burden (range from 60-300). A negative age-specific mean-difference score in SF-12 physical and mental health composite scale scores (SF12-PCS, SF12-MCS) indicates poorer health. Results Over 12 months, 234 patients (attending 78 clinics) were screened, 59 met inclusion criteria and 30 were recruited; 3 patients were subsequently identified as ineligible. Eighteen patients were female (66%), mean age was 79.4 years (SD±6.2), median number of daily medications was 10 (IQR 8-13), median number of comorbidities was 11 (IQR 9-14). Participants were generally drug-compliant, median MARS score of 9 (IQR 6.5-10). Patients' median MRQoL score was 14 (IQR 14-22.5); mean LMQ v2 score was 115.64 (SD± 25.18). Mean age specific mean-difference SF12-PCS and SF12-MCS scores were -22.61 (SD±11.7) and -22.1 (SD±17.5) respectively. There was no significant correlation between MRQoL and number of daily medications, number of comorbidities, LMQ, HRQoL, or PIMs(Pearson's 2-tailed test). Conclusion This study demonstrates that MRQoL-LS v.1 is not applicable to most patients attending geriatric ambulatory services. Furthermore, polypharmacy, multimorbidity, presence of PIMs poorer HRQoL do not correlate significantly with MRQoL.</ab>

        <ab>Background NHR are the frailest group of older people and require a gerontologically attuned approach to combat multiple challenges presented to the practitioner. The in-reach ANPc liaison service aims to confront such challenges, by providing comprehensive gerontological input to all nursing home residents admitted to hospital under all specialities medical, geriatric, and surgical. Methods This service commenced in September of 2018, working 9-5 Monday to Friday with limited leave cross-cover. All nursing home residents are reviewed by a Gerontology Advanced Nurse Practitioner candidate. Each patient received comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) with recommendations for care. All had follow up 2 weeks after discharge in telephone review clinic. Results 118 nursing home residents were admitted for acute care in the study period; 96/118 (82%) were reviewed by the ANPc. 16/118 (14%) were discharged prior to review and 6/118 (5%) died within 24 hours of admission. All other patients were reviewed within 72 hours. All assessed residents had &gt;1 recommendation for intervention to enhance care following CGA: Interventions included 31% (30/96) undiagnosed delirium identified and management advice given. 21% (20/96) had recurrent falls work up and advice. 27% (26/96) had recommendations and changes to admission medications. 37% (36/96) referrals to other HSCP therapy disciplines for complete holistic care. 11% (11/ 96) had advanced care planning regarding future illnesses. 13% (13/96) had palliative care advice and referral to community palliative care. Follow up telephone review clinics have further resulted in reduced readmission rates through liaison with NH staff post-discharge. Conclusion The high complexity of this cohort of patients requires a timely, comprehensive gerontological approach in order to provide holistic care. They require a clearly defined approach to enhance care and minimise the need for unnecessary hospitalisations.</ab>

        <ab>The changing physiology and lifestyle of older people affect the gut microbiota composition. In particular, the age-related diet modifications can alter the gut microbiota biodiversity and determine the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa, resulting in microbiota dysbiosis with negative consequences for the host physiology. Unhealthy microbiota may then induce an acceleration of the age-related physiological changes, consequently concurring at determining the characteristic complexity of frail older persons. One of the major clinical manifestations of frailty is represented by the individual's physical decline. Besides of a well-established clinical phenotype of frailty, the qualitative and quantitative skeletal muscle impairment (i.e., sarcopenia) is today of particular interest for potentially serving as target for (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) interventions to prevent incident disability. Evidence suggests that gut microbiota is able to influence the skeletal muscle homeostasis via microbiota-dependent metabolites, thus representing the possible biological substratum for the sarcopenia onset. In fact, the rearrangements of gut microbiota as well as the alteration of its functions contribute at increasing the anabolic resistance, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, determining mitochondrial abnormalities with consequent oxidation, and causing insulin resistance. In this article, the link between gut microbiota and physical frailty is discussed. It is especially explained the role that sarcopenia may play in this likely bidirectional relationship. • Gut microbiota of frail older people differs from that of healthy individuals. • Gut microbiota dysbiosis has a role in the sarcopenia onset. • A bidirectional relationship exists between gut microbiota and physical frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Changes in the demographics and respective growth of life expectancy and social needs make informal caregiving crucial component of comprehensive health and social care network, which substantially contributes to the health and well-being of the elderly. The purpose of this paper is to understand the system of care of elderly patients with mental disorders from the perspective of informal caregivers in Lithuania. Methods: We conducted five semi-structured focus group discussions with 31 informal caregivers attending to elderly patients with mental disorders. The data were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was subsequently performed. Results: Five thematic categories were established: (1) the current state of care-receivers: representation of the complexity of patients' physical and mental condition. (2) The current state of caregivers: lack of formal caregivers' integration as a team; inadequate formal involvement of informal caregivers. (3) Basic care needs: the reflection of the group needs relating directly to the patient, care organisation and the caretaker. (4) The (non-) Readiness of the existing system to respond to the needs for care: long-term care reliance on institutional services, lack of distinction between acute/immediate care and nursing, lack of integration between the medical sector and the social care sector. (5) Potential trends for further improvement of long-term care for the elderly with mental disorders. Conclusions: Strengthening of the care network for elderly patients with mental disorders should cover more than a personalised and comprehensive assessment of the needs of patients and their caregivers. Comprehensive approaches, such as formalization of informal caregivers' role in the patient care management and planning, a more extensive range of available services and programs supported by diverse sources of funding, systemic developments and better integration of health and social care systems are essential for making the system of care more balanced.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives Older people are likely to transition to a new home closer to family who can provide assistance or to long-term residential care as their health declines and their care needs increase. A minority choose to move to "age-friendly" housing before the onset of disability, but the majority prefer to "age in place" and defer moving until health crises compel a transition. Older people living with dementia are likely to move into residential care, but not much is known about the role they play in decision making around these moves. This qualitative study addresses this gap in knowledge by examining how a rare cohort of "older old" people, most with some level of cognitive impairment, were involved in decisions surrounding assistance seeking and moving to a care home. Research Design and Methods Thematic analysis of qualitative interview data from Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) study participants aged 95 years and older, who had moved in later life, and their proxy informants (n = 26). Results Moves at such an old age were made due to a complexity of push and pull factors which had layered dynamics of decision making. In most cases (n = 22), decision making involved other people with varying degrees of decision ownership. Only four older people, who moved voluntarily, had full ownership of the decision to move. Many relatives reported being traumatized by events leading up to the move. Discussion and Implications "Older old" people are sometimes unable to make their own decisions about moving due to the urgency of health crisis and cognitive decline. There is a need to support relatives to discuss moving and housing options at timely junctures before health crises intervene in an effort to optimize older people's participation in decision making.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Recently we defined a user-friendly tool to assess complexity of patients hospitalized in medical wards. FCS-1 is an average between the Barthel Index and the Exton-Smith score, while FCS-2 is obtained by using the Charlson score. The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of the FCS to predict mortality in-hospital and after 1-3-6-12-months. In this perspective, we performed comparisons with the validated Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI). Methods: It is a multicenter, prospective observational study, enrolling patients aged over 40, suffering from at least two chronic diseases and consecutively admitted to Internal Medicine departments. For each patient, data from 13 questionnaires were collected. Survival follow-up was conducted at 1-3-6-12 months after discharge. The relationships between cumulative incidences of death with FCS were investigated with logistic regression analyses. ROC curve analyses were performed in order to compare the predictiveness of the logistic models based on FCS with respect to those with MPI taken as reference. Results: A cohort of 541 patients was evaluated. A 10-point higher value for FCS-1 and FCS-2 leads to an increased risk of 1-year death equal to 25.0% and 27.1%, respectively. In case of in-hospital mortality, the relevant percentages were 63.1% and 15.3%. The logistic model based on FCS is significantly more predictive than the model based on MPI (which requires an almost doubled number of items) for all the time-points considered. Conclusions: Assessment of prognosis of patients has the potential to guide clinical decision-making and lead to better care. We propose a new, efficient and easy-to-use instrument based on FCS, which demonstrated a good predictive power for mortality in patients hospitalized in medical wards. This tool may be of interest for clinical practice, since it well balances feasibility (requiring the compilation of 34 items, taking around 10 minutes) and performance.</ab>

        <ab>The construct of physical frailty and sarcopenia (PF&amp;S) identifies an age-related pre-disability condition defined by reduced physical performance and low muscle mass. Whether PF&amp;S is characterized by perturbations of the cytokine network is presently unclear. Furthermore, the existence of gender-specific inflammatory profiles of PF&amp;S is unknown. This study was designed to explore the association between a large panel of inflammatory biomolecules and PF&amp;S in older adults through a multivariate statistical approach. Gender-specific inflammatory patterns were also explored. One-hundred community-dwellers aged 70 years and older with PF&amp;S and 100 non-sarcopenic, non-frail controls (nonPF&amp;S) were enrolled. A panel of 30 circulating inflammatory biomarkers was assayed. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to explore the relationship between inflammatory molecules and PF&amp;S. Separate PLS-DA models were built for the whole sample and the two genders. Double cross-validation procedures were used to validate the predictive ability of PLS-DA models. The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model built on the whole sample was found to be four latent variables. The proportion of correct classification was 75.6 ± 1.3% (82.3 ± 1.6% for enrollees with PF&amp;S and 68.7 ± 2.5% for nonPF&amp;S controls). The inflammatory profile of people with PF&amp;S was defined by higher levels of P-selectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interferon γ-induced protein 10. NonPF&amp;S participants were characterized by higher levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin (IL) 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB. Gender-specific PLS-DA allowed identifying a "core" inflammatory signature of PF&amp;S, composed by higher levels of CRP, and lower concentrations of MPO, IL8, MCP-1, and PDGF-BB, with peculiar patterns of relationships for men and women. A core inflammatory profile was identified in people with PF&amp;S with a gender-specific signature. The dissection of the PF&amp;S "cytokinome" will provide novel insights into the role played by inflammation in the disabling cascade and allow designing personalized treatment strategies. • Cytokine network dysregulation is a major driver of aging and related conditions. • BIOSPHERE was designed to identify new biomarkers for physical frailty &amp; sarcopenia. • A PF&amp;S cytokinome encompassing eight inflammatory biomolecules was identified. • Gender-specific inflammatory fingerprints were also characterized. • PF&amp;S pathophysiology might be related to loss of hormetic inflammatory signaling.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: Frailty syndrome is related to decreased physiological complexity, functional capacity and cognition. Physical exercise has been suggested to slow down and reverse this syndrome. However, evidence of its effectiveness is not as straightforward as conventionally admitted, as there is a lack of trials with rigorous methodology. The purpose of this study was to describe the Pre‐Frail Multicomponent Training Intervention protocol. Methods: Cardiovascular, motor control and neuromuscular systems of pre‐frail older adults will be assessed by measuring the complexity of the output of these systems. Functional capacity and cognition will be assessed by specific tools. A 16‐week training protocol will be carried out on three alternate days, with 60‐min sessions, and combining aerobic, muscle strength, flexibility and balance exercises. The objective of this intervention is to improve the cardiovascular, motor control and neuromuscular systems, as well as functional capacity and cognition of pre‐frail older adults. The assessment of these systems will be carried out using gold standard devices. Results: The results of the present study might allow clinical and functional support for the evaluation of the variables analyzed. Conclusion: This protocol is easily reproducible and requires low‐cost materials, thus the Pre‐Frail Multicomponent Training Intervention could be a therapeutic strategy for pre‐frail older adults.

        <ab>Objectives: While patients’ health priorities should inform healthcare, strategies for doing so are lacking for patients with multiple conditions. We describe challenges to, and strategies that support, patients’ priorities-aligned decision-making. Design: Participant observation qualitative study. Setting: Primary care and cardiology practices in Connecticut. Participants: Ten primary care clinicians, five cardiologists, and the Patient Priorities implementation team (four geriatricians, physician expert in clinician training, behavioral medicine expert). The patients discussed were ≥ 66 years with &gt;3 chronic conditions and ≥10 medications or saw ≥ two specialists. Exposure: Following initial training and experience in providing Patient Priorities Care, the clinicians and Patient Priorities implementation team participated in 21 case-based, group discussions (10 face-to-face;11 telephonic). Using emergent learning (i.e. learning which arises from interactions among the participants), participants discussed challenges, posed solutions, and worked together to determine how to align care options with the health priorities of 35 patients participating in the Patient Priorities Care pilot. Main outcomes: Challenges to, and strategies for, aligning decision-making with patient’s health priorities. Results: Categories of challenges discussed among participants included uncertainty, complexity, and multiplicity of problems and treatments; difficulty switching to patients’ priorities as the focus of decision-making; and differing perspectives between patients and clinicians, and among clinicians. Strategies identified to support patient priorities-aligned decision-making included starting with one thing that matters most to each patient; conducting serial trials of starting, stopping, or continuing interventions; focusing on function (i.e. achieving patient’s desired activities) rather than eliminating symptoms; basing communications, decision-making, and effectiveness on patients’ priorities not solely on diseases; and negotiating shared decisions when there are differences in perspectives. Conclusions: The discrete set of challenges encountered and the implementable strategies identified suggest that patient priorities-aligned decision-making in the care of patients with multiple chronic conditions is feasible, albeit complicated. Findings require replication in additional settings and determination of their effect on patient outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract The increase of prevalence of mental health problems in the elderly due to the aging of the population becomes an outstanding issue since in most individuals it happens in an already complex multimorbid scenario that may include frailty and age-related medical conditions. Depression, soon the major cause of global disease burden, can be found as an age-related comorbidity and frailty, or as part of neurodegenerative diseases and where females are more vulnerable to it. Thought the multifactorial aetiology and heterogeneous nature of depression render it difficult to be modelled in animals, active behaviours elicited in the Forced Swimming Test (FST) are used to screen antidepressant treatments. However, interpretation of immobility remains controversial. The present work addressed this issue in very-old (21 months) female C57bl/6 × 129 mice, also with the concern that a '6 minutes × 2 days' protocol can result demanding for a very-old animal and confounding factors may also arise. Animals were behaviourally assessed for sensorimotor functions, emotionality and anxiety-like behaviours, novelty seeking, and immobility in a 2-days FST. The predictive value of the first day evidenced that one single assay as sufficient for the assessment of immobility, and that the repeated test did not increase the immobility response. Moreover, sensorimotor tasks, neophobia in the corner test and emotional behaviour in the dark-light box correlated with FST immobility, contributing to the response. The results support the concern of geroscience on the relevance of using aged animals but also aware about taking into account the complexity of their comorbid scenario. Highlights • In 21-month-old females, first FST assay strongly predicted immobility in the 24 h repeated test. • Comorbid sensorimotor and emotional profiles are correlated with the FST-immobility performance. • Equilibrium strongly correlated (negative) with FST-immobility over the time and days. • Neophobia and emotionality correlated (negative) with FST-immobility. • Activity in the open-field and the hole-board test correlated (positively) with immobility.</ab>

        <ab>Patient satisfaction with the general practitioner (GP) is lower in older persons with a higher level of complexity of health problems. This study investigates whether, in these older persons, changes in satisfaction with their GP, on receiving improved integrated care, is related to their perceived health state.Using the Integrated Systematic Care for Older People (ISCOPE) trial (aimed at improving person- centered integrated care) this study compared changes in satisfaction with the GP in older persons (aged ≥75 years) with a high level of complex health problems on receiving integrated care, stratified for perceived health state at baseline. Satisfaction with the GP was registered on a 5-point Likert scale. Perceived health state was estimated with the Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey-Composite End Point (TOPICS-CEP) at baseline, stratified into 33% percentiles. Differences in satisfaction change between the intervention and usual care/control groups (overall and stratified for perceived health state) are presented by percentages of ‘very satisfied’ participants and improving or deteriorating 1 or more points on the Likert scale. At baseline, the intervention (n = 151) and control group (n = 603) were mainly female (75%) and living alone (62%); mean age was 83 years. Medical status, perceived health state and characteristics of participants were similar. Overall, at baseline 44.4% of respondents in the intervention group were ‘very satisfied’ compared with 37.1% at follow-up, (difference -7.3%). In the control group, ‘very satisfied’ at baseline was 32% and at follow up 29.2% (difference -2.8%). The p-value for this difference in change is 0.56. After stratification for TOPICS-CEP the results were the same. In older persons with a high level of complexity of health problems, implementation of person- centered integrated healthcare did not influence their satisfaction with the GP, also not among those with the highest or lowest perceived health state.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Older people with frailty (OPF) can experience reduced quality of care and adverse outcomes due to poorly coordinated and fragmented care, making this patient population a key target group for integrated care. This systematic review explores service user, carer and provider perspectives on integrated care for OPF, and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation, to draw out implications for policy, practice and research. Methods: Systematic review and narrative synthesis of qualitative studies identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index, hand-searching of reference lists and citation tracking of included studies, and review of experts’ online profiles. Quality of included studies was appraised with The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for qualitative research. Results: Eighteen studies were included in the synthesis. We identified four themes related to stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF: different preferences for integrated care among service users, system and service organisation components, relational aspects of care and support, and stakeholder perceptions of outcomes. Service users and carers highlighted continuity of care with a professional they could trust, whereas providers emphasised improved coordination of care between providers in different care sectors as key strategies for integrated care. We identified three themes related to factors facilitating and hindering implementation: perceptions of the integrated care intervention and target population, service organisational factors and system level factors influencing implementation. Different stakeholder groups perceived the complexity of care needs of this patient population, difficulties with system navigation and access, and limited service user and carer involvement in care decisions as key factors hindering implementation. Providers mainly also highlighted other organisational and system factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation of integrated care for OPF. Conclusions: Similarities and differences in lay and professional stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation were evident. Findings highlight the importance of addressing organisational and system level components of integrated care and factors influencing implementation for OPF. Greater attention needs to be placed on collaboratively involving service users, carers and providers to improve the co-design and implementation of integrated care programmes for this patient population.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Serious infections in older people are associated with unplanned hospital admissions and high mortality. Recognising the presence of a serious infection and making an accurate diagnosis are important challenges for General Practice. This study aimed to explore the issues UK GPs face when diagnosing serious infections in older patients. Methods: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. 28 GPs from 27 practices were purposively sampled from across the UK to achieve maximum variation in terms of GP role, experience and practice population. Interviews began by asking participants to describe recent or memorable cases where they had assessed older patients with suspected serious infections. Additional questions from the topic guide were used to explore the challenges further. Interview transcripts were coded and analysed using a modified framework approach. Results: Diagnosing serious infection in older adults was perceived to be challenging by participating GPs and the diagnosis was often uncertain. Contributing factors included patient complexity, atypical presentations, as well as a lack of knowledge of patients due to a loss in continuity. Diagnostic challenges were present at each stage of the patient assessment. Scoring systems were mainly used as communication tools. Investigations were sometimes used to resolve diagnostic uncertainty, but availability and speed of result limited their practical use. Clear safety-net plans shared with patients and their families helped GPs manage ongoing uncertainty. Conclusions: Diagnostic challenges are present throughout the assessment of an older adult with a serious infection in primary care. Supporting GPs to provide continuity of care may improve the recognition and developing point of care testing for use in community settings may reduce diagnostic uncertainty.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;The ageing global population has seen increasing numbers of older people living with chronic health problems, declining function, and frailty. As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89 years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were 'The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.&lt;bold&gt;Trial Registration: &lt;/bold&gt;ANZCTR Trial ID: ACTRN126140011746773 .</ab>

        <ab>A meeting organised by the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences focussed on the challenges of developing medicines for older adults. International experts discussed the complexity introduced by polypharmacy and multiple morbidities and how the risk–benefit ratio of a medicine changes as an individual ages. The way in which regulatory authorities are encouraging the development of age-appropriate medicines was highlighted. Examples were provided of the difficulties faced by the older population with some medicinal products and suggestions given as to how the pharmaceutical scientist can build the requirements of the older population into their development of new medicines, as well as improvements to existing ones.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Purpose The aim was to provide an overview of chronic low-grade inflammatory phenotype (CLIP) and evidence for its role in the pathogenesis of frailty and other chronic conditions as well as potential causative factors and interventions. Methods We reviewed evidence from published clinical and laboratory studies and summarized the opinions of experts from published reviews. Findings CLIP is a low-grade, systemic, unresolved, and smoldering chronic inflammatory state clearly indicated by a 2- to 4-fold increase in serum levels of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. It involves many other cellular and molecular inflammatory mediators. CLIP typically occurs during aging, also known as "inflammaging," and is an integral part of the spectrum of immunosenescence. Causative factors likely include persistent viral infections, particularly chronic cytomegalovirus infection, cellular senescence, failure to eliminate degraded materials and waste products, dysregulated microbiota and gut permeability, obesity, and others. Substantial evidence supports CLIP as a powerful contributing factor to frailty and many other chronic conditions and adverse health outcomes. Many of the inflammatory mediators and their regulatory mechanisms in CLIP may serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. However, development of new interventional strategies for CLIP and its associated chronic conditions should take the complexity of the inflammatory network into consideration. Nonpharmacologic interventions, such as caloric restriction and exercise, may have significant impact on CLIP and its causative factors, leading to substantial health benefits. Metformin and resveratrol have anti-inflammatory property and may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of CLIP and frailty. Implications CLIP is a chronic inflammatory pathophysiologic process that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of frailty and many other chronic conditions. Improving our understanding of this phenotype may provide opportunities to identify potential targets of effective prevention and therapeutic strategies for frailty and other CLIP-associated conditions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Physical frailty, characterized by reduced physiologic complexity and ability to cope with stressors, is closely associated with cognitive impairment, which increases the risk of poor clinical outcomes. To better capture the association between frailty and cognitive impairment, a new construct, cognitive frailty, has been proposed. Cognitive frailty is a clinical condition characterized by the simultaneous presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment. There is little evidence on the relationship between physical frailty and cognition, as well as cognitive frailty, in Chinese older adults. We aimed to elucidate whether physical frailty is associated with cognitive impairment in an older Chinese population. Methods: Data were obtained from the China Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Study. The sample comprised 3202 community-dwelling adults, aged 60 years and older, from seven Chinese cities. Physical frailty was assessed using a modified, four-item version of the Fried criteria, according to frailty phenotype. Cognitive function was assessed usrng the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: The prevalence of physical frailty, prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and cognifrailty was 9.9, 33.9, 7.5, and 2.3%, respectively (weighted: 8.8, 33.8, 6.5, and 2.0%). The prevalence of the combination of prefrail/frail and cognitive impairment was 5.1% (weighted 4.5%). Frail participants performed worse on global cognition and all cognitive domains than robust and prefrail participants. The MMSE total score was positively correlated with walking speed and negatively correlated with age and frailty. A multivariate logistic regression revealed that after adjusting for age, gender, education level, living area, and chronic diseases, frailty, exhaustion, slowness, and inactivity were significantly associated with poor global cognition.Conclusions: The standard prevalence of physical frailty, prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and cognitive frailty in community-dwelling older adults in China was 8.8, 33.8, 6.5, and 2.0%, respectively. Frailty, exhaustion, slowness, and inactivity were significantly associated with poor global cognition.</ab>

        <ab>Diabetes mellitus affects over 20% of people aged &gt; 65 years. With the population of older people living with diabetes growing, the condition may be only one of a number of significant comorbidities that increases the complexity of their care, reduces functional status and inhibits their ability to self-care. Coexisting comorbidities may compete for the attention of the patient and their healthcare team, and therapies to manage comorbidities may adversely affect a person's diabetes. The presence of renal or liver disease reduces the types of antihyperglycemic therapies available for use. As a result, insulin and sulfonylurea-based therapies may have to be used, but with caution. There may be a growing role for sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in diabetic renal disease and for glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 therapy in renal and liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Cancer treatments pose considerable challenges in glucose therapy, especially the use of cyclical chemotherapy or glucocorticoids, and cyclical antihyperglycemic regimens may be required. Clinical trials of glucose lowering show reductions in microvascular and, to a lesser extent, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but these benefits take many years to accrue, and evidence specifically in older people is lacking. Guidelines recognize that clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus need to be mindful of comorbidity, particularly the risks of hypoglycemia, and ensure that patient-centered therapeutic management of diabetes is offered. Targets for glucose control need to be carefully considered in the context of comorbidity, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient wishes and expectations. This review discusses the role of chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, cancer, severe mental illness, ischemic heart disease, and frailty as comorbidities in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</ab>

        <ab>This paper addresses how the introduction of welfare technologies in Denmark makes the bodywork of eldercare an object of public governance, and investigates how wash-and-dry toilets co-constitute professional care work. First, a theoretical frame is established for studying care, with an emphasis on bodywork as a sociomaterial and collective accomplishment. The paper then unfolds the great expectations tied to welfare technologies in general, and wash-and-dry toilets specifically. Turning to differentiated examples of situated uses of the toilets, the complexity of making the toilets work within the context of professional eldercare is illustrated. Some of the uses of the toilets in care work are in concordance with policy expectations. Other uses demonstrate difficulties in satisfying the great expectations and call for a more complex understanding of what it takes to achieve dignified, technologically assisted care without silencing the skills and professionalism of care workers.</ab>

        <ab>The number of hip fractures in anticoagulated patients is predicted to increase, due to people living longer. However, evidence regarding urgent perioperative management of elderly patients with hip fracture who take oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants) is scarce. In this article, the authors present a narrative review of the evidence to date supporting the urgent management of hip fracture in anticoagulated elderly patients. They discuss the complexity of managing the high risk of procedure-related bleeding and, at the same time, the high risk of thromboembolism. The role of a bridging procedure and the best strategy of anticoagulation reversal are also reviewed. Further studies are required to improve the evidence in urgent surgery, especially in frail elderly patients.</ab>

        <ab>Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the malignant disease.</ab>

        <ab>Hypertension is a common disease in the elderly associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Due to the complexity of this population, the optimal target of blood pressure (BP) control is still controversial. In this article, we conduct a literature review of trials published in English in the last 10 years which were specifically designed to study the efficacy and safety of various BP targets in patients who are 70 years or older. Using these criteria, we found that the benefits in the positive studies were demonstrated even with a minimal BP control (systolic BP [SBP] &lt;150 mmHg) and continued to be reported for a SBP &lt;120 mmHg. On the other hand, keeping SBP &lt;140 mmHg seemed to be safely achieved in elderly patients. Although the safety of lowering SBP to &lt;120 mmHg is debated, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial study has shown no increased risk of falls, fractures, or kidney failure in elderly patients with SBP lower than this threshold. While the recent guidelines recommended to keep BP &lt;130/80 mmHg in the elderly, more individualized approach should be considered to achieve this goal in order to avoid undesirable complications. Furthermore, further studies are required to evaluate BP target in very old patients or those with multiple comorbidities.</ab>

        <ab>In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

        <ab>OBJECTIVES To summarize available tools that can assist clinicians in identifying and reducing or stopping (deprescribing) potentially inappropriate medications and that specifically consider frailty or limited life expectancy. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. SETTING We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL from inception to December 2017, along with grey literature. We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications. PARTICIPANTS Frail older persons and older persons with limited life expectancy. MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of tools. RESULTS: We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medication‐specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, step‐wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in very low‐quality studies). CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:172–180, 2019.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Objectives: &lt;/bold&gt;Many European countries face challenges in long-term care for older people, such as the growing number of older people requiring care, the increasing complexity of their health care problems, and a decreasing workforce that is inadequately prepared. Optimizing the staff and skill mix of health care teams may offer part of the solution for these challenges. The aim of this study was to obtain insight into the development of teams in terms of staff and skill mix, and the influence of staff and skill mix on quality of care, quality of life, and job satisfaction.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;Seven teams in elderly care in the Netherlands participated in this exploratory case study. From April 2013 to January 2015, a researcher followed the development of the teams, performed observations at the workplace and held interviews with team members, team captains, and (representatives of) clients. Data-analyses were carried out in MAXQDA 11, by coding interviews and analyzing themes.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;During the project, almost all teams became more diverse in terms of staff and skill mix. In general, there was a trend towards adding (more) higher-qualified health care workers (e.g. nurse) to the team, increasing communication with other disciplines, and enhancing skills of lower-qualified team members. A more diverse staff and skill mix had a positive effect on quality of care and quality of life of clients, and on job satisfaction, but only under certain contextual conditions. Important contextual conditions for successful functioning of a diverse team were a shared view of care by all team members, good communication, autonomy for professionals, and a safe team culture.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/bold&gt;A more diverse staff and skill mix, in combination with positive contextual conditions, can result in improved quality of care, quality of life, and job satisfaction. However, a "one size fits all" blueprint for the optimal staff and skill mix, that suits each team and organization, does not exist. This depends on the context, and should be based on the needs of the clients and possible future changes in these needs.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: People living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer and developing comorbidities and aging-related syndromes. New care models are needed to address the combined burden and complexity of HIV and its comorbidities in this group. The goal of this study is to describe qualitative data from patients and providers that informed the development of a comprehensive care model for older PLWH. Methods: Patient and provider perspectives on the clinical care and service needs of patients living and aging with HIV were explored via surveys and focus groups at a safety net HIV clinic in San Francisco. We surveyed 77 patients and 26 providers and conducted separate focus groups of older patients living with HIV (n = 31) and staff (n = 20). Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes for a care program were additionally explored using findings from the literature on HIV and aging. Findings: Themes from surveys and focus groups emphasized (a) the need for knowledge expertise in HIV and aging, (b) focus on medical conditions and determinants of health of particular import (e.g. marginal housing) among older PLWH, (c) co-locating specialty services (e.g. cardiology, geriatrics) with primary care, and (d) addressing social isolation. Findings informed the design of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary care model for PLWH called the Golden Compass program composed of four “points”: Heart and Mind (North), Bones and Strength (East), Network and Navigation (South), and Dental, Hearing, and Vision (West). Conclusion: Based on patient and clinic staff perspectives from surveys and focus groups, we designed a multidisciplinary program of integrated primary and specialty care, as well as housing and social support, to address the needs of older PLWH within a safety-net infrastructure. Golden Compass launched in 2017 for PLWH older than 50 years. Future research to evaluate the effectiveness of this care program in improving patient outcomes and satisfaction is ongoing.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract The aim of this paper is to subject the clinical classification of frailty to scrutiny through exploring, via a phenomenological lens, the lived experiences of older people who meet the objective, or clinical, criteria of frailty. Drawing on a range of published research that explores the heterogeneous experiences of embodied ageing, the paper highlights the continuity of phenomenological structures of experience across successful ageing, normal ageing and frailty, suggesting the permeability and contestability of the boundaries between them and highlighting the complexity of health and illness in old age. Such data suggests a need to question the perception of frailty as something both apart from 'normal' ageing, and constitutive of frailed or failed ageing, and challenges the construction of the third age/fourth age polarity that underpins much of the meaning accorded to old age today. Highlights • This paper explores the meaning of frailty through the lived experiences of frail older people • It draws on published research that explores the lived experience of frailty, health and illness in ageing • It aims to highlight the continuity of embodied structures across these categories and the contestability of the boundaries • In doing so it aims to challenge the social imaginary of frailty as failed ageing and symbolic of the fourth age • It highlights the usefulness of phenomenology for tailoring interventions to fit diverse lived experiences in old age</ab>

        <ab>Background: Despite the frequency of hospital readmissions, there is still a relatively incomplete understanding of the broader array of factors pertaining to readmission in older persons. Few studies have explored how older persons experience readmission and their perceptions of circumstances affecting the course of care. Research indicates that males experience poorer health outcomes and are at higher risk of readmission compared to women. Aim: To explore life conditions and critical incidents pertained to hospital readmission from the perspective of older males. Methods: The study used a qualitative explorative design using the Critical Incident Technique. A purposive sample of four males aged 65–75 were recruited from two internal medical wards. Data were collected through narrative double interviews. The study was registered by the North Denmark Region's joint notification of health research (ID 2008‐58‐0028). Findings: The analysis revealed four themes of life conditions: 'Ambiguity of ageing', 'Living with the burden of illness', 'Realisation of dependency' and 'Growing sense of vulnerability and mortality'. Critical incidents comprised four areas: 'Balancing demands and resources in everyday life', 'Back home again – a period of recovery', 'Care interaction' and 'Navigating within and between healthcare system(s)'. Conclusion: This study illustrated the interconnectedness, dynamics and complexity of life conditions and critical incidents that over time and across diverse healthcare sectors affected the course of care in older persons. Hospital readmissions seem related to a complex web of interacting life conditions and critical incidents rather than growing age or specific illnesses.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Background One of the major threats looming over the growing older population is frailty. It is a distinctive health state characterised by increased vulnerability to internal and external stressors. Although the presence of frailty is well acknowledged, its concept and operationalisation are hampered by the extraordinary phenotypical and biological complexity. Yet, a widely accepted conception is needed to offer tailored policies and approaches. The ADVANTAGE Group aims to analyse the diverse frailty concepts to uncover the essence of frailty as a basis for a shared understanding. Method A systematic literature review was performed on frailty concepts and definitions from 2010 onwards. Eligible publications were reviewed using concept analysis that led to the extraction of text data for the themes "definition", "attributes", "antecedents", "consequences", and "related concepts". Qualitative description was used to further analyse the extracted text passages, leading to inductively developed categories on the essence of frailty. Results 78 publications were included in the review, and 996 relevant text passages were extracted for analysis. Five components constituted a comprehensive definition: vulnerability, genesis, features, characteristics, and adverse outcomes. Each component is described in more detail by a set of defining and explanatory criteria. An underlying functional perspective of health or its impairments is most compatible with the entity of frailty. Discussion The recent findings facilitate a focus on the relevant building blocks that define frailty. They point to the commonalities of the diverse frailty concepts and definitions. Based on these components, a widely accepted broad definition of frailty comes into range. Highlights • The literature review reveals a variety of concepts and definitions on frailty. • A definition that covers five components facilitates a comprehensive understanding. • These are: vulnerability, genesis, features, characteristics, and adverse outcomes. • There is a growing understanding of frailty as a "complex system". • A functional holistic definition seems to meet the current understanding of frailty.</ab>

        <ab>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their associated proteins represent one of the most diverse cellular signaling systems involved in both physiological and pathophysiological processes. Aging represents perhaps the most complex biological process in humans and involves a progressive degradation of systemic integrity and physiological resilience. This is in part mediated by age-related aberrations in energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, protein folding and sorting, inflammatory activity and genomic stability. Indeed, an increased rate of unrepaired DNA damage is considered to be one of the 'hallmarks' of aging. Over the last two decades our appreciation of the complexity of GPCR signaling systems has expanded their functional signaling repertoire. One such example of this is the incipient role of GPCRs and GPCR-interacting proteins in DNA damage and repair mechanisms. Emerging data now suggest that GPCRs could function as stress sensors for intracellular damage, e.g., oxidative stress. Given this role of GPCRs in the DNA damage response process, coupled to the effective history of drug targeting of these receptors, this suggests that one important future activity of GPCR therapeutics is the rational control of DNA damage repair systems.</ab>

        <ab>Multimorbidity is a common and burdensome condition that may affect quality of life, increase medical needs, and make people live more years of life with disability. Negative outcomes related to multimorbidity occur beyond what we would expect from the summed effect of single conditions, as chronic diseases interact with each other, mutually enhancing their negative effects, and eventually leading to new clinical phenotypes. Moreover, multimorbidity mirrors an accelerated global susceptibility and a loss of resilience, which are both hallmarks of aging. Due to the complexity of its assessment and definition, and the lack of clear evidence steering its management, multimorbidity represents one of the main current challenges for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The authors of this article recently reflected on these issues during two twin international symposia at the 2016 European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS) meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, and the 2016 Gerontological Society of America (GSA) meeting in New Orleans, USA. The present work summarizes the most relevant aspects related to multimorbidity, with the ultimate goal to identify knowledge gaps and suggest future directions to approach this condition.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The increasing complexity of drug regimens over time and the use of multiple medications exposes older patients to a greater risk of receiving inappropriate medications. This study investigated whether Drug Burden Index (DBI) and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) were associated with patient-reported health outcomes (PROs) in community-dwelling older adults (aged ≥ 60 years) in Malaysia.Methods: DBI was used to quantify patients’ exposure to anticholinergic and sedative medications in a cross-sectional sample of older individuals from the community pharmacy setting in Malaysia. PIMs (based on Beers criteria), potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP; based on STOPP criteria) and polypharmacy (use of ≥ 5 concurrent medications) were used to quantify exposure to inappropriate medications. PROs were investigated using the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) for frailty and older people’s quality of life-35 (OPQOL) for quality of life (QOL). The adjusted associations between DBI, medication inappropriateness and PROs were analyzed.Results: More than half of the study participants received ≥ 1 anticholinergic or sedative medications (mean 0.47/participant; range 0.0-2.14). Prevalence of frailty was low (8.90% of patients), with a mean GFI score of 1.67 (range 1-8) and was significantly and positively correlated with DBI (r 0.253; p = 0.003). In multivariate logistic regression, frailty was found to be significantly associated with the odds of receiving DBI-associated medications (odds ratio 1.44; 95% CI 1.02-2.02, p = 0.039). Non-significant associations were found between DBI and QOL domains, except for a significant and positive correlation between the independence domain of OPQOL and PIP.Conclusion: This study indicates a significant relationship between drug burden measured by DBI and frailty measured by GFI. The prescribers managing various medical conditions of older people should consider frailty and other relevant physical health parameters as important health outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Older people are the "core business" for 21st century hospitals. Of concern, therefore, is negative stereotyping of older people by medical students. Through a bespoke teaching session for final-year medical students, we aimed to deconstruct the phraseology they employed in relation to older people and to drive attitudinal change among students. This study also aimed to discern whether there was a detectable difference in attitudes toward older people after the session. Forty-seven medical students participated. Students recorded in a "word-cloud" terms they associated with older people in hospital before and after the session. The University of California Los Angeles Geriatrics Attitude Scale (UCLA-GAS) was administered for pre-session. The intervention students, along with a control group, completed this instrument at the end of their placement. Content analysis of word cloud data was performed—an iterative, transparent, structured approach to analysis, along with external critique of findings and collaborative triangulation ensured rigor of analysis. Qualitative analysis demonstrated the use of pejorative and sometimes nihilistic terms. There were evidence of growing appreciation of the inherent complexity of caring for older people and increasing awareness of how healthcare systems can be challenging for older people. Quantitative analysis revealed that there is no statistical difference neither between the UCLA-GAS pre- and post-teaching nor the intervention and control groups. In conclusion, a bespoke educational intervention, designed to promote student reflection on their views toward older people in hospital, can be a catalyst to challenging superficial and stereotypical views.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community‐dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Frailty is associated with multi-system deterioration, and typically increases susceptibility to adverse events such as falls. Frailty can be better managed with early screening and intervention, ideally conducted in primary health care (PHC) settings. This study used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as an evaluation framework during the second stage piloting of a novel web-based tool called the Frailty Portal, developed to aid in the screening, identification, and care planning of frail patients in community PHC.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;This qualitative study conducted semi-structured key informant interviews with a purposive sample of PHC providers (family physicians, nurse practitioners) and key PHC stakeholders who were administrators, decision makers and staff. The CFIR was used to guide data collection and analysis. Framework Analysis was used to determine the relevance of the CFIR constructs to implementing the Frailty Portal.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;A total of 17 interviews were conducted. The CFIR-inspired interview questions helped clarify critical aspects of implementation that need to be addressed at multiple levels if the Frailty Portal is to be successfully implemented in PHC. Finding were organized into three themes 1) PHC Practice Context, 2) Intervention attributes affecting implementation, and 3) Targeting providers with frail patients. At the intervention level the Frailty Portal was viewed positively, despite the multi-level challenges to implementing it in PHC practice settings. Provider participants perceived high opportunity costs to using the Frailty Portal due to changes they needed to make to their practice routines. However, those who had older patients, took the time to learn how to use the Frailty Portal, and created processes for sharing tasks with other PHC personnel become proficient at using the Frailty Portal.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Structuring our evaluation around the CFIR was instrumental in identifying multi-level factors that will affect large-scale adoption of the Frailty Portal in PHC practices. Incorporating CFIR constructs into evaluation instruments can flag factors likely to impede future implementation and impact the effectiveness of innovative practices. Future research is encouraged to identify how best to facilitate changes in PHC practices to address frailty and to use implementation frameworks that honor the complexity of implementing innovations in PHC.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The aim of this study is to develop a new predictive model to measure complexity of patients in medical wards. Setting: 29 Internal Medicine departments in Italy. Materials and methods: The study cohort was made of 541 consecutive patients hospitalized for any cause, aged more than 40 years and with at least two chronic diseases. First, we applied a hierarchical cluster analysis and the principal component analysis (PCA) to a panel of questionnaires [comorbidity (Charlson, CIRS), clinical stability (MEWS), social frailty (Flugelman), cognitive dysfunction (SPSMQ), depression (5-item GDS), functional dependence (ADL, IADL, Barthel), risk of sore threats (Exton-Smith scale), nutrition (MNA), pain (NRPS), adherence to therapy (Morisky scale)], in order to select domains informative for the definition of complexity. The following step was to create the score(s) needed to quantify it. Results: Two main clusters were identified: the first includes 7 questionnaires whose common denominator is dependence and frailty, the second consists of 3 questionnaires representative of comorbidity. Globally, they account for about 70% of the total variance (55.2% and 13.8%, respectively). The first principal component was simplified in “Complimed Score 1” (CS1) as a recalibrated average between the Barthel Index and the Exton Smith score, whereas the second cluster was approximated to “Complimed Score 2” (CS2), by using the Charlson score only. Conclusions: Complexity is a two-dimensional clinical phenomenon. The FADOI-Complimed Score(s) is a new tool useful for the routine evaluation of complexity in medical patients, simple to use and taking around 10 minutes to complete.</ab>

        <ab>Older people living in residential aged care often experience complex persistent pain because of the presence of multiple comorbidities and geriatric syndrome. Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration needs to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population can be improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary suffering.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Older patients are major users of pharmacotherapy due to a higher incidence of health issues. However, there is evidence of age-biased prescribing, leading to over- or underprescribing of medication, and suboptimal clinical outcomes. Although many guidelines provide cautionary statements about the use of medicines in older patients, they fail to identify what this means in practice. There is no accepted definition of an older adult that appropriately characterises this patient group. As a result, there is potential for physicians to have variable interpretations of individuals within this patient population, leading to potential inconsistencies when making pharmacotherapeutic decisions.Objective: The aim of this study was to explore how Australian medical physicians practically defined an older adult patient in the context of providing pharmacotherapeutic care to this population.Methods: This was a two-stage study comprising a scenario-based questionnaire (quantitative phase) and semi-structured individual interviews (qualitative phase) with Australian physicians. Qualitative data was thematically analysed and manual inductive coding was used to generate core themes.Results: A total of 15 physicians participated in the study. Overall, in regard to providing care to their older patients, the three key themes that emerged from physicians’ discussions were (1) using a number-based versus health status-based definition of an older patient; (2) patient ‘red flags’ influence prescribing decisions; and (3) lack of guideline support in prescribing for older patients. Most physicians ultimately defined older adult patients using a number-based description (i.e. age between 65 and 90 years) because they felt they needed some sort of ‘cut-off’ point to guide their decision making. However, in assessing an older patient, physicians considered a multitude of patient factors as influencers of their decision making during prescribing, including comorbidities, cognitive function, frailty, polypharmacy, etc., and did not solely focus on the patient’s age.Conclusion: Physicians describe the complexity of decision making for older adult patients, and how this is influenced by a diverse range of factors, yet ultimately simplify the process by defaulting to number-based (age in years) guidelines and procedures.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To propose the application of the concept of geriatric syndrome for common geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions and to suggest the necessity of developing effective evaluation methods for oral and maxillofacial frailty. Design: The concepts of frailty and geriatric syndrome based on multi‐morbidity and polypharmacy were applied to five common geriatric oral medicinal dysfunctional problems: salivary gland hypofunction (dry mouth), chronic oral mucosal pain disorders (burning mouth symptoms), taste disorders (taste disturbances), swallowing disorders (dysphagia), and oral and maxillofacial movement disorders (oromandibular dyskinesia and dystonia). Results: Each of the dysfunctions is caused by various kinds of diseases and/or conditions and medications, thus the concept of geriatric syndrome could be applied. These dysfunctions, suggested as components of oral and maxillofacial geriatric syndrome, are associated and interacted with each other in a complexity of vicious cycle. The resulting functional impairments caused by this syndrome can cause oral and maxillofacial frailty. Conclusions: Geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions could be better appreciated in the context of geriatric syndrome. The development of effective methods for evaluating the severity of these dysfunctions and the resulting frailty is essential.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To analyze gender differences in incidence and determinants of the components of the frailty phenotype. Method: A total of 1,413 older adults were selected in 2006. To estimate the incidence of each frailty component, only individuals who did not exhibit a given component at baseline (independently of the presence of other components) were included in the study. The variables of interest were socioeconomic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric factors and physical performance. The incidence of each component in 2010 was the outcome. Results: Unintentional weight loss and slowness were more incident in men up to 74 years of age. The other frailty components were more incident in women at all age groups, except weakness. Besides age, the determinants of incidence of the components of frailty were different between genders. Discussion: Strategies for preventing or delaying the installation of frailty need to address gender differences, considering the greater complexity in the network determinants among women.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Complex medication regimens are highly prevalent in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Strategies to reduce unnecessary complexity may be valuable because complex medication regimens can be burdensome for residents and are costly in terms of nursing time. The aim of this study is to investigate application of a structured process to simplify medication administration in RACFs.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;SImplification of Medications Prescribed to Long-tErm care Residents (SIMPLER) is a non-blinded, matched-pair, cluster randomised controlled trial of a single multidisciplinary intervention to simplify medication regimens. Trained study nurses will recruit English-speaking, permanent residents from eight South Australian RACFs. Medications taken by residents in the intervention arm will be assessed once using a structured tool (the Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE) to identify opportunities to reduce medication regimen complexity (e.g. by administering medications at the same time, or through the use of longer-acting or combination formulations). Residents in the comparison group will receive routine care. Participants will be followed for up to 36 months after study entry. The primary outcome measure will be the total number of charted medication administration times at 4 months after study entry. Secondary outcome measures will include time spent administering medications, medication incidents, resident satisfaction, quality of life, falls, hospitalisation and mortality. Individual-level analyses that account for clustering will be undertaken to determine the impact of the intervention on the study outcomes.&lt;bold&gt;Discussion: &lt;/bold&gt;Ethical approval has been obtained from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee and the aged care provider organisation. Research findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. SIMPLER will enable an improved understanding of the burden of medication use in RACFs and quantify the impact of regimen simplification on a range of outcomes important to residents and care providers.&lt;bold&gt;Trial Registration: &lt;/bold&gt;Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12617001060336 .

        <ab>The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical problems. However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and researchers.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Detecting frailty in older adults scheduled for surgery is important to predict the occurrence of adverse outcomes, but because of its complexity, frailty screening is not commonly performed. The objective of the current study was to assess whether frailty can be screened for using automatically measured usual gait speed (UGS) and mid‐arm circumference (MAC) in the outpatient clinic. Design: Prospective, cross‐sectional study. Setting: Geriatric center of a tertiary hospital. Participants: Outpatients aged 65 and older (N = 113). Measurements: Frailty status was evaluated according to a multidimensional frailty score (MFS) using a comprehensive geriatric assessment, and participants were classified into 5 categories. UGS was evaluated by having participants walk through the clinic using an automated laser‐gated chronometer. MAC was recorded using a tape measure on a blood pressure cuff. Correlations between these two physical measurements and MFS were assessed. Results: The mean age of the 93 participants who successfully underwent UGS evaluation was 75.8 ± 4.7; 35 were male. In this population, the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2.2 ± 1.4, mean MFS was 4.1 ± 2.0, and 20 participants were considered to be at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Mean UGS was 0.75 ± 0.16 m/s, and mean MAC was 31.2 ± 1.9 cm); both physical parameters were correlated with MFS (UGS: standardized beta = −0.420, &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; &lt; .001; MAC: standardized beta = −0.457, &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; &lt; .001). Using UGS and MFS, the area under curve of receiver operating curve for determining which participants were at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes was 0.809 (&lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; &lt; .001). Conclusion: UGS and MAC are viable methods of clinically screening for frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives There are limited screening tools to predict adverse postoperative outcomes for the geriatric surgical fracture population. Frailty is increasingly recognized as a risk assessment to capture complexity. The goal of this study was to use a short screening tool, the FRAIL scale, to categorize the level of frailty of older adults admitted with a fracture to determine the association of each frailty category with postoperative and 30-day outcomes. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Level 1 trauma center. Participants A total of 175 consecutive patients over age 70 years admitted to co-managed orthopedic trauma and geriatrics services. Measurements The FRAIL scale (short 5-question assessment of fatigue, resistance, aerobic capacity, illnesses, and loss of weight) classified the patients into 3 categories: robust (score = 0), prefrail (score = 1–2), and frail (score = 3–5). Postoperative outcome variables collected were postoperative complications, unplanned intensive care unit admission, length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and orthopedic follow-up after surgery. Thirty-day outcomes measured were 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality. Analysis of variance (1-way) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare continuous variables across the 3 FRAIL categories. Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Multiple regression analysis, adjusted by age, sex, and Charlson index, was conducted to study the association between frailty category and outcomes. Results FRAIL scale categorized the patients into 3 groups: robust (n = 29), prefrail (n = 73), and frail (n = 73). There were statistically significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidity, dementia, functional dependency, polypharmacy, and rate of institutionalization, being higher in the frailest patients. Hip fracture was the most frequent fracture, and it was more frequent as the frailty of the patient increased (48%, 61%, and 75% in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, respectively). The American Society of Anesthesiologists preoperative risk significantly correlated with the frailty of the patient (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3–4: 41%, 82% and 86%, in robust, prefrail, and frail groups, P &lt; .001). After adjustment by age, sex, and comorbidity, there was a statistically significant association between frailty and both LOS and the development of any complication after surgery (LOS: 4.2, 5.0, and 7.1 days, P = .002; any complication: 3.4%, 26%, and 39.7%, P = .03; in robust, prefrail, and frail groups). There were also significant differences in discharge disposition (31% of robust vs 4.1% frail, P = .008) and follow-up completion (97% of robust vs 69% of the frail ones). Differences in time to surgery, unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day readmission and mortality, although showing a trend, did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Frailty, measured by the FRAIL scale, was associated with increase LOS, complications after surgery, and discharge to rehabilitation facility in geriatric fracture patients. The FRAIL scale is a promising short screen to stratify and help operationalize the perioperative care of older surgical patients.</ab>

        <ab>In high-income countries, migrant live-in caregivers are increasingly in demand to provide health and social care in the home. While there is a wide range of research on the perspectives of live-in caregivers (including domestic workers) in destination countries, few studies address the perspective of families who hire them. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, range and nature of international literature on the needs and experiences of employers/families and care recipients of live-in caregivers. We undertook a scoping review of the literature on this topic using Arksey and O'Malley's five stages. With the assistance of a health science librarian, a comprehensive search of nine databases was undertaken from April to July 2014. Two research assistants independently reviewed 2493 articles. The data were analysed through data charting, numerical summary and thematic analysis. Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria for the scoping review. Many of these studies ( n = 7) were conducted in Israel, and the majority ( n = 8) focus on elderly care recipients. The findings reveal the diverse roles live-in caregivers perform, including emotional and physical care; changes in family dynamics and roles upon hiring a live-in caregiver; the negative experiences, including abuse, of live-in caregivers and elderly care recipients; the positive outcomes for families with a live-in caregiver; and families' common perception that live-in caregivers are like kin, a part of the family. Furthermore, evidence points to some degree of bi-directional emotional support between caregivers and employers/families, which adds complexity to their relations and the negotiation of power.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: This study introduces a novel way to accurately assess gait quality. This new method called Multifeature Gait Score (MGS) is based on the computation of multiple parameters characterizing six aspects of gait (temporal, amplitude, variability, regularity, symmetry and complexity) quantified with one inertial sensor. According to the aspects described, parameters were aggregated into partial scores to indicate the altered aspect in the case of abnormal patterns. In order to evaluate the overall gait quality, partial scores were averaged to a global score. Methods: The MGS was computed for 3 groups namely: healthy adult (10 subjects), sedentary elderly (11 subjects) and active elderly (20 subjects). Data were gathered from an inertial sensor located at the lumbar region during two sessions of 12m walking. Results: The results based on ANOVA and Tukey tests showed that the partial scores with the exception of those which describe the symmetry aspect were able to discriminate between groups (p&lt;0.05). This significant difference was also confirmed by the global score which shows a significantly lower value for the sedentary elderly group (3.58 ±1.15) compared to the healthy adults (5.19 ±0.84) and active elderly (4.82 ±1.26). In addition, the intersession repeatability of the elaborated global score was excellent (ICC = 0.93, % SEM = 10.81). Conclusion: The results obtained support the reliability and the relevance of the MGS as a novel method to characterize gait quality.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Integrated Care Management (ICM) that delivers patient-centered physical and psychosocial nursing care, produces superior health outcomes (e.g., less disability/depression/hospitalization) in older vulnerable persons who have multimorbid conditions including depression. 1-4 However, physical and psychosocial ICM is rarely found in Medicare home healthcare (HHC) settings, where the bulk of healthcare services are provided to older persons with multimorbidity. Instead, current HHC services provide care management for HHC patients short-term needs, following an acute illness, injury, or disease exacerbation,5 despite the existence of high levels of disability (40-70%), depression (40-70%) 6-10 and multiple illnesses (80%+). When multimorbidity needs are identified, the emphasis for care is placed on treatment strategies for physical health rather than ICM.9,10 This traditional service approach results in persons receiving segregated physical and mental healthcare as well as a lack of coordination between providers leading to untoward outcomes (e.g. medication errors).20-26 Yet, providing ICM to persons with multi-morbidities receiving HHC requires a uniquely different skill set for nurses.9 Thus, we developed a novel ICM education/training course, for nurses designed to provide them with skills needed to deliver ICM to their older patients to prevent disability worsening and improve psychosocial health. Design: The study used a mixed method design to develop an evidence-based hybrid online educational program. The program focused on the following 4 content areas and is informed/guided by the Chronic Care Model (CCM), ICM competencies, and expert panel (PNP, DNP, Ph.D.): (1) recognizing, treating, and providing depression care management (2) learning communication skills and developing therapeutic relationships, (3) goal setting and behavior change self-care management (4) facilitating integrated, coordinated, and interprofessional teams' management. After development/pre-testing the course with supervisory staff, the course was pilot-tested with experienced nurses. Results: Surveys results from the pre-test by the expert panel demonstrated agreement the course was acceptable to use within the Medicare HHC reimbursement system. The panel provided useful modifications for educational content, skill building, and videos. Nurse post-test scores on module tests and comprehensive exam -showed significant improvement in knowledge and skill building scores and nurses agreed that training was useful and applicable. Lessons Learned and Suggestions for Future Research: The training curriculum showed improved nurse knowledge and skills needed to address the needs of older persons with multimorbidity and health complexity. We also found that leveraging the on-going nursepatient relationship occurring during the HHC episode, addressed a missed opportunity to expand and enhance the therapeutic communication skills of HHC nurses' well within their scope of practice. We will use this course as foundational part of pilot-testing a novel, nursesupported ICM intervention, for older patients with multimorbid conditions- INSPIRE (Interactive Nursing Support to Promote Integrated care for elders REcieving HHC) designed to prevent disability worsening and improve psychosocial health. The course will be used to train intervention nurses, to ensure they have competencies to assess and provide ICM interventions that address the physical, mental and social health issues of study subjects. Thus, the ICM activities incorporated in this course have the potential to transform the way traditional HHC is practiced.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Integrated care has increasingly been promoted as an effective way to organize primary care for community-dwelling frail older people. In the context of the National Care for the Elderly Programme in the Netherlands, a number of integrated primary care interventions were evaluated. These interventions have common components such as screening, assessment, care plan and an integrated, multidisciplinary follow-up. However, the evaluations of these interventions have not shown convincing effects in terms of health outcomes, functional abilities or quality of life. A possible explanation could be that frail older people have been perceived as a homogeneous group by both care professionals involved in the interventions and researchers conducting the evaluation research. Frailty is characterized by its complexity; different components of frailty could influence and reinforce each other. Therefore, it is essential to develop profiles of frail older people. By specifying frailty, interventions could be better designed and implemented to meet specific needs of frail older people and to prevent negative outcomes. The aim of this ongoing research is twofold: 1) to distinguish subpopulations of frail older people and 2) to explore to what extent the effectiveness of integrated care interventions differs between the subpopulations of frail older people. Methods: For this research The Older Person and Informal Caregiver Survey Minimum DataSet (TOPICS-MDS) will be used, containing data of 30,000 older people [1]. First, to distinguish the subpopulations of frail older people, latent class analysis will be applied. Second, the identified subpopulations will be taken into account as a moderator variable in an Individual Patient Data meta-analysis of eight integrated primary care interventions. The eight studies used controlled designs with before and after measurements of 8000 frail older people. The outcome variables will be: health outcomes, functional abilities and quality of life. Discussion: By distinguishing subpopulations of frail older people, we will enhance the understanding of frailty and its complexity for care professionals and researchers. Our results will indicate whether integrated primary care interventions are (more) effective for certain subpopulations of frail older people. Thereby, our study may provide valuable insights into the future design, implementation and evaluation of integrated care interventions for frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Care for older persons is one of the greatest challenges in healthcare. Integrated care approaches are increasingly advocated as means to redesign primary healthcare. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a proactive, integrated care approach to improve well-being of frail community-living older people, which is called 'Finding and Follow-up of Frail older persons' (FFF). Methods: FFF approach: The aim of the FFF approach is to redesign primary care for frail older persons in order to improve their well-being. An integrated primary care system is established in which frail older people receive a continuum of (healthcare) services according to their needs and through different professionals. The FFF approach consists of multiple interrelated elements, such as proactive case finding, case management, medication review, selfmanagement support, and working in multidisciplinary teams. Evaluation study: The study had a matched quasi-experimental design and was conducted in the Netherlands between September 2014 and July 2016. The study included an intervention group (11 GP practices that implemented the FFF approach) and a control group (4 GP practices delivering care as usual). The target population consisted of frail community-dwelling older persons (= 75 years). Primary outcomes were well-being and health-related quality of life. Several secondary outcomes were measured, like quality of care. We assessed intervention costs, healthcare costs, and patient-related costs. Data were collected at baseline and 12 months after and were analyzed by intention-to-treat using univariate, multivariate, and multilevel methods. Results: Frailty was assessed among 2956 older persons registered at the 15 GP practices. In total 42.2% of these older people were identified as frail. At baseline, 464 frail older persons were included in the evaluation study (n=232 in each group). Follow-up rates were 78.4% (n=182) in the intervention group and 75.9% (n=176) in the control group at 12 months. The groups were comparable in baseline characteristics except for marital status. There were no significant differences between the intervention group and control group with respect to well-being and health-related quality of life at 12 months follow-up. There were no significant differences between the groups in total costs over 12 months. We found significant improvements in perceived quality of care in the intervention group over time. Discussion and conclusion: We found no evidence for the (cost-)effectiveness of the proactive, integrated care approach FFF. However, based on earlier research we expect improvements in quality of care to positively influence patient outcomes in the long term. Our study contributes to the emerging body of evidence that underlines the complexity of integrated care. We will therefore provide valuable insights into the processes, barriers and facilitators, and underlying theoretical mechanisms of integrated primary care that help to increase our understanding of the complexity and (lack of) effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Care home practice has been described as complex, even though it might comprise common everyday activities. Research has indicated that nursing staff consider assisting care home residents to be demanding work, much of which remains tacit or is taken for granted. The tacit knowledge that lies behind nurses' work is an important issue to explore and describe. Aims: To describe tacit care practices and understand the complexity of nursing practice in care homes. Methods: An ethnographic study was used to gain an in-depth understanding of nursing practice in care homes in a Nordic context. Findings: Nursing staff appeared to be committed to daily work routines but also reported having to deal with a number of unexpected events each day, some of which were particularly challenging. Dealing with some residents' behaviours could evoke difficult emotions among staff, such as irritation and aversion -- emotions that could be difficult to admit to. Despite this, staff seemed to believe they had to manage their responses and offer good care to all residents. Synthesising these findings led to the theme of 'tacit care home practice'. Examples of such tacit practice are described in this article. Discussion: Staff develop a common habitus of caring, including dealing with unexpected events and behaviours that are sometimes regarded as unpleasant. This habitus is often taken for granted and therefore needs to be explicated and discussed. Conclusions and implications for practice: • The statement 'we just do it' suitably describes nursing staff's habitus of caring, which includes dealing with unexpected events and unpleasant behaviours • Describing these tacit aspects of care can extend our understanding of some previously unarticulated aspects of care home practice • These findings suggest a need for greater awareness, better communication and reflection in relation to these tacit elements of practice. This could contribute to improved nursing practice in care homes</ab>

        <ab>Decision making with older people can be difficult because of medical complexity, uncertainty (about prognosis, treatment effectiveness and priorities), difficulties brought by cognitive and communication impairment and the multiple family and other stakeholders who may need to be involved. The usual approach, based on balancing benefits and burdens of a treatment, and then deciding on the basis of autonomy (or best interests for someone lacking mental capacity), within the constraints of resources and equity, remains valid, but is often inadequate. In addition, approaches relying on optimal communication and relationship building and professional virtues are important. Older people vary in their medical status, views and preferences more than younger people and these variations must be sought and accommodated, using a shared decision-making approach. This includes adapting to the increasing numbers of people from different cultures.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To examine how medical complexity modifies the relationship between enrollment in Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) home-based primary care ( HBPC) and hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions ( ACSC) for veterans with diabetes mellitus and whether the effect of HBPC on hospitalizations varies according to clinical condition. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting VA and non- VA hospitals. Participants VA beneficiaries aged 67 and older with diabetes mellitus and enrolled in Medicare (N = 364,972). Measurements Instrumental variables regression models were used to estimate the effect of HBPC enrollment on hospitalization for ACSCs (defined according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators) overall and in subgroups stratified according to medical complexity. Models were also estimated for each ACSC to determine which conditions were most sensitive to HBPC. Distance from the veteran's residence to the nearest HBPC site was used as the instrumental variable. Results HBPC was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations (odds ratio ( OR) = 0.35 per person-month, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.30-0.42). For veterans in the highest quartile of medical complexity, HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.93), whereas for those in the lowest quartile, HBPC was associated with more ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 33.2, 95% CI = 4.6-240.1). HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs. Conclusion HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs in veterans with diabetes mellitus but only in the most medically complex individuals. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate targeting and suggests that the effect of HBPC is attributable to its comprehensive approach rather than condition-specific interventions.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Healthcare organisations are facing large demands in recruiting employees with adequate competency to care for the increasing numbers of elderly. High degrees of turnover and dissatisfaction with working conditions are common. The gendered notion of care work as 'women's work', in combination with low salaries and status, may contribute to negative work experiences. There is abundant information about the negative aspects of elderly care health services, but little is known about positive aspects of this work. The study aim was to investigate work satisfaction from a gender perspective among Swedish registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, focusing specifically on healthcare services for the elderly.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;A mixed methods approach was adopted in which we combined statistics and open-ended responses from a national survey with qualitative research interviews with healthcare professionals in elderly care organisations. The survey was administered to a random sample of 1578 registered nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. Qualitative interviews with 17 professionals were conducted in six elderly care facilities. Qualitative and quantitative content analyses, chi2 and constructivist grounded theory were used to analyse the data.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;There was a statistically significant difference in overall work satisfaction between those who worked in elderly care and those who did not (64 and 74,4% respectively, p &lt;0.001). Nine themes were derived from open-ended responses in the questionnaire. The qualitative interviews revealed four prominent storylines: 'Team social cohesion', 'Career development and autonomy', 'Client-centeredness', and 'Invisible and ignored power structures'.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;The results show the complexity of elderly care work and describe several aspects that are important for work satisfaction among health professionals. The results reveal that work satisfaction is dependent on social interrelations and cohesion in the work team, in possibilities to use humour and to have fun together, and in the ability to work as professionals to provide client-centered elderly care. Power relations such as gendered hierarchies were less visible or even ignored aspects of work satisfaction. The storylines are clearly linked to the two central discourses of professionalism and gender equality.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The complexity of medication therapy in older adults with multiple comorbidities often leads to inappropriate prescribing. Drugs with anticholinergic properties are of particular interest because many are not recognized for this property; their use may lead to increased anticholinergic burden resulting in significant health risks, as well as negatively impacting cognition. Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions showed promise in addressing inappropriate medication use, but the effectiveness of targeted multidisciplinary team interventions addressing anticholinergic medications in older populations is yet to be determined. Methods: We conducted an 8-week, parallel-arm, randomized trial to evaluate whether a targeted patient-centered pharmacist-physician team MTM intervention ("targeted MTM intervention") reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients enrolled in a longitudinal cohort at University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Study outcomes included changes in the medication appropriateness index (MAI) targeting anticholinergic medications and in the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score from baseline to the end of study. Results: Between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 we enrolled and randomized 50 participants taking at least one medication with anticholinergic properties. Of these, 35 (70%) were women, 45 (90%) were white, and 33 (66%) were cognitively intact (clinical dementia rating [CDR] = 0); mean age was 77.7 ± 6.6 years. At baseline, the mean MAI was 12.6 ± 6.3; 25 (50%) of the participants used two or more anticholinergics, and the mean ADS score was 2.8 ± 1.6. After randomization, although no statistically significant difference was noted between groups, we identified a potentially meaningful imbalance as the intervention group had more participants with intact cognition, and thus included CDR in all of the analyses. The targeted MTM intervention resulted in statistically significant CDR adjusted differences between groups with regard to improved MAI (change score of 3.6 (1.1) for the MTM group as compared with 1.0 (0.9) for the control group, p = 0.04) and ADS (change score of 1.0 (0.3) for the MTM group as compared with 0.2 (0.3) for the control group, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Our targeted MTM intervention resulted in improvement in anticholinergic medication appropriateness and reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients. Our results show promise in an area of great importance to ensure optimum outcomes for medications used in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Adaptive postural control can be impaired in the presence of frailty syndrome, given that this condition causes homeostatic dysregulation in physiological systems. Objectives: To compare the center of pressure (CoP) displacements of non-frail, pre-frail, and frail elderly subjects in the standing position before and after postural transition of sitting and rising from a chair, using linear and nonlinear methods. Methods: Forty-two elderly subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-frail (n=15), pre-frail (n=15), and frail (n=12). The CoP displacements in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) direction in the orthostatic position, 30s before and after sitting down and rising from a chair, were evaluated by means of linear measurements (root mean square (RMS), amplitude, and total average speed) and nonlinear measurements (corrected approximate entropy - CApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and complexity index (CI) and its normalized versions. Results: After sitting and rising, there was an increase in RMS in the ML direction in all groups and in the AP direction in the non-frail and frail groups. The frail group showed no reduction in entropy values in either direction, and the pre-frail group showed no reduction in the ML direction. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that, in the presence of frailty syndrome, the organization of CoP displacements does not show less regularity after sitting and rising from a chair, reflecting a possible impairment of the integration of the systems involved in postural control.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;All community-living older adults might benefit from integrated care, but evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of such services for perceived quality of care.&lt;bold&gt;Objective: &lt;/bold&gt;To examine the impact of Embrace, a community-based integrated primary care service, on perceived quality of care.&lt;bold&gt;Design: &lt;/bold&gt;Stratified randomized controlled trial.&lt;bold&gt;Participants: &lt;/bold&gt;Integrated care and support according to the "Embrace" model was provided by 15 general practitioners in the Netherlands. Based on self-reported levels of case complexity and frailty, a total of 1456 community-living older adults were stratified into non-disease-specific risk profiles ("Robust," "Frail," and "Complex care needs"), and randomized to Embrace or control groups.&lt;bold&gt;Intervention: &lt;/bold&gt;Embrace provides integrated, person-centered primary care and support to all older adults living in the community, with intensity of care dependent on risk profile.&lt;bold&gt;Measurements: &lt;/bold&gt;Primary outcome was quality of care as reported by older adults on the Patient Assessment of Integrated Elderly Care (PAIEC). Effects were assessed using mixed model techniques for the total sample and per risk profile. Professionals' perceived level of implementation of integrated care was evaluated within the Embrace condition using the Assessment of Integrated Elderly Care.&lt;bold&gt;Key Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Older adults in the Embrace group reported a higher level of perceived quality of care than those in the control group (B = 0.33, 95 % CI = 0.15-0.51, ES d = 0.19). The advantages of Embrace were most evident in the "Frail" and "Complex care needs" risk profiles. We found no significant advantages for the "Robust" risk profile. Participating professionals reported a significant increase in the perceived level of implementation of integrated care (ES r = 0.71).&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;This study shows that providing a population-based integrated care service to community-living older adults improved the quality of care as perceived by older adults and participating professionals.</ab>

        <ab>Advances in understanding the biological bases of aging have intellectually revitalized the field of geriatric psychiatry and broadened its scope to include promoting successful aging and studying resilience factors in older adults. To describe the process by which this paradigm shift has occurred and illustrate its implications for treatment and research of late-life brain disorders, late-life depression is discussed as a prototype case. Prior phases of geriatric psychiatry research were focused on achieving depressive symptom relief, outlining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between older and younger adults, and identifying moderators of treatment response. Building on this work, current geriatric psychiatry researchers have begun to disentangle the etiologic complexity in late-life depression by focusing on the causative aging-related processes involved, identifying both neurobiological and behavioral intermediates, and finally delineating depression subtypes that are distinguishable by their underlying biology and the treatment approach required. In this review, we discuss several age-related processes that are critical to the development of late-life mood disorders, outline implications of these processes for the clinical evaluation and management of later-life psychiatric disorders, and finally put forth suggestions for better integrating aging and developmental processes into the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria.</ab>

        <ab>Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one major health concern for our growing elderly population. It accounts for increasing impairment of cognitive capacity followed by loss of executive function in late stage. AD pathogenesis is multifaceted and difficult to pinpoint, and understanding AD etiology will be critical to effectively diagnose and treat the disease. An interesting hypothesis concerning AD development postulates a cause-effect relationship between accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and neurodegenerative changes associated with this pathology. Here we propose a computerized method for an easy and fast mtDNA mutations-based characterization of AD. The method has been built taking into account the complexity of living being and fractal properties of many anatomic and physiologic structures, including mtDNA. Dealing with mtDNA mutations as gaps in the nucleotide sequence, fractal lacunarity appears a suitable tool to differentiate between aging and AD. Therefore, Chaos Game Representation method has been used to display DNA fractal properties after adapting the algorithm to visualize also heteroplasmic mutations. Parameter β from our fractal lacunarity method, based on hyperbola model function, has been measured to quantitatively characterize AD on the basis of mtDNA mutations. Results from this pilot study to develop the method show that fractal lacunarity parameter β of mtDNA is statistically different in AD patients when compared to age-matched controls. Fractal lacunarity analysis represents a useful tool to analyze mtDNA mutations. Lacunarity parameter β is able to characterize individual mutation profile of mitochondrial genome and appears a promising index to discriminate between AD and aging.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The elderly, who suffer from multiple chronic diseases, represent a substantial proportion of Emergency Department (ED) frequent users, thus contributing to ED overcrowding, although they could benefit from other health care facilities, if those were available. The aim of this study was to evaluate and characterize hospital visits of older patients (age 65 or greater) to the ED of a university teaching hospital in Rome from the 1st of January to the 31st of December 2014, in order to identify clinical and social characteristics potentially associated with “elderly frequent users”. Material and Methods: A retrospective study was performed during the calendar year 2014 (1st January 2014 – 31st December 2014) analyzing all ED admissions to the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata. Variables collected included age, triage code, arrival data, discharge diagnosis, and visit outcome. We performed a risk analysis using univariate binary logistic regression models. Results: A total number of 38,016 patients accessed the ED, generating 46,820 accesses during the study period, with an average of 1.23 accesses for patient. The elderly population represented a quarter of the total ED population and had an increased risk of frequent use (OR 1.5: CI 1.4–1.7) and hospitalization (OR 3.8: CI 3.7–4). Moreover, they showed a greater diagnostic complexity, as demonstrated by the higher incidence of yellow and red priority codes compared to other ED populations (OR 3.1: CI 2.9–3.2). Discussion: Older patients presented clinical and social characteristics related to the definition of “elderly frail frequent users”. The fact that a larger number of hospitalizations occurred in such patients is indirect evidence of frailty in this specific population, suggesting that hospital admissions may be an inappropriate response to frailty, especially when continued care is not established. Conclusion: Enhancement of continuity of care, establishment of a tracking system for those who are at greater risk of visiting the ED and evaluating fragile individuals should be the highest priority in addressing ED frequent usage by the elderly.</ab>

        <ab>Context: In most developed countries, there is an increase of frail elderly people who are frequent users of health and social resources, often in an unplanned way. Recently, because of sustainability, there has been a significant reduction in acute hospital beds. These two phenomena have led to a saturation of the emergency services and increased the need for a new organizational model. This problem needs to be approached in a systemic way, by viewing it as a problem of the health system as a whole, not just as issue for emergency departments. To address the growing demands on the health system, the government has devised a system of pathways through the health service for the most frequently occurring medical needs of the population, for example, diabetes and, in relation to this paper, a complexity pathway. This involves the identification of patients and the development of treatment plans, and at the same time the reorganization of services to provide care in the most coordinated way possible. This paper aims to describe how an emergency service has been reorganized in the context of a complexity pathway through the health system and what impact it has had on the rate of hospitalizations and alternatives to hospitalization. Organizational changes: - Proactively detect patients who may be candidates for alternatives to hospital from the emergency department: patients already marked as complex from the community (use of territorial information systems), patients from nursing homes, patients who consult for a geriatric syndrome and patients aged over 85. - Involve all emergency service professionals through training in how to approach this demographic group. - The hospital management believes it is a strategic project. - Introduction of a short geriatric assessment in casualty departments. - Having a nurse practitioner who participates in the evaluation and management of cases and in coordinating all related intermediate care. - Having access to consultations with geriatric professionals from the acute geriatric unit or intermediate care units. Results in patients. - Up to October 2015, 437 patients were referred from emergency to intermediate care resources. 302 in the programme of sub-acute care and 135 in the hospital at home programme. - These patients are on average 81 years old, have a Barthel baseline of 61 and a high prevalence of geriatric syndromes. - The patients referred to sub-acute care had lower Barthel baseline and were classified as MACA (advanced chronic disease). Dementia diagnosis was more common. - This project has reduced the admissions in acute care of persons over 85 by 15% during the last two years. Conclusions: - Many patients were referred to hospitalization alternatives after applying this methodology. - The alternatives to hospitalization from casualty are allocated to people over 80 with a high level of frailty (geriatric syndromes, disability, advanced disease situation). - Patients have different characteristics according to which alternative they are referred to. - Hospital admissions of people &gt; 85 to the acute hospital unit were reduced. - The participation of the nurse practitioner is the key to achieve good coordination with intermediate care.</ab>

        <ab>Summary: This study aims to analyse and define the role of the case manager (CM) in Spain. The qualitative technique of semi-structured interviews together with the literature review technique have been chosen for the information gathering process. This study constitutes the first of the several stages of a broader research project whose ultimate goals are to create a Network of Integrated Care professionals (NIC) and to reach some conclusions about the CM role in Spain. The rise of chronic diseases, partly caused by demographic changes and increased longevity, requires the development of new strategies on health and social care policies. High levels of dependency associated to chronic patients imply that health care and social problems need to be addressed through coordinated actions of these two public services. The implementation of the CM seek to respond to this need. CM for chronic patients usually undertake coordination tasks within different levels of the health care system and between the health care and social systems. This coordination substantially enhances the continuity of care. Case management enables the integration of the social and health care systems and, therefore, the integrated and needs-centered health care service that patients require. The definition of the role played by the CMs is highly ambiguous; pluripathologies management, single collective (fragile elderly) and single disease management, to name only a few, are amongst them. Nevertheless, there have been also identified some of the CM most basic elements including; patients identification, problems and need assessments, care plan setting, etc. Methodology: Through the usage of an explorative methodology, the numerous roles played by the CM in Spain will be identified and classified. More concretely we will be looking at the main similarities and differences, and analysing impact results. Ultimately patterns and potential scenarios will be considered. This methodology is composed by various stages; 1-Semi-structured interviews and literature review techniques will be used to gather information from professional interviewees (professional profiles, services offered, population target, etc). In addition, a theoretical framework will support the information provided by these professionals. The objective of this first stage is to obtain an initial document which describes and simplifies the complexity that characterises the practices related to the CM. 2-Focus group; the next step will involve naming a group of professionals from the social and health care sectors to discuss the different ideas appearing in the initial document. The purpose of this stage is to reach some conclusions on the CM different realities. The resulting document will ultimately serve as a basis from which the NIC will be created. Bearing in mind that the ultimate goal of this study will only be reached in the mid -term, the main purpose of this initial paper is to elaborate a document which will serve as the basis for following stages of the research project. Preliminary results: The CM is characterised by a significant lack of homogeneity in its implementation, both within and between Spanish regions. - Despite the CM presence in most Spanish regions, its characteristics and functions vary considerably. The main differences are found in the professional profile, services offered, and duties carried by the CM, and its relationship with inner and outer professionals. These variances occur within and between regions. - The different CM functions will be categorised using the five-stages model (case finding, assessment, care planning, care coordination and case closure) based on Ross.S et al (2011). CM functions have been intuitively obtained by applying an explorative methodology in a number of CM experiences. - In Spain it is possible to observe different levels of policy development regarding the CM role (design, pilot, implementation process...). For instance, in Catalonia, Castile y Leon and the Basque Country, the role of the CM has been considerably successful whereas in Navarra no implemented practice, related to this specific actor, was found. Similarly, whilst a number of experiences where the CM has been especially dedicated to coordinate a specific treatment process, others have been implemented, in a broader sense. - Furthermore, the consequences resulting from these practices widely differ depending on the context and, a part of in the case of Andalucía, there are no major publications on the consequences of these practices. As an example, in Andalusia the CM has supposed a sort of driving force for change towards a broader model of integrated care where new roles and new ways of care management have arisen.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Fife is the third largest local government region in Scotland with a growing population of 366,957, of which 18% are over the age of 65, and with a mix of urban communities and sparsely populated rural communities. Social care services are delivered by Fife Council and healthcare services by National Health Service Fife in a partnership working arrangement but with separate workforces, management structures and funding. Unplanned admissions to hospitals and care homes account for nearly 30% of the resources that Fife spends on health and social care for older people. To address these demographic and associated funding pressures, a programme to redesign and integrate community health and social care services was implemented. Description: The Scottish Government introduced a Reshaping Care for Older People programme to create a vision and offer some funding for service change. The programme aims to increase care in community settings resulting in reductions in demand for hospital inpatient and care home facilities. This should allow disinvestment to enable successful community services and projects to be sustained. The Government programme does not prescribe how community services should be redesigned, devolving responsibility and empowering organisations to do that with their local knowledge. In Fife, community service redesign is informed by Stakeholder Events where health and social care professionals are joined by third and independent sector, patient and carer representatives to map existing pathways and identify ways of integrating teams, reducing handovers and avoidable hospital and care home admissions. The aim is to empower teams to encourage patients and their carers to take control of their own health and wellbeing personal outcomes. The redesign has created an Integrated Community Assessment and Support Service (ICASS) combining professionals and blurring roles (nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and care assistants) into multidisciplinary teams with shared care plans, resources and support systems. A number of related projects focus on prevention of admission (Hospital-at-home, day hospital rapid assessment, falls response, re-ablement, third sector capacity building, Local Area services Co-ordinators). Other projects focus on discharge planning and support (hospital discharge planning hubs, Short Term Assessment and Rehabilitation beds, special needs housing, discharge-to-assess, third sector supported discharge). Service managers facilitated integration and scaling up of services, developed a culture of integrated multi-disciplinary working in teams of co-located health and social care workers, created a generic support worker role, introduced performance management measures and consistent delivery processes across Fife. Evaluation is focussed on achieving personal outcomes, including conversations training for staff, and an IT patient management system that records outcomes goals. National tools such as Indicators of Relative Need (IoRNs) are used, and a university research project, PEPPERs, is measuring the effectiveness of proactive community interventions compared with unplanned hospital admissions in a randomised trial. Key findings: Successful integration of multidisciplinary ICASS teams and collocation of professionals has improved communication and empathy resulting in better co-ordinated patient care and more effort on prevention of admission to hospital. Assessing homecare needs at home or in STAR beds is reducing the costs of packages of care or care home admission. However this success is countered by accelerating growth in demand for services and increasing complexity of people living longer with multiple long term conditions. Highlights: Redesign of community services was already underway in 2011 when the Reshaping Care for Older People programme was launched and the process of evolution is continuing. The huge complexity of health and social care service integration needs a structured project management methodology to plan and implement change. Resistance to change in the workforce, and differences in practices between localities is being overcome with ongoing engagement, using reference groups, training needs analysis and upskilling, shadowing and mentoring. Clear communication of vision and change plans, and full engagement of the workforce in the change process is the key to success. Implementing change will take longer and cost more than you expect. Conclusion: Fife is continuously evolving and improving integrated community health and social care services that are focussed on proactively helping older people live safely and independently in their own homes for as long as possible. A new operational management structure for intermediate care that is scalable and transferrable across Fife communities, ensures a consistent service experience for patients across Fife. Community teams' activities are shifting from responding to crisis to proactively managing frailty and long term conditions. To create a more enabling environment for integrated care, in April 2016 NHS Fife and Fife Council will launch a new Integration Authority with strategic priorities for prevention and early intervention, integrated and co-ordinated care, tackling health inequalities and improving mental health services. The journey continues?.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. Background Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. Design Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial ( AGe- FIT). Methods Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. Results Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. Conclusions Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the development of a conceptual framework for explaining the etiology of violence in later life by various groups involved in the field of elder abuse. In this study, we explore this through eight focus groups with different professionals involved in the field of elder abuse and older persons themselves and in interviews with 35 experts in the field. Our findings show that dependency, vulnerability, power and control, social isolation, stress, and care burden play a central role in their explanations for the occurrence of violence in later life. The role of a history of violence in violence in later life is equivocal. The complexity and ambiguity of dependency and vulnerability, the notion of mutual dependency, and diverse attitudes and expectations toward them that arise with the aging process are distinct features of violence in later life that were found.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Integrated neighborhood approaches (INAs) are increasingly advocated to reinforce formal and informal community networks and support community-dwelling older people. They aim to augment older people's self-management abilities and engage informal networks before seeking professional support. INAs' effectiveness however remains unknown. We evaluated an INA's effects on older people's (health-related) quality of life (HRQoL) and well-being in Rotterdam. Methods: We used a matched quasi-experimental design comparing INA with "usual" care and support. Community-dwelling frail older (70+ years) people and frailty- and gender-matched control subjects (n = 186 each) were followed over a 1-year period (measurements at baseline and 6 and 12 months). Primary outcomes were HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L, SF-20) and well-being [social production function instrument for the level of well-being (SPF-IL)]. The effect of INA was analysed using an "intention to treat" and an "as treated" approach. Results: The results indicated that pre-intervention participants had lower incomes and were significantly older, more often single, less educated and more likely to have ≥1 disease than control subjects; they had lower well-being, physical functioning, role functioning, and mental health. Generalized linear mixed modelling of repeated measurements revealed no substantial difference in well-being or HRQoL between the intervention and control group after 1 year. The small differences we did find in the intention to treat group though were in favour of the control subjects (SF-20 = 6.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.45-11.52; SPF-IL = .09, 95% CI = .01-.17). However, the difference in well-being (SPF-IL) disappeared in the as treated analysis. Conclusions: The lack of effects of INA highlights the complexity of integrated care and support initiatives. Barriers associated with meeting the complex, varied needs of frail older people, and those related to dynamic political and social climates challenge initiative effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Age-related gait changes may be due to the loss of complexity in the neuromuscular system. This theory is disputed due to inconsistent results from single-scale analyses. Also, behavioral adaptations may confound these changes. We examined whether EMG dynamics during gait is less complex in older adults over a range of timescales using the multiscale entropy method, and whether slower walking attenuates this effect. Surface EMG was measured from the left vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), gastrocnemius (GA), and tibialis anterior (TA) in 17 young and 18 older adults as they walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 0.8x-1.2x of preferred speed. Sample entropy (SE) and the complexity index (CI) of the EMG signals were calculated after successive coarse-graining to extract dynamics at timescales of 27 to 270 Hz, with m = 2 and r = 0.15 SD. SE and CI were lower across the timescales in older adults in VL and BF, but higher in GA (all p&lt;0.001); these results held for VL and GA even after accounting for longer EMG burst durations in older adults. CI was higher during slower walking speed in VL and BF (p&lt;0.001). Results were mostly similar for m = 3 and r = 0.01–0.35. Smaller r was more sensitive to age-related differences. The decrease in complexity with aging in the timescales studied was limited to proximal muscles, particularly VL. The increase in GA may be driven by other factors. Walking slower may reflect a behavioral adaptation that allows the nervous system to function with greater complexity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The rising life expectancy in the developed world leads to an increase in the number of older patients and the complexity of their complaints in general practice. Although interventions and support for general practitioners are available, implementation lags. Knowledge on what determines a complex older patient, the problems of which general practitioners encounter and the situations they actually need support for, is necessary for better implementation. Methods: To provide support to general practitioners in their struggle with complex older patients, the aim of this research was to disentangle the concept of the complex older patient in general practice. A qualitative approach was used consisting of 15 semi-structured interviews with general practitioners. The general practitioner was asked to prepare a case of a complex older patient out of their own practice that could be discussed during the interview. Transcripts of the interview were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Analysis of the interviews resulted in twelve themes that could be categorised into five factors that contribute to the complexity of cases of older patients. The five factors are: not being in charge, different views on necessary care, encountering the boundaries of medicine, limits to providing social care, ill-equipped. Conclusion: The factors that were found imply that a better organisational structure for elderly care and consulting elderly care physicians could support general practitioners in providing care for older complex patients. Furthermore, understanding the current concept of patient autonomy seems unjustified in cases of complex older patients.</ab>

        <ab>In the coming decades, a massive shift in the aging segment of the population will have major social and economic consequences around the world. One way to offset this increase is to expedite the development of geroprotectors, substances that slow aging, repair age-associated damage and extend healthy lifespan, or healthspan. While over 200 geroprotectors are now reported in model organisms and some are in human use for specific disease indications, the path toward determining whether they affect aging in humans remains obscure. Translation to the clinic is hampered by multiple issues including absence of a common set of criteria to define, select, and classify these substances, given the complexity of the aging process and their enormous diversity in mechanism of action. Translational research efforts would benefit from the formation of a scientific consensus on the following: the definition of 'geroprotector', the selection criteria for geroprotectors, a comprehensive classification system, and an analytical model. Here, we review current approaches to selection and put forth our own suggested selection criteria. Standardizing selection of geroprotectors will streamline discovery and analysis of new candidates, saving time and cost involved in translation to clinic.</ab>

        <ab>The sustainability of healthcare systems worldwide is threatened by the absolute and relative increase in the number of older persons. The traditional models of care (largely based on a disease-centered approach) are inadequate for a clinical world dominated by older individuals with multiple (chronic) comorbidities and mutually interacting syndromes. There is the need to shift the center of the medical intervention from the disease to the biological age of the individual. Thus, multiple medical specialties have started looking with some interest at concepts of geriatric medicine in order to better face the increased complexity (due to age-related conditions) of their average patient. In this scenario, special interest has been given to frailty, a condition characterized by the reduction of the individual's homeostatic reserves and increased vulnerability to stressors. Frailty may indeed represent the fulcrum to lever for reshaping the healthcare systems in order to make them more responsive to new clinical needs. However, the dissemination of the frailty concept across medical specialties requires a parallel and careful consideration around the currently undervalued role of geriatricians in our daily practice.</ab>

        <ab>This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Purpose: &lt;/bold&gt;To classify and identify the main characteristics of the tools used in practice to assess the impact of elderly caregiving on the informal carers' life.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;A systematic review of literature was performed searching in Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, IBECS, LILACS, SiiS, SSCI and Cochrane Library from 2009 to 2013 in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, and in reference lists of included papers.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;The review included 79 studies, among them several in languages other than English. Their inclusion increased the variety of identified tools to measure this impact (n = 93) and allowed a wider analysis of their geographical use. While confirming their overlapping nature, instruments were classified according to the degree of integration of dimensions they evaluated and their specificity to the caregiving process: caregiver burden (n = 20), quality of life and well-being (n = 11), management and coping (n = 21), emotional and mental health (n = 29), psychosocial impact (n = 10), physical health and healthy habits (n = 2), and other measures. A high use in practice of tools not validated yet and not caregiver-specific was identified.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;The great variety and characteristics of instruments identified in this review confirm the complexity and multidimensionality of the effects of elderly caregiving on the informal carer's life and explain the difficulties to assess these effects in practice. According to the classification provided, caregiver burden and emotional and mental health are the most evaluated dimensions. However, further work is required to develop integrated and caregiving focused procedures that can appraise this complexity across different countries and cultures.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To evaluate the linear variability of comfortable gait according to socioeconomic status in community-dwelling elderly. Method: For this cross-sectional observational study 63 self-functioning elderly were categorized according to the socioeconomic level on medium-low (n= 33, age 69.0 ± 5.0 years) and medium-high (n= 30, age 71.0 ± 6.0 years). Each participant was asked to perform comfortable gait speed for 3 min on an 40 meters elliptical circuit, recording in video five strides which were transformed into frames, determining the minimum foot clearance, maximum foot clearance and stride length. The intra-group linear variability was calculated by the coefficient of variation in percent. Results: The trajectory parameters variability is not different according to socioeconomic status with a 30% (range= 15-55%) for the minimum foot clearance and 6% (range= 3-8%) in maximum foot clearance. Meanwhile, the stride length consistently was more variable in the medium-low socioeconomic status for the overall sample (p= 0.004), female (p= 0.041) and male gender (p= 0.007), with values near 4% (range = 2.5-5.0%) in the medium-low and 2% (range = 1.5-3.5%) in the medium-high. Conclusions: The intra-group linear variability is consistently higher and within reference parameters for stride length during comfortable gait for elderly belonging to medium-low socioeconomic status. This might be indicative of greater complexity and consequent motor adaptability.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that leads to impairment in interrelated physiological systems and progressive homeostatic dysregulation in physiological systems.&lt;bold&gt;Objective: &lt;/bold&gt;The focus of the present systematic review was to study the association between the activity of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) and frailty.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov; the last search was performed in March 2015. Inclusion criteria were: (1) that the studied population was classified for frailty according to a standard definition, such as Fried's criteria; (2) that the study had a nonfrail control group, and (3) that heart rate (HR) and/or heart rate variability (HRV) were parameters of interest in the study.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Of the 1,544 articles screened, 54 were selected for full-text review and 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. Assessment of HRV using different standard time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear domain approaches confirmed the presence of an impaired cardiac ANS function in frail compared to nonfrail participants. Furthermore, HR changes while performing a clinical test (e.g., the seated step test or the lying-to-standing orthostatic test) were decreased in the frail group compared to the nonfrail group.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;The current systematic review provides evidence that the cardiac ANS is impaired in frail compared to nonfrail older adults, as indicated by a reduction in the complexity of HR dynamics, reduced HRV, and reduced HR changes in response to daily activities. Four out of 6 included articles recruited only female participants, and in the other 2 articles the effect of gender on impairment of cardiac ANS was insufficiently investigated. Therefore, further studies are required to study the association between cardiac ANS impairments and frailty in males. Furthermore, HRV was studied only during static postures such as sitting, or without considering the level of activity as a potential confounder. Accordingly, simultaneous measurement of both physiological (i.e., HRV) and kinematic (e.g., using wearable sensor technology) information may provide a better understanding of cardiac ANS impairments with frailty while controlling for activity.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Objectives: &lt;/bold&gt;Measures of frailty (Groningen Frailty Indicator, GFI) and case complexity (INTERMED for the Elderly, IM-E-SA) may assist healthcare professionals to allocate healthcare resources. Both instruments have been evaluated with good psychometric properties. Limited evidence has been published about their predictive validity. Thus, our aim is to evaluate the predictive validity of both instruments on healthcare costs.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;Multivariate linear regression models were developed to estimate associations between the predictors frailty (GFI) and/or case complexity (IM-E-SA) and the healthcare costs (in € log transformed) in the following year. All models were adjusted for demographics and the presence of morbidity.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;In the multivariate regression analyses the continuous scores of the GFI and IM-E-SA remained significant predictors for total healthcare costs. Adjusted βs for GFI and IM-E-SA were respectively 0.14 (95% CI 0.10-0.18) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.07). The corresponding explained variance (R(2)) for both models was 0.40. Frailty remained a significant predictor of long-term care costs (adjusted β 0.13 [95% CI 0.09-0.16]), while case complexity was a significant predictor of curative care costs (adjusted β 0.03 [95% CI 0.02-0.05]).&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;The GFI and IM-E-SA both accurately predict total healthcare costs in the following year.</ab>

        <ab>The population of older adults is expanding rapidly, and aging predisposes to cardiovascular disease. The principle of patient-centered care must respond to the preponderance of cardiac disease that now occurs in combination with the complexities of old age. Geriatric cardiology melds cardiovascular perspectives with multimorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty, cognitive decline, and other clinical, social, financial, and psychological dimensions of aging. Although some assume that a cardiologist may instinctively cultivate some of these skills over the course of a career, we assert that the volume and complexity of older cardiovascular patients in contemporary practice warrants a more direct approach to achieve suitable training and a more reliable process of care. We present a rationale and vision for geriatric cardiology as a melding of primary cardiovascular and geriatrics skills, thereby infusing cardiology practice with expanded proficiencies in diagnosis, risks, care coordination, communications, end-of-life, and other competences required to best manage older cardiovascular patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Exergames are becoming an increasingly popular tool for training balance ability, thereby preventing falls in older adults. Automatic, real time, assessment of the user’s balance control offers opportunities in terms of providing targeted feedback and dynamically adjusting the gameplay to the individual user, yet algorithms for quantification of balance control remain to be developed. The aim of the present study was to identify movement patterns, and variability therein, of young and older adults playing a custom-made weight-shifting (ice-skating) exergame. Methods: Twenty older adults and twenty young adults played a weight-shifting exergame under five conditions of varying complexity, while multi-segmental whole-body movement data were captured using Kinect. Movement coordination patterns expressed during gameplay were identified using Self Organizing Maps (SOM), an artificial neural network, and variability in these patterns was quantified by computing Total Trajectory Variability (TTvar). Additionally a k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier was trained to discriminate between young and older adults based on the SOM features. Results: Results showed that TTvar was significantly higher in older adults than in young adults, when playing the exergame under complex task conditions. The kNN classifier showed a classification accuracy of 65.8%. Conclusions: Older adults display more variable sway behavior than young adults, when playing the exergame under complex task conditions. The SOM features characterizing movement patterns expressed during exergaming allow for discriminating between young and older adults with limited accuracy. Our findings contribute to the development of algorithms for quantification of balance ability during home-based exergaming for balance training.</ab>

        <ab>The academic geriatrics community has provided outstanding leadership in addressing frailty and complexity in older adults, but a minority of older adults are frail. Although resources to treat older adults are limited, and it is appropriate to focus clinical efforts on those with frailty and multimorbidity, there is also important expertise that can be brought to bear on the health of ALL older adults. A review of the literature suggests that attention to healthy or successful aging has failed to keep pace with the focus on frailty. By providing leadership to promote successful aging, the quality of life of older adults across the spectrum can be improved and transitions to frailty reduced. The template that leaders have established in understanding frailty-defining and operationalizing it, understanding outcomes, identifying pathophysiology-can be used as an approach to successful aging. Several community-based programs have been successful in promoting successful aging. These are potentially highly scalable and could have a substantial effect on the aging population, but their essential components need to be better understood. The geriatrics community is uniquely positioned to take on this role. This is a critical time to work together to make the lives of all older adults as healthy and fulfilling as possible.</ab>

        <ab>In this article we discuss the opportunities and challenges of using the Internet as part of an emergent methodology in qualitative research. Utilising a deliberative process of democratic enquiry, an online forum was used to identify important capabilities for the health of informal caregivers for older people in New Zealand. Recognising the difficulties associated with recruiting and interviewing informal caregivers, the study was advertised and conducted via the Internet. Over four months, 60 informal caregivers, from varied backgrounds, contributed to an online forum created specifically for the research. The asynchronous, anonymous format facilitated participants’ personal accounts of caregiving, which highlighted the tensions and complexity of caregivers’ lives. This resulted in a key finding that emotions, particularly attachment, play a significant role in the day-to-day experience of informal eldercare provision. Overall, we found that Internet-mediated research offers an innovative option for qualitative data collection, which has potential for including hard-to-reach populations and enabling insightful, contextual data collection.</ab>

        <ab>Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) is a hematologic malignancy that primarily affects the elderly. Approximately two-thirds of patients are aged 65 years or older at diagnosis. Major advances in testing, treatment, and supportive care have resulted in substantial improvement in overall survival in younger, standard-risk, PCM patients over the past 3 decades. However, this positive impact progressively diminishes with advancing age, with some studies showing no improvement in survival outcomes in the elderly. Slow improvement in survival for elderly PCM patients is likely multifactorial, influenced by factors such as age-related physiologic changes, increased comorbidities, decreased treatment tolerance, socioeconomic barriers, and possible differences in disease biology. The standard approach of basing treatment decisions on age and performance status does not account for this complexity, and can be insufficient to determine the risks and benefits of treatment. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) produces a more thorough iteration of the factors influencing an individual's treatment risk, and can potentially identify targets for intervention to lower risk. Ongoing studies are looking at developing and refining the tools available for risk screening and assessment. Treating elderly PCM patients with novel agent-based regimens with or without autologous stem cell transplantation has improved response rates and survival in some studies, but elderly PCM patients have benefitted less than their younger counterparts from recent advances in PCM treatment. Personalizing treatment decisions, based on predictions of risk, determined by geriatric assessment, and response, determined by precision medicine (our understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular pathways that drive an individual's cancer) will help maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of PCM treatment for each patient. Continued evaluation of new strategies and treatments for PCM in clinical trials specifically designed for elderly patients is needed to continue to improve outcomes for elderly PCM patients in the future.</ab>

        <ab>Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Current research suggests that the neuropathology of dementia—including brain changes leading to memory impairment and cognitive decline—is evident years before the onset of this disease. Older adults with cognitive decline have reduced functional independence and quality of life, and are at greater risk for developing dementia. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can be easily assessed within the clinical setting and predict cognitive decline is important. Early recognition of cognitive decline could promote timely implementation of preventive strategies. Methods: We included 89 community-dwelling adults aged 70 years and older in our study, and collected 32 measures of physical function, health status and cognitive function at baseline. We utilized an L1–L2 regularized regression model (elastic net) to identify which of the 32 baseline measures were strongly predictive of cognitive function after one year. We built three linear regression models: 1) based on baseline cognitive function, 2) based on variables consistently selected in every cross-validation loop, and 3) a full model based on all the 32 variables. Each of these models was carefully tested with nested cross-validation. Results: Our model with the six variables consistently selected in every cross-validation loop had a mean squared prediction error of 7.47. This number was smaller than that of the full model (115.33) and the model with baseline cognitive function (7.98). Our model explained 47% of the variance in cognitive function after one year. Discussion: We built a parsimonious model based on a selected set of six physical function and health status measures strongly predictive of cognitive function after one year. In addition to reducing the complexity of the model without changing the model significantly, our model with the top variables improved the mean prediction error and R-squared. These six physical function and health status measures can be easily implemented in a clinical setting.</ab>

        <ab>Background and purpose - We reviewed the current state of research on microRNAs in age-related diseases in cartilage and bone. Methods - PubMed searches were conducted using separate terms to retrieve articles on (1) the role of microRNAs on aging and tissue degeneration, (2) specific microRNAs that influence cellular and organism senescence, (3) microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions, and (4) the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions. Results - An increasing number of studies have identified microRNAs associated with cellular aging and tissue degeneration. Specifically in regard to frailty, microRNAs have been found to influence the onset and course of age-related musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and posttraumatic arthritis. Both intracellular and extracellular microRNAs may be suitable to function as diagnostic biomarkers. In particular Interpretation - The research data currently available suggest that microRNAs play an important role in orchestrating age-related processes and conditions of the musculoskeletal system. Further research may help to improve our understanding of the complexity of these processes at the cellular and extracellular level. The option to develop microRNA biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents for the degenerating diseases of bone and cartilage appears to be promising.</ab>

        <ab>As part of a Practice Learning Centre, representing a partnership between an English University social work department and a non-governmental organisation, 12 students were placed in care homes for older people for their first period of assessed practice. The aims of this initiative were to facilitate: development of critical reflection; deployment of social work skills in a care home setting; and opportunities for social work students to work with care home residents. The learning was captured via four Experiential Groups facilitated by the Practice Educator with responsibility for assessing the students' practice. On-site supervisors also participated. Key learning included understanding of: the importance of critical reflection as a key social work skill; the influence of organisational norms and care home culture on the quality of care practice; the complexity and emotion-rich nature of person-centred care; and the pivotal role of relationships in work with people with dementia. Links made in the Groups—between the experiential and theoretical, the emotional and cognitive, and the structural and personal—demonstrate their value as learning platforms. Placements in care homes have considerable potential to enrich practice education; this is especially important in the context of an ageing population.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives Improved survival has shifted the HIV epidemic in the developed world towards more individuals &gt; 50 years of age. Older individuals, with new or longstanding HIV infection, are at greater risk for HIV-related and non- HIV-related conditions, compounding the burden and complexity of HIV management. The aim of the study was to examine the impact of age on the cost of HIV care in a well-defined HIV-infected population. Methods All HIV-infected individuals &gt; 16 years old receiving HIV care between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2011 were included in the study. The costs of antiretroviral therapy ( ART), HIV-related out-patient care and HIV-related in-patient care were collected using mean cost per person, per month ( PPPM) as the comparator variable for the comparison between older (&gt; 50 years old) and younger (≤ 50 years old) patients. Results The proportion of older patients increased from 9.6% to 25.4% and proportional costs increased from 25% to 31% from 1999 to 2010. Older patients were more likely than younger patients to be on ART (89% vs. 69%, respectively; P &lt; 0.01) and to have AIDS (29% vs. 20%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) but had similar median CD4 counts (404 vs. 396 cells/μL, respectively; not significant). They incurred higher costs for all aspects of HIV care throughout the entire 12 years. By 2010, the mean PPPM cost of HIV care for longstanding older patients was $1325 compared with $1075 for younger patients. More expensive ART as a consequence of more complex regimens, more comorbid interactions and greater adherence accounted for most of the cost difference. Conclusions The aging of the HIV-infected population in care is leading to increased HIV care costs. Health care planners and funding agencies need to be aware of the impact of this important shift in HIV demographics on the overall costs of HIV care.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Frailty has emerged as an important predictor of operative risk among elderly surgical patients. However, the complexity of prospective frailty scores has limited their widespread use. Our goal was to develop two frailty-based surgical risk models using only routine preoperative data. Our hypothesis was that these models could easily integrate into an electronic medical record to predict 30-day morbidity and mortality.&lt;bold&gt;Study Design: &lt;/bold&gt;American College of Surgeons NSQIP Participant Use Data Files from 2005 to 2010 were reviewed, and patients 65 years and older who underwent elective lower gastrointestinal surgery were identified. Two multivariate logistic regression models were constructed and internally cross-validated. The first included simple functional data, a comorbidity index based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, demographics, BMI, and laboratory data (ie, albumin &lt;3.4 g/dL, hematocrit &lt;35%, and creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL). The second model contained only parameters that can directly autopopulate from an electronic medical record (ie, demographics, laboratory data, BMI, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score). To assess diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;There were 76,106 patients who met criteria for inclusion. Thirty-day mortality was seen in 2,853 patients or 3.7% of the study population and 18,436 patients (24.2%) experienced a major complication. The c-statistic of the first expanded model was 0.813 for mortality and 0.629 for morbidity. The second simplified model had a c-statistic of 0.795 for mortality and 0.621 for morbidity. Both models were well calibrated per the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Our work demonstrates that routine preoperative data can approximate frailty and predict geriatric-specific surgical risk. The models' predicative powers were comparable with that of established prospective frailty scores. Our calculator could be used as a low-cost simple screen for high-risk individuals who might require additional evaluation or specialized services.</ab>

        <ab>In order to assess functional skills of older adults, both timed up and go (TUG) test and gait speed (GS) test are well validated concerning their predictive capacities. However, the question remains unclear which one of these tests represents better the whole physical performance of older adults. The aim of this study is to determine the more representative test, between TUG and GS, of the whole motor control quality. To study links between locomotion capacities and arm function, we measured, in a population of frail aged patients, the locomotion tests and the mean arm maximal velocity developed during a speed-accuracy trade-off. This arm movement consisted in reaching the hand toward a target in a virtual game scene. We plotted the different couples of variables obtained on graphs, and calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between each couple. The Pearson correlation between GS and hand maximal velocity was significant (r = 0.495; p = 0.046). Interestingly, we found a non significant Pearson correlation between timed up and go score (TUG) and hand maximal velocity (r = -0.139; p = 0.243). Our results suggest that GS score is more representative of the whole motor ability of frail patients than the TUG. We propose that the relative complexity of the TUG motor sequence could be involved in this difference. For a few patients with motor automatisms deficiencies, this motor sequence complexity could leads to a dual task perturbation. In this way, we conclude that GS should be preferred over the TUG with older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The Reported Edmonton Frail Scale was used to describe the prevalence of frailty in an acute general medical unit. The relationship between frailty, discharge destination, mortality and length of hospital stay was explored. We found that age was associated with frailty, and frailty correlated to an increasing length of hospital stay. Significantly, frailty was associated with complexity in discharge, and this process created a longer length of hospital stay.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Many frail older adults are thin, weak, and undernourished; this component of frailty remains a critical concern in the geriatric field. However, there is also strong evidence that excessive adiposity contributes to frailty by reducing the ability of older adults to perform physical activities and increasing metabolic instability. Our scoping review explores the impact of being obese on physical frailty in older adults by summarizing the state of the science for both clinical markers of physical function and biomarkers for potential underlying causes of obesity-related decline. We used the 5-stage methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley to conduct a scoping review of randomized trials of weight loss and/or exercise interventions for obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) in older adults (aged &gt;60 years), examining the outcomes of inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid accumulation in muscle, as well as direct measures of physical function. Our initial search yielded 212 articles; exclusion of cross-sectional and observational studies, cell culture and animal studies, disease-specific interventions, and articles published before 2001 led to a final result of 21 articles. Findings of these trials included the following major points. The literature consistently confirmed benefits of lifestyle interventions to physical function assessed at the clinical level. Generally speaking, weight loss alone produced a greater effect than exercise alone, and the best outcomes were achieved with a combination of weight loss and exercise, especially exercise programs that combined aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training. Weight loss interventions tended to reduce markers of inflammation and/or oxidative damage when more robust weight reduction was achieved and maintained over time, whereas exercise did not change markers of inflammation. However, participation in a chronic exercise program did reduce the oxidative stress induced by an acute bout of exercise. Weight loss interventions consistently reduced lipid accumulation in the muscle; however, in response to exercise, 3 studies showed an increase and 2 a decrease in muscle lipid infiltration. In summary, this scoping review identified strong clinical evidence that weight reduction and/or exercise interventions can improve physical function and biomarkers of physical dysfunction among overweight/obese older adults, supporting the suggestion that excessive adiposity contributes to physical frailty. However, the evidence also suggests a complexity of metabolic influences, both systemically and within muscle, which has not been elucidated to date. Considerable further study is needed to examine the mechanisms by which lifestyle interventions influence physical frailty before the net impact of such interventions can be fully understood.</ab>

        <ab>In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The Family Medicine Residency Program at the Aga Khan University, Karachi introduced a course on elderly care in 2009. To enhance experiential learning, a pilot home visit program was added for the final year residents. Home visits were incorporated for the first time as part of post-graduate training program in Pakistan. Such visits are unique as they allow physicians to assess and experience the health problems of the aged in their own environment. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify residents' in-depth perspectives, their positive and negative learning experiences, and to assess if nursing home visits were fulfilling the objectives of geriatric training. Method: Two batches of final year residents (n=9) consented to participate. Focused observations, a focused group discussion (FGD), and phone interviews were conducted. A trained facilitator used broad questions made by the research team to explore participant perceptions. Responses were video-taped, transcribed, and shared with participants for member checking. Phone interviews conducted were also recorded, transcribed, and collated with data from the FGD. Members of the research team then coded the data and generated themes independently which were then compared, merged, and analyzed. Quotations by participants were documented. Result: The home visit experience was regarded as overwhelming positive and innovative. Uniqueness of nursing home visits in skill building was reported by most participants. Complexity of assessing and managing geriatric patients was acknowledged. Trainees expressed frustration with point of care testing and treatment adherence which hindered their learning in terms of patient outcomes. They also reported these visits as opportunities for self-reflection and introspection. One participant reported the possibility of choosing geriatrics as a career choice. Conclusion: The nursing home program strengthened geriatric knowledge and skills of trainees, fulfilling their learning objectives and provided a unique experiential opportunity to care for the elderly. Such programs may be replicated in regional universities to enhance geriatric skills in trainees.</ab>

        <ab>The prevalence of dementia is increasing in Australia. Limited research is available on access to Cognitive Dementia and Memory Services (CDAMS) for people with dementia from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities. This study aimed to determine the barriers and enablers to accessing CDAMS for people with dementia and their families of Chinese and Vietnamese backgrounds. Consultations with community members, community workers and health professionals were conducted using the 'Cultural Exchange Model' framework. For carers, barriers to accessing services included the complexity of the health system, lack of time, travel required to get to services, language barriers, interpreters and lack of knowledge of services. Similarly, community workers and health professionals identified language, interpreters, and community perceptions as key barriers to service access. Strategies to increase knowledge included providing information via radio, printed material and education in community group settings. The 'Cultural Exchange Model' enabled engagement with and modification of the approaches to meet the needs of the targeted CALD communities.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This study aimed to gather insights in physicians' considerations for decisions to either refer for- or to withhold additional diagnostic investigations in nursing home patients with a suspicion of venous thromboembolism. Methods: Our study was nested in an observational study on diagnostic strategies for suspected venous thromboembolism in nursing home patients. Patient characteristics, bleeding-complications and mortality were related to the decision to withhold investigations. For a better understanding of the physicians' decisions, 21 individual face-to-face in-depth interviews were performed and analysed using the grounded theory approach. Results: Referal for additional diagnostic investigations was forgone in 126/322 (39.1%) patients with an indication for diagnostic work-up. ‘Blind’ anticoagulant treatment was initiated in 95 (75.4%) of these patients. The 3month mortality rates were higher for patients in whom investigations were withheld than in the referred patients, irrespective of anticoagulant treatment (odds ratio 2.45; 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 4.29) but when adjusted for the probability of being referred (i.e. the propensity score), there was no relation of non-diagnosis decisions to mortality (odds ratio 1.75; 0.98 to 3.11). In their decisions to forgo diagnostic investigations, physicians incorporated the estimated relative impact of the potential disease; the potential net-benefits of diagnostic investigations and whether performing investigations agreed with established management goals in advance care planning. Conclusion: Referral for additional diagnostic investigations is withheld in almost 40% of Dutch nursing home patients with suspected venous thromboembolism and an indication for diagnostic work-up. We propose that, given the complexity of these decisions and the uncertainty regarding their indirect effects on patient outcome, more attention should be focused on the decision to either use or withhold additional diagnostic tests.</ab>

        <ab>Aims To describe and compare the perceived social provision for a group reporting never feeling lonely with that of a group reporting feeling lonely and to explore the meaning of loneliness. Subjects Participants (N = 101) were recruited from geriatric wards. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 65 years or more, the absence of dementia, one or more chronic physical disorders and plans to be discharged from the hospital to their home. The mean age was 81.3 years (range: 65-96 years), 68% were women, and 66% lived alone. Measures Assessments of social provisions and loneliness were collected by a subjective report using the Social Provision Scale ( SPS), and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS) was used to assess depression. The participants were also asked whether they felt lonely and were then asked to describe the meaning of loneliness if they had indicated feeling lonely. Narratives were then condensed by the participants into short sentences. Results Seventy-five per cent of the participants reported feeling lonely, of these 54% were living alone, and 18% identified with depression. Three subscales of SPS scores were significantly lower in the lonely group: attachment (p &lt; 0.001), a sense of reliable alliance (p = 0.001) and the obtaining of guidance (p = 0.01). The overall view of the experience of loneliness was dominated by emptiness and negative emotions. The following themes were identified: Emotions were dominated by sadness, anxiety and restlessness, anger and guilt. Relationships were dominated by being left alone, being confined and feeling useless. Existential dimensions were characterised by emptiness, endless boredom, isolation and the potential for change. Conclusion The study shows that loneliness is prevalent among older people suffering from chronic physical illness and confirms the complexity of the concept. A mixed-methods design contributed to nuanced and detailed information about the meaning of loneliness.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To determine the effect of two variables not previously studied in the readmissions literature (frailty-related diagnoses and high-risk medications in the elderly ( HRME)) and one understudied variable (volume of primary care visits in the prior year). Design Retrospective cohort study using data from a study designed to examine outcomes associated with inappropriate prescribing in elderly adults. Setting All Veterans Affairs ( VA) facilities with acute inpatient beds in fiscal year 2006 ( FY06). Participants All veterans aged 65 and older by October 1, 2005, who received VA care at least once per year between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, and were hospitalized at least once during FY06 on a medical or surgical unit. Measurements A generalized linear interactive risk prediction model included demographic and clinical characteristics (mental health and chronic medical conditions, frailty-related diagnoses, number of medications) in FY05; incident HRME in FY06 before index hospitalization or readmission; chronic HRME in FY05; and FY05 emergency department ( ED), hospital, geriatric, palliative, or primary care use. Facility-level variables were complexity, rural versus urban, and FY06 admission rate. Results The mean adjusted readmission rate was 18.3%. The new frailty-related diagnoses variable is a risk factor for readmission in addition to Charlson comorbidity score. Incident HRME use was associated with lower rates of readmission, as were higher numbers of primary care visits in the prior year. Conclusion Frailty-related diagnoses may help to target individuals at higher risk of readmission to receive more-intensive care transition services. HRME use does not help in this targeting. A higher number of face-to-face primary care visits in the prior year, unlike ED and hospital use, correlates with fewer readmissions and may be another avenue for targeting prevention strategies.</ab>

        <ab>Working in the patient narrative has become a familiar part of the common language used in the context of caring for patients. Working in the patient narrative encompasses sharing conversation that allows exploration of the entire patient experience as it relates to health and illness. However, the complexity of engaging in end-of-life conversations, standing steady with conflict, remaining present, maintaining neutrality, and actively listening remain challenging concepts in practice even though they are integral to effectively doing so. Literature review has identified and defined key elements of interactions that can lead to significant opportunities to "wander more fully" in the patient narrative. Two case studies reviewed therein demonstrate ways in which palliative care encounters and end-of-life discussions afford the interdisciplinary team members purposeful engagement with patients. One case discusses taking risks to delve more deeply into patient's fears related to dying. This exploration lays the foundation for assuring goals of care are aligned with individual patient values. The other case demonstrates the use of symbols to share dialog related to an individual's tasks of dying. When directed, intentional facilitation occurs, the patient's unique holistic needs and values are identified, and goals of care can be clarified. In conclusion, highlights of research and clinical applications provide advantageous practice implications.</ab>

        <ab>International studies on the death of elderly nursing home residents show the complexity in the understanding of the professionals who care for the dying. The aim of this study is to explore the discourses about professional caregivers caring for those dying in Denmark in the last decade. A discourse analysis inspired by Foucault was constructed. The material consists of different source documents: research articles, newspaper articles, theses, books, websites - 35 sources in total. There are constructed six positions of speech, five discourses and three themes: (1) 'the work of the professional caregivers - a complex low-status work'; (2) 'the education of the professionals - the way to ensure a good death or possessing the right qualifications' and (3) 'the vulnerable professionals'. The study concludes that an economical/political discourse is dominating and sets up the frames within which the professionals care for dying residents, although the medical, the social/critical and the religious discourses attempt to speak against it. All positions articulate that the professional caregivers' job has a low status and that it is not possible to provide an optimal care due to lack of time, resources and education. Psychical or mental demands make the professionals vulnerable. The meaning of optimal care varies according to the positions of speech.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Since complexity of the care for the elderly increases and since a frail older person often moves across different care settings, interprofessional collaboration matters. Therefore, the BelRAI web tool with the interRAI instruments was developed in Belgium. The interRAI instruments are internationally validated, comprehensive geriatric assessments, used to collect data of clients in a structured and standardized way by different professionals and across settings. In a pilot study, financed by the Belgian Federal Government, other professionals such as nurses and social workers complained about the lack of collaboration of general practitioners (GPs). Not only this pilot study, but also scientific literature underlines that physicians are reluctant to engage when a new electronic tool is implemented. However, the studies also show that their involvement is crucial. This paper tries to explain how other professionals evaluate the collaboration with the GP and how the involvement of the GP can be improved. Methods: Data was gathered via semi-structured telephone interviews with 39 GPs. Other professionals shared their views on the role of the GP in focus groups and 123 other professionals by filling out a survey. Results: The questionnaire shows a higher GP involvement in nursing homes than in home care. The interviews reveal that the more the GPs are involved with BelRAI, the more positive their views. GPs state their involvement would increase under the following conditions: limited time investment per client (n=11), BelRAI output usable in GP practice (n=10), a more user-friendly application (n=9) and financial compensation (n=8). Conclusions and Discussion: There is room for improving GPs involvement in BelRAI and thus to increase interprofessional collaboration in care for older people in Flanders (Belgium). The findings from this study can be of help to improve the involvement of the GP and to optimize the use of the interRAI instruments via a web based tool.</ab>

        <ab>Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models—reliability, allostatic load, and complexity—that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.</ab>

        <ab>Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by older people, both with and without chronic disease. It is unpleasant and distressing and can affect functioning and quality of life. Fatigue also may inhibit an older person from participating optimally in a physical therapy program aimed at rehabilitation or the promotion of better health. However, confusion surrounds the concept of self-reported aging-related fatigue, not only because of the complexity of the problem itself but also because of lack of clarity of definition and the use of the term "fatigue" to describe a range of different concepts. This article aims to provide clarification of the concept in the context of physical therapist clinical practice. The intention is to increase awareness of the issue among physical therapists, promoting their assessment and consideration of the problem when planning health interventions involving functioning, physical activity, and exercise for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Palliative medicine is a young specialty that is officially recognized in relatively few countries. The World Health Organization published an adapted definition in 2002, describing palliative care as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. When the accent is shifting from curative to palliative, the goal of management is the maintenance or improvement of the patient's quality of life. The different dimensions of palliative care and the multitude of types of care to be provided require a multidisciplinary, well-functioning team, effective communication and a clear task division between primary and hospital care. Considering the complexity of care for incurable patients, a multidisciplinary approach is a prerequisite to balance curative and palliative intervention options. Optimal functioning of a team requires excellent training, communication and a description of the tasks and responsibilities of each team member. More and more advanced care planning is introduced in palliative care, focusing on an early identification of patients in a palliative trajectory and on the prevention of annoying symptoms, hoping that this approach results in an improved quality of life for the individual patient, less useless technical investigations and a better end-of-life care on the place the patient and his family desires.</ab>

        <ab>The need for well-coordinated care at the end of life is an important priority for meeting the needs of the growing number of low-income frail elders who are advancing in age. Partially integrated (Medicaid only) models of managed long-term care (MMLTC) are viewed as one promising and financially viable approach to enhance care coordination, yet we know little about the challenges that care managers face in managing the end-of-life care needs of poor elders. A case study design was used to explore challenges encountered in the provision of end-of-life care management for low-income elders enrolled in an innovative partially integrated model of long-term care, in Wisconsin, the Milwaukee County Family Care program. Data were collected via in-depth interviews with county administrators (n = 4) and selected lead supervisors or care managers (n = 7) and two focus groups with care management team members (n = 17). We identified five major themes representing essential challenges: (1) complexity of care and high level of support needs; (2) communication constraints in advance care planning; (3) family conflicts in end-of-life decision making for elders; (4) insufficient communication and collaboration between elders, families, teams, and service providers; and (5) limited bereavement and grief related support for families and teams after elders die. We discuss similarities and difference in the challenges reported here as compared to challenges reported in studies of other models of care and offer recommendations for program and policy development.</ab>

        <ab>Human aging into senescence diminishes the capacity of the postural control system to adapt to the stressors of everyday life. Diminished adaptive capacity may be reflected by a loss of the fractal-like, multiscale complexity within the dynamics of standing postural sway (i.e., center-of-pressure, COP). We therefore studied the relationship between COP complexity and adaptive capacity in 22 older and 22 younger healthy adults. COP magnitude dynamics were assessed from raw data during quiet standing with eyes open and closed, and complexity was quantified with a new technique termed empirical mode decomposition embedded detrended fluctuation analysis (EMD-DFA). Adaptive capacity of the postural control system was assessed with the sharpened Romberg test. As compared to traditional DFA, EMD-DFA more accurately identified trends in COP data with intrinsic scales and produced short and long-term scaling exponents (i.e., αShort, αLong) with greater reliability. The fractal-like properties of COP fluctuations were time-scale dependent and highly complex (i.e., αShort values were close to one) over relatively short time scales. As compared to younger adults, older adults demonstrated lower short-term COP complexity (i.e., greater αShort values) in both visual conditions (p&gt;0.001). Closing the eyes decreased short-term COP complexity, yet this decrease was greater in older compared to younger adults (p&lt;0.001). In older adults, those with higher short-term COP complexity exhibited better adaptive capacity as quantified by Romberg test performance (r2 = 0.38, p&lt;0.001). These results indicate that an age-related loss of COP complexity of magnitude series may reflect a clinically important reduction in postural control system functionality as a new biomarker.</ab>

        <ab>The inherent complexity of aging-related traits can temper progress in unraveling the genetic origins of healthspan. We focus on two generations in the Framingham Heart Study, the original ( FHS) and offspring ( FHSO) cohorts, to determine whether aging-related processes in changing environments can substantially impact the role of lipid-related genes discovered in candidate gene (the apolipoprotein E ( APOE) e2/3/4 polymorphism) and genome-wide (the APOB rs1042034 (C/T)) studies, in regulation of total cholesterol ( TC) and onset of cardiovascular disease ( CVD). We demonstrate that the APOE e4 allele and APOB CC genotype can play detrimental, neutral, and protective sex-specific roles in the etiology of CVD at different ages and in different environments. We document antagonistic roles for the e4 allele in the onset of CVD characterized by detrimental effects at younger ages ( RR≤ 75 years = 1.49, P = 7.5 × 10−4) and protective effects at older ages ( RR76+years = 0.77, P = 0.044) for FHS participants. We found that disregarding the role of aging erroneously nullifies the significant effects of the e4 allele in this sample ( RR = 0.92, P = 0.387). The leading biogenetic pathways mediating genetic effects on CVD may be more relevant to lipid metabolism for APOB than APOE. Aging-related processes can modulate the strength of genetic associations with TC in the same individuals at different chronological ages. We found substantial differences in the effects of the same APOE and APOB alleles on CVD and TC across generations. The results suggest that aging-related processes in changing environments may play key roles in the genetics of healthspan. Detailed systemic integrative analyses may substantially advance the progress.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Although the evolutionary theories of aging are quite well established, our knowledge about how we age is still very limited. The abundance and heterogeneity of available mechanistic theories of aging implicitly suggest that this phenomenon is overly complex and unlikely to be explained by a single pathway. Moreover, although aging remains a unique process, it is characterized by heterogeneous manifestations, not only determining inter-individual variations, but even intra-individual diversities. Such heterogeneity renders the inner nature of the aging process of difficult evaluation in older persons due to the potential biases introduced by multiple age-related social, biological, and clinical factors (and responsible for the evidence-based issue in geriatrics). Moving from the difficulties in translating anti-aging preclinical interventions into clinical trials, an alternative approach is illustrated. We encourage moving to a holistic evaluation of aging by adopting specific and consequent modifications in the design and conduction of clinical research. Such approach is today commonly applied in the clinical setting where the complexity of older patients often requires multidimensional interventions to adequately target the geriatric syndromes. Consistently, interventions targeting the aging process may result ineffective if too focused on a single underlying causal mechanism and/or failing to capture the complexity of the phenomenon. In this context, frailty (a geriatric syndrome characterized by age-related declines occurring across multiple physiologic systems) may indeed represent a clinically relevant threshold throughout the continuum of the aging process and a promising benchmark to test multidomain interventions against age-related conditions.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric medicine has an encyclopaedic sweep, reflecting the complexity of both the ageing process and of our patient group. Keeping up with, and making sense of, the relevant scientific literature is challenging, especially as ageing has increased in prominence as a focus of research across many branches of the sciences and the humanities. This review of research published in 2012 in generalist, geriatric medicine and gerontology journals has been compiled with a view to extracting those aspects of research into ageing which could be considered relevant not only to the practice of geriatric medicine, but also to our understanding of the ageing process and the relationship of geriatric medicine to other medical specialties and public health. The research discussed includes new insights into global ageing and the compression of morbidity; nosological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of dementia; an innovative study on the microbiome and ageing; epidemiological perspectives into multi-morbidity; an overview of the impact of the first waves of Baby Boomers; fresh thinking on geriatric syndromes such as orthostatic hypotension, kyphosis, urinary incontinence after stroke, frailty and elder abuse; an update of the Beers criteria and the first stirrings of recognition of the longevity dividend in the biomedical literature.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In Canada, primary care practitioners provide the majority of care for elderly patients. Increasing volume and complexity of care compounded by a shortage of specialized geriatric services has lead to problems of fragmented, inefficient, and often ineffective service for this population. Integrated models that bridge primary and secondary care have emerged as a major theme in health reform to address such challenges for care of the elderly. Although primary care practitioners are important stakeholders necessary for successful uptake and sustainability of such integrated models, this perspective has been largely unexplored. Methods and Findings: We used a qualitative thematic approach to bring forward front-line perspectives of nurses and physicians who referred their patients to a newly developed integrated, multidisciplinary program for seniors that was introduced into their primary care clinic. Referrers experienced improved care processes, improved quality of care, as well as an enhanced experience when managing their elderly patients. Unclear assignment of roles and responsibilities created confusion for referring practitioners and their patients. Conclusions: Understanding benefits, limitations, and changes to front-line practitioner experience provides insight into important factors contributing to buy-in and sustainability of integrated programming for the elderly in this setting.</ab>

        <ab>The planning and delivery of care systems require knowledge on the ways in which individuals access available services that are funded by a range of health and community services. The aims of this study were to identify distinct groups of Home and Community Care (HACC) clients in New South Wales, Australia, based on patterns of actual service use, and to understand the health and social needs and resources of client groups that access different mixes of services. Multiple data sets linked at the individual level - including the 45 and Up Study community survey, the HACC Minimum Data Set and the Admitted Patient Data Collection for hospitals - provide an innovative basis to investigate the complexity of access to service use. Data were collected between 2006 and 2008. A cluster analysis based on clients' type and volume of community service use was conducted on the 4890 HACC clients in the linked dataset and nine distinct clusters of clients were identified. Three of these clusters were considered 'complex', in terms of the range of community and hospital assistance received, while the others comprised mainly of one or two dominant service types. The analytical approach and findings developed here provide a client-centred approach to monitor and evaluate access to local service systems that are being reformed to better integrate the delivery of health and community services currently funded and managed separately by national and state governments.</ab>

The concept of frailty is a better predictor than age alone. The Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has been developed to identify frailty. We assessed feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Community-based. Participants: Home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly persons were included in the study (n = 353) who met the following inclusion criteria: persons 65 years and older who were able to fill out questionnaires. Measurements: The feasibility of the GFI was assessed by determining the proportion of missing values per item. The internal consistency reliability of the GFI was established by calculating the KR-20. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to assess discrimination between specific subgroups (known group validity). Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using Spearman Rank correlations between GFI and diseases and disorders, case complexity, and health care needs (INTERMED), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder of Life), activities of daily living (Katz), quality of life (EQ-5D), and mental health (SF-36). Finally, we used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the cutoff score of the GFI (&lt;4 versus ≥4). Results: A total of 296 (84%) of the participants completed all items of the GFI; the internal consistency was 0.68. The GFI yielded statistically significant GFI scores for subgroups (known group validity). The correlations for the convergent (range 0.45 to 0.61) and discriminant validity (range 0.08 to 0.50) were also as hypothesized. In contrast with nonfrail participants, frail older persons had higher levels of case complexity, disability, and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the self-assessment version of the GFI in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly people.</ab>

        <ab>Heart rate variability (HRV) is the temporal beat-to-beat variation in successive RR intervals on an electrocardiographic (ECG) recording and it reflects the regulation of the heart rate (HR) by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). HRV analysis is a noninvasive tool for the assessment of autonomic function that gained momentum in the late 1980s when its clinical relevance as a predictor of mortality was established by a milestone study by Kleiger et al. in patients with postacute myocardial infarction. In the last few decades, the increasing availability of commercial ECG devices offering HRV analysis has made HRV a favorite marker for risk stratification in the setting of cardiovascular disease. The rapid aging of the world population and the growing popularity of HRV have also fueled interest for the prognostic value of HRV in the elderly, outside a specific cardiological context. However, the discussion of HRV measures in the elderly is still very much centered on the rather reductionistic model of sympathovagal balance, with the orthosympathetic and parasympathetic limbs of the ANS exercising opposing effects on the heart via autonomic tone. The expanding application of nonlinear dynamics to medicine has brought to the forefront the notion of system complexity, embedded in the mathematical concepts of chaos theory and fractals, and provides an opportunity to suggest a broader interpretation for the prognostic significance of HRV, especially in the elderly. Although the use of novel indices of HRV may be hampered by practical issues, a more holistic approach to HRV may still be safeguarded if traditional time- and frequency-domain measures are viewed in terms of autonomic modulation. This review focuses on HRV in geriatric populations. It considers studies on the prognostic value of HRV in elderly subjects, discussing the potential confounding effect of erratic rhythm, and concentrates on the conceptual distinction between autonomic tone and autonomic modulation. It also briefly addresses the question of the practicality of ECG recordings and identifies a promising area for future research in the effects of common noncardioactive drugs on HRV.

        <ab>Abstract: PD is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects as many as 1–2% of persons aged 60 years and older. In the latest decade, the approach to PD was dramatically changed. In fact, although for many years PD has been considered only “a disease that affects walking”, with a key role of the neurotransmitter dopamine, recently the neurological approach has been substantially modified. The approach for this disease is not only a neurological issue. Given the complexity of its clinical aspects, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, sleep disorder, pneumonia dysfagia-related and malnutrition, a multidisciplinary evaluation and not just a neurological evaluation is needed. We suggest a n multidisciplinary approach for this old actor, underlying a subtle link between neurophatological stages of the disease (Braak''s classification) and clinical aspects (Braak''s stages 1 and 2 associated with the premotor phase; Braak''s stages 3–4 associated with the motor symptoms and Braak''s stages 5–6 associated with cognitive impairment). In addition, we emphasize the usefulness of geriatric evaluation for the identification of frail “in situ”, frail, and disable status for improving care and treatment in this multifaceted disease.</ab>

        <ab>Mobility disability in older adults can arise from single system problems, such as discrete musculoskeletal injury. In frail older adults, however, mobility disability is part of a complex web of problems. The approach to their rehabilitation must take that complexity into account, as is reported by Fairhall et al. First, their overall health state must be assessed, which is achieved by a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The assessment can show how a particular patient came to be disabled, so that an individualized care plan can be worked out. Whether this approach works in general can be evaluated by looking at group differences in mean mobility test scores. Knowing whether it has worked in the individual patient requires an individualized measure. This is because not every patient starts from the same point, and not every patient achieves success by aiming for the same goal. For one patient, walking unassisted for three metres would be a triumph; for another it would be a tragedy. Unless we understand the complexity of the needs of frail older adults, we will neither be able to treat them effectively nor evaluate our efforts sensibly.</ab>

        <ab>Aging is characterized by a general decline in physiological and behavioral function that has been widely interpreted within the context of the loss of complexity hypothesis. In this paper, we examine the relation between aging, neuromuscular function and physiological-behavioral complexity in the arm-hand effector system, specifically with reference to physiological tremor and isometric force production. Experimental findings reveal that the adaptive behavioral consequences of the aging-related functional decline in neurophysiological processes are less pronounced in simple motor tasks which provides support for the proposition that the motor output is influenced by both extrinsic (e.g., task related) and intrinsic (e.g., coordination, weakness) factors. Moreover, the aging-related change in complexity can be bidirectional (increase or decrease) according to the influence of task constraints on the adaptation required of the intrinsic properties of the effector system.</ab>

        <ab>To become dependent on professional support to accomplish the daily activities of life can be considered a turning point, involving a range of challenging changes in life. The purpose of the study was to describe the experiences of older homedwelling individuals in transition from self-supported to supported living from a lifeworld perspective. Five women and five men were interviewed, and a descriptive phenomenological design was used. The findings showed that an attitude of acceptance was an essential characteristic for this group. An attitude of acceptance comprised: flexibility and tolerance, recognition and hopes, and valuation of self and situation. Finding themselves in a situation they had to submit to, they took an attitude of acceptance. An attitude of acceptance implied acknowledgement of the situation as well as positivity and desires to manage. This attitude may represent a significant potential for improvement. Awareness of this is crucial to support older individuals in a healthy way through the transition process. An attitude of acceptance, however, also implied an acceptance of discontinuity in their lives, renunciations, and denigration of own needs. But this aspect of the acceptance was trivialized by the participants and not equally obvious. Insight into this complexity is vital to avoid ignorance of older individuals' vulnerability in the transition process.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Frailty is a late-life syndrome of vulnerability to adverse health outcomes characterized by a phenotype that includes muscle weakness, fatigue, and inflammatory pathway activation. The identification of biologically relevant pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically relevant pathways that contribute to frailty. Methods. Based on current understanding of the physiological basis of frailty, we hypothesize that variation in genes related to inflammation and muscle maintenance would associate with frailty. One thousand three hundred and fifty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped across 134 candidate genes using the Illumina Genotyping platform, and the rank order by strength of association between frailty and genotype was determined in a cross-sectional study. Results. Although no single-nucleotide polymorphism reached study-wide significance after controlling family-wise false-discovery rate at 0.05, single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), Caspase 8 (CASP8), CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), and beta-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) loci were among those strongly associated with frailty. Conclusions. The apoptosis– and transcription regulation–related pathways highlighted by this preliminary analysis were consistent with prior gene expression studies in a frail mouse model and provide useful etiological insights for future biological studies of frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The treatment of older adults with pain is complex and affected by age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Chronic pain encompasses a complex array of sensory-discriminatory, motivational-affective, and cognitive-evaluative components. Because of this complexity, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches should be considered to treat pain. Aims: Given the large number of older persons with pain at the end of life and the few data about this issue, the objective of this article is to review the treatment of pain in this population. Patients and Methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and LILACS from 1990 to 2011 and the references in retrieved manuscripts. The search terms were pain AND elderly AND end of life. Results: There are evidences of undertreatment among elderly people. The association of nonpharmacologic resources with the pharmacological treatment can help reduce the use of analgesics minimizing the side effects of long term medication. Pharmacological treatment is escalated in an orderly manner from non-opioid to weak opioid to strong opioid. Adjuvant drugs like anticonvulsants and antidepressants may be necessary. Conclusions: The sequential use of analgesics drugs and opioids are considered effective and relatively inexpensive for relieving pain, but no well designed specific studies in the elderly patient are available. There are not specific recommendations about the long-term use of complementary and alternative therapies and although their effectiveness remains unproven they should not be discouraged. Palliative sedation may be a valid palliative care option to relieve suffering in the imminently dying patient.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The aim of follow-up visits by the general practitioner and district nurse (within a week after discharge from hospital) is to reduce hospital readmissions and improve the overall wellbeing of the patient. There is strong evidence that these programmes are effective, but are difficult to implement because of a number of organizational obstacles, including co-ordination between the organizations involved in the process. In this paper we look at the factors that affect motivation to participate in a cross-sectoral programme in Copenhagen, Denmark, implementing follow-up home visits to elderly persons. Theory and methods: The analysis is based on inter-organizational network theory in an attempt to explain the role of motivation in network formation between organizational systems. The empirical findings are based on focus groups and in-depth interviews with hospital staff, general practitioners, and district nurses. Results: Care providers are motivated to collaborate by a number of factors. The focus of collaboration needs to be clearly defined and agreed upon, there needs to be a high degree of equality between the professionals involved, and there has to be a will to co-operate based on a shared understanding of values and learning potentials. Conclusions: The study concludes that we need to focus on specific care fields and actors to reduce complexity in the area and more fully understand what motivates care providers to participate in cross-sectoral activities, such as a follow-up home visit programme. One lesson for current policy is that motivational factors need to be addressed in future collaborative programmes in order to fully exploit the potential health benefits.</ab>

        <ab>As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.</ab>

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction and Rationale: The number of older cancer patients is increasing with global aging of the population. A close interaction between oncologists and geriatricians becomes necessary to (1) better evaluate the elders’ health status, (2) determine their residual clinical/biological reserves, and (3) optimize the provided medical care. In fact, aggressive antineoplastic managements are often denied to older patients, possibly because of the common misconception suggesting older age and/or clinical complexity as absolute contraindications to advanced treatments. Methods: The primary aim of the presented project is to assess whether assigning a geriatrician to provide daily medical care to older cancer patients (aged 65 years and older) admitted to an oncology ward increases the number of patients eligible for a chemotherapeutic and/or surgical intervention. The project is articulated in 2 phases: (1) a retrospective phase based on analysis of data collected over the 2 years before the beginning of the study, and (2) a prospective 2-year intervention. Additional information about clinical conditions, biological parameters, adverse drug reactions, body composition, physical function, and 1-year health-related events will also be recorded. Outcomes: The combination of expertise from oncologists and geriatricians is likely to result in (1) an improved selection of candidates for interventions aimed at increasing disability-free life expectancy and/or overall survival, and (2) a more rational exclusion of patients at higher risk of toxicity or with poor prognosis. In this article, the development of an onco-geriatric unit aimed at the evaluation, management, and treatment of older women with gynecological cancer is also described.</ab>

        <ab>The convergence of technology and global ageing is driving new business opportunities, innovations in service delivery and the promise of a better life tomorrow for older adults and those who care for them. Despite its promise, technology has a Janus face introducing both new solutions as well as new problems. Successful development and integration of technology as a tool to transform global ageing into global opportunity requires that individuals, families, business and governments, at all levels, address key trade-offs: functionality versus complexity; service versus stigma; universal design versus universally dull; safety versus privacy; health versus dignity; availability versus equity; and lastly, hightech versus high-touch.</ab>

        <ab>Population ageing is a new challenge for physicians because of the clinical complexity of the elderly. Although geriatric pharmacology is an emerging issue, very little is known and the choice of different treatments for the very elderly is still an important question. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common chronic diseases throughout the world affecting prevalently older people. Despite the increasing burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in older people, underdiagnosis and undertreatment in this age group are still common problems. Some patients are frail as they have impaired homeostatic mechanisms, deteriorated physiological systems, and limited functional reserve. Pharmacotherapeutic decisions should be combined with a careful assessment of comorbidity, polypharmacy, and age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in order to minimize adverse drug events, drug-drug or drug-disease interactions, and nonadherence to treatment. There are few studies that specifically examine age as a factor influencing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled therapies, the cornerstone of treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This review provides a summary of age-related physiological changes and their impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with particular regard to the drugs implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment, in order to optimize drug therapy.

        <ab>Purpose/Objectives: To identify appropriate strategies for pharmacotherapeutic agents in the management of pain in older adults with cancer.Data Sources: PubMed literature searches, personal reference collection, and clinical experience.Data Synthesis: To make good decisions about pain management when developing treatment plans for older adults, healthcare providers should focus on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in the context of the physiologic changes that occur with aging.Conclusions: Unrelieved pain can have a detrimental effect on older adults; conversely, overmedicating can lead to an increased risk of adverse events. With advancing age, physiologic changes alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs by reducing their absorption, changing their distribution, and modifying their metabolism and elimination. Also, common comorbidities increase the risk of pharmacologic toxicity and narrow the therapeutic window. In addition, polypharmacy—an issue more common in older adults—increases the complexity of prescribing and risk of adverse events. Consequently, older adults require individualization of their pharmacotherapies. Healthcare providers should consider carefully the risks and benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjuvants before initiating an analgesic trial. The 2009 guidelines published by the American Geriatrics Society described several key principles for prescribing analgesics to older adults and offered specific recommendations and caveats for each drug class.Implications for Nursing: Current guidelines support appropriate management of cancer pain in older adults with specific recommendations for each class of analgesics as well as general prescribing principles.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The literature on integration indicates the need for an enhanced theorization of institutional integration. This article proposes path dependence as an analytical framework to study the systems in which integration takes place. Purpose: PRISMA proposes a model for integrating health and social care services for older adults. This model was initially tested in Quebec. The PRISMA France study gave us an opportunity to analyze institutional integration in France. Methods: A qualitative approach was used. Analyses were based on semi-structured interviews with actors of all levels of decision-making, observations of advisory board meetings, and administrative documents. Results: Our analyses revealed the complexity and fragmentation of institutional integration. The path dependency theory, which analyzes the change capacity of institutions by taking into account their historic structures, allows analysis of this situation. The path dependency to the Bismarckian system and the incomplete reforms of gerontological policies generate the coexistence and juxtaposition of institutional systems. In such a context, no institution has sufficient ability to determine gerontology policy and build institutional integration by itself. Conclusion: Using path dependence as an analytical framework helps to understand the reasons why institutional integration is critical to organizational and clinical integration, and the complex construction of institutional integration in France.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the experiences of older people living with heart failure and their transitions from independence to dependence and for some death. New Zealand’s ageing population is predicted to increase from 12% in 2001 to 25% by the year 2051, similar to the worldwide trend of ageing. A high proportion of these people will have one or more chronic illnesses. Associated with the increase in survival is a growing body of research examining the needs of the older person with heart failure and finding particular problems with end of life care. Older people face many challenges in living with their heart failure, in particular the transition to dependence. To study the transition a longitudinal qualitative study using General Inductive approach was used. Participants were interviewed every 3 months for a 12-month period during 2006–2008. A total of 79 interviews with 25 people were completed. Our findings showed that transition was not a simple linear process with the older person moving from one phase to another; instead their experiences illustrated the complexity of transitions they faced and what helped them to manage these. The older people in this study illustrated the importance of trust in health professionals and believed they would receive good care. Their fears revealed concerns about being a burden as they deteriorate and becoming more dependent. Understanding the complex issues related to transition to dependence can provide health professionals with a framework for assessment and approaches to providing the support required.</ab>

        <ab>The role of systems in addressing the needs of elderly and chronically ill populations remains a far from universal way of thinking, much less practice, in health care. Re-engineering the current fragmented system to align providers, patients and payment models to facilitate proactive management of conditions associated with advanced age and/or one or more chronic diseases – rather than responding to costly consequences of a health care system optimized for acute care conditions – will be a major challenge for all stakeholders. There are, however, promising success stories that are taking place in the United States today that may provide a model for improvement. The authors define the issues faced by the health care providers and payers that arise when providing care for the elderly and those with chronic conditions – issues that threaten to overwhelm the financial and human health care resources that exist to serve these populations. They define innovative ways of thinking about systems of care, and provide examples of unique systems that have applied theory into practice. These successful leaders may offer lessons in proactively managing complex health conditions, overcoming communication barriers and using technology to complement the necessary human touch that is essential to health care delivery.</ab>

        <ab>Pharmacological treatment of complex older adults with comorbidities, multiple impairments in function, cognition, social status and geriatric syndromes represents a challenge for prescribing physicians and often results in a high rate of iatrogenic illnesses. Clinical guidelines are commonly used to indicate appropriate prescription, but they are often based on the results of clinical trials that are conducted on young subjects with a low level of complexity. Therefore, the recommendations of clinical guidelines may be difficult to apply to older complex adults. In this paper we present the rationale and methodology of the Development of CRIteria to assess appropriate Medication use among Elderly complex patients (CRIME) project, a study aimed at producing recommendations to evaluate the appropriateness of pharmacological prescription in older complex patients, translating the recommendations of clinical guidelines to this type of patient. A literature search will be performed to integrate and revise the recommendations of disease-specific guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of patients with common chronic conditions. New recommendations will be provided and approved in a consensus meeting of international experts. Both data from randomized controlled trials and observational studies will be used to meet this aim. Recommendations provided by the CRIME project are not meant to replace existing clinical guidelines, but they may be used to help physicians in the prescribing process. Once completed these recommendations should be validated in interventional studies.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Balance during quiet stance involves the complex interactions of multiple postural control systems, which may degrade with frailty. The complexity of center of pressure (COP) dynamics, as quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE), during quiet standing is lower in older adults, especially those with falls. We hypothesized that COP dynamics from frail elderly individuals demonstrate less complexity than those from nonfrail elderly controls; complexity decreases when performing a dual task; and postural complexity during quiet standing is independent of other conventional correlates of balance control, such as age and vision.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Frailty in older adults, defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms, is associated with abnormal levels in individual physiological systems. We tested the hypothesis that it is the critical mass of physiological systems abnormal that is associated with frailty, over and above the status of each individual system, and that the relationship is nonlinear. Methods. Using data on women aged 70 - 79 years from the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and II, multiple analytic approaches assessed the cross-sectional association of frailty with eight physiological measures. Results. Abnormality in each system (anemia, inflammation, insulin-like growth factor-1, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, hemoglobin A1c, micronutrients, adiposity, and fine motor speed) was significantly associated with frailty status. However, adjusting for the level of each system measure, the mean number of systems impaired significantly and nonlinearly predicted frailty. Those with three or more systems impaired were most likely to be frail, with odds of frailty increasing with number of systems at abnormal level, from odds ratios (ORs) of 4.8 to 11 to 26 for those with one to two, three to four, and five or more systems abnormal (p &lt; .05 for all). Finally, two subgroups were identified, one with isolated or no systems abnormal and a second (in 30%) with multiple systems abnormal. The latter group was independently associated with being frail (OR = 2.6, p &lt; .05), adjusting for confounders and chronic diseases and then controlling for individual systems. Conclusions. Overall, these findings indicate that the likelihood of frailty increases nonlinearly in relationship to the number of physiological systems abnormal, and the number of abnormal systems is more predictive than the individual abnormal system. These findings support theories that aggregate loss of complexity, with aging, in physiological systems is an important cause of frailty. Implications are that a threshold loss of complexity, as indicated by number of systems abnormal, may undermine homeostatic adaptive capacity, leading to the development of frailty and its associated risk for subsequent adverse outcomes. It further suggests that replacement of any one deficient system may not be sufficient to prevent or ameliorate frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Age-related deterioration in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms leads to decreased complexity in their output. For example, the degradation of cardiac autonomic control results in loss of complexity in the heart rate signal. Frailty is a state of critically impaired homeostasis that results in heightened vulnerability to stressors. We propose a new measure of heart rate variability (HRV) to capture the impairment in cardiac autonomic control associated with frailty. Methods. Traditional time and frequency domain indices of HRV were obtained from 2-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 276 women (65-101 years old) in the Women's Health and Aging Study-I. Principal components analysis was conducted on the correlation matrix of HRV indices. Frailty was defined using a validated instrument. Regression models were used to evaluate associations of HRV measures with age, frailty, and 5-year mortality. Results. The first two principal components (PCs), PC1 and PC2, explained 90% of the variance in HRV indices. PC1 is the mean of log-transformed HRV indices. PC2 is a linear combination of log-transformed indices, with positive weights for very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), and negative weights for high frequency (HF), root-mean-squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and proportion of all N-N intervals that are larger than 50 ms (pNN50). Decreases in SDNN, VLF, LF, and LF/HF were associated with an increased risk of frailty. PC2 was more strongly associated with age (ß = -.23, p &lt; .001) and frailty (ß = -.73, p &lt; 10-5) than were the individual HRV indices and LFIHF. PC2 was also the best predictor of 5-year mortality (ß = -.60 &lt; p &lt; 10-6). Conclusions. Cardiac autonomic control, as reflected by HRV, is impaired in frailty. A new measure derived from PC aggregation of traditional HRV indices provides a compact summary of this impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Given the anticipated limited availability of geriatricians for the foreseeable future, how should the geriatrician's specialized clinical skills be deployed to optimally benefit the health of our aging population? Directors of geriatrics academic programs (DGAPs) at all 145 U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were asked this question as part of a winter 2007 on-line survey. The DGAPs were to indicate the types of patients who would most benefit from a geriatrician's services in three practice situations: primary care, consultations, and care in the hospital. The survey response rate was 74.5%. There was high consensus among the DGAPs on the benefits of having a geriatrician care for the most complex and vulnerable older adults in primary care and hospital settings. There was slightly less consensus as to when geriatrics consultations are beneficial. The patient subsets that were viewed as benefiting the most from geriatrician care were aged 85 and older, frailty, geriatric syndromes, severe functional impairment, and complexity. The results of this survey suggest that, because of the predicted shortage of geriatricians, the DGAPs would target geriatricians to work with the most vulnerable older adults. These findings offer the beginning of a consensus statement as to the role of geriatricians in the continuum of American medical care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To assess whether less physiological complexity underlying regulation of heart rate dynamics, as indicated by lower approximate entropy for heart rate (ApEnHR), is associated with frailty. For supporting validity, relationships between frailty and traditional linear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were also assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, a community-based observational study, 1992 to 1995. PARTICIPANTS: Subset of 389 community-dwelling women aged years and older with moderate to severe disability with ApEnHR data (convenience sampling). MEASUREMENTS: Electrocardiographic Holter recordings obtained over 2- to 3-hour periods were processed for ApEnHR and HRV measures. ApEnHR is a nonlinear statistic that quantifies the regularity of heart rate fluctuations over time. Lower ApEnHR is characteristic of heart rate time series containing a high proportion of repetitive patterns. Frailty was defined according to validated phenotype criteria. RESULTS: Median ApEnHR was lower in frail than in nonfrail subjects ( P=.02). Lower ApEnHR (top quartile) was associated with lower likelihood of frailty than higher ApEnHR (bottom three quartiles) (odds ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.26–0.86), even after adjustment for major confounders. Frailty was consistently associated with lower HRV as assessed using time- and frequency-domain indices. CONCLUSION: This study supports the notion that less physiological complexity marks frailty and provides an empirical basis to the concept of frailty as a syndrome of homeostatic impairment. Future research will determine whether noninvasive measures of physiological complexity underlying heart rate dynamics might be useful for screening and monitoring of clinical vulnerability in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last decade there has been !in enormous expansion of research focused on defining the role of inflammation in aging, age-related diseases, disability, and frailty. The availability of methods to measure cytokines and other inflammatory mediators or markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critically important. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the most widely used and best validated method, is limited by its ability to measure only a single protein in each sample. Recent developments in serum cytokine quantification technology include multiplex arrays, which offer the potential of better evaluating the complexity and dynamic nature of inflammatory responses and offer substantial cost and sample savings over traditional ELISA measurements. Despite potential advantages of this new technology, experience with these techniques is limited, and it has not emerged to date as the gold standard in inflammatory mediator measurement. This article reviews ELISA and the emerging multiplex technologies, compares the cost and effectiveness of recently developed multiplex arrays with traditional ELISA technology, and provides specific recommendations for investigators interested in measuring serum inflammatory mediators in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Constipation is a significant healthcare problem in the elderly. However, while undoubtedly common in the elderly, data on the prevalence of constipation in general and of its subtypes vary considerably, depending on the nature of the study population and their location. Furthermore, the complexity of the pathophysiology of constipation in this age group is little appreciated. Assumptions regarding age-related changes in colorectal physiology are, for the most part, not supported by scientific evidence and may serve to distract the clinician from uncovering the contributions of co-morbid diseases and the impact of iatrogenic factors. The evidence base from which one can develop recommendations on the management of constipation in the elderly is, for the most part, slim. This becomes most starkly apparent when one attempts to critically assess specific approaches to management. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of many commonly used laxatives both in the general population and in the elderly. Lifestyle interventions have value for some patients but data are lacking on the benefits of these interventions for patients with chronic constipation. Data in the elderly do not exist for most new pharmacological approaches to constipation. Pending the availability of good data, management of constipation in the elderly should be tailored to each individuals needs and expectations, regardless of age or place of residence. In certain situations, constipation may be complicated by the development of impaction; preventive strategies are important in this context. We urge enrolment of many more elderly individuals with chronic constipation in clinical trials designed to address their particular needs.</ab>

        <ab>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric patients are a subset of older people with multiple comorbidities that usually have significant functional implications. Geriatric patients have impaired homeostasis and wide inter-individual variability. Comprehensive geriatric assessment captures the complexity of the problems that characterize frail older patients and can be used to guide management, including prescribing. Prescribing for geriatric patients requires an understanding of the efficacy of the medication in frail older people, assessment of the risk of adverse drug events, discussion of the harm:benefit ratio with the patient, a decision about the dose regime and careful monitoring of the patient's response. This requires evaluation of evidence from clinical trials, application of the evidence to frail older people through an understanding of changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and attention to medication management issues. Given that most disease occurs in older people, and that older people are the major recipients of drug therapy in the Western world, increased research and a better evidence base is essential to guide clinicians who manage geriatric patients.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The psychopathological syndromes associated with the organic disease in the frail patient are put in the focus of our studies. In the frail patient, mood disorders show a multifacet appearance often associated to the invalidating pathologies or determined by the interaction between the diseases and the individual personality traits. A psychotic break can worsen the evolution of the clinical status. In the clinical practice with the frail elderly, the diagnostic and therapeutic phases change to some extent. The psychiatric diagnosis based upon the DSM-IV-TR shall include a multiaxial approach, with the general medical conditions coded on axis III. The therapeutic planning must be based on rules taken from the field of sciences of complexity; in the field of complexity, the evolution of the clinical status is not expectable and the points of discontinuity are the rule. The difficulties to reach a “secure base” makes the therapeutic dynamics be attracted from areas of stability in the mid of chaos, named “chaotic attractors”.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the importance and complexity of evaluating decision-making capacity at the end of life, little research has focused on terminally ill patients' decision-making ability. The purpose of this study was to explore the decision-making capacity of elderly, terminally ill patients and the psychological and physical factors that affect decision making. Decision-making capacity and cognitive abilities were assessed using four measures: the Hopkins Competency Assessment Kit, the Bechara Gambling Task, the Concept Assessment Kit, and the Mini Mental Status Exam. In addition, symptoms of depression, level of physical functioning, and extent of physical symptoms were evaluated in order to identify correlates of decision-making ability. Two samples were compared: elderly, terminally ill patients with cancer (n = 43) and elderly, physically healthy adults living in supportive community residence (n = 35). Results revealed significantly poorer decision-making abilities among the terminal ill sample compared with healthy comparisons, but no association between demographic variables (e.g., age, race, or education) or clinical variables (depression or physical symptoms) and decision making. Implications for evaluating decision-making capacity are addressed. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatricians have embraced the term “geriatric syndrome,” using it extensively to highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors—older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility—were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the potential impact and practical difficulties of mainstreaming equalities in support at home for minority and majority ethnic older people, drawing on two linked empirical research projects. Social care providers have long faced difficulties in catering for diversity of need. Recently, diversity within minority ethnic groups has increased, and there is now a statutory duty to promote equality. Research findings illustrate the complexity of exclusionary processes, with particular reference to the example of health care. There is a gap between the high-level commitment to mainstreaming equality and people's lived experiences. Autonomy and choice are central to community care legislation, policy and practice guidance, but in reality, the research shows that choices are limited for both minority and majority older people. More user-focused approaches and grassroots involvement may offer ways forward, despite some limitations of current models. In conclusion, the potentiality of a broad mainstreaming equality perspective is highlighted, but challenges include a need for a more grounded approach, better engagement with user groups and a need to focus on understanding issues of implementation.</ab>

        <ab>Superoxide generated adventitiously by the mitochondrial respiratory chain can give rise to much more reactive radicals, resulting in random oxidation of all classes of macromolecules. Harman's 1956 suggestion that this process might drive aging has been a leading strand of biogerontological thinking since the discovery of superoxide dismutase. However, it has become apparent that the many downstream consequences of free radical damage can also be caused by processes not involving oxidation. Moreover, free radicals have been put to use by evolution to such an extent that their wholesale elimination would certainly be fatal. This multiplicity of parallel pathways and side-effects illustrates why attempts to postpone aging by “cleaning up” metabolism will surely fail for the foreseeable future: we simply understand metabolism too poorly. This has led me to pursue the alternative, “repair and maintenance” approach that sidesteps our ignorance of metabolism and may be feasible relatively soon.</ab>

        <ab>Older people constitute one of the highest risk groups for suicide. Existing research in this area has been largely dominated by a risk factor approach. This is of limited usefulness since only a minority of those at risk go on to make an attempt. Therefore, prediction, prevention and the management of risk remain challenging. The present study aimed to capture the subjective experience of older people who had recently made a suicide attempt through exploring their understanding of the pathway to and from this attempt, within the context of ageing. Fifteen participants were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Three broad themes emerged—Struggle (experiencing life as a struggle before and after the attempt, and in relation to growing older), Control (trying to maintain control over life before the attempt, and following it either failing or succeeding to regain control) and Visibility (feeling invisible or disconnected from others and trying to fight against this before the attempt and either becoming more or less connected afterwards). Risk factors identified in the literature were often absent or construed by participants as not relevant to their attempt. Individual accounts highlight the diversity and complexity of experience of older people who attempt suicide.</ab>

        <ab>This study explored medical conditions associated with mortality among veterans following transfemoral amputation, transtibial amputation, or hip disarticulation. We applied logistic regression models to identify clinical factors associated with mortality postoperatively. The participants included patients with lower-limb amputations (n = 2,375) who were discharged from Veterans Health Administration hospitals between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003. Most (98.9%) were male. We measured cumulative in-hospital, 3-month, and 1-year mortality. The results were 180 in-hospital deaths, 368 by 3 months, and 634 by the 1-year postsurgical amputation date. Those who had perioperative systemic sepsis (odds ratio = 4.28, 95% confidence interval = 2.87--6.39) had more than a fourfold increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality. Congestive heart failure, renal failure, and liver disease were significantly associated with mortality at all time periods. Metastatic cancer was associated only at 3 months and 1 year. We concluded that high medical complexity and mortality rates attest to the need for careful medical oversight during the postacute rehabilitation period.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing nurses to meet the care needs of an expanding aging population is a challenge for nursing. Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current vacancies. This article describes the integration of long-term care experiences into senior year community health practicums and reports on a qualitative analysis to evaluate the project's impact on student attitudes and intentions toward geriatric nursing roles.</ab>

        <ab>Background The changing oral health status and the increasing complexity of dental needs for older Australians highlights the importance of oral healthcare within the residential aged care setting. The increasing incidence of oral disease and conditions in older adults is related to higher levels of oral functional dependence, physical frailty, medical conditions, polypharmacy, cognitive impairment and increasing dependence on carers. Objectives The Compliance with Best Practice in Oral Health Project was designed to identify issues in relation to oral healthcare and to identify that evidence-based best practice was demonstrated within the organisation's existing policies and procedures. Evidence-based best practice recommendations were based on the systematic evidence review ‘ oral hygiene care for adults with dementia in residential aged care’ developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results Four aged care facilities participated in the project. In the pre-audit, compliance was achieved in one of the six evidence-based criteria. A plan was implemented to improve compliance with three of the remaining five criteria within a 4-week time frame. Post-audit results indicated an improvement in compliance with evidence-based best practice. Conclusion The Compliance with Best Practice in Oral Health Project provided an opportunity to review and update existing organisational clinical care policies with evidence-based best practice recommendations and highlighted the importance of developing local clinical care leadership at the residential site.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this review is to critically synthesize the existing literature on family involvement in residential long-term care. Studies that examined family involvement in various long-term care venues were identified through extensive searches of the literature. Future research and practice must consider the complexity of family structure, adopt longitudinal designs, provide direct empirical links between family involvement and resident outcomes, and offer rigorous evaluation of interventions in order to refine the literature.</ab>

        <ab>Scand J Caring Sci; 2005; 19; 53–57Family, caring and ageing in the United KingdomThis paper provides a critical exploration of the assumptions and narratives underpinning the development of social policy initiatives targeting caring relationships based upon family ties. Using a narrative approach attention is drawn to the ways in which family identities are open to a far greater range of negotiation than is assumed by policy. Drawing on the United Kingdom as a case example, questions are posed about intergenerational relations and the nature of late life citizenship. The comparatively recent invention of narratives supporting‘informal care’ and the link with neo-liberal and‘third way’ notions of active citizenship are explored. As is the failure of policy developments to take into account the diversity of care giving styles and the complexity of caring relationships. It is argued that the uneven and locally specific ways in which policy develops enables the co-existence of a complex range of narratives about family, caring and ageing which address diverse aspects of the family life of older people in often contradictory ways.</ab>

        <ab>To expand the ability to assess physical frailty by developing a Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty (CGIC-PF) instrument. Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. Academic centers. Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less. The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.</ab>

        <ab>Through the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Technology for Successful Aging (RERC-Tech-Aging) elder perspectives on cell phone designs and features were explored. Six-hundred and sixty-five participants (596 elders with disabilities, 69 adults with disabilities) from Northern Florida, Southern California, and Western New York were surveyed through face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, or mailed surveys. The survey addressed satisfaction, importance, frequency of use, methods for learning, barriers to use, views on features, and ways the cell phone had helped. The majority of elders (60%) valued their cell phone, and a large proportion (87%) use the cell phone for emergencies. Only one third of elders reported using their cell phone daily. Suggestions for improving phone design included increasing button size (50% of subjects), increasing display size (29% of subjects), increasing overall size of the cell phone (24% subjects), and decreasing the complexity of the phone.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last two decades we have seen an increased interest in informal care within both political and academic communities in the UK. This has stemmed in large part from an increased emphasis on the home-space as the preferred site of care provision and a resultant increase in the complexity of the care-giving relationship. The explicitly spatial dimensions of this caring relationship, however, are vastly under-researched. This paper represents one attempt to redress the gap by examining the importance of place, and its conceptualization, in the care of frail older people. In doing so, the paper focuses, firstly, on the spatial manifestation of care at various scales, identifying some of the processes behind variations in the care-giving experience and, secondly, using the example of dementia care, it considers how Augé's concepts of anthropological place and non-space, when applied to domestic and institutional care settings, can facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the importance of people and place in the construction and delivery of care to frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional interdisciplinary diagnostic process focused on determining a frail elderly person’s medical, psychological, and functional capabilities in order to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and long-term follow-up. Geriatrics interventions building on CGA are defined from their historical emergence to the present day in a discussion of their complexity, goals and normative components. Through literature review, questions of the effectiveness and costs of these interventions are addressed. Evidence of effectiveness is derived from individual trials and, particularly, recent systematic reviews. While the trial evidence lends support to the proposition that geriatric interventions can be effective, the results have not been uniform. Review of meta-regression studies suggests that much of this outcome variability is related to identifiable program design parameters. In particular, targeting the frail, an interdisciplinary team structure with clinical control of care, and long-term follow-up, tend to be associated with effective programs. Answers to cost-effectiveness questions also vary and are more rare. With some exceptions, existing evidence as exists suggest that geriatrics interventions can be effective without raising total costs of care. Despite the attention given to these questions in recent years, there is still much room for clinical and scientific advance as we move to better understand what CGA interventions do well and in whom.</ab>

        <ab>The high burden of illness and frailty common among our growing population of older adults often results in fragmentation of care across providers and health care systems, increasing the complexity and costs of caring for these patients. Information technology offers one way to meet this challenge. Scientists at the Regenstrief Institute have more than a quarter-century of experience in using medical informatics to support clinicians in the day-to-day care of older adults. Their research has progressed through several evolutionary cycles, beginning with the acquisition of relevant data and moving to studies of the most efficient and effective mechanisms that bring information to bear at the time of clinical decision making. Information technology designed with the input of the end user has the greatest promise of changing provider behavior because it balances technological challenges with the cultural context of the practice environment. One topic of active research is information technology to support transitions of care among sites and providers. These transitions place older adults at increased risk for avoidable illness, death, and health care costs. Information systems that improve communication among providers during these transitions have the potential to improve safety and reduce costs.</ab>

        <ab>Due to the ageing of the population and the sharp increase in life expectancy, cancer in the older person has become an increasingly common problem in the Western world. Although several authors have stressed that elderly cancer patients deserve special attention as a target group for research efforts, older aged patients are still less likely to be offered participation in clinical trials. The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the physiological process of ageing and senescence are far from understood, although inflammation is likely to play an important role, at least in some cancers. In addition, the relationship between ageing and cancer risk is also far from understood. One of the most intriguing aspects of ageing is how different the ageing process is from person to person; the basis for this variation is largely unknown. Population-based studies and longitudinal surveys have shown that comorbidity and physical and mental functioning are important risk factors; thus, a meaningful assessment of comorbidity and disability should be implemented in clinical practice. Modern geriatrics is targeted towards patients with multiple problems. Such patients are not simply old, but are geriatric patients because of interacting psychosocial and physical problems. As a consequence, the health status of old persons cannot be evaluated by merely describing the single disease, and/or by measuring the response, or survival after treatment. Conversely, it is necessary to conduct a more comprehensive investigation of the ‘functional status’ of the aged person. A geriatric consultation provides a variety of relevant information and enables the healthcare team to manage the complexity of health care in the elderly; this process is referred to as the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). The use of CGA is now being introduced into oncological practice. The definition of frailty is still controversial and represents a major issue of debate in clinical geriatrics. As the frail population increases, clinical trials in frail persons are needed. The usefulness of these trials requires a consensus as to the definition of frailty. Clearly, the management of older persons with cancer requires the acquisition of special skills in the evaluation of the older person and in the recognition and management of emergencies as well as experience in geriatric case management.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The biological basis of frailty has been difficult to establish owing to the lack of a standard definition, its complexity, and its frequent coexistence with illness. Objective: To establish the biological correlates of frailty in the presence and absence of concurrent cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Methods: Participants were 4735 community-dwelling adults 65 years and older. Frail, intermediate, and nonfrail subjects were identified by a validated screening tool and exclusion criteria. Bivariate relationships between frailty level and physiological measures were evaluated by Pearson χ² tests for categorical variables and analysis of variance F tests for continuous variables. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate multivariable relationships between frailty status and physiological measures. Results: Of 4735 Cardiovascular Health Study participants, 299 (6.3%) were identified as frail, 2147 (45.3%) as intermediate, and 2289 (48.3%) as not frail. Frail vs nonfrail participants had increased mean ± SD levels of C-reactive protein (5.5 ± 9.8 vs 2.7 ± 4.0 mg/L), factor VIII (13790 ± 4480 vs 11860 ± 3460 mg/dL), and, in a smaller subset, D dimer (647 ± 1033 vs 224 ± 258 ng/mL) (P ≤ .001 for all, χ² test for trend). These differences persisted when individuals with cardiovascular disease and diabetes were excluded and after adjustment for age, sex, and race. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that there is a specific physiological basis to the geriatric syndrome of frailty that is characterized in part by increased inflammation and elevated markers of blood clotting and that these physiological differences persist when those with diabetes and cardiovascular disease are excluded.</ab>

        <ab>The introduction of new asset/income tested charges for high care residents was the 1997–98 Commonwealth government policy response to concerns about financing residential aged care. This in-depth study of residents, families, staff and managers in three aged care facilities explores issues of equity, access and empowerment arising when some residents pay more for the same level of care and amenity. The study reports little evidence of financial contributions affecting access to high care places and the delivery of care, the potential for differential access to amenities such as single rooms linked to the extra payments, and no evidence of a sense of empowerment linked to payment of the new charges. The complexity of current financial arrangements, access to appropriate financial advice at the time of entry, and the potential for an informal two tier system in relation to the allocation of amenities are identified as developing policy issues.</ab>

        <ab>Each of the fields of geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice intensifies the usefulness and effectiveness of the other. Combining geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice also magnifies the complexity of two singularly complex fields. However, the subtle reasons for their complexity may escape the understanding of clinicians, educators, policy makers, and administrators. Attempting to treat older patients who have complex problems while ignoring common principles of geriatrics and teamwork can cause a kind of double jeopardy. It can potentially harm the patient and decrease the provider's sense of mastery. Training either students or health care providers to appreciate the interactions and the complexities of these two fields could produce a double indemnity for the health care system and for older persons who need health care. It requires recognizing subtle factors like the barrier of presumed knowledge, the interpretation of the meaning of function, frailty, the lure of medical technology, professional hierarchies, diverse views of disease, and the myth of insufficient evidence.</ab>

        <ab>Under basal resting conditions most healthy physiologic systems demonstrate highly irregular, complex dynamics that represent interacting regulatory processes operating over multiple time scales. These processes prime the organism for an adaptive response, making it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given set of boundary conditions, most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively short periods of time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response mode, which is denoted "reactive tuning." Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in resting dynamics and maladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline and frailty. Nonlinear mathematical techniques that quantify physiologic dynamics may predict the onset of frailty, and interventions aimed toward restoring healthy dynamics may prevent functional decline.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of a participatory community-based prevention program against injuries among the elderly. A population-based quasi-experimental design was used with pre- and post-implementation measurements in an intervention and a control area. The program was based on cross-sectoral participation in detecting and taking action against injuries among the elderly. Change in the relative risk of injury was estimated by the odds ratio. Morbidity in moderately (AIS 2) severe injury in the study area was reduced from 46 per 1000 population years to 25 per 1000 population years (odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.46–0.65), while the minor (AIS 1) injuries increased (odds ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval 1.21–1.91). The risk of severe or fatal (AIS 3–6) injuries remained constant. In the study area, only a slight decrease in the total morbidity rate was observed (odds ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.77–0.99). In the control area, there was no evident change in the total morbidity rates. Falls decreased or showed a tendency to decrease in the age groups 65 to 79-y-old in the study area, while they increased in the older age group. The results indicate that no sharp boundaries should be drawn between safety education, physical conditioning, environmental adjustments and secondary prevention measures when planning safety promotion among the elderly. Future studies should address these issues along with the methodological complexity associated with assessment of participatory community-based safety promotion programs.Public Health (2001) 115, 308–316.</ab>

        <ab>Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in monitoring some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer perceptions and experiences of services and involvement of users/carers in assessment and review. Using data from the study Evaluating Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales receiving community care services, this investigation examines three crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction. This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need to...</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT: To study the complex phenomenon of home care utilization, most researchers have conducted epidemiologic tests of the Andersen model. Understanding any complex phenomenon requires attention to these problems: (1) identifying the phenomenon's parts, (2) determining relationships among the parts, and (3) identifying changes in the phenomenon. Focused on population risk factors rather than individual behaviors, epidemiologic tests of the Andersen model have not yielded an empirically valid construct of home care need (a critical "part" of the phenomenon). Tests of relationships among such constructs have not produced conclusive predictions of use. Analyzing changes in use has been thwarted in part because prospective longitudinal designs have seldom been employed. Employing these basic arguments, this critique of the epidemiologic study of home care utilization is presented as a rationale for descriptive phenomenological study of the experience of home care. A phenomenological perspective on the three problems of complexity is discussed, as it is being implemented in a study of older widows' experience of home care.</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT: Friendship is not institutionalized in American society; hence, perceptions of it vary. Rather than studying sources of this variation, most scholars ignore the complexity, bemoan the difficulty it causes in analysis, or eliminate it. We examined the frequency of use of previously studied and emergent characteristics of friendship as definitional criteria and the age, gender, and cultural patterns associated with them. Data are from two North American cities: the Andrus Study of Older Adult Friendships in southeastern United States (28 women and 25 men, age 55 to 84), and the Social Relations Project in western Canada (39 women and 25 men, age 55 to 87). Definitions o f friendship differed across age and gender groups within each culture, but most striking is cross-cultural variation.</ab>

        <ab>The transition from curative to palliative care for elderly patients with cancer-related asthenia presents complex challenges to oncologists. A result of this complexity is a lack of regard for the maintenance of physical and mental function. This study examined the effects of comprehensive, multidisciplinary, inpatient rehabilitation on the physical and mental function of elderly cancer patients with asthenia. We found that both physical and mental function improved following inpatient rehabilitation. However, it is difficult to predict which patients benefit most from rehabilitation. Nevertheless, functional improvement following rehabilitation may allow medical caregivers to better distribute the type and intensity of care, and reduce the caregiver burden experienced by family members in the home.</ab>

        <ab>Using Kinds of Love by May Sarton in gerontology classes as a text for studying human development affords an opportunity to explore theory and research on aging. The story takes place in a small New England town through one year: fall to summer. The plot involves daily events in the lives of several characters who represent various ages and psychosocial development. The tasks of adolescence, middle age, and old age are eloquently described in the motivation and experience of Sarton's characters. Youth, middle - aged, and elders play out their lives, but it is the elder characters who represent the richest opportunity to examine the struggle for integrity, inner life, gender shift, and meaning. As a text for the study of gerontology from a human development perspective, Kinds of Love demonstrates the sweep of growth and change that are made up in intricate day - to - day tasks, decisions, and quiet ruminations. The narrative, complexity of characters, and environmental context illuminate an array of developmental movements. When analyzed within Eriksonian, constructive developmental, and relational frameworks, the novel allows readers to study the nature of human change over time. This article explores psychosocial theory and research which are found in classroom reading of Kinds of Love by May Sarton.</ab>

        <ab>Little attention has been given to the ethical dimensions of social work practice in the growing field of home health care. This descriptive, exploratory study examined the influence of frail elders' cognitive status, safety, and caregiver burden on social workers' support for autonomy. The major findings of this study were that all three factors were significantly related to support for autonomy. Especially important was the emergence of a ranking of the relative importance of these three factors in social workers' decision making: the first factor considered was cognitive status, the second was safety, and the third was caregiver burden.</ab>

        <ab>This article discusses factors that affect the participation of ethnic and racial minority elders in the political process, underscoring the heterogeneity of the minority elder population and stressing that policies must reflect that complexity. Older persons in the United States are a formidable political force, whether measured by registration and voting rates, proliferation of old-age organizations, or presence of silver-haired legislatures. But what about elderly members of minority populations?By most account, minority elders do not enjoy political visibility, are not a major component of the membership base making up the national aging organizations, and have limited electoral ability at the local and state level. The minority population is aging. The benefits of improved public health measures in this country and the increased longevity enjoyed by young immigrant groups mean that they, too, will see major increases in the proportion of persons considered senior citizens. In this country, those who are dependent upon social services must have effective political advocates and they must learn to maneuver through the social services system. Factors like the "youth culture" orientation from the early sixties, the coming of age of the minority baby boom generation, and the changes in families being experienced by minority communities have combined to erode the status of the respected elders in culturally diverse communities. The effects of assimilation and acculturation are important indicators in understanding the past and future potential of minority elders to be political players.</ab>
