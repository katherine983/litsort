        <ab>Background: Facial skin cancer lesions in close proximity to critical organs require further development of radiotherapeutic techniques for highly conformal treatment, especially when treating elderly frail patients. We report on our treatment technique and first clinical experience for patients with perinasal/periorbital skin cancer treated with individualized epithetic mold high‐dose‐rate brachytherapy (BRT). Methods: From January 2019, patients with complex shaped or unfavorably located skin cancer not eligible for surgery or external beam radiotherapy (RT) were screened for mold‐based BRT. Six patients were identified. Toxicity and clinical response were documented during therapy and posttreatment follow‐up. Results: Median patient age was 80 years (74–92 years). Median prescription dose was 42 Gy (range, 33–44 Gy) delivered in once‐daily fractions of 3 or 4 Gy. Two patients had treatment interruptions caused by acute conjunctivitis grade 2 and a nontreatment‐related cardiac event, respectively. At a median follow‐up of 335 days (96–628 days), no ≥ grade 2 late toxicity was documented with all patients showing complete clinical response. Conclusions: High‐dose‐rate BRT with individualized epithetic molds for perinasal/periorbital skin cancer is a well‐tolerated and safe treatment option for patients not eligible for primary surgery or definitive external beam RT because of comorbidities or tumor location.</ab>

        <ab>Background/Objectives: The number of older adults with complex health needs is growing, and this population experiences disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Interventions led by community health workers (CHWs) can improve clinical outcomes in the general adult population with multimorbidity, but few studies have investigated CHW‐delivered interventions in older adults. Design: We systematically reviewed the impact of CHW interventions on health outcomes among older adults with complex health needs. We searched for English‐language articles from database inception through April 2020 using seven databases. PROSPERO protocol registration CRD42019118761. Setting: Any U.S. or international setting, including clinical and community‐based settings. Participants: Adults aged 60 years or older with complex health needs, defined in this review as multimorbidity, frailty, disability, or high‐utilization. Interventions: Interventions led by a CHW or similar role consistent with the American Public Health Association's definition of CHWs. Measurements: Pre‐defined health outcomes (chronic disease measures, general health measures, treatment adherence, quality of life, or functional measures) as well as qualitative findings. Results: Of 5671 unique records, nine studies met eligibility criteria, including four randomized controlled trials, three quasi‐experimental studies, and two qualitative studies. Target population and intervention characteristics were variable, and studies were generally of low‐to‐moderate methodological quality. Outcomes included mood, functional status and disability, social support, well‐being and quality of life, medication knowledge, and certain health conditions (e.g., falls, cognition). Results were mixed with several studies demonstrating significant effects on mood and function, including one high‐quality RCT, while others noted no significant intervention effects on outcomes. Conclusion: CHW‐led interventions may have benefit for older adults with complex health needs, but additional high‐quality studies are needed to definitively determine the effectiveness of CHW interventions in this population. Integration of CHWs into geriatric clinical settings may be a strategy to deliver evidence‐based interventions and improve clinical outcomes in complex older adults.

        <ab>This study explores the experiences and perceptions of recovery in elderly patients who had sustained a proximal humerus fracture. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 patients over the age of 65. Thematic analysis identified aspects of care that impacted upon patient experience and quality of life. Seven main patient-reported themes were identified, including pain, sleep, shoulder function, emotional state, social support, relationship with their professional and experience of healthcare institution. These themes offer insight into the experiences of adults receiving care for proximal humerus fracture and highlight that existing quantitative measures of quality of life do not measure domains that are important to patients.</ab>

        <ab>Moreover, comorbidities and comedication could contribute to these patient preferences in those aiming to reduce medication use.8 Therefore, assessment of individual patient characteristics, QoL impact, treatment goals and preferences could facilitate decision making. Dear Editor, Psoriasis management in the rapidly expanding geriatric population can be complex owing to frailty, comorbidities, comedication and limited available data on treating older patients with psoriasis.1 Previous studies reported comparable disease severity in patients aged &gt;= 65 years and patients aged &lt; 65 years,2-4 although prescribed antipsoriatic therapies differed between age groups.2,3,5 This might be due to comorbidities and comedication, and/or disease perception or patient preferences.3,5 Unfortunately, little is known regarding these topics in older patients with psoriasis.</ab>

        <ab>As human beings age, they become weak, fragile, and feeble. It is a slowly progressing yet complex syndrome in which old age or some disabilities are not prerequisites; neither does loss of human parts lead to frailty among the physically fit older persons. This paper aims to describe the influences of transhumanist perspectives on human‐technology enhancements and replacements in the transcendence of human frailties, including those of older persons, in which technology is projected to deliver solutions toward transcending these frailties. Through technologies including genetic screening and other technological manipulations, intelligent machines and augmented humans improve, maintain, and remedy human‐linked susceptibilities. Furthermore, other technologies replace parts fabricated through inorganic‐mechanical processes such as 3D‐printing. Advancing technologies are reaching the summit of technological sophistication contributing to the transhumanist views of being human in a technological world. Technologies enhance the transcendence of human frailties as essential expressions of the symbiosis between human beings and technology in a transcendental world.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Frailty is an increasingly recognised concept, with 25–50% of over 85’s estimated to be frail1,. Previous research considered medical students’ attitudes towards older people2, yet despite the correlation between frailty and increased age3, little is known about attitudes of healthcare professionals towards frailty. We researched attitudes towards, and understanding of, frailty in undergraduate and postgraduate trainees, with a view to guiding future educational interventions. Method: Approval was granted by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHCT) Research and Development department, Newcastle University’s Research Management Group and the HRA. 3 cohorts were recruited; 3rd year Newcastle University MBBS Students, 5th year Newcastle University MBBS Students and Foundation Year 2 and Core Medical Trainees working for NHCT (junior doctors). Data was collected during scheduled teaching at NHCT and individuals were invited to participate via email prior to this. Those not participating were still required to attend the teaching. Participants provided written consent. Within each cohort, small group discussions around frailty and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) were prompted using open questions (e.g. “what does frailty mean to you?”), during which participants anonymously submitted phrases to an online word-cloud generator. Discussions were audio recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions and word-clouds were analysed using Simple Content Analysis. The overarching themes within each cohort were identified and compared with other cohorts. Interpretations were reviewed by an independent researcher to enhance rigour. Results: Each cohort associated frailty with older age and weakness, and often used it as a byword for complexity. Frailty was described as an abstract construct composed of personal experiences rather than an objectively defined descriptor. All associated it with negative emotions. Cohorts differed in their approach, with 3rd year students primarily focussed on defining frailty, whereas junior doctors prioritised the clinical challenges it presented. Junior doctors demonstrated limited understanding of CGA whilst undergraduate students were almost universally ignorant of it. Conclusions: The lack of understanding around frailty and CGA is concerning given its high prevalence.The identification of negative emotions increases this concern. To challenge this, focussed educational interventions addressing understanding and attitudes ought to be developed for tomorrow’s doctors.</ab>

        <ab>Background: An increasing number of elderly patients are presenting for elective surgery. Pre‐operative risk assessment in this population is inexact due to the complex interplay between age, comorbidity and functional status. Frailty assessment may provide a surrogate measure of a patient's physiological reserve and aid operative decision‐making. The aim of this study is to determine the association between pre‐operative frailty, as assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale, and post‐operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. Methods: A prospective analysis of 86 patients over the age of 65 undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery at a tertiary centre between October 2017 and October 2018 was performed. Frailty assessment was conducted pre‐operatively using the Edmonton Frail Scale. Primary outcomes included length of stay and post‐operative complication rates. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the influence of frailty on post‐operative outcomes including mortality, prolonged hospital admission, complication rates and quality of life. Results: Of 86 patients, 12 (14.0%) were identified as frail. Frailty was associated with a significantly increased median length of stay (20 days versus 6 days, incidence rate ratio 2.83, P &lt; 0.01) and a significantly increased risk of major post‐operative complications (50.0% versus 6.7%, odds ratio 13.8, P &lt; 0.01). Frailty was not associated with a significant reduction in quality of life scores at 30 and 90 days post‐operatively. Conclusion: Frailty is associated with adverse post‐operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. Frailty assessment is an important component of pre‐operative risk assessment and may identify targets for pre‐operative optimisation.</ab>

        <ab>Early intervention on frailty can help prevent or delay functional decline and onset of dependency. Community nurses encounter patients with frailty routinely and have opportunities to influence frailty trajectories for individuals and their carers. This study aimed to understand nurses' perceptions of frailty in a community setting and their needs for education on its assessment and management. Using an exploratory qualitative design we conducted focus groups in one Health Board in Scotland. Thematic content analysis of data was facilitated by NVivo© software. A total of 18 nurses described the meaning of frailty as vulnerability, loss and complex comorbidity and identified processes of caring for people with frailty. They identified existing educational needs necessary to support their current efforts to build capability through existing adversities. Our study indicates that current practice is largely reactive, influenced by professional judgement and intuition, with little systematic frailty-specific screening and assessment.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Exacerbation of or new onset orthostatic hypotension in perioperative patients can occur. There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery. The implications for post‐operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of post‐operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre‐operative orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: Supine and 1‐minute and 3‐minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post‐operative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20 mmHg or more and/or 10 mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within ~3 minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Whilst all patients included had a 1‐minute standing blood pressure assessment (N = 170), 3‐minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). Nevertheless, one‐quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre‐operative orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65 years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores. The COVID‐19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to surgery within the planned study timescale (N = 143/170; 84.1%). Nevertheless, patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital post‐operatively and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness and/or dizziness documented (un‐prompted) in their notes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with orthostatic hypotension. These risks are not confined to those with a pre‐existing dysautonomia diagnosis.</ab>

        <ab>The care home sector relies on nurses and care workers to deliver care to residents living with frailty and complex needs. However, attracting, recruiting and retaining staff is one of the biggest challenges facing this sector. There is evidence available that describes factors that influence staff decisions to join and/or remain in the care home workforce, for example, individual rewards (such as feeling valued at work or training opportunities), relationships with colleagues and residents, supportive management or working arrangements (including flexible hours). However, it is less clear how different strategies are informed by evidence to improve recruitment and retention. Care homes are heterogeneous in terms of their size, staffing levels and mix, staff age groups, geographical location and working conditions. What matters to different members of the care home workforce will vary across nurses and care workers of different ages and levels of qualification or experience. Recognising this diversity is key: understanding how to attract, recruit and retain staff needs to discriminate and offer solutions that address this diversity. This important area of practice does not lend itself to a 'one-approach-fits-all' solution. This commentary provides a brief overview of known workforce challenges for the care home sector and argues for studies that use empirical evidence to test different theories of what might work for different staff, how and why, and in different circumstances.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Optimizing the approach to older adults with cancer is now a priority given the increasing frequency of new cancer diagnoses that are made in the older population. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the gold‐standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of frail older persons, and (3) designing person‐tailored interventions. Materials and methods: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach to older patients with cancer. Results and discussion: A widespread use of this standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>We describe the findings of a qualitative longitudinal interview study of a group of initially community-dwelling frail older people, and their informal and formal carers. We used a narrative approach to explore the role that narrative may have for people living with frailty. This has been less explored comparative to the experiences of those living with chronic illness. The frail older people told stories of their experiences that revealed three distinct shapes or typologies. These were either stable, unbalancing or overwhelmed, and related to how the person managed to adapt to increasing challenges and losses, and to reintegrate their sense of self into a cohesive narrative. Each is illustrated by an individual case story. Frailty is described as both biographically anticipated yet potentially biographically disruptive as older people may struggle to make sense of their circumstances without a clear single causative factor. Findings are discussed in relation to biographical disruption and reconstruction in chronic illness and the rhetoric around 'successful ageing'. We conclude by drawing attention to the complex individual and social factors that contribute to the experience of living with frailty in later life.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Non‐esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) play central roles in the relationship between adiposity and glucose metabolism, and they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, but few studies have assessed their effects on complex geriatric syndromes like frailty that cross multiple organ systems. We sought to determine the relationships between NEFAs and incident frailty, disability, and mobility limitation in a population‐based cohort of older persons. METHODS: We analyzed 4,710 Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants who underwent measurement of circulating total fasting NEFAs in 1992–1993 and were assessed for frailty in 1996–1997 and for disability and mobility limitation annually. We used ordinal logistic regression to model incident frailty, linear regression to model components of frailty, and Cox regression to model disability and mobility limitation in relation to baseline NEFAs. To ensure proportional hazards, we truncated follow‐up at 9 years for disability and 6.5 years for mobility limitation. RESULTS: A total of 42 participants became frail and 510 became pre‐frail over a 4‐year period, and we documented 1,720 cases of disability and 1,225 cases of mobility limitation during follow‐up. NEFAs were positively associated in a dose‐dependent manner with higher risks of incident frailty, disability, and mobility limitation. The adjusted odds ratios for frailty were 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.86; P =.04) across extreme tertiles and 1.17 (95% CI = 1.03–1.33; P =.01) per standard deviation increment. The corresponding hazard ratios for incident disability were 1.14 (95% CI = 1.01–1.30; P =.04) and 1.11 (95% CI = 1.06–1.17; P &lt;.0001); those for incident mobility limitation were 1.23 (95% CI = 1.06–1.43; P =.006) and 1.15 (95% CI = 1.08–1.22; P &lt;.0001). Results were largely consistent among both men and women. Among individual components of frailty, NEFAs were significantly associated with self‐reported exhaustion (β =.07; standard error =.03; P =.02). CONCLUSION: Circulating NEFAs are significantly associated with frailty, disability, and mobility limitation among older adults. These results highlight the broad spectrum of adverse health issues associated with NEFA in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Increasing numbers of frail elderly people living at home but dependent on supportive care will face complex oral health challenges. Objectives: To investigate the associations of frailty status with oral cleaning habits and oral hygiene taking into account the effects of preventive oral health intervention among home care clients aged 75 or over. Methods: Data were gathered by interviews and clinical oral examinations at baseline and after a 6‐month follow‐up. Frailty status was evaluated at baseline using the abbreviated comprehensive geriatric assessment (aCGA) scale, which consists of 15 questions from three different domains: cognitive status, functional status and depression. A total of 231 home care clients completed the aCGA at baseline and the interview and clinical oral examination both at baseline and after the follow‐up. Results: Using the aCGA classification with at least one score in the ≥2 domain, 62% of clients were classified as frail at baseline. They had poorer oral cleaning habits and hygiene, and they had lost more teeth than nonfrail participants. Multivariate analysis showed that being frail at baseline was statistically significantly associated with a lower frequency of toothbrushing and denture cleaning (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1–0.9 and OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1–0.8) at baseline, but not after the follow‐up. Membership in the intervention group was associated with better oral cleaning at the follow‐up. However, among the frail participants, toothbrushing frequency was still significantly lower and oral hygiene poorer than among the nonfrail group. Conclusions: Oral cleaning habits of frail elderly people were slightly improved as a result of external support, which had a positive effect on oral hygiene. Individual preventive actions in the context of oral health and hygiene should be integrated into the daily care plan of home care clients with the first signs of frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Why you should read this article: • To recognise that identifying frailty is important to support older people living with complex needs • To be aware that a frailty screening and assessment tool should be used that is most appropriate for the clinician's service • To understand that collaborative working can improve care and reduce hospital admissions for older people living with frailty Identifying frailty is essential to support older people living with complex health and social care needs. This article discusses how a Florence Nightingale Foundation travel scholar used her scholarship to explore best practice in identifying frailty in acute and community settings in Scotland with the aim of developing services for people living with frailty locally and regionally in England. As the move to integrated care services develops in England, valuable insights from Scotland will assist in the proactive design of bespoke services around the needs of individuals in the community and, when acutely unwell, in the hospital setting.</ab>

        <ab>The number of older people living with complex health conditions is increasing, with the majority of these managed in primary and community settings. Many models of care have been developed to support them, however, there is mixed evidence on their value and they include multiple overlapping components. We aimed to synthesise the evidence to learn what works for managing complex conditions in older people in primary and community care. We carried out a state‐of‐the‐art review of systematic reviews. We searched three databases (January 2009 to July 2019) for models of primary and community care for long‐term conditions, frailty, multimorbidity and complex neurological conditions common to older people such as dementia. We narratively synthesised review findings to summarise the evidence for each model type and identify components which influenced effectiveness. Out of 2,129 unique titles and abstracts, 178 full texts were reviewed and 54 systematic reviews were included. We found that the models of care were more likely to improve depressive symptoms and mental health outcomes than physical health or service use outcomes. Interventions including self‐management, patient education, assessment with follow‐up care procedures, and structured care processes or pathways had greater evidence of effectiveness. The level of healthcare service integration appeared to be more important than inclusion of specific professional types within a team. However, more experienced and qualified nurses were associated with better outcomes. These conclusions are limited by the overlap between reviews, reliance on vote counting within some included reviews and the quality of study reports. In conclusion, primary and community care interventions for complex conditions in older people should include: (a) clear intervention targets; (b) explicit theoretical underpinnings; and (c) elements of self‐management and patient education, structured collaboration between healthcare professionals and professional support. Further work needs to determine the optimal intensity, length, team composition and role of technology in interventions.</ab>

        <ab>This is the first article in a six-part series in Nursing Older People exploring the nursing care of people living with advanced dementia. This article discusses the changes that may occur as dementia progresses, from the perspective of the individual, their family and other carers. A person living with advanced dementia is likely to experience physical, cognitive and social changes that can be profound and debilitating. Healthcare needs intensify as new and co-existing issues result in increasing dependency on others for support with activities of daily living. These activities can include eating, drinking, mobility and personal care. Consequently, family carers may find their role has to develop and change to provide increasing support in response to these complex needs. These increasing needs can result in care transitions to hospitals or care homes. Careful and collaborative management of care is crucial to maintain quality of life for the person with dementia and family carers.</ab>

        <ab>The past three decades have seen a steady increase in the availability of routinely collected health and social care data and the processing power to analyse it. These developments represent a major opportunity for ageing research, especially with the integration of different datasets across traditional boundaries of health and social care, for prognostic research and novel evaluations of interventions with representative populations of older people. However, there are considerable challenges in using routine data at the level of coding, data analysis and in the application of findings to everyday care. New Horizons in applying routine data to investigate novel questions in ageing research require a collaborative approach between clinicians, data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and trial methodologists. This requires building capacity for the next generation of research leaders in this important area. There is a need to develop consensus code lists and standardised, validated algorithms for common conditions and outcomes that are relevant for older people to maximise the potential of routine data research in this group. Lastly, we must help drive the application of routine data to improve the care of older people, through the development of novel methods for evaluation of interventions using routine data infrastructure. We believe that harnessing routine data can help address knowledge gaps for older people living with multiple conditions and frailty, and design interventions and pathways of care to address the complex health issues we face in caring for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults who experience challenges related to mental health are unlikely to seek professional help. The voices of older adults who have navigated through mental health issues and systems of care to arrive at psychological treatment are less well understood. We conducted individual interviews with 15 adults aged 61 to 86 who sought psychological treatment. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using narrative methods. We identified several main storylines that describe the meaning-making and treatment-seeking journeys of older adults: resistance to being labeled with mental health problems (telling stories of resistance, defining mental health issues in mysterious and uncontrollable terms, and experiencing internal role conflict); muddling through the help-seeking process (manifestations of chaos and system-level barriers); and emotional reactions to psychological treatment (hope, fear, and mistrust). Findings add to the literature base in the area of narrative gerontology, and highlight the complex experiences that older adults face when seeking psychological treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Appetite drives essential oral nutritional intake. Its regulation is complex, influenced by physiology, hedonism (the reward of eating) and learning from external cues within a person's society and culture. Appetite loss is common in the older population and not always attributable to medical conditions or treatment. Although the physiological basis of the anorexia of ageing (loss of appetite due to the ageing process) has been established, the effect of ageing on hedonism and external cues, which may be equally important, is less well understood. The anorexia of ageing is associated with reductions in dietary diversity and oral intake, and increased risk of malnutrition, sarcopenia and frailty. Early identification of poor appetite could allow timely intervention before weight loss occurs. There is no standardised tool for assessing appetite in clinical settings at present but the 4-item Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) has the potential to be used in this way. This review, designed for clinicians, will discuss the regulation of appetite and the pathogenesis of the anorexia of ageing. It will describe the current evidence for interventions to manage the anorexia of ageing, which is limited, with little benefit reported from individual studies of education, physical activity and medication. There is some positive evidence for flavour enhancement, fortified food and oral nutritional supplements but mainly within single studies. Looking ahead, the aim is to develop multicomponent approaches to the treatment of the anorexia of ageing based on growing understanding of the role of physiological signalling, hedonism and external cues.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives People with dementia become increasingly dependent on others for care as cognition declines. Decision making about placement of people with dementia into long-term institutional care can be emotionally complex. The objective of this review is to describe experiences and perspectives of people with dementia and their family caregivers in making decisions about institutional care placement. Research Design and Methods MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched from inception to August 2018. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze results. Results We included 42 studies involving 123 people with dementia and 705 family caregivers from 12 countries. We identified five themes: ensuring safety (avoiding injury due to frailty, protecting against dangerous behaviors, preventing aggressive encounters), reaching breaking point (insufferable burden of caregiving, needs exceeding capabilities, intensifying family conflict, loneliness and isolation, straining under additional responsibilities, making extreme personal sacrifices), vulnerability in lacking support (ill-prepared for crisis, unable to access professional expertise, unpredictable prognostic trajectory, uncertainty navigating health care services, pressured by limited placement opportunities, high cost of placement, resenting loss of autonomy), avoiding guilt of abandonment (sharing accountability, mitigating against disagreement and stigma, reluctance to relinquish caregiving, seeking approval), and seeking reassurance and validation (preserving personhood and former identity, empowerment through engagement, assurance of care quality, acceptance from other care residents). Discussion and Implications People with dementia and family caregivers feel vulnerable, disempowered, and guilty in decision making about institutionalization. Person-centered communication and support strategies that foster confidence and reassurance are needed to assist people with dementia and caregivers to make decisions about placement into long-term institutional care settings.</ab>

        <ab>People living with HIV are ageing with a combination of physical, mental and social health challenges, known as disability. Although rehabilitation can address disability, the field is still emerging. Our aim was to identify similar disability experiences across complex chronic conditions and establish recommendations for future rehabilitation research and practice to advance healthy ageing with HIV. We conducted a consultation with 77 stakeholders from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland with expertise in the fields of rehabilitation and HIV, cancer, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who attended a one-day symposium. We used facilitated discussions to identify how rehabilitation issues in complex chronic disease translate to people ageing with HIV, and prioritised recommendations for future practice and research. Disability issues experienced across HIV and other complex chronic diseases included: (i) frailty, (ii) uncertainty and worrying about the future ageing with complex chronic disease, (iii) mental health, (iv) pain, and (v) stigma. We highlight six recommendations for clinical practice and research to advance healthy ageing with HIV. Opportunities for cross-collaboration exist with other more established areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation. Recommendations can be used to inform future HIV clinical practice and research in this emerging field.</ab>

        <ab>Background Care home residents are increasingly frail with complex health and social care needs. Their transfer to hospital at the end-of-life can be associated with unwanted interventions and distress. However, hospitals do enable provision of care that some residents wish to receive. We aimed to explore the factors that influence hospital admission of care home residents who then died in hospital. Methods This study combined in-depth case note review of care home residents dying in two Scottish teaching hospitals during a 6-month period and semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 26 care home staff and two relatives. Results During the 6-month period, 109 care home residents died in hospital. Most admissions occurred out-of-hours (69%) and most were due to a sudden event or acute change in clinical condition (72%). Length of stay in hospital before death was short, with 42% of deaths occurring within 3 days. Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP) regarding hospital admission was documented in 44%. Care home staff wanted to care for residents who were dying; however, uncertain trajectories of decline, acute events, challenges of ACP, relationship with family and lack of external support impeded this. Conclusions Managing acute changes on the background of uncertain trajectories is challenging in care homes. Enhanced support is required to improve and embed ACP in care homes and to provide rapid, 24 hours-a-day support to manage difficult symptoms and acute changes.</ab>

        <ab>Frailty has recently emerged as a dominant concept against a backdrop of media and governmental narratives that frame the growing ageing population as an economic threat to the current configuration of health care in the United Kingdom (UK). Despite frailty's popularity amongst geriatricians and policy makers, the concept faces resistance from other health-care professionals and older people themselves. This paper draws on the Foucauldian idea of biopower; by suggesting that the contemporary emergence and utilisation of frailty represents a biopolitical practice a number or critical observations are made. First, despite biomedical experts acknowledging ambiguities in the definition of frailty, the concept is presented as a truth discourse. This is driven by the ability of frailty measurements to predict risk of costly adverse outcomes; the capability of frailty scores to enumerate complex needs; and the scientific legitimacy frailty affords to geriatric medicine. Consequently, frailty has become pervasive, knowable and measurable. Second, the routine delineation between frail and robust objectifies older people, and can be said to benefit those making the diagnosis over those being labelled frail, with the latter becoming disempowered. Last, studies show that frailty is associated with increasing wealth inequalities in the UK; however, experts' suggested management of frailty shifts the focus of responsibility away from ideologically driven structural inequalities towards the frail older person, attempting to encourage individuals to modify lifestyle choices. This neglects the association between lifestyle opportunities and socio-economic deprivation, and the impact of long-term poverty on health. These observations, set against the contemporary political climate of economic austerity, cuts to public services and rationalisation of health resources, bring the urgency of a critical consideration of frailty to the fore.</ab>

        <ab>The increasing use of the question, "What matters most to you?" is a welcome development in the effort to provide patient‐centered care. However, it is difficult for clinicians to translate answers to this question into treatment plans for chronic conditions, including recognizing when to consider options other than clinical practice guideline (CPG)–directed therapy. Goal elicitation is most helpful when a patient has different treatment options with clearly identifiable trade‐offs. In the face of trade‐offs, goal elicitation helps patients to prioritize among potentially competing outcomes. While decision aids (DAs) focus on trade‐offs by delineating options and outcomes, the robust outcome data necessary to create DAs for older patients with multimorbidity are often lacking and even mild cognitive impairment makes the use of DAs difficult. The challenges for providing chronic disease care to older patients who are at risk for adverse events from CPG‐directed therapy because of multimorbidity and/or frailty are to organize the complexity of individual combinations of diseases, conditions, and syndromes into common sets of trade‐offs and to identify those goals or priorities that will directly inform a plan of care.

        <ab>Researchers propose that the convoy of care model should be used to study care networks of frail, older individuals. Care convoys are defined as the evolving collection of individuals who may or may not have close personal connections to the recipient or to one another, but who provide care, including help with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), socio-emotional care, skilled health care, monitoring, and advocacy. This study reports on community-dwelling older adults' experiences of their care convoy, how care convoys change over time, and perceived (positive) outcomes. A qualitative analysis among 65 semi-structured interviews with frail, community-dwelling older adults demonstrates a great variety in the composition of care convoys. Participants were often actively involved in their care convoy and valued the social/relational aspect of care. Care and support covered a wide range of activities, with some activities being provided by specific types of caregivers. Participants expressed the adequacy of their care convoy in terms of satisfaction and sufficiency. Noteworthy, participants who were satisfied with their care convoy did not necessarily receive sufficient help. Policies and practice should recognize the relational aspect of care, the complex interplay between all actors, and the dynamic character of care convoys.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Of people admitted to the acute surgical unit (ASU) only 23% of them are aged over 70. However the number of bed days they occupy are disproportionate to this; comprising 48% of the total bed days. The average number of bed days rises exponentially with age, with those aged under 70 averaging less than two days; those aged 80 averaging approximately 4.5 bed days and those aged over 90 approximately 7 bed days. This disparity was recognised and a Medicine for Older People (MOP) liaison team comprising consultant geriatrician and Advanced Clinical Practitioner in Frailty starting working with the acute surgical team in November 2018, initially providing support two days a week, increasing to 5 days in March 2019. Methods: The MOP liaison team meets with the acute surgical team each morning identifying and discussing relevant patients; those identified as living with frailty with associated complexity and uncertainty. This group of patients is then reviewed by the MOP liaison team utilising the principles of the comprehensive geriatric assessment to formulate a person-centred plan. Plans are discussed and coordinated with the surgical, nursing and therapy teams utilising a multi-disciplinary/ multi-professional approach. Results: Length of stay is the main outcome measure and readmissions are monitored. Data on admission length and readmissions was analysed from April 2018 and has continued following commencement of the liaison service. Primary results-Length of stay has reduced from 4.4 to 3.3 days on average for all over 70-year-olds admitted to the ASU team. Whilst admission rates have dropped across all age ranges the biggest reduction in readmissions is among the over 80-year-olds with an almost 50% reduction as opposed to a 33% reduction in the under 70 age group Conclusions: Proactively managing the admissions and discharges of patients with frailty allows them to receive the right care at the right time in their period of crisis and shortens their admissions by approximately 25%.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: In 2014-15, 2.5 million patients over 75 years old underwent surgery compared to 1.5 million in 2006-7. The population is aging with increasing numbers of comorbidities, and associated frailty. 1 The Royal College of Anaesthetists recommends that preoperative assessment for these complex older patients takes a “cross-specialty approach.”2 In Colchester the COPES clinic has been introduced in which selected high-risk patients are seen by a Consultant Anaesthetist and Consultant Geriatrician. This aims to medically optimise patients prior to surgery and to facilitate shared decision making. Methods: The new clinic was introduced in October 2018. The following data was collected from COPES clinic letters from October to February 2018-19 (n=46): • Patient/surgery characteristics: age, comorbidities, frailty score and any cognitive impairment • Interventions: changes to medication, specialty referral, intravenous iron, diabetes optimisation, other • Outcomes of surgery following the COPES clinic Patients were asked to complete feedback forms to evaluate the service. Results: 52% of patients had 4-6, and 28% had 7-9 comorbidities. The majority had Rockwood frailty scores of 4 or 5. 28% of patients had medications changed, 48% had specialty referrals, 17% received intravenous iron, 8.7% required diabetes optimisation and 28% of patients had investigations including echocardiograms, MRI and CT scans. 12/46 patients had surgery deemed unlikely to go ahead after shared decision making with patients in conjunction with the multidisciplinary team involved in their care. 2 patients died of their comorbidities after deciding not to proceed with surgery. 12/46 patients underwent surgery; 4 developed post-operative complications, none died and the mean length of stay was 3.38 days. The remaining 22/46 patients are awaiting surgery. Patient feedback questionnaires (n=10) were overwhelmingly positive. Everyone felt that they were treated with respect and that their fears were addressed and they were clear in the next steps in management. Conclusions: The introduction of the ‘COPES’ clinic has helped address frailty and multiple comorbidities by optimising patients’ medical conditions and allowing alternatives to surgery to be considered. Patients were very satisfied with the COPES clinic and felt it has prepared them for upcoming surgery.</ab>

        <ab>Topic: Hospital admissions for older people are increasing with subsequent pressure on outpatient (OP) clinics. By early 2018, 350 patients were waiting up to 6 months for follow-up, with limited capacity in existing clinics. There were concerns regarding potential harm to patients from delayed review of significant results. Intervention: A working group considered options for managing the OP waiting list. We decided to pilot a fortnightly virtual clinic (VC) where cases were reviewed without the patient present. All patients awaiting results were listed for the VC rather than routine OP. Each VC had 50 patients listed. Patient’s GP received a clear action plan. Clinic rules were modified as issues were identified. Links with other specialities evolved reducing the number of missing results. Data was analysed for 50% of consultations between January 2018 and March 2019. Improvement: 311 VC appointments were reviewed: 207 in 2018 and 104 up to March 2019. Maximum 25 cases could be completed per clinic, additional sessions cleared initial backlog within 3 months. Completion time/case ranged from 2-15 minutes depending on complexity. Main reason for VC was test results: 82% in 2018, increasing to 93% in 2019. 61% in 2018, 80% in 2019 were discharged directly from VC. 20% required a 2nd VC for outstanding results. OP review post-VC fell from 16% in 2018 to just 2% in 2019. General OP requirements fell from 24hrs to 10 hours/week as a result of VCs, releasing consultants for other clinical areas. Discussion: VCs are an effective means of reviewing outstanding results fromrecent admissions and OP consultations. Routine listing of patients with outstanding investigations provides a safety net. Most results are normal and do not require follow-up. Repeat CXRs at 6 weeks continue to be requested for severely frail people who are unlikely to benefit.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: There are over 400,000 people over 65 in UK care homes, three times the number than that in acute hospitals. They are amongst the frailest in our community, with average life expectancy of 15 months once in the home. Their needs are often complex and challenging, which when unmet, often result in unwanted and unnecessary hospital admissions. Imperial College Healthcare Trust (ICHT), along with funding from Health Education England (HEE), have introduced a care home liaison nurse. The aim is to bridge the boundaries, making a significant difference to cross organisation communication and support. Methods: The care home liaison nurse manages a frailty liaison service with the largest local nursing care home. This home has 140 residents with complex needs. The care home liaison nurse provides a point of contact for advice, guidance and support for individual patient pathways, she provides face to face assessment and treatment or verbal advice. In addition, the nurse supports discharge from the acute setting. This direct contact allows rapid access to specialist advice, and aims to build confidence both within the care home team and within the acute team, that the patients’ needs can be met in their own surroundings. Results: The preliminary data demonstrates a positive impact this role is having both to the acute trust and most importantly patient’s experience. Comparing ICHT data from April-May 2018 to April-May 2019 it showing that the number of avoidable admissions has decreased from 54.3% to 37.5%, length of stay when patients are admitted has decreased from 11.7 days to 6.5 days, and the number of patients with an advanced care plan has risen 14.9%. Feedback from nursing staff at the care centre as well as that from patients and families has been overwhelmingly positive. Conclusions: The role is still in the pilot phase. Given the already positive impact it is hoped that it will continue and expand into other care homes and extra sheltered accommodations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust provides services to more than 500,000 residents in the North-East of England across multiple sites. Local problem: Outpatient services for older people across Northumbria include specialist (eg falls) and generic clinics with differing referral routes, demands and waiting times. Referrals derive from primary care, emergency services and elsewhere; some are complex patients requiring a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Existing pathways led to variable waits for clinics, duplication and delays. Aim was to improve the timeliness, efficiency and access to appropriate assessment first time. Methods: We adopted a Clinical Microsystems approach (Sheffield Microsystems Coaching Academy) for improvement. Main components were team coaching, weekly “Big Room” meeting of involved staff to share understanding of current process, agree change ideas, and test these with multiple plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles. Impacts of each PDSA cycle were discussed in Big Room, leading to refinement of the pathway. Interventions: Results: PDSA interventions were tested over 6 months: 1. Development of a single triage system 2. CGA clinic for frail older patients. 3. Development of shared documentation for CGA. 4. Improved cycle and lead times for assessment Conclusions: Our quality improvement work supported the development and implementation of a new referral triage process with CGA assessment for complex frail patients. The change has reduced patient wait times, provided early intervention and reduced duplication. Work is ongoing to determine impact on patient satisfaction and time to discharge from clinic. The approach taken by this project could be applied elsewhere to improve outpatient referral processes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Ambulatory Assessment Unit (AAU) at the John Radcliffe Hospital aims to provide excellent care for complex patients with varying range of medical presentations. It sees over 50% of the acute take in operational hours, with over 40% of AAU patients over the age of 70. Staff feedback consistently identified a suboptimal service provided to the frail group within this patient cohort. A dedicated physiotherapist specialising in older people living with frailty joined the team in October 2018 to address this. Aims: 1. Early identification of patients with frailty attending the unit 2. Improve staff understanding of frailty to enhance patient care 3. Assess patients to either enable a patient to return home safely or support ambulatory pathway 4. Refer to community services that can support the patient and enable them to live well after hospital attendance 5. Review the impact of the specialist physiotherapist’s role Methods: 1. Introduction of frailty identification as per frailty team guidance 2. Frailty questionnaire to ascertain baseline understanding and learning needs to develop staff training 3. Assess patients using a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment 4. Raise staff and patient awareness of community support services available within the community 5. Data collection to review interventions taken, bed days saved and re-attendance rates Results: • 129 new patients were seen in a 4-month period. • 85% returned home the same day; 64% had their ambulatory pathway supported with therapy intervention and 21% had an acute admission avoided directly due to therapy. 15% were admitted to an acute bed for safety • 60% of patients were referred to community services and 50% were signposted to a range of community and support services • The re-admission rates for therapy related reasons within 7 days and 30 days were 0% and 4% respectively. 38 bed days were saved with a calculated cost saving of £15,162 Future service delivery and conclusions: There is ongoing work to obtain patient experience data for those who had their admission avoided directly due to therapy intervention. A training programme on frailty for all members of the MDT is to be developed. A dedicated therapy service in an ambulatory setting has a role in ensuring that patients’ needs are met in the most appropriate place and enhances their quality of life after hospital attendance.</ab>

        <ab>The increasing age and subsequent medical complexity of patients presenting for surgery grants the opportunity to examine the processes and delivery of peri-operative care. There is a need to redesign peri-operative pathways allowing room for shared decision making and personalised, evidence-based care. In times of financial constraint, this is no easy task. However, neglecting to transform services now may lead to challenges in the sustainability of the provision of peri-operative care in the long-term. Challenges in redesigning peri-operative care pathways include identification and optimisation of those at highest peri-operative risk to inform the difficult conversations surrounding the appropriateness of surgery. The moral burden of these conversations on patient and professionals alike is increasingly recognised and managing this issue requires innovative models of collaborative, multidisciplinary and interprofessional working. To operate or not can be a challenging question to answer with a number of different perspectives to consider; not least that of the patient.</ab>

Qualitative textual script analysis was used to analyze the representation of older adults in six plays produced on and off Broadway, 1991–2017. Traditional character constructions of age and older adults emerged – frailty, fear, caregiving burden – with counternarratives of resilience, resistance, and self-reflexivity also present. Uncovered dyadic pairs (e.g. frailty/resistance) served as examples of the complexity of age portrayed on stage. From this dyadic tension present in the plays emerged a way to build upon and expand traditional, and often more limited, societal notions of aging.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: During an initial phase of this research, an e‐Delphi survey was conducted to gain consensus among stakeholders on the components of a nurse‐led assessment and care planning intervention for older people who live with frailty in primary care. This feasibility randomized controlled trial (fRCT) will test the proposed intervention and its implementation and determine methods for the design of a conclusive randomized controlled trial. Methods: The fRCT, with embedded qualitative study, aims to recruit 60 participants. Moderately and severely frail older people will be identified using the electronic frailty index (eFI) and the intervention will be delivered by senior community nurses. The control participants will receive usual primary care for frailty. The study is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR; funding granted in May 2016, ref: ICA‐CDRF‐2016‐02‐018) and received NHS and University Research Ethics Committee approval in 2018. Discussion: There is evidence that the delivery of complex interventions for community‐dwelling older people can reduce care home and hospital admissions and falls, there is less evidence for the benefit of any specific type or intensity of intervention or the additional benefits of targeting the frail population. This trial will determine feasibility of the intervention, define recruitment and retention parameters and trial logistics, and decide outcome measures. Impact: This study aims to address the limitations of current research by using a systematic method of frailty diagnosis and participant identification, trialling implementation of a person‐centred intervention, and testing of feasibility parameters.

        <ab>Background Introducing Health and Social Care Professional (HSCP) teams to the emergency department (ED) has increasingly demonstrated benefits for ED patient and process outcomes. However, there is a dearth of research exploring the views of key ED stakeholders on the role of HSCP teams in care delivery the ED. This qualitative study investigated the perspectives of a wide range of ED stakeholders about HSCPs teams working in the ED. Methods A total of 65 participants including older adults who had recently attended the ED and their carers/relatives, ED doctors and nurses, HSCPs and pre-hospital staff participated in four World Café style focus groups and individual interviews across two Irish hospital sites. Written and audio-recorded data were transcribed and thematically analysed. Results Overall, participants expressed positive views on HSCPs working in teams in the ED, with benefits for patients, staff members and the hospital (Theme 1). Having an ED-based HSCP team was described as promoting effective and timely decision-making and a more integrated approach to patient care, particularly for frail older adults with complex needs (Theme 2). Barriers and enablers for effective implementation were identified at multiple levels (Theme 3) including the ED physical environment, (e.g. space and equipment), operational factors (e.g. working hours), and relations (e.g. patient-staff or staff-staff communication); factors at system level included availability of community resources and financial pressures. Conclusion Our study indicates overall acceptability of HSCPs working in teams in the ED and positive views on their contribution to enhance the quality care of older adults. However, a number of operational and relational factors need to be considered to ensure feasibility and effectiveness. This information is crucial to inform implementation.</ab>

        <ab>Background Community Health Organisation Area 1 has the highest age dependency in Ireland (37.5 vs 34.5) and the highest proportion of its population engaged in unpaid care (4.7%)1. Social prescribing is a novel tool used by the Integrated Care Team for the Older Person in Sligo to address social determinants of health such as social isolation and to minimise the impact of carer burden. The study aim is to quantify social needs and carer burden in this acutely frail group and describe interventions to address this. Methods A descriptive study compiled from Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment of patient care profile and social prescribing from June to December 2018. Results 50% of patients studied did not have a supportive, able person living with them. 1 in 4 had no local support while 1 in 5 were supported only by neighbours or friends. 53% were not receipt of home help while 24% paid for private care or cleaning services. Carer burden was reported in half of cases with a 2.2 times increased risk with a patient co-morbidity of cognitive decline and a 1.8 times increased risk with a complex medical needs patient. Intervention increased community service usage such as the public health nurse from 70% to 86% and home help applications by 26%. Social prescribing increased day centre use from 18% to 46% and Meals on Wheels usage by 50%. Dementia specific social prescribing was made in 26% of those with cognitive difficulties. 33% received information for carers while 11% were informed of respite options. Conclusion In this acutely decompensated and vulnerable group social isolation and carer burden are a significant issue. Our study indicates the potential for the use of a social prescribing model to address this at an earlier point in frailty development at a primary care level.</ab>

        <ab>Background The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the National Clinical Programme for Older People conducted a national survey of Specialist Geriatric Services (SGS) in 2014. The survey was repeated in 2018-2019 period to collect data on the resources available for the care of older people attending hospitals and associated communities in Ireland. Methods Participants were geriatrician leads or proxies in each hospital in Ireland. Questions based on the 2014 survey were updated to include frailty and dementia-delirium specific questions. Data were collected between September 2018 and April 2019 using an electronic survey. Comments from open-ended questions were analysed using qualitative analysis methods. Results In total, 20 fully complete and 18 incomplete responses were received. Most complete responses were from model 3 or 4 hospitals (n= 14/20). Less than half (47%) reported having a dedicated specialist geriatric ward in their institution. Half (50%) reported currently developing an integrated plan for services for frail older people with complex care needs. Barriers to managing frailty that were identified included limited access to funding and staffing. 82% reported that their group/area/unit/department engaged in case-finding for frailty. The most commonly used frailty-specific screening tools were the CFS (n=9), VIP (n=6), FRAIL scale (n=4), and PRISMA-7 (n=3). A National Frailty Education Programme governance structure was operational in 9/20 sites. Half (50%) reported that their hospital has an integrated pathway for people with dementia and/or delirium, although (82%) stated that their hospital does not formally screen all older people for cognitive impairment in the ED/AMAU, and does not formally screen people at risk for delirium on wards on a daily basis (100%). Conclusion Limited staffing and resources were reported for many aspects of SGS in Ireland. Although frailty and dementia-delirium are recognised as priority areas, there is need for standardised assessment and screening approaches.</ab>

        <ab>Background Nursing home residents are prone to acute illness due to their advancing age, underlying illnesses and immobility. The decision to refer a nursing home resident for acute hospital admission is a complex one, and there is no consensus among health care professionals about what constitutes an 'appropriate admission' to hospital from a nursing home. We aimed to explore patterns of acute nursing home patient presentations to the emergency department. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of emergency hospital admissions to a tertiary university teaching hospital. Emergency admissions through the emergency department were included. Elective admissions, outpatient admissions, or inter-hospital transfers were excluded. Cases were validated by scrutiny of the patient medical records, and where possible an assessment of the Rockwood clinical frailty scale (CFS) was carried out. Results There were 126 nursing home residents who presented to ED over a two month period for emergency assessments. 87.3% (n=115) presented via ambulance. Just over half had a GP referral letter (53.2%). 72.3% of patients who presented to ED were admitted. 25.2% of patients were re-referred to ED within 30 days of hospital discharge. All patients were classified as frail. 21.3% of patients had died at the 90 day follow up mark. 66% of those with a CFS 8 or 9 died, in comparison to 16% of those with a CFS or either 6 or 7. Conclusion We noted high numbers of patients from nursing homes attending our emergency department. A very high proportion were admitted, along with a high number of subsequent re-presentations. Death rates were higher in those with more advanced frailty status. We would suggest advanced care planning and strategies to improve the patient experience. This study highlights the requirement for improved advance care planning in the nursing home setting. This is however a complex issue. Early discussion about end of life preferences with patients and family is required.</ab>

        <ab>Background The National Clinical Programme for Older Persons was introduced in the Model 4 Adult teaching hospital in 2012 with the development of a Specialist Geriatric Ward, supported by an existing Day Hospital and access to post acute rehabilitation in the local model 3 hospital. The continuing growth of the population over 70 years in the catchment area and the increasing awareness of the complex needs of this group of patients required a new way of thinking and working. Methods Using Lean methodology the group restructured the focus of the care pathway for older persons using evidence based practice and data collection. Workstreams have been identified and iterative project charters established to guide and empower staff to design and evaluate the supports they provide. Key internal and external stakeholders were identified and invited to participate in the ongoing steering group and the voice of the customer was used to underpin targeted improvements. Results The hospital now has a structured framework for the delivery and evaluation of care provided to older persons attending our services. Overall governance is provided by a Frailty Steering Group with strong clinical leadership and is informed by agreed quality indicators and realtime data. Despite increases in numbers requiring admission, length of stay has decreased, readmission rates have remained stable and a greater proportion of our patients are accessing both offsite rehabilitation and home supports on discharge. Conclusion This is an ongoing project with medium and long term goals identified across all workstreams. The evidence and data gathered will inform service planning and resource allocation. A number of collaborative research proposals are now being considered from across acute hospital and Community Healthcare Organisation.</ab>

        <ab>Background In the United Kingdom, the 2010 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report 'An Age Old Problem' outlined significant shortcomings in the perioperative care of older people. Other than hip fractures, the care of older patients under surgical specialities is largely devoid of routine geriatrician input. In August 2018, we introduced daily geriatric reviews (GR) on the gastrointestinal surgical wards, aiming to improve length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Methods All acute general surgery admissions for patients ≥70 years were reviewed between September and October 2017 (pre-introduction) and 2018 (post-introduction), and outcomes compared. For 2018, comparisons were also made between those who had GR and those who didn't. Results There were 173 admissions in 2017, vs 190 in 2018. In both 2017 and 2018, median age was 80, median LOS was 4 days, and clinical frailty scale (CFS) 4. Twenty-two percent (38/173) of patients had a surgical procedure in 2017, vs 33% (63/190) in 2018. Inpatient mortality was 8% (13/173) in 2017 (median CFS 6), vs 6% (11/190) in 2018 (median CFS 6). In 2018, 21% (40/190) of patients had GR: median time to review 3 days. 54% (n=22) of the patients with GR underwent a surgical procedure, 37% (n=15) were admitted to ICU, and inpatient mortality was 5% (n=2), vs 28% (n=42), 4% (n=6) and 6% (n=9) respectively for those without GR. 30 day readmission for those with GR was 12.5% (n=5), vs 18.4% (n=28) for those not seen. Conclusion While more surgical procedures were performed in 2018 (post-introduction), overall LOS remained unchanged and improved mortality was observed compared to 2017. Geriatricians are seeing more post-operative and ICU patients, and despite presumed increased complexity, both mortality and readmission rates remain low. Screening for frailty and specific inclusion criteria may improve rates of GR.</ab>

        <ab>Background The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is widely used to assess frailty in older adults and reflects functional independence. We examined its use as an outcome measure in an offsite rehabilitation unit for patients over 65 transferred from an acute hospital following medical/surgical admission. Methods Patients were given a CFS score by consensus opinion from the multidisciplinary team on admission and on completion of rehabilitation. We included data on diagnosis, length of stay and discharge destination Results Thirty patients, with a mean age of 80, completed rehabilitation over a four-month period. The most common diagnosis was fracture of hip or pelvis (53%). Median CFS was 6 on admission and 5 on discharge (range 3-8). Twenty-one (70%) patients saw an improvement in CFS of an average of one point on the scale irrespective of admission score. Of those that improved, 81% were discharged directly home with no need for increased support services, compared with 11% of those who did not improve. Mean length of stay was significantly less in those with mild/moderate frailty (CFS 5-6) at admission versus severe frailty (31 vs 53.8 days, p&lt;0.01). Conclusion Frailty score improved in the majority of patients undergoing rehabilitation, regardless of admission score; CFS alone did not predict rehabilitation potential, emphasising the importance of offering rehabilitation to frail older adults – better judged by experienced clinical assessment. CFS is a broad 9-point tool that can miss small improvements in physical function based on other objective scores e.g. FIM+FAM. Severe frailty was associated with longer length of stay in rehabilitation, possibly reflecting more complex discharge planning as well as rehabilitation progress in this group.</ab>

        <ab>Background With increasing numbers of older multi-morbid people being exposed to polypharmacy, research needs to focus on medication-related outcomes affecting quality-of-life (QoL). This study examines older-patients' medication-related QoL (MRQoL), its relationship to medication burden/complexity, frailty, health-related QoL (HRQoL) and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs. Methods A cross-sectional-study was conducted in older-patients attending out-patients and day-hospital services of a tertiary-teaching-hospital. Participants were aged ≥65 years, first-time attendees, taking ≥5 chronic-medications for ≥3 chronic-conditions and mini-mental state examination score ≥26/30. Demographic, medication, comorbidity, frailty status, PIMs(STOPP/STARTv.2 criteria), MRQoL (MRQoL-LS v1.0) HRQoL (Short-form-12; SF-12) and medication burden (Living with Medicines Questionnaire v.2; LMQv2) data were collected. Drg compliance was measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). Lower MRQoL-LS v1.0 scores indicate better MRQoL (range 0-84). Higher LMQv2 scores indicate higher medication burden (range from 60-300). A negative age-specific mean-difference score in SF-12 physical and mental health composite scale scores (SF12-PCS, SF12-MCS) indicates poorer health. Results Over 12 months, 234 patients (attending 78 clinics) were screened, 59 met inclusion criteria and 30 were recruited; 3 patients were subsequently identified as ineligible. Eighteen patients were female (66%), mean age was 79.4 years (SD±6.2), median number of daily medications was 10 (IQR 8-13), median number of comorbidities was 11 (IQR 9-14). Participants were generally drug-compliant, median MARS score of 9 (IQR 6.5-10). Patients' median MRQoL score was 14 (IQR 14-22.5); mean LMQ v2 score was 115.64 (SD± 25.18). Mean age specific mean-difference SF12-PCS and SF12-MCS scores were -22.61 (SD±11.7) and -22.1 (SD±17.5) respectively. There was no significant correlation between MRQoL and number of daily medications, number of comorbidities, LMQ, HRQoL, or PIMs(Pearson's 2-tailed test). Conclusion This study demonstrates that MRQoL-LS v.1 is not applicable to most patients attending geriatric ambulatory services. Furthermore, polypharmacy, multimorbidity, presence of PIMs poorer HRQoL do not correlate significantly with MRQoL.</ab>

        <ab>Background Fried's frailty phenotype is defined by five criteria: exhaustion, unexplained weight loss, weakness, slowness and low physical activity. Frailty can also affect obese people. Little is known about how body mass index [BMI] or waist-hip ratio [WHR] are associated with frailty or pre-frailty in the face of confounding factors, including markers of allostatic load which are known to be involved in frailty biology. We cross-sectionally examined these associations in a population-based study. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of data collected at Wave 1 (2010) of TILDA was undertaken. Participants aged &lt;50 and those who did not have measurements of their BMI, WHR, chronic disease status, HbA1c, CRP, sex and educational status were excluded. Two multivariate logistic regression models (one with BMI and another one with WHR as measure of obesity) were computed adjusting for these covariates, with frail/pre-frail versus non-frail as the outcome variable. Results 4,568 participants were included: 3,277 non-frail and 1,291 frail/pre-frail. The frail/pre-frail group had a mean BMI of 29.2 (versus 28.3) kg/m2 and a mean WHR of 0.912 (versus 0.899). In the adjusted regression model, BMI had a significant association with frailty/pre-frailty (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.001). However, in the model using WHR, the latter had a stronger association with frailty (OR 4.52, 95% CI: 1.60-12.72, p=0.004). In both models, age, education, chronic disease status, HbA1c and CRP had the expected associations with frailty/pre-frailty. Female sex was significantly associated with frailty/pre-frailty in the WHR model (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50, p=0.008). Conclusion While obesity is associated with frailty, the distribution of body fat may be more important as a marker of frailty. These physical traits should not be overlooked in the over 50 population. The association between frailty, obesity and markers of 'inflammaging' could be examined longitudinally to further understand their complex biology.</ab>

        <ab>Background NHR are the frailest group of older people and require a gerontologically attuned approach to combat multiple challenges presented to the practitioner. The in-reach ANPc liaison service aims to confront such challenges, by providing comprehensive gerontological input to all nursing home residents admitted to hospital under all specialities medical, geriatric, and surgical. Methods This service commenced in September of 2018, working 9-5 Monday to Friday with limited leave cross-cover. All nursing home residents are reviewed by a Gerontology Advanced Nurse Practitioner candidate. Each patient received comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) with recommendations for care. All had follow up 2 weeks after discharge in telephone review clinic. Results 118 nursing home residents were admitted for acute care in the study period; 96/118 (82%) were reviewed by the ANPc. 16/118 (14%) were discharged prior to review and 6/118 (5%) died within 24 hours of admission. All other patients were reviewed within 72 hours. All assessed residents had &gt;1 recommendation for intervention to enhance care following CGA: Interventions included 31% (30/96) undiagnosed delirium identified and management advice given. 21% (20/96) had recurrent falls work up and advice. 27% (26/96) had recommendations and changes to admission medications. 37% (36/96) referrals to other HSCP therapy disciplines for complete holistic care. 11% (11/ 96) had advanced care planning regarding future illnesses. 13% (13/96) had palliative care advice and referral to community palliative care. Follow up telephone review clinics have further resulted in reduced readmission rates through liaison with NH staff post-discharge. Conclusion The high complexity of this cohort of patients requires a timely, comprehensive gerontological approach in order to provide holistic care. They require a clearly defined approach to enhance care and minimise the need for unnecessary hospitalisations.</ab>

        <ab>Background A hospital's trolley count is often highlighted as a measure of its performance. However there is a more complex reality for each organisation in accessing suitable resources for often frail older patients to improve care and capacity. Coupled with this is the need for pathways that identify these patients early in their admission and access the appropriate specialist care.  In 2018, 65% of this hospital's bed days were occupied by those whose hospital stay was greater than 14 days. Nationally this was 57%. We undertook to review processes locally around the care of older acute patients. Methods On the 20th November 2018 we conducted a chart audit of 85 in-patients who had been in the acute setting for more than 14 days. A proforma was completed for each patient by a doctor and multi-disciplinary team member. Results The length of stay ranged from 15 – 527 days with the median being 41 days. The average age was 76 years. A history of falls/dementia/"acopia" was recorded on admission in 57%. The mean time for referral to MDT was 5 days. Social history was only documented in 47% of cases. Ward transfers was a significant issue with 69% moving wards at least once and 9% moving three times or more. A care planning meeting had not been held in 49% of cases. Over 17% of charts audited were awaiting home care package hours whilst 20% were awaiting long term care. In 62% of cases there was no ongoing medical reason keeping them in hospital and 56% of this cohort could have been cared for elsewhere. Conclusion Deficits in clear communication and appropriate timely planning for patients resulted in significant delays in discharge. The findings of our research informed a decision to conduct a root and branch analysis of discharge planning utilising the Lean Six Sigma model.</ab>

        <ab>Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Self-perceived health declines with age, varies by gender and is a predictor of mortality, morbidity, physical and psychological functioning. However, gender differences in health and illness perception are complex and not yet fully understood. This study aimed to explore gender-related differences in psychosocial determinants of self-perceived health among older adults living in nursing homes. Method: Nationwide face-to-face survey of the Portuguese population aged 65 and over. A representative sample of nursing homes residents was obtained through a multistage cluster random sampling of nursing homes, stratified by main Portuguese administrative regions (NUTS II). Results: Overall, 1186 nursing homes residents voluntarily enrolled in this study (participation rate, 93%) and a total of 515 participants (70.1% women) were considered to have adequate cognitive functioning to answer all questionnaires. A significant association between self-rated health and gender was found: 90.6% of all women (95% CI: 85.7—93.9) and 82.3% of all men (95% CI: 72.9—88.9) rated their health as less than good (p = 0.023). Gender-stratified analyses showed differences in psychosocial determinants of self-perceived health. While symptoms of depression and loneliness feelings were the major psychosocial determinants of poor self-perceived health among women, age and subjective financial well-being were the only determinants among men. Conclusion: Factors associated with perceived health, as representative of healthy ageing, were identified by gender, leading to future avenues for fruitful investigation. The acknowledgement of interpersonal and socioeconomic factors that determine the experience of ageing at a national level is crucial to improve the health of elders.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives Older people are likely to transition to a new home closer to family who can provide assistance or to long-term residential care as their health declines and their care needs increase. A minority choose to move to "age-friendly" housing before the onset of disability, but the majority prefer to "age in place" and defer moving until health crises compel a transition. Older people living with dementia are likely to move into residential care, but not much is known about the role they play in decision making around these moves. This qualitative study addresses this gap in knowledge by examining how a rare cohort of "older old" people, most with some level of cognitive impairment, were involved in decisions surrounding assistance seeking and moving to a care home. Research Design and Methods Thematic analysis of qualitative interview data from Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) study participants aged 95 years and older, who had moved in later life, and their proxy informants (n = 26). Results Moves at such an old age were made due to a complexity of push and pull factors which had layered dynamics of decision making. In most cases (n = 22), decision making involved other people with varying degrees of decision ownership. Only four older people, who moved voluntarily, had full ownership of the decision to move. Many relatives reported being traumatized by events leading up to the move. Discussion and Implications "Older old" people are sometimes unable to make their own decisions about moving due to the urgency of health crisis and cognitive decline. There is a need to support relatives to discuss moving and housing options at timely junctures before health crises intervene in an effort to optimize older people's participation in decision making.</ab>

        <ab>People in nursing and residential homes are more likely to suffer frailty. Registered nurses are a crucial component of the care delivery service and can offer support to patients who have complex care needs and comorbidities and are at risk of unplanned admissions to secondary care. This article explores frailty and the role of the nurse in assessing for frailty. Three aspects of patient care—nutrition status, polypharmacy and exercise and cognitive function—are discussed as areas where nurses can target their interventions in order to support those considered as frail, aiming to reduce the impact of frailty and negative health outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Finding ways to quantify resilience as a predictor of a person's resistance to health challenges is important to improve healthy aging. This study investigated a unique sample of high-functioning older persons in whom traditional markers of frailty and functional decline are largely absent. Translating complex dynamical systems theory to humans, dynamical indicators of resilience in postural balance time series may sensitively discriminate levels of resilience.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;This study investigated 240 high-functioning older adults (mean age 83.9 ± 2.9 years, 59% male), of whom 94 hikers of the Nijmegen Four Days Marches. Participants stood upright on a force plate with eyes open and feet at shoulder width for 30 seconds. Center of pressure data were analyzed for dynamical indicators of resilience (variance and temporal autocorrelation). After 1 year, participants were compared on a modified Successful Aging Index.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Mediolateral center of pressure displacement of hikers exhibited significantly lower variance (2.2 vs 2.8 mm, p &lt; .001) and temporal autocorrelation (0.59 vs 0.65, p = .006), compared with nonhikers. Multivariably adjusted, mediolateral variance was significantly associated with successful aging at baseline (b = -1.43, p = .003) and 1-year follow-up (b = -1.94, p &lt; .001), while mediolateral temporal autocorrelation was not.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Two dynamical indicators of resilience (variance and temporal autocorrelation) calculated on time series of mediolateral center of pressure displacement differed between hikers and nonhikers within a group of high-functioning older adults. In the whole group, variance was independently associated with successful aging at baseline and after 1 year. Our results support the hypothesis that resilience of older persons may be estimated from time series of natural fluctuations of bodily functions.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults are prescribed a growing number of medications. Polypharmacy, commonly considered the receipt of five or more medications, is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. There is a debate about the reason(s) why. On one side is the assertion that older persons are being prescribed too many medications, with the number of medications increasing the risk of adverse events. On the other side is the observation that polypharmacy is associated both with overprescribing of inappropriate medications and underprescribing of appropriate medications. This leads to the concept of "inappropriate" vs "appropriate" polypharmacy, with the latter resulting from the prescription of many correct medications to persons with multiple chronic conditions. Few studies have examined the health outcomes associated with adding and/or removing medications to address this debate directly. The criteria used to identify underutilized medications are based on results of randomized controlled trials that may not be generalizable to older adults. Several randomized controlled trials and many more observational studies provide evidence that these criteria overestimate medication benefits and underestimate harms. In addition, evidence suggests that the marginal effects of medications added to an already complex regimen differ from their effects when considered individually. Although in selected circumstances adding medications results in benefit to patients, patients with multimorbidity and frailty/disability have susceptibilities that can decrease the likelihood of medication benefit and increase the likelihood of harms. The identification of appropriate polypharmacy requires more robust criteria to evaluate the net effects of complex medication regimens.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Multimorbidity and frailty are complex syndromes characteristics of aging. We reviewed the literature and provided pooled estimations of any evidence regarding (a) the coexistence of frailty and multimorbidity and (b) their association.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;We searched PubMed and Web of Science for relevant articles up to September 2017. Pooled estimates were obtained through random effect models and Mantel-Haenszel weighting. Homogeneity (I2), risk of bias, and publication bias were assessed. PROSPERO registration: 57890.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;A total of 48 studies involving 78,122 participants were selected, and 25 studies were included in one or more meta-analyses. Forty-five studies were cross-sectional and 3 longitudinal, with the majority of them including community-dwelling participants (n = 35). Forty-three studies presented a moderate risk of bias and five a low risk. Most of the articles defined multimorbidity as having two or more diseases and frailty according to the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. In meta-analyses, the prevalence of multimorbidity in frail individual was 72% (95% confidence interval = 63%-81%; I2 = 91.3%), and the prevalence of frailty among multimorbid individuals was 16% (95% confidence interval = 12%-21%; I2 = 96.5%). Multimorbidity was associated with frailty in pooled analyses (odds ratio = 2.27; 95% confidence interval = 1.97-2.62; I2 = 47.7%). The three longitudinal studies suggest a bidirectional association between multimorbidity and frailty.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Frailty and multimorbidity are two related conditions in older adults. Most frail individuals are also multimorbid, but fewer multimorbid ones also present frailty. Our findings are not conclusive regarding the causal association between the two conditions. Further longitudinal and well-designed studies may help to untangle the relationship between frailty and multimorbidity.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Frailty is a complex pathophysiological phenomenon that will impact a significant proportion of adults over the age of 65 and contributes to the risk of several adverse health outcomes. Although women have a disproportionately higher risk of frailty, the sex-specific factors related to this syndrome are not well described. Hence, we sought to examine the relationship of age at menopause, hysterectomy status, and hormone replacement therapy use with prevalent frailty in older women.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) Baseline Comprehensive Cohort (n = 30,097, 45-85 years old). Frailty was operationalized using both the deficit accumulation (frailty index) and frailty phenotype (Fried) models. Postmenopausal women were categorized as follows: premature (30-39 years), early (40-45 years), normal (46-54 years), and late (55+ years) menopause, or hysterectomy. Associations were determined using multivariate analysis, adjusting for sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, social support, and hormone replacement therapy use.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Age at menopause was inversely related to frailty in older Canadian women. The frailty index decreased 1.2% of the mean (p &lt; .001) with every year of menopause onset and was significantly higher for women in the premature (24%; p &lt; .001) and early (7%; p &lt; .01) menopause and hysterectomy (21%; p &lt; .001) groups, compared to the normal menopause group. The odds for being classified as frail using Fried's criteria was higher for the premature menopause (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.72-2.27) and hysterectomy (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.25-2.02) groups.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Our study supports a role for age at menopause and hysterectomy in the risk of frailty in older women and warrants further investigation.</ab>

        <ab>China is facing an escalating demand of healthcare services from the middle-aged and elderly. Compared with the traditional view of health on symptoms and diseases, this study aimed to assess the heterogeneous health profiles of middle-aged and elderly Chinese by a person-centered approach. Furthermore, this study examined the effects of health profiles and associated factors on healthcare utilization within the context of China's multiple health insurance schemes. The study used the 2015 data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationwide population-based sample of people aged 45 years and older. Latent class analysis (LCA) was adopted to identify the heterogeneous health profiles. Two-part models were adopted to assess the effects of associated factors on healthcare utilization. Among 15,250 Chinese aged 45 years and older, six heterogeneous health profiles were identified and labeled as 'Quite Healthy', 'Relatively Healthy', 'Comprehensive Comorbidities', 'Functional Impairment', 'Severe Disability', and 'Relatively Frail'. The Relatively Frail profile was the heaviest healthcare user. The Severe Disability profile took the least use of outpatient services but had relatively high utilization of inpatient services and outpatient expenditure. The Comprehensive Comorbidities profile tended to have the smallest effect on the frequency of visits for both inpatient and outpatient services, but its effect on outpatient expenditure was high. After controlling for health profiles, the significant effects of different health insurance programs on healthcare utilization were discussed. Introducing health profiles by the person-centered approach of LCA has provided a holistic understanding of complex healthcare demands for middle-aged and elderly Chinese. It is valuable for policy makers to improve healthcare resource allocation targeted for the middle-aged and elderly. • Heterogeneous health profiles were assessed by a person-centered approach. • Six health profiles for middle-aged and elderly Chinese were identified. • How health profiles and other factors impact healthcare utilization was evaluated. • Significant effects of different health insurance were evaluated by controlling health profiles.</ab>

        <ab>In our ageing society diabetes imposes a significant burden in terms of the numbers of people with the condition, diabetes‐related complications including disability, and health and social care expenditure. Older people with diabetes can represent some of the more complex and difficult challenges facing the clinician working in different settings, and the recognition that we have only a relatively small (but increasing) evidence base to guide us in diabetes management is a limitation of our current approaches. Nevertheless, in this review we attempt to explore what evidence there is to guide us in a comprehensive scheme of treatment for older adults, often in a high‐risk clinical state, in terms of glucose lowering, blood pressure and lipid management, frailty care and lifestyle interventions. We strive towards individualized care and make a call for action for more high‐quality research using different trial designs. What's new?: This review represents a modern, up‐to‐date account of published evidence that seeks to examine the significance of previous research relating to the management of diabetes in older people.The review also provides a diagrammatic view of the development of the complex illness scenarios seen in ageing people with diabetes, and provides the first detailed algorithm for developing individualized care programmes in this often vulnerable group.The evidence review takes us through glucose‐lowering trials involving older people, a discussion of important cardiovascular outcome and safety trials relevant to the elderly, in addition to a discussion of insulin therapy, lifestyle interventions and managing frailty.This review concludes with a call to action to promote new research in older adults with diabetes with the hope of optimizing clinical outcomes in the future.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Purpose: &lt;/bold&gt;Hypertension trials often exclude patients with complex health problems and lack generalizability. We aimed to determine if systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients undergoing antihypertensive treatment is associated with 1-year changes in cognitive/daily functioning or quality of life (QoL) in persons aged ≥75 years with or without complex health problems.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;We analyzed data from a population-based prospective cohort study (Integrated Systematic Care for Older Persons [ISCOPE]) with a 1-year follow-up. Stratified by SBP level in the year before baseline, we used mixed-effects linear regression models to evaluate the change from baseline to 1-year follow-up in outcome measures (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], Groningen Activity Restriction Scale [GARS], and EQ-5D-3L). We adjusted for age, sex, and baseline MMSE/GARS/EQ-5D-3L scores and stratified for complex health problems as a proxy for frailty.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Participant (n = 1,266) age averaged 82.4 (SD 5) years, and 874 (69%) were women. For participants undergoing antihypertensive therapy (1,057; 83.5%) and with SBP &lt;130 mm Hg, crude cognitive decline was 0.90 points MMSE, whereas in those with SBP &gt;150 mm Hg, it was 0.14 points MMSE (ie, 0.76-point less decline; P for trend = .013). Complex health problems modified the association of SBP with cognition; the association was seen in those with antihypertensive treatment (P for trend &lt;.001), not in those without (P for trend = .13). Daily functioning/QoL did not differ across the strata of SBP or antihypertensive treatment.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Participants aged ≥75 years undergoing antihypertensive treatment, with SBP ≥130 mm Hg compared to &lt;130 mm Hg, showed less cognitive decline after 1 year, without loss of daily functioning or QoL. This effect was strongest in participants with complex health problems. More studies should be conducted to determine if there is a causal relation and to understand the mechanism of the association observed.</ab>

        <ab>Integrated care is increasingly promoted as an effective and cost‐effective way to organise care for community‐dwelling frail older people with complex problems but the question remains whether high expectations are justified. Our study aims to systematically review the empirical evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for community‐dwelling frail older people and close attention is paid to the elements and levels of integration of the interventions. We searched nine databases for eligible studies until May 2016 with a comparison group and reporting at least one outcome regarding effectiveness or cost‐effectiveness. We identified 2,998 unique records and, after exclusions, selected 46 studies on 29 interventions. We assessed the quality of the included studies with the Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk‐of‐bias tool. The interventions were described following Rainbow Model of Integrated Care framework by Valentijn. Our systematic review reveals that the majority of the reported outcomes in the studies on preventive, integrated care show no effects. In terms of health outcomes, effectiveness is demonstrated most often for seldom‐reported outcomes such as well‐being. Outcomes regarding informal caregivers and professionals are rarely considered and negligible. Most promising are the care process outcomes that did improve for preventive, integrated care interventions as compared to usual care. Healthcare utilisation was the most reported outcome but we found mixed results. Evidence for cost‐effectiveness is limited. High expectations should be tempered given this limited and fragmented evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for frail older people. Future research should focus on unravelling the heterogeneity of frailty and on exploring what outcomes among frail older people may realistically be expected.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with frailty among the young‐old elderly (YOE) and old–old elderly (OOE). METHODS: This longitudinal study with a 3‐year follow‐up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS: Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3‐year period. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent frailty, we suggest weight‐loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower‐limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. Implications for Nursing Practice: The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.</ab>

        <ab>In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

        <ab>In July 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its proposed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rule for calendar year 2019 (MPFS2019). The proposal sets forth CMS‐recommended updates to Medicare payment policies, payment rates, and quality provisions for services provided in the next calendar year. From year to year, the rule also can serve as a vehicle for soliciting input on new payment proposals and changes to existing policies. Among the payment and quality proposals in the MPFS2019 proposal, CMS proposed extensive changes to Current Procedural Terminology codes that are the framework for documentation and payment for office‐based evaluation and management (E/M) services. The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) believes the proposed payment methodology changes for E/M services would have had a significant negative impact on care for older Americans. On September 10, 2018, the AGS submitted its comments on this proposal and other aspects of the rule, and the AGS also submitted a comment letter signed by 41 organizations from an AGS‐led multispecialty coalition. The coalition also worked collaboratively on outreach to Congress, which included visits to Capitol Hill and a coalition letter stressing our collective support for reducing the burden of documentation for clinicians and our opposition to the proposed changes in payment methodology. In all letters, we noted that the AGS and members of our coalition hoped to work collaboratively with CMS and other stakeholders to develop a refined approach that would achieve the best possible outcomes for patients, particularly frail older Americans with multiple chronic conditions. In releasing their final MPFS2019, CMS postponed the E/M coding collapse for at least two years, a decision that speaks to the hard work of the AGS, its members, and the multi‐specialty coalition, and which opens the door for further discussions about the future of payment for E/M services so critical to older people.

        <ab>OBJECTIVES To summarize available tools that can assist clinicians in identifying and reducing or stopping (deprescribing) potentially inappropriate medications and that specifically consider frailty or limited life expectancy. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. SETTING We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL from inception to December 2017, along with grey literature. We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications. PARTICIPANTS Frail older persons and older persons with limited life expectancy. MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of tools. RESULTS: We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medication‐specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, step‐wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in very low‐quality studies). CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:172–180, 2019.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores the development of an ambulatory community service that demonstrates multidisciplinary working to meet the diverse needs of frail older people and their carers. The service comprises advanced nurse practitioners, a pharmacist, a community navigator, consultants, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, a nurse, rehabilitation assistants, a healthcare assistant and an administrator. This multidisciplinary team (MDT) serves adults with complex medical and rehabilitation needs who are being discharged from hospital, staying in bedded rehabilitation units or living at home by offering assessments, investigations and rehabilitation, where appropriate closer to home. The aims of the service are to: keep people well, prevent unplanned hospital admissions, promote health and well-being, reduce the risk of falls, enable independent living and provide rehabilitation. Personalised care plans are developed with patients and their carers. Advanced nursing practice is demonstrated in assessment, investigation, diagnosis, management, referral and non-medical prescribing. Development of this MDT is required to support and promote integrated, evidence-based work. Such development leads to integrated care across communities, and bridges gaps between patients and carers, GPs, home, residential and hospital-based services, and the voluntary, statutory and non-statutory sectors.</ab>

        <ab>Therapeutic decision‐making for older patients with stage IV non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no identifiable activating mutation is complex. In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients ≥70 years of age were evaluated with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age was 76 (70–92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p &lt; 0.001) and GA group (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.</ab>

        <ab>Background: To promote health and well-being, and to meet the desires of the growing elderly population to age in place, elderly spousal caregivers need adequate support such as respite care services. More knowledge is needed about elderly spousal caregivers' experiences in relation to participation, which is an aspect of health that remains relatively unexplored for this group. Aim: To explore and describe how elderly spousal caregivers experience and discuss participation in everyday life when living in shifting contexts due to the use of respite care. Method: A grounded theory approach was used during data generation and analysis, which involved repeated focus group interviews with 12 spousal caregivers. Results: Complexity and ambiguity was understood to imbue participation in everyday life. Being in charge of everyday life was challenging for spousal caregivers, and created a need for personal time. Respite care and home care service gave them time, although when interacting with social contexts other issues arose that influenced their own recovery. Conclusions: A holistic 'situation centered' approach that focuses on the elderly couple's life story and needs might capture a wider perspective and enable adequate support that influences their health, well-being, and participation in everyday life.</ab>

        <ab>Multimorbidity is a common and burdensome condition that may affect quality of life, increase medical needs, and make people live more years of life with disability. Negative outcomes related to multimorbidity occur beyond what we would expect from the summed effect of single conditions, as chronic diseases interact with each other, mutually enhancing their negative effects, and eventually leading to new clinical phenotypes. Moreover, multimorbidity mirrors an accelerated global susceptibility and a loss of resilience, which are both hallmarks of aging. Due to the complexity of its assessment and definition, and the lack of clear evidence steering its management, multimorbidity represents one of the main current challenges for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The authors of this article recently reflected on these issues during two twin international symposia at the 2016 European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS) meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, and the 2016 Gerontological Society of America (GSA) meeting in New Orleans, USA. The present work summarizes the most relevant aspects related to multimorbidity, with the ultimate goal to identify knowledge gaps and suggest future directions to approach this condition.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose to support older people with several healthcare needs in sustaining adequate functioning and independence, more proactive approaches are needed. This purpose of this study is to summarise the (cost-) effectiveness of proactive, multidisciplinary, integrated care programmes for older people in Dutch primary care. Methods design individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of eight clinically controlled trials. Setting primary care sector. Interventions combination of (i) identification of older people with complex problems by means of screening, followed by (ii) a multidisciplinary integrated care programme for those identified. Main outcome activities of daily living, i.e. a change on modified Katz-15 scale between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes quality of life (visual analogue scale 0–10), psychological (mental well-being scale Short Form Health Survey (SF)-36) and social well-being (single item, SF-36), quality-adjusted life years (Euroqol-5dimensions-3level (EQ-5D-3L)), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness. Analysis intention-to-treat analysis, two-stage IPD and subgroup analysis based on patient and intervention characteristics. Results included were 8,678 participants: median age of 80.5 (interquartile range 75.3; 85.7) years; 5,496 (63.3%) women. On the modified Katz-15 scale, the pooled difference in change between the intervention and control group was −0.01 (95% confidence interval −0.10 to 0.08). No significant differences were found in the other patient outcomes or subgroup analyses. Compared to usual care, the probability of the intervention group to be cost-effective was less than 5%. Conclusion compared to usual care at 1-year follow-up, strategies for identification of frail older people in primary care combined with a proactive integrated care intervention are probably not (cost-) effective.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To examine the effects of a computerized, game-based training on motor-cognitive performances, the transfer of training effects on untrained tasks, and the sustainability of training gains in people with dementia. Method: Ninety-nine individuals with a mean age of 82.9 (5.8) and dementia participated in a 10-week randomized controlled trial with three-month follow-up. The intervention group (IG) received a motor-cognitive training on (Physiomat®) including concurrent dual-tasks of balance control with cognitive demands (Physiomat®-Trail Making Tasks (PTMTs)). The control group (CG) performed non-specific, low-intensity exercises. Duration and accuracy at different complexity levels of trained and untrained PTMTs and the number of successfully performed tasks (PTMT score) were assessed. Results: Physiomat® training significantly improved the duration and accuracy at almost all complexity levels of trained (P ≤ 0.001-0.047, ηp2 = 0.065-0.589) and untrained PTMTs (P &lt; 0.001-0.005, ηp2 = 0.073-0.459). Significant effects were also found for the PTMT score of trained (P &lt; 0.001, ηp2 = 0.211) and untrained PTMTs (P &lt; 0.001, ηp2 = 0.184). Training gains were partly sustained at follow-up. Conclusion: Physiomat® is feasible and has the potential to sustainably improve motor-cognitive performances in people with dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: Although oral anticoagulants (OACs) are effective in preventing stroke in older people with atrial fibrillation (AF), they are often underused in this particularly high‐risk population. The aim of the present study was to assess the appropriateness of OAC prescription and its associated factors in hospitalized patients aged 65 years or older. Methods: Data were obtained from the retrospective phase of Simulation‐based Technologies to Improve the Appropriate Use of Oral Anticoagulants in Hospitalized Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (SIM‐AF) study, held in 32 Italian internal medicine and geriatric wards. The appropriateness of OAC prescription was assessed, grouping patients in those who were and were not prescribed OACs at hospital discharge. Multivariable logistic regression was used to establish factors independently associated with the appropriateness of OAC prescription. Results: A total of 328 patients were included in the retrospective phase of the study. Of these, almost 44% (N = 143) were inappropriately prescribed OACs, being mainly underprescribed or prescribed an inappropriate antithrombotic drug (N = 88). Among the patients prescribed OACs (N = 221), errors in the prescribed doses were the most frequent cause of inappropriate use (N = 55). Factors associated with a higher degree of patient frailty were inversely associated with the appropriateness of OAC prescription. Conclusions: In hospitalized older patients with AF, there is still a high prevalence of inappropriate OAC prescribing. Characteristics usually related to frailty are associated with the inappropriate prescribing. These findings point to the need for targeted interventions designed for internists and geriatricians, aimed at improving the appropriate prescribing of OACs in this complex and high‐risk population.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: In residential care homes and aged‐care facilities globally, between one in three and one in four residents may have diabetes, an often complex highly co‐morbid illness that leads to frailty, dependency, disability and reduced life expectancy. Residents with diabetes also have a high risk of hypoglycaemia, avoidable hospital admissions, and represent one of the most difficult challenges to health professionals and care staff in optimizing their diabetes and medical care. This detailed review examines the literature relating to care home diabetes over the last 25 years to assess what has been achieved in characterizing residents with diabetes, and what we know about the various but limited intervention studies that have been carried out internationally. The guidance and guidelines that have been published to assist clinicians in planning effective and safe care for this rather vulnerable group of people with diabetes are also reviewed. The review presents the first diagrammatic representation of a likely physiological cascade depicting the mainly irreversible functional decline a resident with diabetes might experience, provides modern principles of care for each resident with diabetes, and identifies what priority recommendations are required to be implemented if diabetes care is to improve. The review concludes that action is required since diabetes care still remains fragmented, sub‐optimal, and in need of investment, otherwise care home residents with diabetes will continue to have their needs unfulfilled.</ab>

        <ab>Interprofessional collaborative education and practice has become a cornerstone of optimal person-centered management in the current complex health care climate. This is especially important when working with older adults, many with multiple chronic conditions and challenging health care needs. This paper describes a feasibility study of the Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training 2.0 (GITT 2.0) program focused on providing interprofessional care to complex and frail older adults with multiple chronic conditions. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design facilitated program implementation and evaluation. Over three years (2013-2016), 65 graduate students from nursing, midwifery, social work, and pharmacy participated along with 25 preceptors. Participants were surveyed on their attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration pre and post-intervention and participated in focus groups. While attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration did not change quantitatively, focus groups revealed changes in language and enhanced perspectives of participants. Based on the evaluation data, the GITT 2.0 Toolkit was refined for use in interprofessional education and practice activities related to quality initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Providing care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is associated with a high risk of them developing complications. Aim: To survey the most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. Method: A retrospective descriptive survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. Findings: The persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. Conclusion: Frail older persons with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end‐of‐life care, should be prevented from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making house calls.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome resulting in decreased physiological reserves. Frailty and polypharmacy are common in older adults and the focus of extensive studies, although little is known about the impact they may have on each other. This is the first systematic review analysing the available evidence on the relationship between frailty and polypharmacy in older adults. Methods: Systematic review of quantitative studies. A comprehensive literature search for publications in English or Spanish was performed on MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database and PsycINFO in September 2017 without applying restrictions on the date of publication. Studies reporting any relationship between frailty and polypharmacy in older adults were considered. Results: A total of 25 publications were included, all of them observational studies. Evaluation of Fried's frailty criteria was the most common approach, followed by the Edmonton Frail Scale and FRAIL scale. Sixteen of 18 cross‐sectional analyses and five of seven longitudinal analyses demonstrated a significant association between an increased number of medications and frailty. The causal relationship is unclear and appears to be bidirectional. Our analysis of published data suggests that polypharmacy could be a major contributor to the development of frailty. Conclusions: A reduction of polypharmacy could be a cautious strategy to prevent and manage frailty. Further research is needed to confirm the possible benefits of reducing polypharmacy in the development, reversion or delay of frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisymptom, neurodegenerative disease affecting primarily older adults. With progression, many individuals become homebound and removed from coordinated, expert care, resulting in excess morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures in acute care settings and institutions. Home visit care models have achieved the triple aim of improving individual and population health while reducing costs in many frail, community‐dwelling geriatric cohorts. This study details a novel, interdisciplinary home visit program specifically designed for individuals with PD and related disorders and their family caregivers built upon best practice principles in the care of multimorbid older adults. At each quarterly home visit, a movement disorders–trained neurologist, social worker, and nurse work in parallel with the individual and caregiver to complete a history, physical, detailed medication reconciliation, psychosocial needs assessment, and home safety assessment. A comprehensive, person‐centered plan is agreed upon, referrals to community resources are made, standardized documentation is shared, and follow‐up communication is instituted. In the first 2 years, 272 visits were conducted with 85 individuals who represent one of the oldest, most disabled PD populations reported. Satisfaction with and retention in the program were high. This study represents the first translation of the success of interdisciplinary and home‐based geriatric care models to a population with a specific neurological disease. Preliminary evidence supports the need for such programs in vulnerable populations. Future studies will prospectively assess person‐centered outcomes, the effect of using telemedicine on sustainability, and cost effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: This study drew upon the ecological system theory to demonstrate rural-urban differences in the relationships between the availability of recreational facilities, physical activity (PA), functional health status, and depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older Chinese adults.Methods: Nationally representative data (n = 5949) from the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2013) were examined using the multigroup structural equation modeling approach.Results: The results suggest that higher availability of recreational facilities in the urban communities was associated with higher levels of leisure time physical activity (LTPA), better functional capacity, and less occurrence of depressive symptoms among urban participants. In contrast, LTPA engagement among rural participants was low and had negligible mitigating effects on functional decline and depressive symptoms. The findings also show that functional health status mediated the association between total PA and depressive symptoms in both rural and urban participants. However, high levels of total PA were directly associated with elevated depressive symptoms, suggesting that the context of PA and related socioeconomic factors might explain this association after the non-LTPA components were included.Conclusions: The findings highlight how complex patterns of intrapersonal, behavioral, and environmental correlates influence depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. The context of PA should be considered when creating targeted strategies to prevent depressive symptoms. As an inactive lifestyle evolves with China’s rapid urbanization, joint efforts from public health and urban planning should be made to promote LTPA and develop active living communities for achieving optimal health in later life.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community‐dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatricians are increasingly encountering older adults expressing suicidal wishes in the absence of overt mental illness. This is expected to grow as life expectancy increases. This article describes the case of an older adult who expressed the wish to end his life in the absence of a diagnosable mental illness. Although he had chronic medical illnesses, he was not terminally ill. The complex subject of rational suicide in elderly adults is approached from a clinician's perspective. Issues of ageism, gerontophobia, and changing perspectives on death are highlighted. The experience of being a Baby Boomer and its influence on rational suicide is reviewed. Finally, clinical topics such as aging, frailty, dependence on younger and healthier individuals, and the older adult's need for a sense of control are explored.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To propose the application of the concept of geriatric syndrome for common geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions and to suggest the necessity of developing effective evaluation methods for oral and maxillofacial frailty. Design: The concepts of frailty and geriatric syndrome based on multi‐morbidity and polypharmacy were applied to five common geriatric oral medicinal dysfunctional problems: salivary gland hypofunction (dry mouth), chronic oral mucosal pain disorders (burning mouth symptoms), taste disorders (taste disturbances), swallowing disorders (dysphagia), and oral and maxillofacial movement disorders (oromandibular dyskinesia and dystonia). Results: Each of the dysfunctions is caused by various kinds of diseases and/or conditions and medications, thus the concept of geriatric syndrome could be applied. These dysfunctions, suggested as components of oral and maxillofacial geriatric syndrome, are associated and interacted with each other in a complexity of vicious cycle. The resulting functional impairments caused by this syndrome can cause oral and maxillofacial frailty. Conclusions: Geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions could be better appreciated in the context of geriatric syndrome. The development of effective methods for evaluating the severity of these dysfunctions and the resulting frailty is essential.</ab>

        <ab>Background: checklists are increasingly proposed as a means to enhance safety and quality of care. However, their use has been met with variable levels of success. The Frailsafe project focused on introducing a checklist with the aim to increase completion of key clinical assessments and to facilitate communication for the care of older patients in acute admissions. Objectives: to examine the use of the Frailsafe checklist, including potential to contribute to improved safety, quality and reliability of care. Methods: 110 qualitative interviews and group discussions with healthcare professionals and other specialties, 172 h of ethnographic observation in 12 UK hospitals and reporting of high-level process data (completion of checklist and relevant frailty assessments). Qualitative analysis followed a thematic and theory-driven approach. Results: through use of the checklist, hospital teams identified limitations in their existing assessments (e.g. absence of delirium protocols) and practices (e.g. unnecessary catheter use). This contributed to hospitals reporting just 24.0% of sampled patients as having received all clinical assessments across key domains for this population for the duration of the project (1,687/7,021 checklists as fully completed). Staff perceptions and experiences of using the checklist varied significantly, primarily driven by the extent to which the aims of this quality improvement project aligned with local service priorities and pre-existing team communications styles. Conclusions: the Frailsafe checklist highlighted limitations with frailty assessment in acute care and motivated teams to review routine practices. Further work is needed to understand whether and how checklists can be embedded in complex, multidisciplinary care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To analyze gender differences in incidence and determinants of the components of the frailty phenotype. Method: A total of 1,413 older adults were selected in 2006. To estimate the incidence of each frailty component, only individuals who did not exhibit a given component at baseline (independently of the presence of other components) were included in the study. The variables of interest were socioeconomic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric factors and physical performance. The incidence of each component in 2010 was the outcome. Results: Unintentional weight loss and slowness were more incident in men up to 74 years of age. The other frailty components were more incident in women at all age groups, except weakness. Besides age, the determinants of incidence of the components of frailty were different between genders. Discussion: Strategies for preventing or delaying the installation of frailty need to address gender differences, considering the greater complexity in the network determinants among women.</ab>

        <ab>The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical problems. However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and researchers.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Detecting frailty in older adults scheduled for surgery is important to predict the occurrence of adverse outcomes, but because of its complexity, frailty screening is not commonly performed. The objective of the current study was to assess whether frailty can be screened for using automatically measured usual gait speed (UGS) and mid‐arm circumference (MAC) in the outpatient clinic. Design: Prospective, cross‐sectional study. Setting: Geriatric center of a tertiary hospital. Participants: Outpatients aged 65 and older (N = 113). Measurements: Frailty status was evaluated according to a multidimensional frailty score (MFS) using a comprehensive geriatric assessment, and participants were classified into 5 categories. UGS was evaluated by having participants walk through the clinic using an automated laser‐gated chronometer. MAC was recorded using a tape measure on a blood pressure cuff. Correlations between these two physical measurements and MFS were assessed. Results: The mean age of the 93 participants who successfully underwent UGS evaluation was 75.8 ± 4.7; 35 were male. In this population, the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2.2 ± 1.4, mean MFS was 4.1 ± 2.0, and 20 participants were considered to be at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Mean UGS was 0.75 ± 0.16 m/s, and mean MAC was 31.2 ± 1.9 cm); both physical parameters were correlated with MFS (UGS: standardized beta = −0.420, &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; &lt; .001; MAC: standardized beta = −0.457, &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; &lt; .001). Using UGS and MFS, the area under curve of receiver operating curve for determining which participants were at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes was 0.809 (&lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; &lt; .001). Conclusion: UGS and MAC are viable methods of clinically screening for frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives:Psychosocial resources (personal resources, social resources, and other) are important for coping with aging and impairment. The aim of this study was to describe the resources of older adults and to compare subgroups with frailty, complex health care needs, and/or mental disorders. Method:At the third follow-up of the large population-based German ESTHER study, 3124 elderly persons (aged 55–85) were included. Psychosocial resources were assessed during a home visit by trained study doctors by using a list of 26 different items. Resources were described for the total group, separated by sex, and for the three subgroups of persons with frailty, complex health care needs, and mental disorders. Results:Family, self-efficacy, and financial security were the most frequently reported resources of older adults. Women and men showed significant differences in their self-perceived resources. Personal resources (self-efficacy, optimism, mastery), social resources, and financial security were reported significantly less frequently by frail persons, persons with complex health care needs, and mentally ill older adults compared to non-impaired participants. Apart from external support, patients who experienced complex health care needs reported resources less frequently compared to frail and mentally ill patients. Conclusion:Coping resources in older adults are associated with sex and impairment. Evaluation and support of personal resources of frail or mentally ill persons or individuals with complex health care needs should be integrated in the therapeutic process.</ab>

        <ab>The concept of multimorbidity has attracted growing interest over recent years, and more latterly with the publication of specific guidelines on multimorbidity by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Increasingly it is recognised that this is of particular relevance to practitioners caring for older adults, where multimorbidity may be more complex due to the overlap of physical and mental health disorders, frailty and polypharmacy. The overlap of frailty and multimorbidity in particular is likely to be due to the widespread health deficit accumulation, leading in some cases to functional impairment. The NICE guidelines identify 'target groups' who may benefit from a tailored approach to care that takes their multimorbidity into account, and make a number of research recommendations. Management includes a proactive individualised assessment and care plan, which improves quality of life by reducing treatment burden, adverse events, and unplanned or uncoordinated care.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Little is known about whether potentially preventable spending is concentrated among a subset of high-cost Medicare beneficiaries.&lt;bold&gt;Objective: &lt;/bold&gt;To determine the proportion of total spending that is potentially preventable across distinct subpopulations of high-cost Medicare beneficiaries.&lt;bold&gt;Design: &lt;/bold&gt;Beneficiaries in the highest 10% of total standardized individual spending were defined as "high-cost" patients, using a 20% sample of Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2012. The following 6 subpopulations were defined using a claims-based algorithm: nonelderly disabled, frail elderly, major complex chronic, minor complex chronic, simple chronic, and relatively healthy. Potentially preventable spending was calculated by summing costs for avoidable emergency department visits using the Billings algorithm plus inpatient and associated 30-day postacute costs for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs). The amount and proportion of potentially preventable spending were then compared across the high-cost subpopulations and by individual ACSCs.&lt;bold&gt;Setting: &lt;/bold&gt;Medicare.&lt;bold&gt;Participants: &lt;/bold&gt;6 112 450 Medicare beneficiaries.&lt;bold&gt;Measurements: &lt;/bold&gt;Proportion of spending deemed potentially preventable.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;In 2012, 4.8% of Medicare spending was potentially preventable, of which 73.8% was incurred by high-cost patients. Despite making up only 4% of the Medicare population, high-cost frail elderly persons accounted for 43.9% of total potentially preventable spending ($6593 per person). High-cost nonelderly disabled persons accounted for 14.8% of potentially preventable spending ($3421 per person) and the major complex chronic group for 11.2% ($3327 per person). Frail elderly persons accounted for most spending related to admissions for urinary tract infections, dehydration, heart failure, and bacterial pneumonia.&lt;bold&gt;Limitation: &lt;/bold&gt;Potential misclassification in the identification of preventable spending and lack of detailed clinical data in administrative claims.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/bold&gt;Potentially preventable spending varied across Medicare subpopulations, with the majority concentrated among frail elderly persons.&lt;bold&gt;Primary Funding Source: &lt;/bold&gt;The Commonwealth Fund.</ab>

        <ab>In the July 2016 issue of this journal, Dr. Mary Tinetti proposed that geriatric medicine abandon attempts to increase the numbers of board-certified geriatricians and change focus to the development of a 'small elite workforce.' What would be gained and what sacrificed by accepting this challenge? We agree that the best clinical use of a scarce resource, specialty trained geriatricians, is to care for frail, complex, severely ill elderly adults and to help design and study novel interventions in research, education, and care models to improve the care of all older adults, but for this to happen, all other providers must attain specific competency in the care of older adults. This article responds and discusses alternative pathways for teaching geriatrics care, training specialists, and geriatrics fellows.</ab>

        <ab>In this commentary article, we describe the impact that an ageing population is having on the nature of major trauma seen in emergency departments. The proportion of major trauma victims who are older people is rapidly increasing and a fall from standing is now the most common mechanism of injury in major trauma. Potential barriers to effective care of this patient group are highlighted, including: a lack of consensus regarding triage criteria; potentially misleading physiological parameters within triage criteria; non-linear patient presentations and diagnostic nihilism. We argue that the complex ongoing care and rehabilitation needs of older patients with major trauma may be best met through Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). Furthermore, the use of frailty screening tools may facilitate more informed early decisionmaking in relation to treatment interventions in older trauma victims. We call for geriatric medicine and emergency medicine departments to collaborate--equipping urgent care staff with the basic competencies necessary to initiate CGA should be a priority, and geriatricians have a key role to play in delivery of such educational interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pain management is a cornerstone of palliative care. The clinical issues encountered by physicians when managing pain in patients dying with advanced dementia, and how these may impact on prescribing and treatment, are unknown Aim: To explore physicians' experiences of pain management for patients nearing the end of life, the impact of these on prescribing and treatment approaches, and the methods employed to overcome these challenges Design: Qualitative, semi-structured interview study exploring barriers to and facilitators of pain management, prescribing and treatment decisions, and training needs. Thematic analysis was used to elicit key themes. Setting/participants: A total of 23 physicians, responsible for treating patients with advanced dementia approaching the end of life, were recruited from primary care (n = 9), psychiatry (n = 7) and hospice care (n = 7) Results: Six themes emerged: diagnosing pain, complex prescribing and treatment approaches, side effects and adverse events, route of administration, importance of sharing knowledge and training needs. Knowledge exchange was often practised through liaison with physicians from other specialities. Cross-speciality mentoring and the creation of knowledge networks were believed to improve pain management in this patient population Conclusion: Pain management in end-stage dementia is complex, requiring cross-population of knowledge between palliative care specialists and non-specialists, in addition to collateral information provided by other health professionals and patients' families. Regular, cost- and time-effective mentoring and ongoing professional development are perceived to be essential in empowering physicians to meet clinical challenges in this area.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To examine how medical complexity modifies the relationship between enrollment in Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) home-based primary care ( HBPC) and hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions ( ACSC) for veterans with diabetes mellitus and whether the effect of HBPC on hospitalizations varies according to clinical condition. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting VA and non- VA hospitals. Participants VA beneficiaries aged 67 and older with diabetes mellitus and enrolled in Medicare (N = 364,972). Measurements Instrumental variables regression models were used to estimate the effect of HBPC enrollment on hospitalization for ACSCs (defined according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators) overall and in subgroups stratified according to medical complexity. Models were also estimated for each ACSC to determine which conditions were most sensitive to HBPC. Distance from the veteran's residence to the nearest HBPC site was used as the instrumental variable. Results HBPC was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations (odds ratio ( OR) = 0.35 per person-month, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.30-0.42). For veterans in the highest quartile of medical complexity, HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.93), whereas for those in the lowest quartile, HBPC was associated with more ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 33.2, 95% CI = 4.6-240.1). HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs. Conclusion HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs in veterans with diabetes mellitus but only in the most medically complex individuals. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate targeting and suggests that the effect of HBPC is attributable to its comprehensive approach rather than condition-specific interventions.</ab>

        <ab>At the beginning of the 21st century, one in five of UK residents can expect to see their 100th birthday and one in four people are aged 60 years or older. The UK has an ageing population. With older age comes an increasing variety of comorbidities that have an impact not only on an individual’s quality of life but also on healthcare resources. Older people account for a rapidly rising cohort of individuals admitted to hospital, often with complex needs, and this can require achieving venous access. Venepuncture and cannulation are the most commonly performed invasive procedures in health care today. This article aims to increase awareness of vascular access challenges in older patients so the potential for complications relating to venepuncture, cannulation and infusion therapy can be minimised, thereby improving their overall quality of care. The article will look at the healthcare challenges facing the older population, and the importance of a holistic approach to assess their vascular access needs to deliver optimum care.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;We currently still lack valid methods to dynamically measure resilience for stressors before the appearance of adverse health outcomes that hamper well-being. Quantifying an older adult's resilience in an early stage would aid complex decision-making in health care. Translating complex dynamical systems theory to humans, we hypothesized that three dynamical indicators of resilience (variance, temporal autocorrelation, and cross-correlation) in time series of self-rated physical, mental, and social health were associated with frailty levels in older adults.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;We monitored self-rated physical, mental, and social health during 100 days using daily visual analogue scale questions in 22 institutionalized older adults (mean age 84.0, SD: 5.9 years). Frailty was determined by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) frailty index. The resilience indicators (variance, temporal autocorrelation, and cross-correlation) were calculated using multilevel models.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;The self-rated health time series of frail elderly exhibited significantly elevated variance in the physical, mental, and social domain, as well as significantly stronger cross-correlations between all three domains, as compared to the nonfrail group (all P &lt; 0.001). Temporal autocorrelation was not significantly associated with frailty.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;We found supporting evidence for two out of three hypothesized resilience indicators to be related to frailty levels in older adults. By mirroring the dynamical resilience indicators to a frailty index, we delivered a first empirical base to validate and quantify the construct of systemic resilience in older adults in a dynamic way.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. Comprehension of risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options has been shown to be poor among patients referred for cardiac interventions. Patients’ values and preferences are rarely explicitly sought. An increasing proportion of frail and older patients are undergoing complex cardiac surgical procedures with increased risk of both mortality and prolonged institutional care. We sought input from patients and caregivers to determine the optimal approach to decision making in this vulnerable patient population. Methods. Focus groups were held with both providers and former patients. Three focus groups were convened for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), Valve, or CABG +Valve patients ≥ 70 y old (2-y post-op, ≤ 8-wk post-op, complicated post-op course) (n = 15). Three focus groups were convened for Intermediate Medical Care Unit (IMCU) nurses, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses, surgeons, anesthesiologists and cardiac intensivists (n = 20). We used a semi-structured interview format to ask questions surrounding the informed consent process. Transcribed audio data was analyzed to develop consistent and comprehensive themes. Results. We identified 5 main themes that influence the decision making process: educational barriers, educational facilitators, patient autonomy and perceived autonomy, patient and family expectations of care, and decision making advocates. All themes were influenced by time constraints experienced in the current consent process. Patient groups expressed a desire to receive information earlier in their care to allow time to identify personal values and preferences in developing plans for treatment. Both groups strongly supported a formal approach for shared decision making with a decisional coach to provide information and facilitate communication with the care team. Conclusions. Identifying the barriers and facilitators to patient and caretaker engagement in decision making is a key step in the development of a structured, patient-centered SDM approach. Intervention early in the decision process, the use of individualized decision aids that employ graphic risk presentations, and a dedicated decisional coach were identified by patients and providers as approaches with a high potential for success. The impact of such a formalized shared decision making process in cardiac surgery on decisional quality will need to be formally assessed. Given the trend toward older and frail patients referred for complex cardiac procedures, the need for an effective shared decision making process is compelling.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose:The aim of this study was to explore older people’s experiences of living with neurogenic claudication (NC), their preferences for physiotherapy treatment provision and associated outcomes in order to inform an intervention to be tested in a clinical trial. Method:Patients with a diagnosis of NC and/or lumbar spinal stenosis were recruited through a UK NHS tertiary care center. Semi-structured interviews and self-report questionnaires were used to obtain data. A thematic analysis was conducted. Results:15 participants were recruited; half were classed as frail older adults. Pain and the threat of pain was a prominent feature of participants’ experience of NC. This led to a loss of engagement in meaningful activities and sense of self. Discourses of ageing influenced experiences as well as treatment preferences, particularly the acceptability of walking aids. A combination of one-to-one and group setting for treatment was preferred. Outcome preferences related to re-engagement in meaningful activities and pain reduction. Limitations relate to generalisability of the findings for NC patients not under physiotherapy treatment. Conclusion:We have obtained important findings about older people’s experiences of living with NC and preferences for physiotherapy treatment and outcomes. These will be incorporated into an evidence-based intervention and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.Implications for rehabilitationOlder people living with NC want to get back to meaningful activities and learn how to live with the threat of pain.Allied health professionals (AHPs) should be sensitive to the complex and ambiguous ways in which older people live with ageing and age-related decline.AHPs are in a position to support patients’ successful transition to the use of walking aids thereby reducing stigmatizing effects and increasing activity.AHPs should consider a mixture of one-to-one and group classes to enable rehabilitation for older NC patients.</ab>

        <ab>Advances in understanding the biological bases of aging have intellectually revitalized the field of geriatric psychiatry and broadened its scope to include promoting successful aging and studying resilience factors in older adults. To describe the process by which this paradigm shift has occurred and illustrate its implications for treatment and research of late-life brain disorders, late-life depression is discussed as a prototype case. Prior phases of geriatric psychiatry research were focused on achieving depressive symptom relief, outlining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between older and younger adults, and identifying moderators of treatment response. Building on this work, current geriatric psychiatry researchers have begun to disentangle the etiologic complexity in late-life depression by focusing on the causative aging-related processes involved, identifying both neurobiological and behavioral intermediates, and finally delineating depression subtypes that are distinguishable by their underlying biology and the treatment approach required. In this review, we discuss several age-related processes that are critical to the development of late-life mood disorders, outline implications of these processes for the clinical evaluation and management of later-life psychiatric disorders, and finally put forth suggestions for better integrating aging and developmental processes into the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Because frailty is a complex phenomenon associated with poor outcomes, the identification of patient profiles with different care needs might be of greater practical help than to look for a unifying definition. This study aimed at identifying aging phenotypes and their related outcomes in order to recognize frailty in hospitalized older patients.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;Patients aged 65 or older enrolled in internal medicine and geriatric wards participating in the REPOSI registry. Relationships among variables associated to sociodemographic, physical, cognitive, functional, and medical status were explored using a multiple correspondence analysis. The hierarchical cluster analysis was then performed to identify possible patient profiles. Multivariable logistic regression was used to verify the association between clusters and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and 3-month postdischarge mortality and rehospitalization).&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;2,841 patients were included in the statistical analyses. Four clusters were identified: the healthiest (I); those with multimorbidity (II); the functionally independent women with osteoporosis and arthritis (III); and the functionally dependent oldest old patients with cognitive impairment (IV). There was a significantly higher in-hospital mortality in Cluster II (odds ratio [OR] = 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-4.46) and Cluster IV (OR = 5.15, 95% CI = 2.58-10.26) and a higher 3-month mortality in Cluster II (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.13-2.44) and Cluster IV (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15-3.00) than in Cluster I.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Using alternative analytical techniques among hospitalized older patients, we could distinguish different frailty phenotypes, differently associated with adverse events. The identification of different patient profiles can help defining the best care strategy according to specific patient needs.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose of the Study: Janus, the two-faced, Roman god of beginnings and transitions, is used as a metaphor to explore our personal narratives and our quantitative research on the experiences of older women with dementia in long-term care (LTC). Two research questions are addressed: (a) How do our quantitative data map onto our mothers' experiences? (b) What lessons do our mothers' experiences offer for the care of older women with dementia? Design and Methods: Informed by a life-course perspective, we triangulate administrative data on 3,717 women with dementia receiving LTC in British Columbia, Canada, with personal narratives--the stories of our mothers who made the transition from home care into residential (nursing home) care. Results: Our quantitative data reveal that the home care to residential care transition is the most common LTC trajectory for women with dementia who are most likely to be widowed and living alone in suburban areas. On entry into residential care, they exhibit greater frailty in terms of activities of daily living, cognition, aggression, and incontinence. Our personal narrative data on our mothers reveals that the relatively straightforward pathways through LTC for women with dementia, are often considerably more complex in a real-world context. Attention is drawn to the public and private services, hospitalization patterns, and substantial communication gaps experienced by our moms and families. Implications: A life-course perspective, and qualitative and quantitative data facilitate understanding the care journeys--health and service trajectories of older women with dementia.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To explore barriers to anticoagulation in older adults with atrial fibrillation ( AF) at high risk of stroke and to identify opportunities for interventions that might increase use of oral anticoagulants ( OACs). Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Two large community-based AF cohorts. Participants Individuals with ischemic stroke surviving hospitalization (N = 1,405, mean age 79). Measurements Using structured chart review, reasons for nonuse of OAC were identified, and 1-year poststroke survival was assessed. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of OAC nonuse. Results Median CHA2 DS2- VASc score was 5, yet 44% of participants were not prescribed an OAC at discharge. The most-frequent (nonmutually exclusive) physician reasons for not prescribing OAC included fall risk (26.7%), poor prognosis (19.3%), bleeding history (17.1%), participant or family refusal (14.9%), older age (11.0%), and dementia (9.4%). Older age (odds ratio ( OR) = 8.96, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 5.01-16.04 for aged ≥85 vs &lt;65) and disability ( OR = 12.58, 95% CI = 5.82-27.21 for severe vs no deficit) were the most-important independent predictors of nonuse of OACs. By 1 year, 42.5% of those not receiving an OAC at discharge had died, versus 19.1% of those receiving an OAC ( P &lt; .001), far higher than recurrent stroke rates. Conclusion Despite very high stroke risk, more than 40% of participants were not discharged with an OAC. Dominant reasons included fall risk, poor prognosis, older age, and dementia. These individuals' high 1-year mortality rate confirmed their high level of comorbidity. To improve anticoagulation decisions and outcomes in this population, future research should focus on strategies to mitigate fall risk, improve assessment of risks and benefits of anticoagulation in individuals with AF, and determine whether newer anticoagulants are safer in complex elderly and frail individuals.</ab>

        <ab>Interprofessional education (IPE) for healthcare professionals is important in Japan because of its rapidly aging population and increasingly complex healthcare needs. However, no tools have been validated in the Japanese context to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitudes towards, or readiness for, IPE. The professional version of the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) with 23 items was selected for cross-cultural adaptation because it has been widely used internationally and a Japanese edition of the student version has already been developed. We followed a guideline for cross-cultural adaptation and subsequently conducted factor analysis with 368 responses from over 16 professions. Face and content validity was confirmed through the translation process. We obtained four factors with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha &gt; 0.7). These results were similar to those of the original UK study, apart from one factor being divided into two different factors in this study. Studies are required to further confirm the rigor and generalisability of the results; however, the Japanese RIPLS can be used to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitudes towards IPE, which can eventually lead to a better IPE development for healthcare professionals in Japan.</ab>

        <ab>Background: understanding how best to provide palliative care for frail older people with non-malignant conditions is an international priority. We aimed to develop a community-based episodic model of short-term integrated palliative and supportive care (SIPS) based on the views of service users and other key stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Method: transparent expert consultations with health professionals, voluntary sector and carer representatives including a consensus survey; and focus groups with older people and carers were used to generate recommendations for the SIPS model. Discussions focused on three key components of the model: potential benefit of SIPS, timing of delivery and processes of integrated working between specialist palliative care and generalist practitioners. Content and descriptive analysis was employed and findings were integrated across the data sources. Findings: we conducted two expert consultations (n = 63), a consensus survey (n = 42) and three focus groups (n = 17). Potential benefits of SIPS included holistic assessment, opportunity for end of life discussion, symptom management and carer reassurance. Older people and carers advocated early access to SIPS, while other stakeholders proposed delivery based on complex symptom burden. A priority for integrated working was the assignment of a key worker to co-ordinate care, but the assignment criteria remain uncertain. Interpretation: key stakeholders agree that a model of SIPS for frail older people with non-malignant conditions has potential benefits within community settings, but differ in opinion on the optimal timing and indications for this service. Our findings highlight the importance of consulting all key stakeholders in model development prior to feasibility evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. Background Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. Design Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial ( AGe- FIT). Methods Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. Results Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. Conclusions Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the development of a conceptual framework for explaining the etiology of violence in later life by various groups involved in the field of elder abuse. In this study, we explore this through eight focus groups with different professionals involved in the field of elder abuse and older persons themselves and in interviews with 35 experts in the field. Our findings show that dependency, vulnerability, power and control, social isolation, stress, and care burden play a central role in their explanations for the occurrence of violence in later life. The role of a history of violence in violence in later life is equivocal. The complexity and ambiguity of dependency and vulnerability, the notion of mutual dependency, and diverse attitudes and expectations toward them that arise with the aging process are distinct features of violence in later life that were found.</ab>

        <ab>The incidence and prevalence of most cardiovascular disorders increase with age, and cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is the leading cause of death and major disability in adults aged 75 and older. Despite the effect of CVD on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in older adults, individuals aged 75 and older have been markedly underrepresented in most major cardiovascular trials, and virtually all trials have excluded older adults with complex comorbidities, significant physical or cognitive disabilities, frailty, or residence in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of older adults typical of those encountered in routine clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision-making, and recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these objectives, a detailed review was conducted of current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/ AHA) and American Stroke Association ( ASA) guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older adults. A pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision-making in older adults with CVD was found, as well as a paucity of data on the effect of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on outcomes that are particularly important to older adults, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large population-based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older adults representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to older adults in the study design. The results of these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines applicable to older adults and enhance person-centered care of older individuals with CVD in the United States and around the world.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To identify factors associated with end-of-life (EoL) transition from usual place of care to the hospital as place of death for people aged 75 and older. Design Population-based mortality follow-back survey. Setting Deaths over 6 months in 2012 in two unitary authorities in England covering 800 square miles with more than 1 million residents. Participants A random sample of people aged 75 and older who died in a care home or hospital and all those who died at home or in a hospice unit (N = 882). Cases were identified from death registrations. The person who registered the death (a relative for 98.9%) completed the survey. Measurements The main outcome was EoL transition to the hospital as place of death versus no EoL transition to the hospital. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to examine factors (illness, demographic, environmental) related to EoL transition to the hospital. Results Four hundred forty-three (50.2%) individuals responded, describing the care of the people who died. Most died from nonmalignant conditions (76.3%) at a mean age of 87.4 ± 6.4. One hundred forty-six (32.3%) transitioned to the hospital and died there. Transition was more likely for individuals with respiratory disease than for those with cancer (prevalence ratio ( PR) = 2.07, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 1.42-3.01) and for people with severe breathlessness ( PR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.12-3.43). Transition was less likely if EoL preferences had been discussed with a healthcare professional ( PR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.42-0.88) and when there was a key healthcare professional ( PR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.95). Conclusion To reduce EoL transition to the hospital for older people, there needs to be improved management of breathlessness in the community and better access to a key healthcare professional skilled in coordinating care, communication, facilitating complex discussions, and in planning for future care.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. Background Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched. Design An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism. Methods The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. Results Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions. Conclusions This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention. Relevance to clinical practice Increased focus on musculoskeletal conditions and moving and handling implications is required.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines the reflective discourses of medical, nursing, and paramedic students participating in interprofessional education (IPE) activities in the context of aged-care clinical placements. The intent of the research is to explore how students engage with their interprofessional colleagues in an IPE assessment and care planning activity and elucidate how students configure their role as learners within the context of a non-traditional aged-care training environment. Research participants included cohorts of volunteer medical (n = 61), nursing (n = 46), and paramedic (n = 20) students who were on clinical placements at two large teaching aged-care facilities in Tasmania, Australia, over a period of 18 months. A total of 39 facilitated focus group discussions were undertaken with cohorts of undergraduate student volunteers from three health professions between February 2013 and October 2014. Thematic analysis of focus group transcripts was assisted by NVIVO software and verified through secondary coding and member checking procedures. With an acceptable level of agreement across two independent coders, four themes were identified from student focus group transcripts that described the IPE relations and perceptions of the aged-care environment. Emergent themes included reinforcement of professional hierarchies, IPE in aged care perceived as mundane and extraneous, opportunities for reciprocal teaching and learning, and understanding interprofessional roles. While not all students can be engaged with IPE activities in aged care, our evidence suggests that within 1 week of clinical placements there is a possibility to develop reciprocal professional relations, affirm a positive identity within a collaborative healthcare team, and support the health of vulnerable older adults with complex care needs. These important clinical learnings support aged-care-based IPE as a potentially powerful context for undergraduate learning in the 21st Century.</ab>

        <ab>The question of exactly what frailty is and what that may mean for patients is extremely complex. This is a very conceptual problem requiring a broad and long-term solution. It is not a disease or a condition that can be treated in isolation. Frailty is a collection of contributing factors that culminate in an individual being susceptible to poorer outcomes following health-care interventions and minor illness. The solution to such a complex problem lies in engaging and empowering staff to understand and champion frailty. Once better understood, it will be possible to educate and enable this workforce to recognise the signs of frailty, poor prognosis and patients requiring more specialised palliative care. Informing staff working within a health-care economy of this issue must be the first step in a shift towards managing patients with frailty more appropriately, and streaming their care towards the correct care pathways sooner. This article discusses what frailty is, what it may mean for patients, and attempts to expand on why the construct of frailty is a prevalent issue for community nurses. The link between frailty and mortality is discussed and how targeted appropriate advanced care planning may be used to address this demographic challenge.</ab>

        <ab>This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.</ab>

CGA is a holistic assessment model, which is designed to determine a frail older person's medical and mental health status, as well as functional, social and environmental issues. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised care planning. The case study presented explores the application of CGA with an 89-year-old patient with complex health and social care needs. It demonstrates how a hospital admission was avoided and the patient's health outcomes improved, by using a nurse-led systematic approach to assessment and by careful consideration of CGA domains.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To describe how the included items in three different scales, Downton Fall Risk Index, the short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment and the Modified Norton Scale are associated to severe outcomes as falls, weight loss and pressure ulcers. Background Falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are common adverse events among nursing home residents and risk scoring are common preventive activities, mainly focusing on single risks. In Sweden the three scales are routinely used together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention. Design Longitudinal quantitative study. Methods Descriptive analyses and Cox regression analyses. Results Only 4% scored no risk for any of these serious events. Longitudinal risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating increased risks. This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general condition. There were no statistical significant differences between residents categorised at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of general health were most important. Conclusions Risk tendencies for falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are high in nursing homes, and when measure them at the same time the majority will have several of these risks. Items assessing mobility or items affecting mobility were of most importance. Care processes can always be improved and this study can add to the topic. Relevance to clinical practice A more comprehensive view is needed and prevention can not only be based on total scores. Mobility is an important factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both as a risk factor and a protective factor. This involves a challenge for care - to keep the inmates physical active and at the same time prevent falls.</ab>

        <ab>As a treatment for depression, behavioural activation is as effective as cognitive behaviour therapy but less complex. Its simplicity and the absence of a cognitive component mean that it may be more suitable for older adults. However, existing reviews of the evidence are meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, which tend to exclude subjects who are medically frail, cognitively impaired or have comorbid mental health problems. Eleven studies were examined to determine whether behaviourally focused treatments are suitable for older adults, including members of these client groups. The evidence suggests that behavioural activation that is delivered by non-therapists who are trained in the intervention can reduce depressive symptoms in older adults with comorbid medical problems. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.</ab>

        <ab>Background Older people with cognitive impairment represent a large group of patients in acute care settings. Research show that these acute care environments can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them. Aim This study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff. Method A purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. Findings Caring for older, acutely ill cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed. Conclusion The comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' personal-professional integrity.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives:This paper presents preliminary baseline data from a prospective study of nursing home adaptation that attempts to capture the complexity of residents' adaptive resources by examining psychological, social, and biological variables from a longitudinal conceptual framework. Our emphasis was on validating an index of allostasis. Method:In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes. Results:Our results supported both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social support, optimism, and hope. Conclusion:Although these results are based on a small sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and physical resources and well-being.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The aim of the present study was to develop a valid Geriatric ICF Core Set reflecting relevant health-related problems of community-living older adults without dementia.Methods: A Delphi study was performed in order to reach consensus (≥70% agreement) on second-level categories from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The Delphi panel comprised 41 older adults, medical and non-medical experts. Content validity of the set was tested in a cross-sectional study including 267 older adults identified as frail or having complex care needs.Results: Consensus was reached for 30 ICF categories in the Delphi study (fourteen Body functions, ten Activities and Participation and six Environmental Factors categories). Content validity of the set was high: the prevalence of all the problems was &gt;10%, except ford530 Toileting. The most frequently reported problems wereb710 Mobility of joint functions(70%),b152 Emotional functions(65%) andb455 Exercise tolerance functions(62%). No categories had missing values.Conclusion: The final Geriatric ICF Core Set is a comprehensive and valid set of 29 ICF categories, reflecting the most relevant health-related problems among community-living older adults without dementia. This Core Set may contribute to optimal care provision and support of the older population.Implications for RehabilitationThe Geriatric ICF Core Set may provide a practical tool for gaining an understanding of the relevant health-related problems of community-living older adults without dementia.The Geriatric ICF Core Set may be used in primary care practice as an assessment tool in order to tailor care and support to the needs of older adults.The Geriatric ICF Core Set may be suitable for use in multidisciplinary teams in integrated care settings, since it is based on a broad range of problems in functioning.Professionals should pay special attention to health problems related to mobility and emotional functioning since these are the most prevalent problems in community-living older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Geriatric Care Model ( GCM), an integrated care model for frail older adults based on the Chronic Care Model, with that of usual care. Design Economic evaluation alongside a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting Primary care (35 practices) in two regions in the Netherlands. Participants Community-dwelling older adults who were frail according to their primary care physicians and the Program on Research for Integrating Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy case-finding tool questionnaire (N = 1,147). Intervention The GCM consisted of the following components: a regularly scheduled in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment by a practice nurse followed by a customized care plan, management and training of practice nurses by a geriatric expert team, and coordination of care through community network meetings and multidisciplinary team consultations of individuals with complex care needs. Measurements Outcomes were measured every 6 months and included costs from a societal perspective, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Survey ( SF-12) physical ( PCS) and mental component summary ( MCS) scales), functional limitations (Katz activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), and quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D. Results Multilevel regression models adjusted for time and baseline confounders showed no significant differences in costs ($356, 95% confidence interval = −$488-1,134) and outcomes between intervention and usual care phases. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that, for the SF-12 PCS and MCS, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.76 if decision-makers are willing to pay $30,000 per point improvement on the SF-12 scales (range 0-100). For all other outcomes the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was low. Conclusion Because the GCM was not cost-effective compared to usual care after 24 months of follow-up, widespread implementation in its current form is not recommended.</ab>

        <ab>Social workers play a key role in the delivery of interdisciplinary health care. However, in the past decade, concerns have been raised about social work's sustainability and contributions in a changing health care sector. These changes come at a time when older patients are more complex and vulnerable than ever before. In this article, using a strengths-based approach, the authors examine the key contributions made by social workers working with older patients with hip fracture as they strive to achieve successful care transitions. Twenty-five interviews with health care professionals (HCPs) were conducted and then analyzed using an analytical coding framework. Although social workers are vital, they are often underused and overlooked in the care of hip fracture patients. The authors sketch the important contributions that social workers make to care transitions after hip fracture, specifically informational continuity; patient--HCP relational continuity; conflict resolution; mediation among family, patient, and HCP (for example, doctors and nurses); collaboration with family caregivers and community supports; and relocation counseling.</ab>

        <ab>Population aging and successful drug therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) management mean that more people are living longer with HIV. As these individuals age, they become more at risk of developing other chronic health conditions which will have many implications for disease management and choice of care setting. As people living with HIV turn to home care and long-term care (LTC) settings for care, understanding the particular needs of this population is becoming increasingly important. This study sought to describe the sociodemographic, clinical, and social attributes of people living with HIV in the home care and institutional environments. This work involved secondary analysis of data collected from both the international Resident Assessment Instruments (interRAI) home care and minimum data set instruments in the Canadian province of Ontario. Descriptive analysis was used to describe key attributes of people living with and without HIV in LTC, complex continuing care, and home care settings. A comparison of differences between people living with HIV across the three environments was also done using Chi-square analysis. People living with HIV were often younger, male and unmarried than other populations in the care settings studied. Together with specific health needs associated with issues like mental health and social isolation, people living with HIV represent a population with complex and distinctive health needs. Finding ways to better understand the needs of this vulnerable population will help to develop strategies to provide better formal and informal care and improve the quality of life of this group. interRAI standardized assessment instruments may be important tools for meeting this challenge.</ab>

        <ab>Physical therapists often treat older adults with marked deficits in physical function secondary to an acute hospitalization. These deficits are often collectively defined as hospital-associated deconditioning (HAD). However, there is a paucity of evidence that objectively demonstrates the efficacy of physical therapy for older adults with HAD. Older adults with HAD represent a highly variable and complex population and thus may be difficult to study and develop effective interventions for using our current rehabilitation strategies. This perspective article outlines an innovative framework to operationalize and treat older adults with HAD. This framework may help therapists apply emerging exercise strategies to this population and facilitate additional research to support the total value of physical therapy for older adults in postacute care settings--with value measured not only by improvements in physical performance but perhaps also by reduced rates of disability development, rehospitalization, and institutionalization.</ab>

        <ab>Few studies have investigated loneliness in relation to health care consumption among frail older people. The aim of this study was to examine loneliness, health-related quality of life ( HRQo L), and health complaints in relation to health care consumption of in- and outpatient care among frail older people living at home. The study, with a cross-sectional design, comprised a sample of 153 respondents aged from 65 years (mean age 81.5 years) or older, who lived at home and were frail. Data was collected utilising structured interviews in the respondent's home assessing demographic data, loneliness, HRQo L and health complaints. Patient administrative registers were used to collect data on health care consumption. Loneliness was the dependent variable in the majority of the analyses and dichotomised. For group comparisons Student′s t-test, Mann- Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used. The results showed that 60% of the respondents had experienced loneliness during the previous year, at least occasionally. The study identified that lonely respondents had a lower HRQo L (p = 0.022), with a higher total number of reported health complaints (p = 0.001), and used more outpatient services including more acute visits at the emergency department, compared to not lonely respondents (p = 0.026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a depressed mood was independently associated to total use of outpatient care ( B = 7.4, p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, it might not be loneliness, per se, that is the reason for seeking health care. However, reasons for using health care services are difficult to determine due to the complex situation for the frail older person. To avoid emergency department visits and to benefit the well-being of the frail older person, interventions targeting the complex health situation, including loneliness, are suggested.</ab>

        <ab>The academic geriatrics community has provided outstanding leadership in addressing frailty and complexity in older adults, but a minority of older adults are frail. Although resources to treat older adults are limited, and it is appropriate to focus clinical efforts on those with frailty and multimorbidity, there is also important expertise that can be brought to bear on the health of ALL older adults. A review of the literature suggests that attention to healthy or successful aging has failed to keep pace with the focus on frailty. By providing leadership to promote successful aging, the quality of life of older adults across the spectrum can be improved and transitions to frailty reduced. The template that leaders have established in understanding frailty-defining and operationalizing it, understanding outcomes, identifying pathophysiology-can be used as an approach to successful aging. Several community-based programs have been successful in promoting successful aging. These are potentially highly scalable and could have a substantial effect on the aging population, but their essential components need to be better understood. The geriatrics community is uniquely positioned to take on this role. This is a critical time to work together to make the lives of all older adults as healthy and fulfilling as possible.</ab>

        <ab>Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to analyse effects of a comprehensive continuum of care (intervention group) on frail older persons' life satisfaction, as compared to those receiving usual care (control group). The intervention included geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes. Background Improvements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life satisfaction are not well explored. Design Randomised controlled study. Methods The validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12 months after the baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as well as six- to 12-month follow-ups. Results Older persons who received the intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who received usual care, between 6 and 12 month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Conclusions A comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Relevance to clinical practice Frail older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.</ab>

        <ab>Background and purpose - We reviewed the current state of research on microRNAs in age-related diseases in cartilage and bone. Methods - PubMed searches were conducted using separate terms to retrieve articles on (1) the role of microRNAs on aging and tissue degeneration, (2) specific microRNAs that influence cellular and organism senescence, (3) microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions, and (4) the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions. Results - An increasing number of studies have identified microRNAs associated with cellular aging and tissue degeneration. Specifically in regard to frailty, microRNAs have been found to influence the onset and course of age-related musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and posttraumatic arthritis. Both intracellular and extracellular microRNAs may be suitable to function as diagnostic biomarkers. In particular Interpretation - The research data currently available suggest that microRNAs play an important role in orchestrating age-related processes and conditions of the musculoskeletal system. Further research may help to improve our understanding of the complexity of these processes at the cellular and extracellular level. The option to develop microRNA biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents for the degenerating diseases of bone and cartilage appears to be promising.</ab>

        <ab>Fear of falling (FOF) is widely found in the elderly population and, regardless of its complex nature as a multicomponent construct, its related psychological variables have been overlooked as primary research topics. This article aims to examine the relationship between FOF, falls self efficacy, anxiety, balance, and perceived control over falling in a sample of older adults. A total of 100 subjects aged 60+ were asked about the presence of FOF, falls history, health, and functional status; they also completed the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), the Perceived Control Over Falling Scale (PCOF), and the Performance-Oriented Assessment of Mobility and Balance (POMA-I). FOF was found to be associated with low falls self efficacy, low perceived control over falling, and reduced balance but not with anxiety. Conversely, a statistically significant association was found between GAI and FES, PCOF and POMA-I, and 47.1% of FOF was explained by two items from FES and GAI. FOF is influenced by variables that, though being commonly considered equivalent to FOF, do not fully explain it. A critical thought on the instruments used to evaluate FOF, is needed as well as additional studies to clarify the role of specific psychological variables.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale, aims and objectives Self-rated health ( SRH) is a single measure predictor of hospital utilization and health outcomes in epidemiological studies. There have been few studies of SRH in patient journeys in clinical settings. Reduced resilience to stressors, reflected by SRH, exposes older people (complex systems) to the risk of hospitalization. It is proposed that SRH reflects rather than predicts deteriorations and hospital use; with low SRH autocorrelation in time series. The aim was to investigate SRH fluctuations in regular outbound telephone calls (average biweekly) to patients by Care Guides. Methods Descriptive case study using quantitative autoregressive techniques and qualitative case analysis on SRH time series. Fourteen participants were randomly selected from the Patient Journey Record System (PaJR) database. The PaJR database recorded 198 consecutively sampled older multi-morbid patients journeys in three primary care settings. Analysis consisted of triangulation of SRH (0 very poor - 6 excellent) patterns from three analyses: SRH graduations associations with service utilization; time series modelling (autocorrelation, and step ahead forecast); and qualitative categorization of deteriorations. Results Fourteen patients reported mean SRH 2.84 (poor-fair) in 818 calls over 13 ± 6.4 months of follow-up. In 24% calls, SRH was poor-fair and significantly associated with hospital use. SRH autocorrelation was low in 14 time series (−0.11 to 0.26) with little difference (χ2 = 6.46, P = 0.91) among them. Fluctuations between better and worse health were very common and poor health was associated with hospital use. It is not clear why some patients continued on a downward trajectory, whereas others who destabilized appeared to completely recover, and even improved over time. Conclusion SRH reflects an individual's complex health trajectory, but as a single measure does not predict when and how deteriorations will occur in this study. Individual patients appear to behave as complex adaptive systems. The dynamics of SRH and its influences in destabilizations warrant further research.</ab>

        <ab>Rationale, aims and objectives Declining capacity to function safely and independently in the community is a manifestation of ageing. Multiple measures are used to define and predict functional decline. This paper explores the use of partial least squares ( PLS) analysis to understand the interaction between overtime measures of functional decline. Methods Comprehensive information was captured on individuals aged 65+ who presented at a large metropolitan Australian hospital Emergency Department ( ED) for a complaint, which did not result in a hospital admission. They were followed-up by telephone 1 and 3 months, post- ED discharge. Information was collected each time on home situations (living alone, using community services, using a gait aid and having a formal carer), recent falls, hospitalizations and instrumental activities of daily living ( IADLs). PLS analysis was applied to identify overtime relationships between measures. Results Valid information was provided by 147 individuals at all three time points. The eight individual IADL items clustered clearly around physical, mental or combined mental and physical IADLs. These clusters were strongly related to increased use of community supports, gait aid and carer, and living alone. The relationship was less convincingly for hospitalizations, and falls were not explained well. Conclusion PLS analysis offers a novel and comprehensive way of analysing complex health data, which allows sense to be made of relationships over a 3-month period. This analysis provides a better understanding of declining function over time, than could be provided by current health modelling methods.</ab>

        <ab>Consumer-directed care (CDC) is increasingly widespread among aged care service options in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. However, the evidence base regarding the programmatic and contextual factors that affect the outcome of CDC interventions is surprisingly small. This paper reports on a self-directed care approach for older Australians with complex care needs. A multimethods longitudinal comparative cohort study was employed comprising 4 survey tools and 56 semi-structured interviews. Participation rates were around 20%. A total of 185 (98 in the intervention and 87 in the control group) older people and carers were recruited at baseline. Eleven months later, 109 participants (59 in the intervention and 50 in the control group) completed the repeat measure. Attrition rates were around 40%. Data collection occurred between July 2010 and April 2012. The data suggest that intervention group participants were likely to be more satisfied with the way they were treated (P = 0.013), their care options (P = 0.014), the 'say' they had in their care (P &lt; 0.001), the information they received regarding their care (P = 0.012), what they were achieving in life (P = 0.031), that the services changed their view on what could be achieved in life (P = 0.020) and with their standard of living (P = 0.008). The evaluation suggests that while only a very small segment of older people is interested in a voucher or cash option, a substantially larger group would like to have greater say over and more direct access to their care, without, however, assuming administrative and financial responsibilities. The paper concludes that a stepped capacity-building approach to CDC may improve the acceptability of CDC to older people and generate synergies that improve older people's care outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults are vulnerable to hospital-associated complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, functional decline, and delirium, which can contribute to prolonged hospital stay, readmission, and nursing home placement. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated when the hospital's practices, services, and physical environment are not sufficiently mindful of the complex, multidimensional needs of frail individuals. Several frameworks have emerged to help hospitals examine how organization-wide processes can be customized to avoid these complications. This article describes the application of one such framework-the Senior- Friendly Hospital ( SFH) framework adopted in Ontario, Canada-which comprises five interrelated domains: organizational support, processes of care, emotional and behavioral environment, ethics in clinical care and research, and physical environment. This framework provided the blueprint for a self-assessment of all 155 adult hospitals across the province of Ontario. The system-wide analysis identified practice gaps and promising practices within each domain of the SFH framework. Taken together, these results informed 12 recommendations to support hospitals at all stages of development in becoming friendly to older adults. Priorities for system-wide action were identified, encouraging hospitals to implement or further develop their processes to better address hospital-acquired delirium and functional decline. These recommendations led to collaborative action across the province, including the development of an online toolkit and the identification of accountability indicators to support hospitals in quality improvement focusing on senior-friendly care.</ab>

        <ab>As the population ages, police increasingly serve as first responders to incidents involving older adults in which aging-related health plays a critical role. The goals of this study were to assess police officers' knowledge of aging-related health, to identify challenges police experience in their encounters with older adults, and to describe their recommendations for how to address those challenges. This was a mixed-methods study of 141 San Francisco police officers recruited from mandatory police trainings between 2011 and 2013. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze 141 self-administered questionnaires, and principles of grounded theory were used to analyze open-ended questionnaire responses and 11 additional qualitative interviews. Eighty-nine percent of officers reported interacting with older adults at least monthly. Although 84% of police reported prior training in working with older adults, only 32% rated themselves as knowledgeable about aging-related health. Participants described themselves as first responders to medical and social emergencies involving older adults and identified several challenges, including identifying and responding to aging-related conditions and ensuring appropriate medical and social service handoffs. To address these challenges, officers recommended developing trainings focused on recognizing and responding to aging-related conditions and improving police knowledge of community resources for older adults. They also called for enhanced communication and collaboration between police and clinicians. These findings suggest that, because they assume a front-line role in responding to older adults with complex medical and social needs, many police may benefit from additional knowledge about aging-related health and community resources. Collaboration between police and healthcare providers presents an important opportunity to develop geriatrics training and interprofessional systems of care to support police work with a rapidly aging population.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frail older patients may have increased length of stay (LoS) and poorer outcomes when kept on traditional medical assessment units due to lack of comprehensive geriatric assessment at an early stage of their admission.Innovation: A clinical specialist nurse for older people (CNS) and an Elderly Short Stay Unit (ESSU) were introduced to support the work of the Frail Older Peoples' Advice and Liaison Service (FOPALS) operating in MAU. The CNS actively sought patients for FOPALS to review, liaising with family and community services, helping MAU with complex discharges and triaging patients to ESSU. With an anticipated LoS less than 4 days ESSU benefited from daily consultant geriatrician ward rounds, twice-daily MDT board rounds and increased therapy input. FOPALS then expanded to 7 day working.Evaluation: LoS for all elderly patients admitted to Queen's Hospital from March-May in 2011 and 2012, was 11 days and 11.25 days (respectively). Data was analysed on 730 patients from March-May 2013. 353 patients were assessed by FOPALS between March and mid April 2013. Pro-formas were completed (prospectively) for every patient. Following introduction of seven-day working, a further 377 patients were assessed between mid-April- May 2013. FOPALS reduced LoS for all elderly patients admitted to geriatric wards at Queen's Hospital from March-May 2013, to 9.25 days. LoS for those specifically assessed by FOPALS was 9 days. This reduced further to 8.1 days once seven-day working was introduced. Readmission rates within seven days reduced from 10.4% to 6.9% for all geriatric patients. Readmission rates within thirty days declined from 33 to 25%.Conclusions: ESSU along with a specialist nurse improved LoS, when used in conjunction with FOPALS, not only improving outcomes at the ‘front door’, but for all ward areas.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Unplanned admissions for older people can result in lengthy hospital stays. It has been recognised that many of these admissions are avoidable, often associated with adverse patient outcomes and potential resource misappropriation.There is a drive to seek novel processes to better assess and manage frail elderly people presenting to Emergency Departments (ED).Innovation: Within a busy London District General Hospital, an Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) service was designed. Based in the ED Observation Ward this service provides an in-reach service to the ED, and liaison to the Acute Medical Unit.This is a consultant-led service, with support from a trust grade junior doctor and Band 6 nurse. At present this is a weekday in-hours resource. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is delivered to patients over the age of 80, with complex problems or frailty, but who do not require inpatient care. Therapies and social care support is provided through existing teams operating in the ED.Evaluation: Between January and October 2013, 662 patients have been assessed by the ACE team, in whom 459 inappropriate admissions were avoided. To receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment and appropriate treatment to facilitate discharge of these patients only needed to stay an extra 4.76 hours on average in hospital.Since the introduction of the ACE service the rate of admission in older people from ED Observation Ward has reduced 61.2% in 2012 to 35.1% this year, despite similar levels of activity. Comparing similarly aged patients and episode diagnosis coding, in excess of 4,200 bed days could be saved per year.Conclusions: The ACE service has provided clear benefits to patients and the trust by avoiding un-necessary hospital admission, while providing focused consultant-delivered care in a timely manner. Expansion to a seven-day service is imminent, with expected further benefits.</ab>

        <ab>Residents of long-term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program ( RACIP) is a quality improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on-site support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology nurse specialists ( GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of hospitalization 1 year before and after program implementation. The sample included 29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention group (rate ratio ( RR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.61-0.86, P &lt; .001). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group (69% increase) ( RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56-0.82, P &lt; .001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention and comparison groups ( RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.68-1.46, P = .99). The integration of GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.</ab>

        <ab>Background Various elderly case management projects have been implemented in Belgium. This type of long-term health care intervention involves contextual factors and human interactions. These underlying complex mechanisms can be usefully informed with field experts' knowledge, which are hard to make explicit. However, computer simulation has been suggested as one possible method of overcoming the difficulty of articulating such elicited qualitative views. Methods A simulation model of case management was designed using an agent-based methodology, based on the initial qualitative research material. Variables and rules of interaction were formulated into a simple conceptual framework. This model has been implemented and was used as a support for a structured discussion with experts in case management. Results The rigorous formulation provided by the agent-based methodology clarified the descriptions of the interventions and the problems encountered regarding: the diverse network topologies of health care actors in the project;, the adaptation time required by the intervention;, the communication between the health care actors;, the institutional context;, the organization of the care; and, the role of the case manager and his or hers personal ability to interpret the informal demands of the frail older person., Conclusion The simulation model should be seen primarily as a tool for thinking and learning. A number of insights were gained as part of a valuable cognitive process. Computer simulation supporting field experts' elicitation can lead to better-informed decisions in the organization of complex health care interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The National Heart Failure UK Audit (2011/2012) recommends cardiology services should manage in-hospital heart failure, demonstrating better survival outcomes. However frail older peoples' needs were not reflected; cognitive impairment and multi-morbidity were excluded. Our objective was to survey our older patients' characteristics and management for acute heart failure admission.Sampling methods: We sampled forty-five patients admitted to the Older Persons' Unit with heart failure (January-March 2013) collecting data from case notes and discharge summaries, adapting the National Heart Failure Audit tool adding domains including cognition, non-cardiac co-morbidities and dependency.Results: Mean age 86yrs old, mean length of stay 22 days, 62% (28/45) had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Most lived alone 62% (28/45). 32% (14/44) scored less than 24/30 on mini-mental state examination. Non-cardiac diseases were common; dementia 22% (10/45), chest disease 22% (10/45), diabetes mellitus 24% (11/45), stroke 18% (8/45), chronic kidney disease 31% (14/45). Admission echocardiography performed in 67% (30/45), brain natriuretic peptide level in 71% (32/45). In patients with reduced ejection fraction, 85% (11/13) were discharged on a beta-blocker. Only 38% (5/13) were discharged on an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; of those who were not 50% (4/8) had significant hypotension, 38% (3/8) had significant acute kidney injury.Key conclusions: Cognitive impairment and co-morbidity burden was common. Not everyone received evidence-based medical therapy, mostly clinically justified. Without considering co-morbidity, frailty and medication intolerance, streamlining services to a specialist approach may be detrimental to the complex frail patient. The National Heart Failure Audit should incorporate these aspects to reflect older patients' needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: An initiative to transform health and social care across the Leeds Healthcare Economy has developed in response to recent demographic, political and economic challenges. Two Interface Geriatricians were appointed to perform various innovative roles across the boundaries of primary and secondary care and to improve patient experience by moving care closer to home.Innovation: Interface Geriatricians provide early Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) by consulting in ED for four sessions per week. We aim to reduce unnecessary admissions from the ED by accessing alternative pathways where appropriate e.g. Intermediate Care or early Geriatric outpatient review. Referral criteria include medically stable frail older people experiencing a change in physical or cognitive function and/or complex co-morbidities. Cases are identified by ED clinicians, the Geriatrician, or the Early Discharge Assessment Team (EDAT) – a team of senior nurses and therapists experienced in arranging complex discharges.Evaluation: During the first year of the service, 534 patients were assessed during 146 sessions• 58%of selected patients were discharged from ED – this compares favourably with previous discharge rates from ED for frail older people of 20-33%.• A further 12% of patients were suitable for discharge but were admitted due to delays accessing community services or investigations.• Only 27% of selected patients needed admission for medical reasons.• The readmission rate was similar to the departmental rate of 20%.• A small reduction in the time waiting to be seen in ED for patients of all ages was demonstrated.Conclusions: Our innovative, high quality service is avoiding unnecessary admissions with their associated risks and cost. Feedback from ED staff, EDAT and patients regarding our service has been extremely positive. We are developing strong relationships with the ED team and EDAT, extending our influence outside of our allocated sessions and championing the individualised care of frail older people.</ab>

        <ab>Multiple myeloma (MM) in patients aged greater than 80 years poses an increasingly common challenge for oncology providers. A multidisciplinary workshop was held in which MM-focused hematologists/oncologists, geriatricians, and associated health-care team members discussed the state of research for MM therapy, as well as themes from geriatric medicine that pertain directly to this patient population. A summary statement of our discussions is presented here, in which we highlight several topics. MM disproportionately affects senior adults, and demographic trends indicate that this trend will accelerate. Complex issues impact cancer in seniors, and although factors such as social environment, comorbidities, and frailty have been well characterized in nononcological geriatric medicine, these themes have been inadequately explored in cancers such as MM, despite their clear relevance to this field. Therapeutically, novel agents have improved survival for MM patients of all ages, but less so for seniors than younger patients for a variety of reasons. Lastly, both MM- and treatment-related symptoms and toxicities require special attention in senior adults. Existing research provides limited insight into how best to manage these often complex patients, who are often not reflected in typical clinical trial populations. We hence offer suggestions for clinical trials that address knowledge gaps in how to manage very old and/or frail patients with MM, given the complicated issues that often surround this patient population.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives To explore the benefits and shortcomings of using standardised work methods in home care nursing. Background Health care is increasingly shaped by the use of standardised work methods. This trend is reflected in the use of management tools aimed at monitoring service quality and efficiency, as well as in the evidence-based movement that has led to a shift in focus from the practitioner to the knowledge found in guidelines and clinical protocols. This study addressed the impact of this development on home care services. Design This is an ethnographic study involving fieldwork in home care nursing in Iceland. Methods The study took place in one neighbourhood in an urban area in Iceland in 2010. Members of five of six home care nursing teams agreed to participate. Team leaders were observed during visits to older person's homes and at team and interdisciplinary meetings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the team leaders and 15 older persons. Results The results were presented as three themes: For it all to hang together, which referred to attempts on behalf of the team leaders to coordinate complex services and assistance for the benefit of each patient; Working with more advanced cases, which reflected the uptake of standardised methods to address health matters locally; and Being heard, which reflects the politics of using standardised methods. Conclusions Standardised work methods can be helpful and are welcomed by home care nurses as long as they can also use their own discretion and draw on other forms of knowledge when needed. Relevance to clinical practice This study brought out the importance of flexibility in home care practice. Standardised work methods are welcomed and seen as helpful as long as they can be used based on the discretion of the practitioner.</ab>

        <ab>Improving hospital care for frail older people requires expertise, leadership and resources as these patients have multiple complex needs. One innovative solution to providing the skilled care necessary is to train experienced nurses to become advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs). Such roles encompass activity previously undertaken by medical staff, together with leadership, teaching, research and service development. Skills specific to caring for older people, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, are also required. This article discusses the need for ANPs in this clinical area, a pilot that is under way in one acute trust to develop these roles, and the potential benefits and challenges that may accompany this development.</ab>

        <ab>A move to a senior housing community resembles many of the physical stages of previous moves in the life of an older adult, with added social, cultural, and physical challenges and opportunities. Senior housing offers several levels of housing by which residents can have their care needs met, all of which represent social challenges and the potential for increased frailty and future moves. Forming relationships with fellow residents and staff, and continuing long-term social relationships outside the facility are essential to navigating a complex relocation in late life.</ab>

        <ab>Intermediate care services are usually intended for frail, older people and those with complex needs. Their aims are to avoid unnecessary hospital admission, help people regain independence after a hospital stay and prevent premature admission to long-term care. Services are time limited and delivered in patients' own homes, community hospitals and sometimes nursing homes. But, as Louise Hunt reports, the second national audit of intermediate care, published late last year, found capacity in England is just half of what is needed. There is also significant variation between localities in capacity outside hospital and in the balance of bed-based, home-based and re-enablement services. Two case studies are presented of intermediate care services where nurses play an important role in achieving positive outcomes for patients and saving the health service money.</ab>

        <ab>In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To determine the effect of two variables not previously studied in the readmissions literature (frailty-related diagnoses and high-risk medications in the elderly ( HRME)) and one understudied variable (volume of primary care visits in the prior year). Design Retrospective cohort study using data from a study designed to examine outcomes associated with inappropriate prescribing in elderly adults. Setting All Veterans Affairs ( VA) facilities with acute inpatient beds in fiscal year 2006 ( FY06). Participants All veterans aged 65 and older by October 1, 2005, who received VA care at least once per year between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, and were hospitalized at least once during FY06 on a medical or surgical unit. Measurements A generalized linear interactive risk prediction model included demographic and clinical characteristics (mental health and chronic medical conditions, frailty-related diagnoses, number of medications) in FY05; incident HRME in FY06 before index hospitalization or readmission; chronic HRME in FY05; and FY05 emergency department ( ED), hospital, geriatric, palliative, or primary care use. Facility-level variables were complexity, rural versus urban, and FY06 admission rate. Results The mean adjusted readmission rate was 18.3%. The new frailty-related diagnoses variable is a risk factor for readmission in addition to Charlson comorbidity score. Incident HRME use was associated with lower rates of readmission, as were higher numbers of primary care visits in the prior year. Conclusion Frailty-related diagnoses may help to target individuals at higher risk of readmission to receive more-intensive care transition services. HRME use does not help in this targeting. A higher number of face-to-face primary care visits in the prior year, unlike ED and hospital use, correlates with fewer readmissions and may be another avenue for targeting prevention strategies.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: hip fracture is expensive in terms of mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS) and consequences for independence. Poor outcome reflects the vulnerability of patients who typically sustain this injury, but the impact of different comorbidities and impairments is complex to understand. We consider this in a prospective cohort study designed to examine how a patients' frailty index (FI) predicts outcome.Methodology: consecutive patients with low trauma hip fracture were assessed, excluding only those unfit for surgery. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) findings were used to derive a FI for each patient, which was examined alongside other assessment and outcome data from our National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) submission for these individuals.Results: we describe 178 patients; mean age 81 years, 73.5% female. The mean FI was 0.34 (SD = 0.16), and logistic regression identified abbreviated mental test score and FI as the strongest predictors of poor outcome. When patients were stratified by FI, 56 (31.5%) were in the low-frailty group (FI ≤0.25), 58 (32.5%) in intermediate (FI &gt;0.25–0.4), and 64 (36%) in the high-FI group (FI &gt;0.4). All the patients in the low-FI group returned to their original residence within a mean of 21.6 days. The mean LOS for the intermediate group was 36.3 days compared with 67.8 days in the high-FI group (P &lt; 0.01) while 30-day mortality was 3.4% for the intermediate group compared with 17.2% for the high-FI group (P &lt; 0.001).Conclusions: individual CGA findings proved disappointing as outcome predictors, while FI turned out to be a better predictor of mortality, 30-day residence and length of inpatient stay.</ab>

        <ab>Background: prognostication for frail older adults is complex, especially when they become seriously ill.Objectives: to test the measurement properties, especially the predictive validity, of a frailty index based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (FI-CGA) in an acute care setting in relation to the risk of death, length of stay and discharge destination.Design and setting: prospective cohort study. Inpatient medical units in a teaching, acute care hospital.Subjects: individuals on inpatient medical units in a hospital, n = 752, aged 75+ years, were evaluated on their first hospital day; to test reliability, a subsample (n = 231) was seen again on Day 3.Measurements: all frailty data collected routinely as part of a CGA were used to create the FI-CGA. Mortality data were reviewed from hospital records, claims data, Social Security Death Index and interviews with Discharge Managers.Results: thirty-day mortality was 93 (12.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 10–15%) of whom 52 died in hospital. The risk of dying increased with each 0.01 increment in the FI-CGA: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, (95% CI = 1.04–1.07). People who were discharged home had the lowest admitting mean FI-CGA = 0.38 (±standard deviation 0.11) compared with those who died, FI-CGA = 0.51 (±0.12) or were discharged to nursing home, FI-CGA = 0.49 (±0.11). Likewise, increasing FI-CGA values on admission were significantly associated with a longer length of hospital stay.Conclusions: frailty, measured by the FI-CGA, was independently associated with a higher risk of death and other adverse outcomes in older people admitted to an acute care hospital.</ab>

        <ab>Working in the patient narrative has become a familiar part of the common language used in the context of caring for patients. Working in the patient narrative encompasses sharing conversation that allows exploration of the entire patient experience as it relates to health and illness. However, the complexity of engaging in end-of-life conversations, standing steady with conflict, remaining present, maintaining neutrality, and actively listening remain challenging concepts in practice even though they are integral to effectively doing so. Literature review has identified and defined key elements of interactions that can lead to significant opportunities to "wander more fully" in the patient narrative. Two case studies reviewed therein demonstrate ways in which palliative care encounters and end-of-life discussions afford the interdisciplinary team members purposeful engagement with patients. One case discusses taking risks to delve more deeply into patient's fears related to dying. This exploration lays the foundation for assuring goals of care are aligned with individual patient values. The other case demonstrates the use of symbols to share dialog related to an individual's tasks of dying. When directed, intentional facilitation occurs, the patient's unique holistic needs and values are identified, and goals of care can be clarified. In conclusion, highlights of research and clinical applications provide advantageous practice implications.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a potentially reversible cause of disability in the elderly people. The published literature suggests that the MetS–disability association is likely to be complex, depending on co-existing risk factors and with possible variation for each of the specific MetS components. Further evidence is needed to understand the specific consequences of the MetS as a whole and as a function of its components. Methods. Prospective analyses included data from 6,141 participants (60.9% women) aged 65 and older from the Three-City cohort. Mixed logistic models were used to determine associations between MetS (National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and 7-year incident disability measured as social restriction, mobility limitations (Rosow and Breslau scale), and limitations in instrumental and basic activities of daily living. Results. MetS was associated with incident social restriction (odds ratio = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.14–2.09), limited mobility (odds ratio = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.21–1.90), and instrumental activities of daily living limitations (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.24–2.10) after adjustment for a range of potential sociodemographic, health behavior, and health status confounders at baseline. These associations were independent of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease and dementia. There was evidence of associations between MetS components: central obesity, high triglycerides, and elevated fasting glucose and incidence of limitations in mobility and instrumental activities of daily living. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the increased risk of mobility and instrumental activities of daily living limitations in the elderly people associated with MetS is over and above that associated with its components.</ab>

        <ab>Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models—reliability, allostatic load, and complexity—that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and practice nurses regarding the U- CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. Background Care for older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. Design An explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. Methods The barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and expectations regarding the U- CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires sent to all participating general practitioners ( n = 32) and practice nurses ( n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. Results Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to provide structured care. Conclusion This explanatory mixed-methods study showed that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U- CARE programme as feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care towards a proactive and preventive care approach.</ab>

        <ab>Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by older people, both with and without chronic disease. It is unpleasant and distressing and can affect functioning and quality of life. Fatigue also may inhibit an older person from participating optimally in a physical therapy program aimed at rehabilitation or the promotion of better health. However, confusion surrounds the concept of self-reported aging-related fatigue, not only because of the complexity of the problem itself but also because of lack of clarity of definition and the use of the term "fatigue" to describe a range of different concepts. This article aims to provide clarification of the concept in the context of physical therapist clinical practice. The intention is to increase awareness of the issue among physical therapists, promoting their assessment and consideration of the problem when planning health interventions involving functioning, physical activity, and exercise for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. Methods The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. Findings Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. Conclusions Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice. Clinical Relevances The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to explore experiences of mobility device (MD) use among very old single-living Swedish men. Methods: A multiple case study of three men, involving quantitative and qualitative data, was used in an embedded mixed methods design and presented in three narrative stories. To capture differences and similarities in the use of MDs a cross-case analysis was conducted. Results: The findings show that the devices were important for retaining independence in everyday life and for participation in social activities. Use of MDs impacted on everyday activities by enabling, restricting, or changing the performance. Planning and careful thinking were new strategies developed for managing everyday life. The devices were purchased, received from relatives, or prescribed by professionals at a time point when there was a need. The function and form of the devices and a supportive environment were considered important for optimal use. Conclusions: These narrative stories nurture our understanding of complex and multifaceted aspects impacting on MD use in everyday life for very old men. To support active ageing, occupational therapists and other health professionals need to seek information on personal needs and expectations, in order to understand individual perspectives on MD use.</ab>

        <ab>A lack of knowledge in registered nurses about geriatric conditions is one of the major factors that contribute to these conditions being overlooked in hospitalized older people. In China, an innovative geriatric continuing nursing education program aimed at developing registered nurses' understanding of the complex care needs of hospitalized older people with common geriatric conditions was conducted and evaluated. The program consisted of didactic sessions focused on evidence-based practice and unfolding case studies designed to simulate the care trajectory of an older person with a hip fracture and key geriatric conditions. Findings from the program evaluations revealed a significant increase in favorable attitudes towards older people and increased knowledge concerning common geriatric conditions. The satisfaction rate ranked by program participants was 90%. The study, therefore, drew the conclusion that effective geriatric continuing nursing education should target participants' learning needs, support evidence-based practice, and engage participants in active learning.</ab>

        <ab>Frailty is a state of decreased physical functioning and a significant complication of ageing. We examined frailty, energy and macronutrient intake, biomarkers of nutritional status and food insufficiency in US older adult (age ≥ 60 years) participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n 4731). Frailty was defined as meeting ≥ 2 and pre-frailty as meeting one of the following four-item criteria: (1) slow walking; (2) muscular weakness; (3) exhaustion and (4) low physical activity. Intake was assessed by 24 h dietary recall. Food insufficiency was self-reported as ‘sometimes’ or ‘often’ not having enough food to eat. Analyses were adjusted for sex, race, age, smoking, education, income, BMI, other co-morbid conditions and complex survey design. Prevalence of frailty was highest among people who were obese (20·8 %), followed by overweight (18·4 %), normal weight (16·1 %) and lowest among people who were underweight (13·8 %). Independent of BMI, daily energy intake was lowest in people who were frail, followed by pre-frail and highest in people who were not frail (6648 (se 130), 6966 (se 79) and 7280 (se 84) kJ, respectively, P&lt; 0·01). Energy-adjusted macronutrient intakes were similar in people with and without frailty. Frail (adjusted OR (AOR) 4·7; 95 % CI 1·7, 12·7) and pre-frail (AOR 2·1; 95 % CI 0·8, 5·8) people were more likely to report being food insufficient than not frail people. Serum albumin, carotenoids and Se levels were lower in frail adults than not frail adults. Research is needed on targeted interventions to improve nutritional status and food insufficiency among frail older adults, while not necessarily increasing BMI.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is challenging for many older adults. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination and technology. Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. Setting: Older adults having difficulty in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. Methods: All participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. Discussion: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The need for well-coordinated care at the end of life is an important priority for meeting the needs of the growing number of low-income frail elders who are advancing in age. Partially integrated (Medicaid only) models of managed long-term care (MMLTC) are viewed as one promising and financially viable approach to enhance care coordination, yet we know little about the challenges that care managers face in managing the end-of-life care needs of poor elders. A case study design was used to explore challenges encountered in the provision of end-of-life care management for low-income elders enrolled in an innovative partially integrated model of long-term care, in Wisconsin, the Milwaukee County Family Care program. Data were collected via in-depth interviews with county administrators (n = 4) and selected lead supervisors or care managers (n = 7) and two focus groups with care management team members (n = 17). We identified five major themes representing essential challenges: (1) complexity of care and high level of support needs; (2) communication constraints in advance care planning; (3) family conflicts in end-of-life decision making for elders; (4) insufficient communication and collaboration between elders, families, teams, and service providers; and (5) limited bereavement and grief related support for families and teams after elders die. We discuss similarities and difference in the challenges reported here as compared to challenges reported in studies of other models of care and offer recommendations for program and policy development.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Caring for frail seniors requires health professionals with skills and knowledge in 3 core competencies: geriatrics, interprofessional practice, and interorganizational collaboration. Despite a growing population of frail seniors in all developed countries, significant gaps exist in preparation of health professionals in these skills. To help close these gaps, a knowledge-to-practice (KTP) process was undertaken to increase the capacity of newly created family health teams and longer standing Community Health Centers in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Methods: Each team identified a staff member to become its facilitator in the 3 core skill sets. Guided by a KTP framework, a set of training modules were created, compiled into a digital toolkit for transfer into practice, translated in a multimethods workshop, and implemented using a variety of strategies to optimize practice change. Results: Staff from 82% of the targeted primary care teams learned to use the toolkit in a train-the-facilitator process that was highly valued, and prompted a range of changes in personal and team practice. A digital toolkit for primary care teams remains an enduring and often used resource. Discussion: Closing the knowledge gap in the core competencies for frailty focused care is complex. A KTP framework helped guide a staged multimethod process that produced both individual and team practice change and on online toolkit that has a continuing influence.</ab>

        <ab>Clinical metabolic studies have demonstrated that insulin action declines progressively with age in humans. In addition to its close association with Type 2 diabetes, which reduces life expectancy in older people, age-related insulin resistance is implicated in pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders for which ageing is a major risk factor. These include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, dementia, frailty and cancer. Accordingly, insulin resistance may be viewed as biomarker of age-related ill health and reduced lifespan. The rapidly rising number of older people, coupled with a high prevalence of insulin resistance resulting from obesity and sedentary lifestyles, presents unprecedented public health and societal challenges. Studies of centenarians have shown that preserved whole-body sensitivity to insulin is associated with longevity. The mechanisms through which insulin action is associated with age-related diseases remain unclear. Changes in body composition, i.e. sarcopenia and excess adiposity, may be more potent than age per se. Moreover, the impact of insulin resistance has been difficult to disentangle from the clustering of vascular risk factors that co-segregate with the insulin resistance-hyperinsulinaemia complex. Potentially modifiable mediators of age-related changes in insulin sensitivity include alterations in adipocytokines, impaired skeletal myocyte mitochondrial function and brown fat activity. The hypothesis that improving or maintaining insulin sensitivity preserves health and extends lifespan merits further evaluation. Practical non-pharmacological interventions directed against age-related insulin resistance remain underdeveloped. Novel metabolically active pharmacological agents with theoretical implications for some age-related disorders are entering clinical trials. However, recent adverse experiences with the thiazolidinediones suggest the need for a cautious approach to the use of insulin sensitizing drugs in older people. This could be particularly important in the absence of diabetes where the risk to benefit analysis may be less favourable.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To better understand the antibiotic prescribing process in assisted living ( AL) communities given the growing rate of antibiotic resistance. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Four AL communities in North Carolina. Participants Assisted living residents who received antibiotics (n = 30) from October 20, 2010, to March 31, 2011, a primary family member, staff, and the prescribing medical provider. Measurements Semistructured interviews that were conducted regarding prescribing included the information available at the time of prescribing and the perceptions of the quality of communication between providers, staff, residents and family members about the resident. Providers were asked an open-ended question regarding how to improve the communication process related to antibiotic prescribing for AL residents. Results For the 30 residents who received antibiotic prescriptions, providers often had limited information about the case and lacked familiarity with the residents, the residents' families, and staff. They also felt that cases were less severe and less likely to require an antibiotic than did residents, families, and staff. Providers identified several ways to improve the communication process, including better written documentation and staff and family presence. Conclusion In a small sample of AL communities, providers faced an array of challenges in making antibiotic prescribing decisions. This work confirms the complex nature of antibiotic prescribing in AL communities and indicates that further work is needed to determine how to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatric medicine has an encyclopaedic sweep, reflecting the complexity of both the ageing process and of our patient group. Keeping up with, and making sense of, the relevant scientific literature is challenging, especially as ageing has increased in prominence as a focus of research across many branches of the sciences and the humanities. This review of research published in 2012 in generalist, geriatric medicine and gerontology journals has been compiled with a view to extracting those aspects of research into ageing which could be considered relevant not only to the practice of geriatric medicine, but also to our understanding of the ageing process and the relationship of geriatric medicine to other medical specialties and public health. The research discussed includes new insights into global ageing and the compression of morbidity; nosological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of dementia; an innovative study on the microbiome and ageing; epidemiological perspectives into multi-morbidity; an overview of the impact of the first waves of Baby Boomers; fresh thinking on geriatric syndromes such as orthostatic hypotension, kyphosis, urinary incontinence after stroke, frailty and elder abuse; an update of the Beers criteria and the first stirrings of recognition of the longevity dividend in the biomedical literature.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that according to government nursing blueprint, nurses provide complex care to extensive frail older people. District nurses are involved in working with community matrons to provide palliative care and nutrition advice, and working with old patients to help them care for themselves. The number of district nurses is decreasing because of the long time required to care for old patients thus increasing the work load on community nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Frail older adults face increasingly complex decisions regarding medical care. The Palliative and Therapeutic Harmonization ( PATH) model provides a structured approach that places frailty at the forefront of medical and surgical decision-making in older adults. Preliminary data from the first 150 individuals completing the PATH program shows that the population served is frail (mean Clinical Frailty Score = 6.3), has multiple comorbidities (mean 8), and takes many medications (mean = 9). Ninety-two percent of participants were able to complete decision-making for an average of three current or projected health issues, most often (76.7%) with the help of a substitute decision-maker ( SDM). Decisions to proceed with scheduled medical or surgical interventions correlated with baseline frailty level and dementia stage, with participants with a greater degree of frailty (odds ratio ( OR) = 3.41, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 1.39-8.38) or more-advanced stage of dementia ( OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.06-2.65) being more likely to choose less-aggressive treatment options. Although the PATH model is in the development stage, further evaluation is ongoing, including a qualitative analysis of the SDM experience of PATH and an assessment of the effectiveness of PATH in long-term care. The results of these studies will inform the design of a larger randomized controlled trial.</ab>

        <ab>The interRAI Acute Care is a comprehensive geriatric assessment tool that provides a holistic picture of complex and frail hospitalized older persons. It is designed to support holistic care planning and to transfer patient data across settings. Its usefulness in clinical decision making depends on the extent to which clinicians can rely on the patient data as accurate and meaningful indicators of patients functioning. But its multidimensional character implies challenges for clinimetric testing as some of the traditional analyses techniques cannot be unconditionally applied. The objective was to present an overview of methods to examine the reliability of the interRAI Acute Care. For each line of evidence, examples of hypotheses and research questions are listed.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives To ascertain the effect on survival of eight common geriatric syndromes (multiple comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, sarcopenia, malnutrition, homeostenosis, and chronic inflammation), identified by an expert panel of academic geriatricians. Design A systematic literature review sought studies from a variety of sources to compare survival and life expectancy of individuals with geriatric syndromes with those of the general population. Setting Studies used reflected the general population. Participants Community-dwelling persons aged 65 and older. Measurements Eight geriatric syndromes (multiple definitions) and survival. Results Two thousand three hundred seventy-four publications were retrieved, and 509 publications of 123 studies were included. Seven geriatric syndromes (multiple comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, malnutrition, impaired homeostasis, and chronic inflammation) were associated with poor survival. In each case, the prevalence of a syndrome was negatively associated with mortality. Malnutrition and impaired homeostasis exerted twice the influence of factors such as multiple comorbidities and frailty. From age 65 to 74, only those who are very ill or frail (e.g., impaired homeostasis, low body mass index, or advanced dementia) have a higher risk of mortality than average older adults. In the old-old, particularly aged 90 and older, the added value of predicting survival beyond 1 year is minimal. Conclusion Geriatric syndrome information is helpful to understanding survival for younger old persons but provides little information about survival for the very old. Complex survival models add comparatively little benefit to more simply measured and calculated models.</ab>

        <ab>As the number of older adults in the population increases, the rate of medical care use is expected to rise. As a result, geriatricians and gerontologists are researching predictors of medical care in later life, which includes ageism. Ageism within health care has been widely and frequently reported and it is thought to be a product of negative attitudes toward aging. The current review systematically explores the existing literature in this area and establishes seven themes within the research. From a predominantly American population of papers, themes that emerged were the following: physicians’ attitudes toward aging are complex and mixed; mixed associations among attitude, knowledge, and medical care; aging and disease symptom attributions among physicians; attitudes, knowledge, and exposure to older adults; the role of role models; the influence of the health care culture; and the influence of the health care system. These themes were considered separately and in tandem in order to explore avenues for future research that will clarify the influence that these psychosocial factors have on health care provided to older adults.</ab>

        <ab>At Leicester Royal Infirmary, the care of frail older people occupies a disproportionate amount of emergency department (ED) staff's time and resources. Too few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as possible. This article describes how the unit operates.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Mobility often is tested under a low challenge condition (ie, over a straight, uncluttered path), which often fails to identify early mobility difficulty. Tests of walking during challenging conditions may uncover mobility difficulty that is not identified with usual gait testing. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether gait during challenging conditions predicts decline in gait speed over 1 year in older people with apparently normal gait (ie, gait speed of ≥ 1.0 m/s). Design. This was a prospective cohort study. Methods. Seventy-one older adults (mean age=75.9 years) with a usual gait speed of ≥1.0 m/s participated. Gait was tested at baseline under 4 challenging conditions: (1) narrow walk (15 cm wide), (2) stepping over obstacles (15.24 cm [6 in] and 30.48 cm [12 in]), (3) simple walking while talking (WWT), and (4) complex WWT. Usual gait speed was recorded over a 4-m course at baseline and 1 year later. A 1-year change in gait speed was calculated, and participants were classified as declined (decreased ≥ 0.10 m/s, n=18), stable (changed &lt;0.10 m/s, n=43), or improved (increased ≥0.10 m/s, n=10). Analysis of variance was used to compare challenging condition cost (usual -- challenging condition gait speed difference) among the 3 groups. Results. Participants who declined in the ensuing year had a greater narrow walk and obstacle walk cost than those who were stable or who improved in gait speed (narrow walk cost=0.43 versus 0.33 versus 0.22 m/s and obstacle walk cost=0.35 versus 0.26 versus 0.13 m/s). Simple and complex WWT cost did not differ among the groups. Limitations. The participants who declined in gait speed over time walked the fastest, and those who improved walked the slowest at baseline; thus, the potential contribution of regression to the mean to the findings should not be overlooked. Conclusions. In older adults with apparently normal gait, the assessment of gait during challenging conditions appears to uncover mobility difficulty that is not identified by usual gait testing.</ab>

        <ab>The UK has an ageing population, which means that more and more older people with complex social and healthcare problems will present to emergency departments (EDs). This article explains why ED staff must have appropriate training and education in all aspects of caring for frail older people, including the use of appropriate and specific assessment tools. The authors also refer to a soon-to-be-published guideline for the care of frail older people with emergency care needs.</ab>

        <ab>There is a growing interest in developing a deeper level of understanding of the complex phenomena that make up the aging process. Efforts to pursue questions using a multivariate and ecologically valid approaches that include biological and behavioral factors have led to significant advances in our knowledge. This special issue presents a collection of papers that represent this “biobehavioral” perspective. Little is known concerning the biobehavioral aspects of Hispanic health and there is a dearth of systematic study of how individual biological factors interact with the environmental and cultural factors to affect health outcomes among the swiftly growing older population of Mexican origin, a subgroup of older minorities that exhibits unique morbidity and mortality patterns. The group of papers here represents important contributions to understanding the health consequences in later life for individuals of Mexican descent and addresses several areas of interest including but not limited to diabetes, cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome, frailty, socio-economic status and contextual factors that impact health. The papers presented here use interesting and useful transdisciplinary approaches that increase our knowledge of health processes in older people of Mexican descent. This special issue also provides excellent examples of the critical linkages between biological variables broadly defined and traditional social stratification, social inequalities, and social justice and the ways in which they interact. The papers taken together suggest that the processes involved in aging and health are complex, particularly in people of Mexican descent, and requires the understanding of mechanisms at multiple causes and levels of analysis.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Frailty is a late-life syndrome of vulnerability to adverse health outcomes characterized by a phenotype that includes muscle weakness, fatigue, and inflammatory pathway activation. The identification of biologically relevant pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically relevant pathways that contribute to frailty. Methods. Based on current understanding of the physiological basis of frailty, we hypothesize that variation in genes related to inflammation and muscle maintenance would associate with frailty. One thousand three hundred and fifty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped across 134 candidate genes using the Illumina Genotyping platform, and the rank order by strength of association between frailty and genotype was determined in a cross-sectional study. Results. Although no single-nucleotide polymorphism reached study-wide significance after controlling family-wise false-discovery rate at 0.05, single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), Caspase 8 (CASP8), CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), and beta-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) loci were among those strongly associated with frailty. Conclusions. The apoptosis– and transcription regulation–related pathways highlighted by this preliminary analysis were consistent with prior gene expression studies in a frail mouse model and provide useful etiological insights for future biological studies of frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. This paper is a report of a scoping review of research on cognitive impairment in older adults who visit Emergency Departments of acute care hospitals, followed by an integrative review that included a quality assessment to determine the effectiveness of interventions for this population. Background. Being old and cognitively impaired in the Emergency Department -- a fast-paced intervention system -- is a complex phenomenon that challenges many healthcare professionals. The rise in the incidence and prevalence of dementia will have a large impact on healthcare systems. Data sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, AgeLine, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2008, for qualitative or quantitative studies reporting extractable data on delirium or dementia in non-institutionalized older people (65+ years) in the Emergency Department. Review methods. Titles screened by a project researcher and checked against inclusion criteria by another researcher. Two reviewers completed independent data extraction and synthesis of included studies. Quality assessment occurred using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tools. Results. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for integrative review. Analysis of these studies indicates that the prevalence of cognitive impairment is high and improvements are needed. Contextual details and relevant features of an appropriate intervention are poorly explained. Conclusion. Although the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment is recognized, appropriate interventions and programmatic responses remain elusive. Quality improvements require more thorough examination of emergency department context to identify modifiable influencing factors that are transferable across settings.</ab>

        <ab>New models of interprofessional working are continuously being proposed to address the burgeoning health and social care needs of older people with complex and long-term health conditions. Evaluations of the effectiveness of these models tend to focus on process measures rather than outcomes for the older person. This discussion paper argues that the concept of frailty, and measures based on it, may provide a more user-centred tool for the evaluation of interprofessional services -- a tool that cuts across unidisciplinary preoccupations and definitions of effectiveness. Numerous frailty scales have been developed for case identification and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes. We suggest that they may also be particularly suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of interprofessional working with community-dwelling older people. Several exemplars of frailty scales that might serve this purpose are identified, and their potential contributions and limitations are discussed. Further work is required to establish which is the most suitable scales for this application. The development of an appropriate frailty scale could provide an opportunity for interprofessional debate about the forms of care and treatment that should be prioritised to improve the health and well-being of this population.</ab>

        <ab>Older people, particularly those who are frail, are vulnerable to dehydration. Management of dehydration in older people can be more complex than in younger adults because of the physical effects of ageing. As the population ages, nurses will increasingly care for older patients in every setting. This article provides an overview of the physiological changes that affect the ability of older people to maintain a normal fluid balance. Risk factors for dehydration are reviewed and strategies for the prevention, detection and management of dehydration are discussed. The article focuses on subcutaneous fluid replacement for the management of dehydration in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In most Western countries the growing gap between available resources and greater potential for medical treatment has brought evidence-based guidelines into focus. However, such guidelines are difficult to use when the evidence base is weak. Priority setting for frail elderly patients with heart disease illustrates this problem. We have outlined a tentative model for priority setting regarding frail elderly heart patients. The model takes cardiovascular risk, frailty, and comorbidity into account. Objective: Our aim is to validate the model’s components. We want to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of the study experts’ rankings regarding each of the model’s categories. Methods: A confidential questionnaire study consisting of 15 authentic and validated cases was conducted to assess the views of purposefully selected cardiology experts (n = 58). They were asked to rank the cases regarding the need for coronary angiography using their individual clinical experience. The response rate was 71%. Responses were analysed with frequencies and descriptive statistics. The inter-rater reliability regarding the experts’ rankings of the cases was estimated via an intra-class correlation test (ICC). Results: The cardiologists considered the clinical cases to be realistic. The intra-class correlation (two-way random, consistency, average measure) was 0.978 (95% CI 0.958—0.991), which denotes a very good inter-rater reliability on the group level. The model’s components were considered relevant regarding complex cases of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Comorbidity was considered to be the most relevant component, frailty the second most relevant, followed by cardiovascular risk. Conclusions: A framework taking comorbidity, frailty, and cardiovascular risk into account could constitute a foundation for consensus-based guidelines for frail elderly heart patients. From a priority setting perspective, it is reasonable to believe that the framework is applicable to other groups of elderly patients with acute disease and complex needs.</ab>

        <ab>As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.</ab>

By using a standardized patient family and creatively using resources from the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC), this author maximized learning experiences for advanced practice students who will care for elderly individuals and their families. The goal of ELNEC is to strengthen nursing education to improve end-of-life care. Principles for developing and implementing a complex standardized patient scenario for graduate nursing students are offered.</ab>

        <ab>For more than twenty-five years, Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) have provided quality care to frail, older adults. PACE is an innovative, person-centered approach to comprehensively meeting the medical and long-term-care needs of older adults with complex, chronic conditions, and functional or cognitive disabilities. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) presents opportunities to raise awareness of PACE and test variations on the current PACE model. PACE organizations also can be a resource to policy makers because they have implemented several of the delivery system reforms and concepts in the ACA, such as accountable care, health homes, and patient-centeredness.</ab>

        <ab>UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.</ab>

        <ab>This article documents the development of geriatric medicine fellowship training in the United States through 2009. Results from a national cross-sectional survey of all geriatric medicine fellowship training programs conducted in 2007 is compared with results from a similar survey in 2002. Secondary data sources were used to supplement the survey results. The 2007 survey response rate was 71%. Sixty-seven percent of responding programs directors have completed formal geriatric medicine fellowship training and are board certified in geriatrics, and 29% are board certified through the practice pathway. The number of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited fellowship programs has slowly increased, from 120 (23 family medicine (FM) and 97 internal medicine (IM)) in 2001/02 to 145 in 2008/09 (40 FM and 105 IM), resulting in a 21% increase in fellowship programs and a 13% increase in the number of first-year fellows (259 to 293). In 2008/09, the growth in programs and first-year slots, combined with the weak demand for geriatrics training, resulted in more than one-third of first-year fellow positions being unfilled. The number of advanced fellows decreased slightly from 72 in 2001/00 to 65 in 2006/07. In 2006/07, 55% of the advanced fellows were enrolled at four training programs. In 2008/09, 66% of fellows were international medical school graduates. The small numbers of graduating geriatric medicine fellows are insufficient to care for the expanding population of older frail patients, train other disciples in the care of complex older adults, conduct research in aging, and be leaders in the field.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatrics focuses on a variety of multiorgan problems in a heterogeneous older population. Therefore, most geriatric healthcare interventions are complex interventions. The UK Medical Research Council (MRC) has developed a framework to systematically design, evaluate, and implement complex interventions. This article provides an overview of this framework and illustrates its use in geriatrics by showing how it was used to develop and evaluate a fall prevention intervention. The consecutive phases of the framework are described: Phase I: Development. This phase began with a literature review, which provided the existing evidence and the theoretical understanding of the process of change. This understanding was further developed through focus groups with experts and interviews with patients and caregivers. The intervention was modeled using qualitative testing of the preliminary intervention through focus groups and through the completion of Delphi surveys by independent specialists. Phase II: Feasibility and piloting. In this phase, a pilot study was conducted in a group of patients and caregivers. The feasibility of the intervention and evaluation was also discussed in focus groups of participants and instructors. Phase III: Evaluation. The information from phases I and II shaped the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention. Phase IV: Dissemination. The purpose of the final phase is to examine the implementation of the intervention into practice. The MRC framework provides an innovative and useful methodology for the development and evaluation of complex geriatric interventions that deserves greater dissemination and implementation.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose/Objectives: To identify appropriate strategies for pharmacotherapeutic agents in the management of pain in older adults with cancer.Data Sources: PubMed literature searches, personal reference collection, and clinical experience.Data Synthesis: To make good decisions about pain management when developing treatment plans for older adults, healthcare providers should focus on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in the context of the physiologic changes that occur with aging.Conclusions: Unrelieved pain can have a detrimental effect on older adults; conversely, overmedicating can lead to an increased risk of adverse events. With advancing age, physiologic changes alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs by reducing their absorption, changing their distribution, and modifying their metabolism and elimination. Also, common comorbidities increase the risk of pharmacologic toxicity and narrow the therapeutic window. In addition, polypharmacy—an issue more common in older adults—increases the complexity of prescribing and risk of adverse events. Consequently, older adults require individualization of their pharmacotherapies. Healthcare providers should consider carefully the risks and benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjuvants before initiating an analgesic trial. The 2009 guidelines published by the American Geriatrics Society described several key principles for prescribing analgesics to older adults and offered specific recommendations and caveats for each drug class.Implications for Nursing: Current guidelines support appropriate management of cancer pain in older adults with specific recommendations for each class of analgesics as well as general prescribing principles.</ab>

        <ab>Community-based frail older adults, burdened with complex medical and social needs, are at great risk for preventable rapid rehospitalizations. Although federal and state regulations are in place to address the care transitions between the hospital and nursing home, no such guidelines exist for the much larger population of community-dwelling frail older adults. Few studies have looked at interventions to prevent rehospitalizations in this large segment of the older adult population. Similarly, standardized disease management approaches that lower hospitalization rates in an independent adult population may not suffice for guiding the care of frail persons. Care management interventions currently face unique challenges in their attempt to improve the transitional care of community-dwelling older adults. However, impending national imperatives aimed at reducing potentially avoidable hospitalizations will soon demand and reward care management strategies that identify frail persons early in the discharge process and promote the sharing of critical information among patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. Opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of care-related communications must focus on the effective blending of training and technology for improving communications vital to successful care transitions.</ab>

        <ab>Aims.  This study aims to explore nurses’ experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem. Background.  Urinary tract infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition. Design.  Qualitative. Methods.  A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Results.  When managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed the basis for deciding whether the patient’s urinary condition should be managed by nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to improve nurses’ existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified. Conclusion.  Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem. Relevance to clinical practice.  Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive ‘basic urinary tract infection care’ on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Balance during quiet stance involves the complex interactions of multiple postural control systems, which may degrade with frailty. The complexity of center of pressure (COP) dynamics, as quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE), during quiet standing is lower in older adults, especially those with falls. We hypothesized that COP dynamics from frail elderly individuals demonstrate less complexity than those from nonfrail elderly controls; complexity decreases when performing a dual task; and postural complexity during quiet standing is independent of other conventional correlates of balance control, such as age and vision.</ab>

The service screens all patients admitted who are over the age of 75 for problems specific to a frail population and to identify where ongoing specialist support, referral or advice is indicated. Patients with complex problems undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The service has reduced length of stay and resulted in better care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives.  The aim of this paper was to explore carers’ and nurses’ appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement. Background.  Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations. Design.  This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. Methods.  The convenience sample ( n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results.  Various similarities and differences between nurses’ and carers’ appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: ‘appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed’, ‘appraising the older people as able to continue living at home’, ‘being ambivalent about nursing home placement’ and ‘being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement’. Conclusions.  Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues. Relevance to clinical practice.  Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Frailty in older adults, defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms, is associated with abnormal levels in individual physiological systems. We tested the hypothesis that it is the critical mass of physiological systems abnormal that is associated with frailty, over and above the status of each individual system, and that the relationship is nonlinear. Methods. Using data on women aged 70 - 79 years from the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and II, multiple analytic approaches assessed the cross-sectional association of frailty with eight physiological measures. Results. Abnormality in each system (anemia, inflammation, insulin-like growth factor-1, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, hemoglobin A1c, micronutrients, adiposity, and fine motor speed) was significantly associated with frailty status. However, adjusting for the level of each system measure, the mean number of systems impaired significantly and nonlinearly predicted frailty. Those with three or more systems impaired were most likely to be frail, with odds of frailty increasing with number of systems at abnormal level, from odds ratios (ORs) of 4.8 to 11 to 26 for those with one to two, three to four, and five or more systems abnormal (p &lt; .05 for all). Finally, two subgroups were identified, one with isolated or no systems abnormal and a second (in 30%) with multiple systems abnormal. The latter group was independently associated with being frail (OR = 2.6, p &lt; .05), adjusting for confounders and chronic diseases and then controlling for individual systems. Conclusions. Overall, these findings indicate that the likelihood of frailty increases nonlinearly in relationship to the number of physiological systems abnormal, and the number of abnormal systems is more predictive than the individual abnormal system. These findings support theories that aggregate loss of complexity, with aging, in physiological systems is an important cause of frailty. Implications are that a threshold loss of complexity, as indicated by number of systems abnormal, may undermine homeostatic adaptive capacity, leading to the development of frailty and its associated risk for subsequent adverse outcomes. It further suggests that replacement of any one deficient system may not be sufficient to prevent or ameliorate frailty.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Seventy percent of people over 65 years of age have hypertension, and one third of elders fall each year. These conditions frequently coexist, and each carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with hypertension. Data sources: A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. Conclusions: Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication management accordingly. Implications for practice: This article will assist the NP to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Age-related deterioration in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms leads to decreased complexity in their output. For example, the degradation of cardiac autonomic control results in loss of complexity in the heart rate signal. Frailty is a state of critically impaired homeostasis that results in heightened vulnerability to stressors. We propose a new measure of heart rate variability (HRV) to capture the impairment in cardiac autonomic control associated with frailty. Methods. Traditional time and frequency domain indices of HRV were obtained from 2-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 276 women (65-101 years old) in the Women's Health and Aging Study-I. Principal components analysis was conducted on the correlation matrix of HRV indices. Frailty was defined using a validated instrument. Regression models were used to evaluate associations of HRV measures with age, frailty, and 5-year mortality. Results. The first two principal components (PCs), PC1 and PC2, explained 90% of the variance in HRV indices. PC1 is the mean of log-transformed HRV indices. PC2 is a linear combination of log-transformed indices, with positive weights for very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), and negative weights for high frequency (HF), root-mean-squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and proportion of all N-N intervals that are larger than 50 ms (pNN50). Decreases in SDNN, VLF, LF, and LF/HF were associated with an increased risk of frailty. PC2 was more strongly associated with age (ß = -.23, p &lt; .001) and frailty (ß = -.73, p &lt; 10-5) than were the individual HRV indices and LFIHF. PC2 was also the best predictor of 5-year mortality (ß = -.60 &lt; p &lt; 10-6). Conclusions. Cardiac autonomic control, as reflected by HRV, is impaired in frailty. A new measure derived from PC aggregation of traditional HRV indices provides a compact summary of this impairment.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To compare the validity of a parsimonious frailty index (components: weight loss, inability to rise from a chair, and poor energy (Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) index)) with that of the more complex Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) index (components: unintentional weight loss, low grip strength, poor energy, slowness, and low physical activity) for prediction of adverse outcomes in older men. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Six U.S. centers. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand one hundred thirty-two men aged 67 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty status categorized as robust, intermediate stage, or frail using the SOF index and criteria similar to those used in CHS index. Falls were reported three times for 1 year. Disability (≥1 new impairments in performing instrumental activities of daily living) ascertained at 1 year. Fractures and deaths ascertained during 3 years of follow-up. Analysis of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistics compared for models containing the SOF index versus those containing the CHS index. RESULTS: Greater evidence of frailty as defined by either index was associated with greater risk of adverse outcomes. Frail men had a higher age-adjusted risk of recurrent falls (odds ratio (OR)=3.0–3.6), disability (OR=5.3–7.5), nonspine fracture (hazard ratio (HR)=2.2–2.3), and death (HR=2.5–3.5) ( P&lt;.001 for all models). AUC comparisons revealed no differences between models with the SOF index and models with the CHS index in discriminating falls (AUC=0.63, P=.97), disability (AUC=0.68, P=.86), nonspine fracture (AUC=0.63, P=.90), or death (AUC=0.71 for model with SOF index and 0.72 for model with CHS index, P=.19). CONCLUSION: The simple SOF index predicts risk of falls, disability, fracture, and mortality in men as well as the more-complex CHS index.</ab>

        <ab>Given the anticipated limited availability of geriatricians for the foreseeable future, how should the geriatrician's specialized clinical skills be deployed to optimally benefit the health of our aging population? Directors of geriatrics academic programs (DGAPs) at all 145 U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were asked this question as part of a winter 2007 on-line survey. The DGAPs were to indicate the types of patients who would most benefit from a geriatrician's services in three practice situations: primary care, consultations, and care in the hospital. The survey response rate was 74.5%. There was high consensus among the DGAPs on the benefits of having a geriatrician care for the most complex and vulnerable older adults in primary care and hospital settings. There was slightly less consensus as to when geriatrics consultations are beneficial. The patient subsets that were viewed as benefiting the most from geriatrician care were aged 85 and older, frailty, geriatric syndromes, severe functional impairment, and complexity. The results of this survey suggest that, because of the predicted shortage of geriatricians, the DGAPs would target geriatricians to work with the most vulnerable older adults. These findings offer the beginning of a consensus statement as to the role of geriatricians in the continuum of American medical care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To assess whether less physiological complexity underlying regulation of heart rate dynamics, as indicated by lower approximate entropy for heart rate (ApEnHR), is associated with frailty. For supporting validity, relationships between frailty and traditional linear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were also assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, a community-based observational study, 1992 to 1995. PARTICIPANTS: Subset of 389 community-dwelling women aged years and older with moderate to severe disability with ApEnHR data (convenience sampling). MEASUREMENTS: Electrocardiographic Holter recordings obtained over 2- to 3-hour periods were processed for ApEnHR and HRV measures. ApEnHR is a nonlinear statistic that quantifies the regularity of heart rate fluctuations over time. Lower ApEnHR is characteristic of heart rate time series containing a high proportion of repetitive patterns. Frailty was defined according to validated phenotype criteria. RESULTS: Median ApEnHR was lower in frail than in nonfrail subjects ( P=.02). Lower ApEnHR (top quartile) was associated with lower likelihood of frailty than higher ApEnHR (bottom three quartiles) (odds ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.26–0.86), even after adjustment for major confounders. Frailty was consistently associated with lower HRV as assessed using time- and frequency-domain indices. CONCLUSION: This study supports the notion that less physiological complexity marks frailty and provides an empirical basis to the concept of frailty as a syndrome of homeostatic impairment. Future research will determine whether noninvasive measures of physiological complexity underlying heart rate dynamics might be useful for screening and monitoring of clinical vulnerability in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last decade there has been !in enormous expansion of research focused on defining the role of inflammation in aging, age-related diseases, disability, and frailty. The availability of methods to measure cytokines and other inflammatory mediators or markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critically important. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the most widely used and best validated method, is limited by its ability to measure only a single protein in each sample. Recent developments in serum cytokine quantification technology include multiplex arrays, which offer the potential of better evaluating the complexity and dynamic nature of inflammatory responses and offer substantial cost and sample savings over traditional ELISA measurements. Despite potential advantages of this new technology, experience with these techniques is limited, and it has not emerged to date as the gold standard in inflammatory mediator measurement. This article reviews ELISA and the emerging multiplex technologies, compares the cost and effectiveness of recently developed multiplex arrays with traditional ELISA technology, and provides specific recommendations for investigators interested in measuring serum inflammatory mediators in older adults.</ab>

        <ab>The article examines the data regarding the importance to men of private transportation, particularly in their masculinity and self-identity and its relevance to aging issues. It states that older men are more likely to involve in road traffic accidents and the main cause is their inability to process complex traffic situations quickly. It explores several factors affecting driving cessation for older men including health status, competence awareness, and technological advances. It concludes the need for education and to disseminate information for the whole driving population to respond to issues surrounding driving licenses.</ab>

        <ab>Nurse-led case management programmes have become increasingly popular over the last 15 years. Countries such as the USA, Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands have long running case management programmes in place for frail elderly people. The Department of Health in England has recently introduced a ‘community matron’ role to provide case management to patients with highly complex long-term conditions; a group that is predominantly comprised of elderly people. Department of Health policy documents do not define the day-to-day role of community matrons but instead describe the objectives and principles of case management for long-term conditions. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe case management from the perspective of patients and carers in order to develop a clearer understanding of how the model is being delivered for patients with long-term conditions. In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 72 patients and 52 carers who had experience of case management. Five categories of case management tasks emerged from the data: clinical care, co-ordination of care, education, advocacy and psychosocial support. Psychosocial support was emphasised by both patients and carers, and was viewed as equally important to clinical care. Patient and carer perceptions of case management appear to contrast with descriptions contained in Department of Health guidance, suggesting an ‘implementation surplus’ in relation to the policy. This particularly appears to be the case for psychosocial support activities, which are not described in official policy documents. The provision of significant psychosocial support by community matrons also appears to differentiate the model from most other case management programmes for frail elderly people described in the literature. The findings emphasise the importance of seeking patient and carer input when designing new case management programmes.</ab>

        <ab>Geriatricians have embraced the term “geriatric syndrome,” using it extensively to highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors—older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility—were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.</ab>

        <ab>Preventing injuries in older populations (aged 50-86 years) is more complex than in younger populations because of frailty, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and physical and cognitive functional limitations. To improve accessibility and delivery of comprehensive, focused injury prevention, we developed a model incorporating applicable features of our national children's program with additional elements to address challenges of older populations. The older adult injury prevention model addresses gaps in prevention by improving access to risk factor screening, safety devices, education, counseling, medical care, and referrals.

        <ab>The concept of ‘frailty’, as used within public health and social services, represents a powerful practice where cultural constructions, the global economic rationale of cost restriction and the biomedical focus on ageing collide as inscriptions on the bodies of older women. This article draws on complex forms of resistance witnessed within three separate studies: narrative interviews on ‘frailty’, semi-structured interviews and participant observation in community organizations with older women in Montreal and Boston. Findings reveal how older women exercise resistance in complex ways, both consciously subverting and coopting the notion of ‘frailty’ on an individual and collective level. Such resistance demonstrates the tensions between undermining dominant notions of ageing, and fulfilling prescribed gendered and age-based assumptions about older women and their bodies. The intersections and forms of older women's resistance challenge social constructs, social expectations and what is recognized as resistance.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this research was to disclose the characteristics of quality of life as perceived by physically frail but lucid elderly people living in nursing homes to increase the understanding of the phenomenon of quality of life in this setting. Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents’ narration. The participants’ concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what matters most in relation to their quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Rectal prolapse (RP), although most frequently encountered in the frail elderly, may also occur in children. This condition is most troublesome in the premature infant with significant associated comorbidities. Pediatric RP most often can be managed conservatively with expectant and/or judicious use of laxative-based bowel regimens. In rare instances of intractable RP, surgical intervention ranging from simple (sclerotherapy, Thiersch wire) to complex (perineal or transabdominal bowel resection) becomes necessary. We describe a modification of the Altemeier technique using a novel sequential linear stapling technique to treat intractable RP in a 5.0-kg infant with severe coexisting life-threatening comorbidities. The child had resumption of bowel movements on postoperative Day 1 and has had no recurrences. Sequential linear stapling technique for perineal resection of intractable pediatric RP appears to be a safe and potentially attractive alternative.</ab>

        <ab>Urinary incontinence and other lower urinary tract symptoms exert a major influence on the health and independence of frail older people. Detrusor underactivity (DU) is defined as a contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or a failure to achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span. DU may influence the clinical presentation and impede the therapy of disorders as common and as disparate as detrusor overactivity, urinary retention, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Urodynamically, nearly two-thirds of incontinent nursing home residents exhibit DU. The clinical diagnosis of DU when present alone or in association with other bladder conditions such as detrusor overactivity (detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility (DHIC)) is challenging, because symptoms lack adequate precision. A catheterized and increasingly noninvasive ultrasound-based postvoid residual assessment allows a bedside diagnosis of retention and may suggest the presence of DU in individuals (mostly women) with a low likelihood of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). Nevertheless, it cannot differentiate primary DU from retention secondary to BOO. The management of individuals with DHIC remains unsatisfactory, because antispasmodic anticholinergic medications may worsen retention, whereas bethanechol does not improve bladder emptying. Human detrusor biopsies reveal axonal degeneration, muscle loss, and fibrosis in DU. Animal studies suggest that multiple risk factors, including retention itself, lack of estrogen, infection, inflammation, and aging, may contribute to DU. Priority areas for future research include efforts to facilitate clinical nonurodynamic diagnosis of probable DU plus translational research designed to address the pathogenesis of this complex multifactorial geriatric syndrome.</ab>

        <ab>Older people constitute one of the highest risk groups for suicide. Existing research in this area has been largely dominated by a risk factor approach. This is of limited usefulness since only a minority of those at risk go on to make an attempt. Therefore, prediction, prevention and the management of risk remain challenging. The present study aimed to capture the subjective experience of older people who had recently made a suicide attempt through exploring their understanding of the pathway to and from this attempt, within the context of ageing. Fifteen participants were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Three broad themes emerged—Struggle (experiencing life as a struggle before and after the attempt, and in relation to growing older), Control (trying to maintain control over life before the attempt, and following it either failing or succeeding to regain control) and Visibility (feeling invisible or disconnected from others and trying to fight against this before the attempt and either becoming more or less connected afterwards). Risk factors identified in the literature were often absent or construed by participants as not relevant to their attempt. Individual accounts highlight the diversity and complexity of experience of older people who attempt suicide.</ab>

        <ab>This study explored medical conditions associated with mortality among veterans following transfemoral amputation, transtibial amputation, or hip disarticulation. We applied logistic regression models to identify clinical factors associated with mortality postoperatively. The participants included patients with lower-limb amputations (n = 2,375) who were discharged from Veterans Health Administration hospitals between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003. Most (98.9%) were male. We measured cumulative in-hospital, 3-month, and 1-year mortality. The results were 180 in-hospital deaths, 368 by 3 months, and 634 by the 1-year postsurgical amputation date. Those who had perioperative systemic sepsis (odds ratio = 4.28, 95% confidence interval = 2.87--6.39) had more than a fourfold increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality. Congestive heart failure, renal failure, and liver disease were significantly associated with mortality at all time periods. Metastatic cancer was associated only at 3 months and 1 year. We concluded that high medical complexity and mortality rates attest to the need for careful medical oversight during the postacute rehabilitation period.</ab>

        <ab>Preparing nurses to meet the care needs of an expanding aging population is a challenge for nursing. Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current vacancies. This article describes the integration of long-term care experiences into senior year community health practicums and reports on a qualitative analysis to evaluate the project's impact on student attitudes and intentions toward geriatric nursing roles.</ab>

        <ab>Identifying vulnerable older people and understanding the causes and consequences of their vulnerability is of human concern and an essential task of social policy. To date, vulnerability in old age has mainly been approached by identifying high risk groups, like the poor, childless, frail or isolated. Yet vulnerability is the outcome of complex interactions of discrete risks, namely of being exposed to a threat, of a threat materialising, and of lacking the defences or resources to deal with a threat. In this article, we review approaches to vulnerability in various disciplines in order to develop a systematic framework for approaching vulnerability. This framework distinguishes and examines the interactions among the domains of exposure, threats, coping capacities and outcomes. Drawing on European and Asian gerontological literature, we discuss what might be meant by these domains and their place in the understanding of vulnerability in old age. Two case studies are presented — one on homelessness in Britain, the other on familial care provision in Indonesia — to illustrate the ways in which specific vulnerabilities are created and distributed over the lifecourse.</ab>

        <ab>Background  The elderly are characterized by a high prevalence of chronic heart failure (CHF) and frailty, which is a complex interaction of physical, psychological and social impairment. This study aimed to examine the predictive role of frailty on long-term mortality in elderly subjects with CHF. Materials and methods  The study assessed long-term mortality after 12-year follow up in 120 subjects with CHF and 1139 subjects without CHF, selected in 1992, from a random sample of the elderly population in the Campania region of Italy. Frailty was assessed according to a ‘Frailty Staging System’. Results  Subjects with CHF were prevalently female (60%) and older than 75 years (mean 75·9 ± 6·7); subjects without CHF were prevalently female (56·4%) and younger than 75 years (mean 74·0 ± 6·3). In subjects with and without CHF stratified into classes of frailty there was a statistically significant increase in age, comorbidity, disability and low social support, and a decrease in MMSE score. Moreover, death progressively increased more with frailty in subjects (70·0% to 94·4%, P &lt; 0·03) than in those without (43·8.% to 88·3%, P &lt; 0·0001) CHF. The Kaplan–Meier analysis shows that at 9 years the probability of survival progressively decreased as frailty increased (45·5% to 0%) in subjects with CHF and from 62·8% to 25·9% in subjects without CHF. The Cox regression analysis indicated that frailty is predictive of mortality in the multivariate model adjusted for several variables including sex and age in subjects with and without CHF. Moreover, the analysis showed that frailty is more predictive of mortality in elderly subjects with CHF when it was analyzed either as continuous (1·48 vs. 1·36) or as a dummy (3 vs. 1 = 1·62 vs. 1·24) variable. Conclusions  Thus mortality among elderly subjects with or without CHF increases with frailty. Moreover, frailty is more predictive of long-term mortality in elderly subjects with than in those without CHF. Hence, frailty represents a new independent variable for predicting long-term mortality in elderly subjects with CHF.</ab>

        <ab>Issues of older adults are often ill-structured and complex, requiring the application of insights from different disciplines to be adequately addressed. Gerontology has often used a multidisciplinary rather than an integrated interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary and problem-based learning (PBL) provide pedagogical tools which teach gerontology students skills for understanding and resolving gerontological issues. The paper presents the concepts of interdisciplinarity and problem-based learning, the types of interdisciplinarity (interdisciplinarity at micro and macro levels of analysis, interdisciplinarity with different attributes of the same unit of analysis), learning outcomes of interdisciplinarity and problem-based learning, the incorporation of interdisciplinary problem-based learning in academic programs, steps of interdisciplinary problem-based study of a gerontological issue, and directions for the future study of this approach.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this review is to critically synthesize the existing literature on family involvement in residential long-term care. Studies that examined family involvement in various long-term care venues were identified through extensive searches of the literature. Future research and practice must consider the complexity of family structure, adopt longitudinal designs, provide direct empirical links between family involvement and resident outcomes, and offer rigorous evaluation of interventions in order to refine the literature.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses about geropsychiatric inpatient care, which is regarded as an important and challenging area of nursing practice. The number of complex, frail older adults with comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions is predicted to increase rapidly. In turn, specialized care settings to diagnose and treat mentally ill older adults and a cadre of expertly trained health providers who have expertise in both geriatric and psychiatric care will obviously be needed. Training initiatives, instituted in the 1980s through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), held promise for responding to this challenge by training an adequate number of interdisciplinary geriatric psychiatric professionals to care for mentally ill older people in a variety of settings.</ab>

It is stated that oncology nurses play a vital role in the management of CINV. It is indicated that serotonin-receptor antagonists, neurokinin 1 antagonists and steroids can control nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. It is concluded that safe and effective management of CINV in older patients involves consideration of commorbidities.</ab>

        <ab>To expand the ability to assess physical frailty by developing a Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty (CGIC-PF) instrument. Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. Academic centers. Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less. The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.</ab>

        <ab>The main theories on population aging based on recent data on human longevity, life expectancy, morbidity changes, disability trends, and mortality decrease are presented and discussed within their own geographic, cultural, socioeconomic, and medical contexts. The complex interactions between all these components do not facilitate trend forecasting of aging population (healthy aging versus disability pandemic). In the context of population aging, four elements were introduced with their implications: 1) an increase in the survival rates of sick persons, which would explain the expansion of morbidity, 2) a control of the progression of chronic diseases, which would explain a subtle equilibrium between the decrease in mortality and the increase in disability, 3) an improvement of the health status and health behaviors of new cohorts of elderly people, which would explain the compression of morbidity, and eventually 4) an emergence of very old and frail populations, which would explain a new expansion of morbidity. Obviously, all these elements coexist today, and future trend scenarios--expansion or compression of disability--depend on their respective weights leading to the need of elaborating "a general theory on population aging." This theory has to be based on a world harmonization of functional decline measurements and a periodic "International Aging Survey" to monitor global aging through a sample of carefully selected countries.</ab>

        <ab>Types of medication misunderstanding among community-dwelling elderly people were studied. Community-dwelling people who were at least 65 years of age and who volunteered to participate in a medication-review program were recruited for the study. A structured interview including a background interview, attitudinal questions, and questions related to dosage, frequency, timing, and what to do if a dose was missed was conducted. A total of 375 people were included in the study. Of these, 232 (62%) showed perfect understanding of their medication regimens. Twenty-eight (7.5%) of the subjects with less than perfect understanding misunderstood a limited aspect of their regimens across multiple medications, most frequently what to do if a dose was missed. These subjects had the least complex regimens, could name their medications and describe their purpose, and rated themselves as having few medical problems. Their lack of knowledge was not attributed to cognitive problems. Twenty-seven subjects (7%) did not know multiple aspects of at least one medication and appeared to be at high risk for nonadherence. These individuals had the most complex regimens, had difficulty naming and explaining the purpose of their medications, and rated themselves as less adherent. Eighty-eight subjects (23.5%) demonstrated mixed problems with understanding; they did not show a defined pattern attributable to cognitive or noncognitive factors. A majority of people over the age of 65 years had good understanding of the drugs they were taking.</ab>

        <ab>Through the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Technology for Successful Aging (RERC-Tech-Aging) elder perspectives on cell phone designs and features were explored. Six-hundred and sixty-five participants (596 elders with disabilities, 69 adults with disabilities) from Northern Florida, Southern California, and Western New York were surveyed through face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, or mailed surveys. The survey addressed satisfaction, importance, frequency of use, methods for learning, barriers to use, views on features, and ways the cell phone had helped. The majority of elders (60%) valued their cell phone, and a large proportion (87%) use the cell phone for emergencies. Only one third of elders reported using their cell phone daily. Suggestions for improving phone design included increasing button size (50% of subjects), increasing display size (29% of subjects), increasing overall size of the cell phone (24% subjects), and decreasing the complexity of the phone.</ab>

        <ab>The 'greying' of populations — the demographic shift in which general populations are 'ageing older' — has raised concerns over the future needs of tomorrow's elderly population and contributed to changes in the public persona of elderly people. Traditional representations such as the 'frail elderly' are now complemented by newer representations such as the 'remarkably' youthful elderly. This article explores the ways a group of lower socio-economic status women draw upon representations of the active and inactive elderly evident in a television documentary, when making sense of the contemporary search for the fountain of youth. Participants' discussion of the programme reveals complex relationships among notions of consumer choice, scientific progress and religion. We conclude by exploring the implications of depictions of the active and inactive elderly in framing the contemporary search for the fountain of youth.</ab>

        <ab>Aim. The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy in identifying and describing older adults as frail. Background. Despite the dramatic increase in use of the term ‘frailty’ over the past two decades, there is a lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. Method. The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. Conclusion. The review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the contribution of both individual and environmental factors.</ab>

        <ab>The high burden of illness and frailty common among our growing population of older adults often results in fragmentation of care across providers and health care systems, increasing the complexity and costs of caring for these patients. Information technology offers one way to meet this challenge. Scientists at the Regenstrief Institute have more than a quarter-century of experience in using medical informatics to support clinicians in the day-to-day care of older adults. Their research has progressed through several evolutionary cycles, beginning with the acquisition of relevant data and moving to studies of the most efficient and effective mechanisms that bring information to bear at the time of clinical decision making. Information technology designed with the input of the end user has the greatest promise of changing provider behavior because it balances technological challenges with the cultural context of the practice environment. One topic of active research is information technology to support transitions of care among sites and providers. These transitions place older adults at increased risk for avoidable illness, death, and health care costs. Information systems that improve communication among providers during these transitions have the potential to improve safety and reduce costs.</ab>

        <ab>Recent curriculum changes at McGill University include a mandatory 4-week clerkship for third-year medical students. The basis of this clerkship is the assessment and management of frail elderly who have a combination of complex acute and chronic medical problems and functional disabilities. It includes the understanding of the need for continuity of care across settings and the transition from hospital to the community. Our main purpose is to offer students a learning experience based upon self-reflection, access to technology, interactive learning and permanent feedback. To accomplish the technological goals, didactic sessions were mostly electronic-based with two main components: web-based interactive modules that include the contents in seven web-based interactive lectures complemented with pre- and post-tests, and an electronic portfolio to assess students' acquisition of skills and attitudes. We expect that implementation of this model of clinical clerkship will prepare future physicians, not only for the practice of geriatric medicine, but also for different medical and surgical specialties, and will enhance the attitudes, knowledge, and skills practitioners need to care for older people.</ab>

        <ab>Each of the fields of geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice intensifies the usefulness and effectiveness of the other. Combining geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice also magnifies the complexity of two singularly complex fields. However, the subtle reasons for their complexity may escape the understanding of clinicians, educators, policy makers, and administrators. Attempting to treat older patients who have complex problems while ignoring common principles of geriatrics and teamwork can cause a kind of double jeopardy. It can potentially harm the patient and decrease the provider's sense of mastery. Training either students or health care providers to appreciate the interactions and the complexities of these two fields could produce a double indemnity for the health care system and for older persons who need health care. It requires recognizing subtle factors like the barrier of presumed knowledge, the interpretation of the meaning of function, frailty, the lure of medical technology, professional hierarchies, diverse views of disease, and the myth of insufficient evidence.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract Care in the community has been constructed on the basis of professional support for carers who, as a result of community care policy that has released highly dependant people from residential care and long-stay wards, are carrying out a wide range of tasks, including complex health care activities. The present paper examines the health care activities currently undertaken by family carers and the way in which they work with, and are supported by, professional nurses in the home. It compares and contrasts the approaches of both groups to care-giving for this client group. The authors conclude by making some suggestions for improving the way in which family carers and nurses work together in the home.</ab>

        <ab>Under basal resting conditions most healthy physiologic systems demonstrate highly irregular, complex dynamics that represent interacting regulatory processes operating over multiple time scales. These processes prime the organism for an adaptive response, making it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given set of boundary conditions, most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively short periods of time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response mode, which is denoted "reactive tuning." Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in resting dynamics and maladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline and frailty. Nonlinear mathematical techniques that quantify physiologic dynamics may predict the onset of frailty, and interventions aimed toward restoring healthy dynamics may prevent functional decline.</ab>

        <ab>Recruitment of frail older people to research: lessons learnt through experience Background. With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. Aims of the paper. This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of research related to ethical practice. Conclusions. Recruitment of frail older people to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older people to research while protecting their right to refuse.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Purpose. Although much is known about the benefits of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular health, little research has been done on the effect of aerobic exercise on motor performance. This study examined whether aerobic exercise has an effect on visuospatial information processing during finger-movement tracking in elderly subjects.  Subjects. Fifteen elderly subjects (mean age=3.2 years, SD=5.7, range=72-91) from a senior housing complex were randomly assigned to a control group or an experimental (exercise) group. Twelve subjects completed the study, and data obtained for 10 subjects were used for data analysis (2 control subjects were eliminated to allow for matched-pairs analysis between the experimental and control groups). The control group (n=5) had a mean age of 80.2 years (SD=7.8). Subjects in the experimental group (n=5) had a mean age of 84.8 years (SD=2.5).  Methods. The intervention consisted of group exercise 3 times a week for 8 consecutive weeks, and included calisthenics (eg, marching in place, side stepping, mock boxing), stationary bicycling, and walking. A finger-movement tracking test and submaximal graded exercise tolerance step tests were performed before and after training to determine changes in finger-movement tracking and any aerobic training effects.  Results. Matched-pairs t tests showed a difference in tracking from pretest to posttest in the experimental group compared with the control group. Step test performance did not differ between the 2 groups. Discussion and Conclusion. The results of this small-scale study with a limited number of subjects indicate that, for elderly people, finger-movement tracking performance can improve with aerobic exercise, despite the absence of an aerobic training effect. Possible mechanisms for the treatment effect on information processing are discussed. [Bakken RC, Carey JR, Di Fabio RP, et al.

A population-based quasi-experimental design was used with pre- and post-implementation measurements in an intervention and a control area. The program was based on cross-sectoral participation in detecting and taking action against injuries among the elderly. Change in the relative risk of injury was estimated by the odds ratio. Morbidity in moderately (AIS 2) severe injury in the study area was reduced from 46 per 1000 population years to 25 per 1000 population years (odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.46–0.65), while the minor (AIS 1) injuries increased (odds ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval 1.21–1.91). The risk of severe or fatal (AIS 3–6) injuries remained constant. In the study area, only a slight decrease in the total morbidity rate was observed (odds ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.77–0.99). In the control area, there was no evident change in the total morbidity rates. Falls decreased or showed a tendency to decrease in the age groups 65 to 79-y-old in the study area, while they increased in the older age group. The results indicate that no sharp boundaries should be drawn between safety education, physical conditioning, environmental adjustments and secondary prevention measures when planning safety promotion among the elderly. Future studies should address these issues along with the methodological complexity associated with assessment of participatory community-based safety promotion programs.Public Health (2001) 115, 308–316.</ab>

        <ab>Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in  monitoring some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer  perceptions and experiences of services and involvement of users/carers  in assessment and review. Using data from the study Evaluating  Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or  mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales  receiving community care services, this investigation examines three  crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction  with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also  two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction  with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination  of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their  association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction.  This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each  characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each  satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant  effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping  warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with  reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work  involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction  was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life  satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its  dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently  satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below  average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from  this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and  suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need  to...</ab>

        <ab>The transition from curative to palliative care for elderly patients with cancer-related asthenia presents complex challenges to oncologists. A result of this complexity is a lack of regard for the maintenance of physical and mental function. This study examined the effects of comprehensive, multidisciplinary, inpatient rehabilitation on the physical and mental function of elderly cancer patients with asthenia. We found that both physical and mental function improved following inpatient rehabilitation. However, it is difficult to predict which patients benefit most from rehabilitation. Nevertheless, functional improvement following rehabilitation may allow medical caregivers to better distribute the type and intensity of care, and reduce the caregiver burden experienced by family members in the home.</ab>

        <ab>Engagement in leisure activity is a complex and subjective concept. It may be difficult for older adults who currently have physical and/or sensory disabilities to continue participation in home-based leisure choices they formerly enjoyed. Disability and social isolation may negatively impact on their pattern of leisure participation in the home. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of assistive devices to increase participation in valued home-based leisure activities by older adults who have physical and/or sensory disabilities. The study considered the need for custom made, or specifically adapted devices, to accomplish valued leisure activities by this target population. A random sample of 25 participants was drawn from the Consumer Assessment Study (CAS) at the University at Buffalo Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Aging (RERC-Aging). Participants were seen in their homes for an interview regarding current living arrangement, work history, regard for inclusion of leisure as valued activity, past and current patterns of leisure activity engagement, and temporal use of leisure in their present daily routine. For 17 of the 25 participants, a target leisure activity was identified for intervention using assistive devices. The investigator analyzed the activity and searched for assistive devices to address the need. Assistive devices included commercially available products, devices from vendors who cater to special needs populations, custom adaptations and/or custom designed devices. Participants were supplied with devices and trained to use them. A subsequent contact at their home and/or phone interview was conducted to ascertain the participant's pattern of device use and current satisfaction with the target leisure activity. Twenty devices were supplied to 17 participants. The three custom made devices and one custom adapted device were used with maximum satisfaction by participants. Of the eight commercial devices targeted for ...</ab>

        <ab>Using Kinds of Love by May Sarton in gerontology classes as a text for studying human development affords an opportunity to explore theory and research on aging. The story takes place in a small New England town through one year: fall to summer. The plot involves daily events in the lives of several characters who represent various ages and psychosocial development. The tasks of adolescence, middle age, and old age are eloquently described in the motivation and experience of Sarton's characters. Youth, middle - aged, and elders play out their lives, but it is the elder characters who represent the richest opportunity to examine the struggle for integrity, inner life, gender shift, and meaning. As a text for the study of gerontology from a human development perspective, Kinds of Love demonstrates the sweep of growth and change that are made up in intricate day - to - day tasks, decisions, and quiet ruminations. The narrative, complexity of characters, and environmental context illuminate an array of developmental movements. When analyzed within Eriksonian, constructive developmental, and relational frameworks, the novel allows readers to study the nature of human change over time. This article explores psychosocial theory and research which are found in classroom reading of Kinds of Love by May Sarton.</ab>

        <ab>Frail elders with complex biopsychosocial and functional problems require the collaboration of many caregivers who are often working on different teams and may come from different organizations. The development and maintenance of collaborative alliances among caregivers working on different teams is the challenge of interteam work. It is a challenge because the quality of collaborative alliances in complex environments may predict outcomes better than the internal processes of individual teams and because researchers and educators in gerontology have yet to address this important issue. In this article, business and small group research on collaborative alliances is examined and a familiar truth emerges. Just as putting individuals together to work does not necessarily make for effective teamwork, so putting teams together to work does not necessarily produce effective interteam work. Several conceptual tools for thinking about interteam work are explored. These include a framework for understanding the effect of the diverse cultures of collaborating teams, a set of boundary-crossing functions to enhance interteam linkage, an application from general systems theory that recognizes interteam collaboration as a systems issue, and a set of outcome expectations emerging from interteam experiences that feed forward and determine the quality of future collaboration. Throughout, the discussion of these tools draws on illustrations from practice in clinical gerontology.</ab>

        <ab>Background. There are few studies that document the outcomes experienced by very old patients who undergo major surgery. Methods. This is a case series and 7-year follow-up of 116 consecutive patients who were aged 90 years or older and underwent major surgery at a large university-affiliated community hospital. We describe the functional status., short- and long-term mortality, and predictors of mortality in this group of frail elders. Results. The 116 nonagenarians in this study underwent 134 major operations. Sixty-three patients were admitted to the hospital from a nursing home. The most common surgical procedures were for hip fracture, lower extremity amputation, and abdominal problems. Nineteen patients died in the hospital following surgery, and 23 patients died within 30 days of operation. Follow-up at 7 years revealed that all but three patients had died. Survival was worse for patients admitted from nursing homes, those who were nonambulatory before surgery, and those with major or complete functional impairment. Conclusions. Major surgery in nonagenarians is associated with a 20% perioperative mortality. Functional status and ambulatory ability are maintained in most patients. Whether to operate on these frail elders is a complex decision.</ab>

        <ab>This article discusses factors that affect the participation of ethnic and racial minority elders in the political process, underscoring the heterogeneity of the minority elder population and stressing that policies must reflect that complexity. Older persons in the United States are a formidable political force, whether measured by registration and voting rates, proliferation of old-age organizations, or presence of silver-haired legislatures. But what about elderly members of minority populations?By most account, minority elders do not enjoy political visibility, are not a major component of the membership base making up the national aging organizations, and have limited electoral ability at the local and state level. The minority population is aging. The benefits of improved public health measures in this country and the increased longevity enjoyed by young immigrant groups mean that they, too, will see major increases in the proportion of persons considered senior citizens. In this country, those who are dependent upon social services must have effective political advocates and they must learn to maneuver through the social services system. Factors like the "youth culture" orientation from the early sixties, the coming of age of the minority baby boom generation, and the changes in families being experienced by minority communities have combined to erode the status of the respected elders in culturally diverse communities. The effects of assimilation and acculturation are important indicators in understanding the past and future potential of minority elders to be political players.</ab>
