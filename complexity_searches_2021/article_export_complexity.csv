27	28	Complicated Versus Complexity: When An Old Woman And Her Daughter Meet The Health Care System.	2020	28	10.1186/s12905-020-01092-5	33046068		28	20.0	1.0	230	"BACKGROUND: Detecting infection in frail elderly is a challenge due to lack of specific signs and symptoms. We highlight the complex situation when an elderly woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is explored in the discussion. RESULTS: The latent content analysis of the daughter's story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women recovers quickly. CONCLUSION: The healthcare system should embrace the complexity in the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage ""correctly"" for later placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption of complexity."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	28	Bmc Women'S Health		28	sund levander,mÃ¤rta	Sund Levander	MÃ¤rta		1.0	7.0	6.0	1.0
323	324	Unravelling The Differences Between Complexity And Frailty In Old Age: Findings From A Constructivist Grounded Theory Study.	2011	343	10.1111/j.1365-2850.2010.01630.x			343	18.0	1.0	67	UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=57220072&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	343	Journal of Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1.0	343	mcgeorge,s.j	mcgeorge	s.j		1.0	7.0	6.0	1.0

The complexity of center of pressure (COP) dynamics, as quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE), during quiet standing is lower in older adults, especially those with falls. We hypothesized that COP dynamics from frail elderly individuals demonstrate less complexity than those from nonfrail elderly controls; complexity decreases when performing a dual task; and postural complexity during quiet standing is independent of other conventional correlates of balance control, such as age and vision.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=47451679&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		349	hyun,gu.kang	hyun	gu.kang	Y	1.0	5.0	4.0	0.0
361	362	From Double Jeopardy To Double Indemnity: Subtleties Of Teaching Interdisciplinary Geriatrics.	2002	386	10.1080/03601270290081380			192	28.0	6.0	433	Each of the fields of geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice intensifies the usefulness and effectiveness of the other. Combining geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice also magnifies the complexity of two singularly complex fields. However, the subtle reasons for their complexity may escape the understanding of clinicians, educators, policy makers, and administrators. Attempting to treat older patients who have complex problems while ignoring common principles of geriatrics and teamwork can cause a kind of double jeopardy. It can potentially harm the patient and decrease the provider's sense of mastery. Training either students or health care providers to appreciate the interactions and the complexities of these two fields could produce a double indemnity for the health care system and for older persons who need health care. It requires recognizing subtle factors like the barrier of presumed knowledge, the interpretation of the meaning of function, frailty, the lure of medical technology, professional hierarchies, diverse views of disease, and the myth of insufficient evidence.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=6924781&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	192	Educational Gerontology		386	drinka,theresa.j.k	drinka	theresa.j.k	Y	0.0	5.0	2.0	0.0
244	245	Preventing Hospitalization With Veterans Affairs Home-Based Primary Care: Which Individuals Benefit Most?	2017	251	10.1111/jgs.14843			144	65.0	8.0	1676	Objectives To examine how medical complexity modifies the relationship between enrollment in Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) home-based primary care ( HBPC) and hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions ( ACSC) for veterans with diabetes mellitus and whether the effect of HBPC on hospitalizations varies according to clinical condition. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting VA and non- VA hospitals. Participants VA beneficiaries aged 67 and older with diabetes mellitus and enrolled in Medicare (N = 364,972). Measurements Instrumental variables regression models were used to estimate the effect of HBPC enrollment on hospitalization for ACSCs (defined according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators) overall and in subgroups stratified according to medical complexity. Models were also estimated for each ACSC to determine which conditions were most sensitive to HBPC. Distance from the veteran's residence to the nearest HBPC site was used as the instrumental variable. Results HBPC was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations (odds ratio ( OR) = 0.35 per person-month, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.30-0.42). For veterans in the highest quartile of medical complexity, HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.93), whereas for those in the lowest quartile, HBPC was associated with more ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 33.2, 95% CI = 4.6-240.1). HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs. Conclusion HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs in veterans with diabetes mellitus but only in the most medically complex individuals. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate targeting and suggests that the effect of HBPC is attributable to its comprehensive approach rather than condition-specific interventions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=124623509&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		251	edwards,samuel.t	edwards	samuel.t	Y	0.0	4.0	3.0	0.0

Methods: This was a quantitative study whose convenience sample consisted of 279 elderly. The Interdisciplinary Medicine Instrument (INTERMED) method was used, a tool that identified biopsychosocial aspects and conditions of the health system and classified the complexity of the patient. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis. Results: The prevailing profile was of elderly women, retired, white, with low educational levels, married and satisfied with their life conditions. The mean age was 72.3 years. The biological domain was the most compromised. As for the complexity of care, 34.8% of the patients required multiprofessional care. Conclusion: The elderly had high care complexity, with the biological and health system domains being the most compromised.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=99022122&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	937	Acta Paulista de Enfermagem	1.0	937	ozello,gutierrez.beatriz.aparecida	ozello	gutierrez.beatriz.aparecida		1.0	4.0	4.0	1.0
423	424	Predictive Validity Of A Frailty Measure (Gfi) And A Case Complexity Measure (Im-E-Sa) On Healthcare Costs In An Elderly Population	2015	453	 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.09.015			453	79.0	5.0	404.0	Objectives: Measures of frailty (Groningen Frailty Indicator, GFI) and case complexity (INTERMED for the Elderly, IM-E-SA) may assist healthcare professionals to allocate healthcare resources. Both instruments have been evaluated with good psychometric properties. Limited evidence has been published about their predictive validity. Thus, our aim is to evaluate the predictive validity of both instruments on healthcare costs. Methods: Multivariate linear regression models were developed to estimate associations between the predictors frailty (GFI) and/or case complexity (IM-E-SA) and the healthcare costs (in â‚¬ log transformed) in the following year. All models were adjusted for demographics and the presence of morbidity. Results: In the multivariate regression analyses the continuous scores of the GFI and IM-E-SA remained significant predictors for total healthcare costs. Adjusted Î²s for GFI and IM-E-SA were respectively 0.14 (95% CI 0.10â€“0.18) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.04â€“0.07). The corresponding explained variance (R2) for both models was 0.40. Frailty remained a significant predictor of long-term care costs (adjusted Î² 0.13 [95% CI 0.09â€“0.16]), while case complexity was a significant predictor of curative care costs (adjusted Î² 0.03 [95% CI 0.02â€“0.05]). Conclusions: The GFI and IM-E-SA both accurately predict total healthcare costs in the following year.

483	484	A New Approach To The Identification Of Palliative Care Needs And Advanced Chronic Patients Among Nursing Home Residents	2021	526	10.3390/ijerph18063171	33808567	WOS:000639190800001	526	18.0	6.0		Background: Proper planning of Palliative Care in nursing homes requires advanced knowledge of the care needs that residents show. The aim of the study was to evaluate Palliative Needs and other conditions such as fragility, complexity, and prognosis and also to suggest new indicators for the establishment of the resident's advanced chronic condition. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 149 nursing homes Complex Chronic residents evaluated by trained professionals. Palliative Care Needs, assessed by the NECPAL ICO-CCOMS (c) tool, and fragility, case and palliative complexity and prognosis were evaluate through a comprehensive assessment. Descriptive analyses and association measures were performed setting the statistical significance at 0.05. Results: More than 50% of the residents had positive Surprise Question and other Palliative Needs and were classified as Advanced Chronic Patients. Distress and/or Severe Adaptative Disorder was the most frequent need shown by the residents and significant differences in levels of frailty and other characteristics, were found between the Positive and the Negative Surprise Question Groups. Statistically significant correlations were also found between aspects of both groups. Conclusions: Nursing homes residents show Palliative Needs regardless of the response to the Surprise Question of the NECPAL tool. Other characteristics such as presence of an intermediate level of frailty are suggested as a new perspective to identify advanced chronic patients among nursing homes residents.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1.0	526	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		526	esteban-burgos,ana a	esteban-burgos	ana a		0.0	3.0	2.0	0.0

These processes prime the organism for an adaptive response, making it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given set of boundary conditions, most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively short periods of time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response mode, which is denoted ""reactive tuning."" Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in resting dynamics and maladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline and frailty. Nonlinear mathematical techniques that quantify physiologic dynamics may predict the onset of frailty, and interventions aimed toward restoring healthy dynamics may prevent functional decline."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=6330854&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		388	lipsitz,lewis.a	lipsitz	lewis.a	Y	0.0	3.0	1.0	0.0
680	681	Relational Practice As The Key To Ensuring Quality Care For Frail Older People: Discharge Planning As A Case Example.	2009	994	10.1108/14717794200900024			994	10.0	3.0	44	Discharging frail older people from acute hospital settings has been an issue of concern for over 40 years and recent studies suggest that enduring problems remain. This paper explores the experiences of discharge from three different units: an acute surgical ward, an acute medical ward and a specialist ward for older people. Based on extensive data from interviews with older people, their family carers and ward-based staff, a grounded theory of the discharge experience is presented. This suggests that the quality of discharge hinges largely on whether the focus of efforts is on 'pace' (the desire to discharge older people as rapidly as possible) or 'complexity' (where due account is taken of the complex interaction of medical and wider social issues). When pace is the focus, 'pushing' and 'fixing' are the main processes driving discharge. However, when attention is given to complexity, far more subtle processes of 'informing' and 'brokering' are in evidence. These latter processes are conceived of as forms of 'relational practice' and it is argued that such practices lie at the heart of high quality care for older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105322109&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	994	Quality in Ageing		994	williams,s	williams	s		0.0	3.0	2.0	0.0

The factors that promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older people from drinking are not well understood. Objective: This study aimed to understand the complexity of issues associated with the hydration and hydration care of older people. Design: A qualitative study using multiple methods. Settings: Two healthcare sites providing care for older people in the South West of England: a hospital ward in a major hospital and a care home providing personal and nursing care. Participants: Twenty-one older people aged 68â€“96 years, were recruited to the study from the hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older people to participate were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion criteria were being unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or distressed to take part in the study. The staff participants of nurses and health care assistants totalled 21. The inclusion criterion for staff was any nurse or health care assistant providing hydration care. Seven friends or relatives participated by making anonymous comments via a suggestion box available to all friends and relatives. Methods: Data were collected via interviews with older people, focus group discussions involving staff, suggestion box comments made by friends and relatives and twelve hours observation of hydration practice. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to promote drinking including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in older people''s hands and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their experience of drinking was diminished by a variety of factors including a limited aesthetic experience and a focus on fluid consumption rather than on drinking as a pleasurable and social experience. Conclusion: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with drinking were lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social interaction was underplayed in both settings. Hydration practice which supports the individual needs of older people is complex and goes beyond simply ensuring the consumption of adequate fluids.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104420913&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	141	International Journal of Nursing Studies	1.0	961	godfrey,helen	godfrey	helen		0.0	3.0	1.0	0.0

717	718	Applying The Transitional Care Model To Elderly Patients With Heart Failure.	2000	1043	10.1097/00005082-200004000-00008	NLM10756474		5	14.0	3.0	53	Elderly patients with heart failure present a tremendous challenge to the current health care system. Decreased length of hospital stay for patients with increased numbers of comorbid conditions and complex medication regimens contribute to a revolving door of rehospitalizations. Using a transitional care model designed to decrease rehospitalizations, advanced practice nurses (APNs) in an ongoing clinical trial provide discharge planning in the acute care setting with home follow-up by the same APN for a 3-month period. This article reviews three case studies to provide a view of the complex and challenging situations in which elders with heart failure live and the care provided by APNs using the transitional care model to guide their practice. Social, economic, and emotional factors overlay the illness in each of these cases. The APNs, with advanced knowledge of cardiac disease and research-based management, help the patients and their caregivers to prioritize information and take the appropriate actions, while coping with the complexity of their conditions and the challenges they face. Keeping these patients from returning to the hospital provides evidence of the success of this transitional model of care.

29	30	Experiences Of Elderly Patients Regarding Participation In Their Hospital Discharge: A Qualitative Metasummary.	2019	30	10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025789	31685492		30	9.0	11.0	e025789	BACKGROUND: Ageing patients are discharged from the hospital 'quicker and sicker' than before, and hospital discharge is a critical step in patient care. Older patients form a particularly vulnerable group due to multimorbidity and frailty. Patient participation in healthcare is influenced by government policy and an important part of quality improvement of care. There is need for greater insights into the complexity of patient participation for older patients in discharge processes based on aggregated knowledge. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review reported evidence concerning the experiences of older patients aged 65 years and above regarding their participation in the hospital discharge process. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative metasummary. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsycINFO and SocINDEX were conducted. Data from 18 studies were included, based on specific selection criteria. All studies explored older patients' experience of participation during the discharge process in hospital, but varied when it came to type of discharge and diagnosis. The data were categorised into themes by using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis indicated that participation in the discharge process varied among elderly patients. Five themes were identified: (1) complexity of the patients state of health, (2) management and hospital routines, (3) the norm and preference of returning home, (4) challenges of mutual communication and asymmetric relationships and (5) the significance of networks. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration between different levels in the health systems and user-friendly information between staff, patient and families are crucial. The complexity of patient participation for this patient group should be recognised to enhance user involvement during discharge from hospital. Interventions or follow-up studies of how healthcare professionals can improve their communication skills and address the tension between client-centred goals and organisational priorities are requested. Organisational structure may need to be restructured to ensure the participation of elderly patients.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	30	Bmj Open		30	lilleheie,ingvild	Lilleheie	Ingvild		0.0	3.0	3.0	0.0
334	335	Physiological Complexity Underlying Heart Rate Dynamics And Frailty Status In Community-Dwelling Older Women.	2008	357	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01858.x			144	56.0	9.0	1698	OBJECTIVES: To assess whether less physiological complexity underlying regulation of heart rate dynamics, as indicated by lower approximate entropy for heart rate (ApEnHR), is associated with frailty. For supporting validity, relationships between frailty and traditional linear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were also assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, a community-based observational study, 1992 to 1995. PARTICIPANTS: Subset of 389 community-dwelling women aged years and older with moderate to severe disability with ApEnHR data (convenience sampling). MEASUREMENTS: Electrocardiographic Holter recordings obtained over 2- to 3-hour periods were processed for ApEnHR and HRV measures. ApEnHR is a nonlinear statistic that quantifies the regularity of heart rate fluctuations over time. Lower ApEnHR is characteristic of heart rate time series containing a high proportion of repetitive patterns. Frailty was defined according to validated phenotype criteria. RESULTS: Median ApEnHR was lower in frail than in nonfrail subjects ( P=.02). Lower ApEnHR (top quartile) was associated with lower likelihood of frailty than higher ApEnHR (bottom three quartiles) (odds ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.26â€“0.86), even after adjustment for major confounders. Frailty was consistently associated with lower HRV as assessed using time- and frequency-domain indices. CONCLUSION: This study supports the notion that less physiological complexity marks frailty and provides an empirical basis to the concept of frailty as a syndrome of homeostatic impairment. Future research will determine whether noninvasive measures of physiological complexity underlying heart rate dynamics might be useful for screening and monitoring of clinical vulnerability in older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=34137572&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		357	chaves,paulo.h.m	chaves	paulo.h.m	Y	1.0	3.0	3.0	1.0
620	621	Challenges And Strategies For Managing Diabetes In The Elderly In Long-Term Care Settings.	2020	852	10.2337/ds20-0018			850	33.0	3.0	236	Diabetes affects a large number of patients in the long-term care (LTC) setting, and their care is often complicated because of multimorbidity, diabetes-related complications, disability, dependency on caregivers, and geriatric syndromes, including frailty and cognitive impairment. This population includes patients receiving short-term rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities, those who are residents in LTC facilities, and those receiving palliative or end-of-life care. An individualized approach to care based on clinical complexity, diabetes trajectory, and patients' preferences and goals is required. Such patients may experience one or more transitions of care and decline in condition. They are also prone to adverse drug events, cardiovascular events, and hypoglycemia. Facility-related challenges include varying staff competencies and practitioner preferences, inconsistent interdisciplinary communication, overly complex medication regimens, and poorly implemented care transitions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=145107740&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	850	Diabetes Spectrum	1.0	852	pandya,naushira	pandya	naushira		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
338	339	Geriatric Syndromes: Clinical, Research, And Policy Implications Of A Core Geriatric Concept.	2007	361	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01156.x			144	55.0	5.0	780	Geriatricians have embraced the term â€œgeriatric syndrome,â€ using it extensively to highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factorsâ€”older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobilityâ€”were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=24891873&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		361	inouye,sharon.k	inouye	sharon.k	Y	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
634	635	Hospital Readmission: Older Married Male Patients' Experiences Of Life Conditions And Critical Incidents Affecting The Course Of Care, A Qualitative Study.	2018	883	10.1111/scs.12583			170	32.0	4.0	1379	Background: Despite the frequency of hospital readmissions, there is still a relatively incomplete understanding of the broader array of factors pertaining to readmission in older persons. Few studies have explored how older persons experience readmission and their perceptions of circumstances affecting the course of care. Research indicates that males experience poorer health outcomes and are at higher risk of readmission compared to women. Aim: To explore life conditions and critical incidents pertained to hospital readmission from the perspective of older males. Methods: The study used a qualitative explorative design using the Critical Incident Technique. A purposive sample of four males aged 65â€“75 were recruited from two internal medical wards. Data were collected through narrative double interviews. The study was registered by the North Denmark Region's joint notification of health research (ID 2008â€58â€0028). Findings: The analysis revealed four themes of life conditions: 'Ambiguity of ageing', 'Living with the burden of illness', 'Realisation of dependency' and 'Growing sense of vulnerability and mortality'. Critical incidents comprised four areas: 'Balancing demands and resources in everyday life', 'Back home again â€“ a period of recovery', 'Care interaction' and 'Navigating within and between healthcare system(s)'. Conclusion: This study illustrated the interconnectedness, dynamics and complexity of life conditions and critical incidents that over time and across diverse healthcare sectors affected the course of care in older persons. Hospital readmissions seem related to a complex web of interacting life conditions and critical incidents rather than growing age or specific illnesses.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=133687391&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1.0	883	pedersen,mona.kyndi	pedersen	mona.kyndi		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

His medical history was characterized only by hypertension with cardiac hypertrophy. He was a past director of a bank and was cognitively normal. The clinical definition of frailty is rarely encompassed by a single altered system; multiple systems must be involved, and we propose that the model of Parkinsonian syndrome with its complexity of clinical manifestations could be considered as a prototype of this condition, providing new insight and new perspective to understand the complex biological pathways underlying the pathogenesis of frailty and physical disability in older persons.

329	330	Nonlinear Multisystem Physiological Dysregulation Associated With Frailty In Older Women: Implications For Etiology And Treatment.	2009	352	10.1093/gerona/glp076			210		10.0	1049	Background. Frailty in older adults, defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms, is associated with abnormal levels in individual physiological systems. We tested the hypothesis that it is the critical mass of physiological systems abnormal that is associated with frailty, over and above the status of each individual system, and that the relationship is nonlinear. Methods. Using data on women aged 70 - 79 years from the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and II, multiple analytic approaches assessed the cross-sectional association of frailty with eight physiological measures. Results. Abnormality in each system (anemia, inflammation, insulin-like growth factor-1, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, hemoglobin A1c, micronutrients, adiposity, and fine motor speed) was significantly associated with frailty status. However, adjusting for the level of each system measure, the mean number of systems impaired significantly and nonlinearly predicted frailty. Those with three or more systems impaired were most likely to be frail, with odds of frailty increasing with number of systems at abnormal level, from odds ratios (ORs) of 4.8 to 11 to 26 for those with one to two, three to four, and five or more systems abnormal (p < .05 for all). Finally, two subgroups were identified, one with isolated or no systems abnormal and a second (in 30%) with multiple systems abnormal. The latter group was independently associated with being frail (OR = 2.6, p < .05), adjusting for confounders and chronic diseases and then controlling for individual systems. Conclusions. Overall, these findings indicate that the likelihood of frailty increases nonlinearly in relationship to the number of physiological systems abnormal, and the number of abnormal systems is more predictive than the individual abnormal system. These findings support theories that aggregate loss of complexity, with aging, in physiological systems is an important cause of frailty. Implications are that a threshold loss of complexity, as indicated by number of systems abnormal, may undermine homeostatic adaptive capacity, leading to the development of frailty and its associated risk for subsequent adverse outcomes. It further suggests that replacement of any one deficient system may not be sufficient to prevent or ameliorate frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=45226757&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		352	fried,linda.p	fried	linda.p	Y	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0

These innovations, including kidney replacement therapies, have been effective in providing additional options to patients facing serious illness, but they have also introduced a new level of complexity in the provider assessment of treatment for these patients. Health care providers are being tasked to decide if medical care is appropriate for an aging and medically complex population, a decision complicated by a variety of factors.

137	138	Older Women, Intimate Partner Violence And Mental Health: A Consideration Of The Particular Issues For Health And Healthcare Practice	2017	140	 10.1111/jocn.13490			140	26.0		2177.0	Aims and objectives: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. Background: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and wellâ€being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. Design: Metaâ€ethnographic synthesis of qualitative evidence. Methods: A systematic search of PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end of December 2015. Results: The review identified that intimate partner violence exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. Conclusions: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and wellâ€being of those who experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service providers need to be aware of these. Relevance to clinical practice: urses and healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of abuse and this includes older women.

592	593	Triaging Seniors In Health Crisis In The Emergency Department: A Three-Year Summary.	1996	776		8900636		776	20.0	3.0	8	"The ""geriatric triage"" approach for management of the most complex frail older adult population by geriatric nurses in the emergency department setting was a benefit to the patient/family and the health care system. The patients, through assessment and individualized plans of care, received the right care in the right setting. Seniors were assessed and their care planned by health care professionals who had geriatric knowledge, understood the complexity of their problems, and acted as their advocate. Geriatric triaging resulted in benefits across the health care system. Resources were used effectively. Patients received care in the most appropriate and cost-efficient setting. This new and creative approach served as a catalyst for improvement in services and care for the senior population. Health care workers in the hospitals as well as the community increased their knowledge of geriatrics through consultation with this service. The community and hospitals had a formal linkage, which provided an opportunity for collaboration and continuity of care. The hospital system experienced decreased competition for scarce acute care beds due to diverted admissions. The emergency department had consultants to assist with the decision-making for this high-risk population and decreased the number of patients held in emergency department awaiting an inpatient bed. The community system received patients with a comprehensive plan of care that provided creative and innovative care management strategies. Home care adapted its service to respond with immediate services to assist with health crises in addition to what had been traditionally available. The finding of this study supports a new approach to care of the elderly and chronically ill population who present to the emergency department in health crisis. Creative strategies are required to meet the needs of the aging population in these times of fiscal restraint. The nursing geriatric triage service is one strategy that holds merit."		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		776	Perspectives (Gerontological Nursing Association (Canada))	1.0	776	freeman,m	Freeman	M	Y	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
331	332	Frailty And Impaired Cardiac Autonomic Control: New Insights From Principal Components Aggregation Of Traditional Heart Rate Variability Indices.	2009	354	10.1093/gerona/glp013			210		6.0	682	Background. Age-related deterioration in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms leads to decreased complexity in their output. For example, the degradation of cardiac autonomic control results in loss of complexity in the heart rate signal. Frailty is a state of critically impaired homeostasis that results in heightened vulnerability to stressors. We propose a new measure of heart rate variability (HRV) to capture the impairment in cardiac autonomic control associated with frailty. Methods. Traditional time and frequency domain indices of HRV were obtained from 2-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 276 women (65-101 years old) in the Women's Health and Aging Study-I. Principal components analysis was conducted on the correlation matrix of HRV indices. Frailty was defined using a validated instrument. Regression models were used to evaluate associations of HRV measures with age, frailty, and 5-year mortality. Results. The first two principal components (PCs), PC1 and PC2, explained 90% of the variance in HRV indices. PC1 is the mean of log-transformed HRV indices. PC2 is a linear combination of log-transformed indices, with positive weights for very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), and negative weights for high frequency (HF), root-mean-squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and proportion of all N-N intervals that are larger than 50 ms (pNN50). Decreases in SDNN, VLF, LF, and LF/HF were associated with an increased risk of frailty. PC2 was more strongly associated with age (ÃŸ = -.23, p < .001) and frailty (ÃŸ = -.73, p < 10-5) than were the individual HRV indices and LFIHF. PC2 was also the best predictor of 5-year mortality (ÃŸ = -.60 < p < 10-6). Conclusions. Cardiac autonomic control, as reflected by HRV, is impaired in frailty. A new measure derived from PC aggregation of traditional HRV indices provides a compact summary of this impairment.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=40838481&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		354	varadhan,ravi	varadhan	ravi	Y	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0

Method: Ninety-nine individuals with a mean age of 82.9 (5.8) and dementia participated in a 10-week randomized controlled trial with three-month follow-up. The intervention group (IG) received a motor-cognitive training on (PhysiomatÂ®) including concurrent dual-tasks of balance control with cognitive demands (PhysiomatÂ®-Trail Making Tasks (PTMTs)). The control group (CG) performed non-specific, low-intensity exercises. Duration and accuracy at different complexity levels of trained and untrained PTMTs and the number of successfully performed tasks (PTMT score) were assessed. Results: PhysiomatÂ® training significantly improved the duration and accuracy at almost all complexity levels of trained (P â‰¤ 0.001-0.047, Î·p2 = 0.065-0.589) and untrained PTMTs (P < 0.001-0.005, Î·p2 = 0.073-0.459). Significant effects were also found for the PTMT score of trained (P < 0.001, Î·p2 = 0.211) and untrained PTMTs (P < 0.001, Î·p2 = 0.184). Training gains were partly sustained at follow-up. Conclusion: PhysiomatÂ® is feasible and has the potential to sustainably improve motor-cognitive performances in people with dementia.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=132729048&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	96	Aging & Mental Health		228	wiloth,stefanie	wiloth	stefanie	Y	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0

Culturally linked risk factors and socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare disparities, and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy (HL) and HF are less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease management, or preventative health strategies. Objective: In this systematic review, we analyzed the literature studying older Latinos with HF and limited HL. Method: We searched the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. Inclusion criteria were research studies, Latinos, HF, and HL. Results: Eight quantitative studies were identified for final review. Inadequate HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL was associated with more HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL levels and higher medical complexity. Conclusions: Nurses and advanced practice nurses serve a pivotal role improving access and understanding of health information. Before conducting intervention research affecting clinical outcomes, it is essential to describe elderly Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. Barriers identified confirm the need to alter research protocols for older adults and ensure the availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older Latinos with HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients with limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be reliable predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, and develop, implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their health.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1.0	619	Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing	1.0	626	delgado,janet m	delgado	janet m		0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up, on admission to the Emergency Department in an acute hospital and on discharge from the alternative healthcare resource, of patients assessed by Nurse Care Management, from July to December 2015. The patient characteristics, social environment and results of clinical practice were studied. RESULTS: 190 patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 (59.8%) cases from the Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with dementia, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative healthcare resource (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with advanced age, complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other patients. After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional capacity and present less polypharmacy.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		710	Enfermeria Clinica (English Edition)	1.0	749	solÃ©-casals,montserrat	SolÃ©-Casals	Montserrat		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

Many current measures suffer from being unwieldy for routine use, or not adequately measuring relevant outcomes. In the care of the frail elderly, who have complex needs, these challenges are particularly difficult. The techniques of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) are proposed as means of embracing the complexity of the needs of the frail elderly, and measuring the effectiveness of specialized interventions. GAS appears to meet the current definition of a Health-Related Quality of Life measure, suggesting that its routine use provides advantages both as a management process and as an outcome measure.

290	291	2013: That Was The Year That Was.	2014	305	10.1093/ageing/aft215			161	43.0	2.0	152	In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=94516163&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		305	woo,jean	woo	jean	Y	0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0
554	555	A Nurse-Led Interdisciplinary Primary Care Approach To Prevent Disability Among Community-Dwelling Frail Older People: A Large-Scale Process Evaluation	2013	670	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.12.016	23384696	WOS:000322938400006	111	50.0	9.0	1184	Background: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated. Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design. Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands. Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (>= 70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded. Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions. Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. Conclusions: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the protocol need special attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

202	203	Health Promotion For Mild Frailty Based On Behaviour Change: Perceptions Of Older People And Service Providers.	2019	205	10.1111/hsc.12781			18	27.0	5.0	1333	Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semiâ€structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot homeâ€based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audioâ€recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and wellâ€being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138203873&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1.0	205	avgerinou,christina	avgerinou	christina		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration needs to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population can be improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary suffering.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=130946022&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	893	Contemporary Nurse: A Journal for the Australian Nursing Profession	1.0	893	holloway,helen	holloway	helen		1.0	2.0	0.0	1.0
333	334	Which Patients Benefit The Most From A Geriatrician'S Care? Consensus Among Directors Of Geriatrics Academic Programs.	2008	356	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01940.x			144	56.0	10.0	1796	Given the anticipated limited availability of geriatricians for the foreseeable future, how should the geriatrician's specialized clinical skills be deployed to optimally benefit the health of our aging population? Directors of geriatrics academic programs (DGAPs) at all 145 U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were asked this question as part of a winter 2007 on-line survey. The DGAPs were to indicate the types of patients who would most benefit from a geriatrician's services in three practice situations: primary care, consultations, and care in the hospital. The survey response rate was 74.5%. There was high consensus among the DGAPs on the benefits of having a geriatrician care for the most complex and vulnerable older adults in primary care and hospital settings. There was slightly less consensus as to when geriatrics consultations are beneficial. The patient subsets that were viewed as benefiting the most from geriatrician care were aged 85 and older, frailty, geriatric syndromes, severe functional impairment, and complexity. The results of this survey suggest that, because of the predicted shortage of geriatricians, the DGAPs would target geriatricians to work with the most vulnerable older adults. These findings offer the beginning of a consensus statement as to the role of geriatricians in the continuum of American medical care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=34571692&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		356	warshaw,gregg.a	warshaw	gregg.a	Y	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
640	641	Visiting Nursesâ€™ Posthospital Medication Management In Home Health Care: An Ethnographic Study.	2018	898	10.1111/scs.12451			170	32.0	1.0	222	Background: Medication management is the most challenging component of a successful transition from hospital to home, a challenge of growing complexity as the number of older persons living with chronic conditions grows, along with increasingly specialised and accelerated hospital treatment plans. Thus, many patients are discharged with complex medication regimen instructions, accentuating the risk of medication errors that may cause readmission, adverse drug events and a need for further health care. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore visiting nursesâ€™ medication management in home health care after hospital discharge and to identify key elements in patient medication for improved patient safety. Method: Inspired by the ethnographic research cycle, participant observations and informal interviews were conducted at 12 initial visits by a nurse in a patient's home after hospital discharge. Data consisted of field notes and photographs from the patientsâ€™ homes, medication lists and medical records. Field notes were analysed in four steps. Findings: The analysis showed 12 stages in medication management in which nurses strove to adjust medication management to the patientsâ€™ actual health status by <italic>mediating</italic> on knowledge of the patient, information to the patient and on rules and regulations and by <italic>establishing order</italic> in medication lists and medications in the home. Conclusion: The nurseâ€“patient relationship, the integration of care and the context of care challenged patient safety in visiting nursesâ€™ medication management in patientsâ€™ homes after hospital discharge. The implications for practice were the following: to ensure nursesâ€™ opportunities to continuously evolve their observation skills and skills in making sound clinical judgements; to establish interprofessional working processes which support the continuous assessment of patientsâ€™ needs and the adjustment of care and treatment; to clarify expectations to nursesâ€™ responsibility and patientsâ€™ privacy.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=128262548&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1.0	898	kollerup,mette.geil	kollerup	mette.geil		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

The aim of this study is to explore the discourses about professional caregivers caring for those dying in Denmark in the last decade. A discourse analysis inspired by Foucault was constructed. The material consists of different source documents: research articles, newspaper articles, theses, books, websites - 35 sources in total. There are constructed six positions of speech, five discourses and three themes: (1) 'the work of the professional caregivers - a complex low-status work'; (2) 'the education of the professionals - the way to ensure a good death or possessing the right qualifications' and (3) 'the vulnerable professionals'. The study concludes that an economical/political discourse is dominating and sets up the frames within which the professionals care for dying residents, although the medical, the social/critical and the religious discourses attempt to speak against it. All positions articulate that the professional caregivers' job has a low status and that it is not possible to provide an optimal care due to lack of time, resources and education. Psychical or mental demands make the professionals vulnerable. The meaning of optimal care varies according to the positions of speech.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104147763&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1.0	951	nielsen,karen.t	nielsen	karen.t		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	44	Biological Research For Nursing	1.0	70	zaslavsky,oleg	Zaslavsky	Oleg		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

A comparative effectiveness study was undertaken at a large urban home care agency to examine an evidence-based pain self-management program delivered by physical therapists (PTs). This article focuses on PT training, methods implemented to reinforce content after training and to encourage uptake of the program with appropriate patients, and therapists' fidelity to the program. Seventeen physical therapy teams were included in the cluster randomized controlled trial, with 8 teams (155 PTs) assigned to a control and 9 teams (165 PTs) assigned to a treatment arm. Treatment therapists received interactive training over two sessions, with a follow-up session 6 months later. Additional support was provided via emails, e-learning materials including videos, and a therapist manual. Program fidelity was assessed by examining PT pain documentation in the agency's electronic health record. PT feedback on the program was obtained via semistructured surveys. There were no between-group differences in the number of PTs documenting program elements with the exception of instruction in the use of imagery, which was documented by a higher percentage of intervention therapists (p = 0.002). PTs felt comfortable teaching the program elements, but cited time as the biggest barrier to implementing the protocol. Possible explanations for study results suggesting limited adherence to the program protocol by intervention-group PTs include the top-down implementation strategy, competing organizational priorities, program complexity, competing patient priorities, and inadequate patient buy-in. Implications for the implementation of complex new programs in the home healthcare setting are discussed.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	68	Home Healthcare Now	1.0	68	beissner,katherine.l	Beissner	Katherine L		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

A result of this complexity is a lack of regard for the maintenance of physical and mental function. This study examined the effects of comprehensive, multidisciplinary, inpatient rehabilitation on the physical and mental function of elderly cancer patients with asthenia. We found that both physical and mental function improved following inpatient rehabilitation. However, it is difficult to predict which patients benefit most from rehabilitation. Nevertheless, functional improvement following rehabilitation may allow medical caregivers to better distribute the type and intensity of care, and reduce the caregiver burden experienced by family members in the home.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=3113311&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	139	Palliative Medicine		393	scialla,s	scialla	s	Y	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
699	700	Family, Caring And Ageing In The United Kingdom.	2005	1020		NLM15737166		170	19.0	1.0	53	This paper provides a critical exploration of the assumptions and narratives underpinning the development of social policy initiatives targeting caring relationships based upon family ties. Using a narrative approach attention is drawn to the ways in which family identities are open to a far greater range of negotiation than is assumed by policy. Drawing on the United Kingdom as a case example, questions are posed about intergenerational relations and the nature of late life citizenship. The comparatively recent invention of narratives supporting 'informal care' and the link with neo-liberal and 'third way' notions of active citizenship are explored. As is the failure of policy developments to take into account the diversity of care giving styles and the complexity of caring relationships. It is argued that the uneven and locally specific ways in which policy develops enables the co-existence of a complex range of narratives about family, caring and ageing which address diverse aspects of the family life of older people in often contradictory ways.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106624348&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1.0	1020	gilbert,t	gilbert	t		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
25	26	Are Edentulousness, Oral Health Problems And Poor Health-Related Quality Of Life Associated With Malnutrition In Community-Dwelling Elderly (Aged 75 Years And Over)? A Cross-Sectional Study.	2018	26	10.3390/nu10121965	30545100		26	10.0	12.0	None	As the population ages, the risk of becoming malnourished increases. Research has shown that poor oral health can be a risk factor for malnutrition in institutionalized elderly. However, it remains unclear whether oral health problems, edentulousness and health-related quality of life also pose a risk for malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults. In this cross-sectional observational study, 1325 community-living elderly (â‰¥75 years) were asked to complete questionnaires regarding nutritional status, oral status (edentulous, remaining teeth, or implant-supported overdentures), oral health problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, activities of daily living (ADL) and complexity of care needs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with nutritional status as dependent variable. Of the respondents, 51% (n = 521) were edentulous, 38.8% (n = 397) had remaining teeth and 10.2% (n = 104) had an implant-supported overdenture. Elderly with complex care needs were malnourished most frequently, followed by frail and robust elderly (10%, 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively). Malnourished elderly reported more frequent problems with chewing and speech when compared with well-nourished elderly (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analysis did not show an association between malnutrition and oral health problems and edentulousness, although HRQoL was associated with malnutrition (odds ratio (OR) 0.972, confidence interval (CI) 0.951â»0.955). Based on the results of this cross-sectional study, it can be concluded that poor HRQoL is significantly associated with malnutrition; however, edentulousness and oral health problems are not.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	26	Nutrients		26	bakker,mieke.h	Bakker	Mieke H		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
18	19	The Diversity And Complexity In Health Promotion And Empowerment Related To Older Hospital Patients -- Exploring Nurses' Reflections.	2010	19	10.1177/010740831003000103			19	30.0	1.0	9	Background: In the future, health care services will be challenged by an increasing number of older hospital patients. This prompts a need to focus on and implement a health promoting approach in older people's nursing. Aim: The aim of this exploratory study was to illuminate nurses' reflections about health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients. Method: The study had a qualitative descriptive design. The concepts of health, health promotion and empowerment were initially introduced to nurses before participating in multistage focus group interviews. Two groups of nurses participated in three focus group interviews that were conducted by a moderator and an assistant. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with qualitative content analysis. Findings: The nurses unfolded the theme Â«diversity and complexity marks health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients Â» as the latent content in the text. Two categories, Â«empowerment as balance of power - a twofold relationÂ» and Â«focusing on the individual personÂ», described the manifest content in the texts. The categories were further supported by sub-categories. Conclusion: The focus group interviews showed the ambiguity and complexity in the interpretation of the concepts -- health promotion and empowerment -- related to the older hospital patient. The findings also indicated that multistage focus group interviews may be a useful tool to develop nurses ' reflections about their clinical practice.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105028797&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	19	Nordic Journal of Nursing Research & Clinical Studies / VÃ¥rd i Norden	1.0	19	berg,gv	berg	gv		1.0	2.0	2.0	1.0
17	18	It'S Not Just About Heart Failure -- Voices Of Older People In Transition To Dependence And Death.	2010	18	10.1111/j.1365-2524.2009.00892.x			18	18.0	2.0	199	This paper explores the experiences of older people living with heart failure and their transitions from independence to dependence and for some death. New Zealand's ageing population is predicted to increase from 12% in 2001 to 25% by the year 2051, similar to the worldwide trend of ageing. A high proportion of these people will have one or more chronic illnesses. Associated with the increase in survival is a growing body of research examining the needs of the older person with heart failure and finding particular problems with end of life care. Older people face many challenges in living with their heart failure, in particular the transition to dependence. To study the transition a longitudinal qualitative study using General Inductive approach was used. Participants were interviewed every 3 months for a 12-month period during 2006-2008. A total of 79 interviews with 25 people were completed. Our findings showed that transition was not a simple linear process with the older person moving from one phase to another; instead their experiences illustrated the complexity of transitions they faced and what helped them to manage these. The older people in this study illustrated the importance of trust in health professionals and believed they would receive good care. Their fears revealed concerns about being a burden as they deteriorate and becoming more dependent. Understanding the complex issues related to transition to dependence can provide health professionals with a framework for assessment and approaches to providing the support required.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105306456&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1.0	18	waterworth,s	waterworth	s		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
398	399	The Relationship Between Gait Dynamics And Future Cognitive Decline: A Prospective Pilot Study In Geriatric Patients	2018	424	 10.1017/S1041610217002770			424	30.0	9.0	1301.0	Background: Walking ability recently emerged as a sub-clinical marker of cognitive decline. Hence, the relationship between baseline gait and future cognitive decline was examined in geriatric patients. Because a â€œloss of complexityâ€ (LOC) is a key phenomenon of the aging process that exhibits in multiple systems, we propose the idea that age- and cognition-related LOC may also become manifested in gait function. The LOC theory suggests that even healthy aging is associated with a (neuro)physiological breakdown of system elements that causes a decline in variability and an overall LOC. We used coordination dynamics as a conceptual framework and hypothesized that a LOC is reflected in dynamic gait outcomes (e.g. gait regularity, complexity, stability) and that such outcomes could increase the specificity of the gait-cognition link. Methods: 19 geriatric patients (age 80.0Â±5.8) were followed for 14.4 Â± 6.6 months. An iPod collected three-dimensional (3D) trunk accelerations while patients walked for 3 minutes. Cognition was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Seven-Minute screen (7 MS) test. The Reliable Change Index (RCI) quantified the magnitude of cognitive change. Spearman's Rho coefficients (Ï) indexed correlations between baseline gait and future cognitive change. Results: Seven patients showed reliable cognitive decline (â€œCognitive Declineâ€ group), and 12 patients remained cognitively stable (â€œCognitive Stableâ€ group) over time. Future cognitive decline was correlated with a more regular (Ï = 0.579*) and predictable (Ï = 0.486*) gait pattern, but not with gait speed. Conclusions: The increase in gait regularity and predictability possibly reflects a LOC due to age- and cognition-related (neuro)physiological decline. Because dynamic versus traditional gait outcomes (i.e. gait speed and (variability of) stride time) were more strongly correlated with future cognitive decline, the use of wearable sensors in predicting and monitoring cognitive and physical health in vulnerable geriatric patients can be considered promising. However, our results are preliminary and do require replication in larger cohorts.

721	722	Circles Of Care: Home Care And Community Support For Rural Older Adults.	1994	704		NLM8203828		1044	16.0	3.0	22	Rural dwelling, frail older adults are a vulnerable population owing to the complexity of health problems superimposed upon limited health care resources. Home care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A major theme identified was 'Circles of Care.' Grounded in rural culture, the circles assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107443078&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	1044	Advances in Nursing Science	1.0	704	magilvy,jk	magilvy	jk	Y	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0

Linear regression was used to compare global cognitive performance scores of housewives (G1) and women exposed to work of low (G2) and high (G3) complexity. The sample comprised 477 older adult Brazilian women, 430 (90.4%) of whom had performed lifelong jobs. In work with data, the G2 group's cognitive performance scores were 1.73 points higher (p =.03), and the G3 group scored 1.76 points (p =.02) higher, than the G1. In work with things and with people, the G3 scored, respectively, 2.04 (p <.01) and 2.21 (p <.01) cognitive test points higher than the G1. Based on our findings we suggest occupation of greater complexity is associated with better cognitive performance in women later in life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111070163&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	925	Health Care for Women International	1.0	925	ribeiro,pricila.cristina.correa	ribeiro	pricila.cristina.correa		0.0	2.0	2.0	0.0
439	440	Intentional Non-Adherence To Medications By Older Adults	2014	471	 10.1007/s40266-014-0153-9			471	31.0	3.0	149.0	The extent to which an individualâ€™s medication-taking behaviour and/or execution of lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare providerâ€™, is a highly complex behaviour, defined as adherence. However, intentional non-adherence is regularly observed and results in negative outcomes for patients along with increased healthcare provision costs. Whilst this is a consistent issue amongst adults of all ages, the burden of chronic disease is greatest amongst older adults. As a result, the absolute prevalence of intentional non-adherence is increased in this population. This non-systematic review of intentional non-adherence to medication highlights the extent of the problem amongst older adults. It notes that age, per se, is not a contributory factor in intentionally nonadherent behaviours. Moreover, it describes the difference in methodology required to identify such behaviours in contrast to reports of non-adherence in general: the use of focus groups, semi-structured, one-to-one interviews and questionnaires as opposed to pill counts, electronic medication monitors and analysis of prescription refill rates. Using Leventhalâ€™s Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation, it emphasizes six key factors that may contribute to intentional non-adherence amongst older adults: illness beliefs, the perceived risks (e.g. dependence, adverse effects), benefits and necessity of potential treatments, the patientâ€“practitioner relationship, inter-current physical and mental illnesses, financial constraints and pharmaceutical/pharmacological issues (poly-pharmacy/regimen complexity). It describes the current evidence for each of these aspects and notes the paucity of data validating Leventhalâ€™s model in this regard. It also reports on interventions that may address these issues and explicitly acknowledges the lack of evidence-based interventions available to healthcare practitioners. As a result, it highlights five key areas that require urgent research amongst older adults: (1) the overlap between intentional and unintentional non-adherence, particularly amongst those who may be frail or isolated; (2) the potential correlation between symptomatic benefit and intentional vs. unintentional non-adherence to medication; (3) an evaluation of the source of prescribing (i.e. a long-standing provider vs. an acute episode of care) and the patientâ€“prescriber relationship as determinants of intentional and unintentional non-adherence; (4) the decision-making processes leading to selective intentional nonadherence amongst older adults with multiple medical problems; and (5) the development and evaluation of interventions designed to reduce intentional non-adherence, specifically addressing each of the aspects listed above.

87	88	Older Women, Intimate Partner Violence And Mental Health: A Consideration Of The Particular Issues For Health And Healthcare Practice.	2017	89	10.1111/jocn.13490	27487083		34	26.0		2177	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic synthesis of qualitative evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end of December 2015. RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service providers need to be aware of these. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of abuse and this includes older women.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1.0	89	mcgarry,julie	McGarry	Julie		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
651	652	Determinants Of The Caregiving Experience...Second In A Series	2016	913				913	19.0	3.0	6	The traditional discourse of caregiving focuses on burden, depression and anxiety. However, there is an emerging understanding of the complexities of the caregiving experience. This review paper highlights the complexity and often ambiguous reporting of variables associated with the caregiving experience and raises a number of research questions. The paper concludes that the identification of determinants that affect aspects of the caregiving experience, including anxiety and depression symptoms, is required to inform health care professionals of carer support needs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=120615242&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	913	Journal of the Australasian Rehabilitation Nurses' Association (JARNA)	1.0	913	aggar,christina	aggar	christina		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
99	100	Disability Intervention Model For Older Adults With Arthritis: An Integration Of Theory Of Symptom Management And Disablement Process Model.	2014	101	10.1016/j.anr.2014.08.004	25529905		101	8.0	4.0	241	To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	101	Asian Nursing Research	1.0	101	shin,so.young	Shin	So Young		0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0
496	497	Improving Oral Health In Nursing Home Residents: A Process Evaluation Of A Shared Oral Care Intervention	2020	553	10.1111/jocn.15373	32533875	WOS:000542562300001	34	29.0		3392	Aims and objectives To evaluate the process of implementing an oral care intervention in nursing homes in a Danish municipality. Background Older people with aged natural dentition require preventive and curative oral health care. An intervention based on principles of situated learning was implemented to establish closer cooperation between dental and nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to improved oral hygiene in nursing home residents. Design An embedded multiple-case study combined with principles of realist evaluation unfolded in three phases: Formulation of initial programme theory, Testing and Refining the programme theory. The COREQ checklist is followed in reporting. Methods Observations, six group interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with dentists, dental practitioners, nursing home managers, care professionals and residents were conducted in three nursing homes (n = 41). Results Three main outcomes of a programme theory were identified, relating to (a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) interdisciplinary working, in the form of professional pride in performing sufficient oral care; (c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the creation of relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care professionals as well as nursing home management taking responsibility for structure, planning and knowledge sharing. Conclusion The situated learning perspective supported residents and care professionals' competencies in performing sufficient oral care. The shared oral care intervention supports an individual and multidisciplinary assessment of nursing home residents' ability to self-care concerning oral care. Contextual factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms influence the intervention's success. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the complexity within interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and unravelling the necessary properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health care are areas of improvement for care service in nursing homes.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1.0	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1.0	553	aagaard,karin	aagaard	karin		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
448	449	Ingestive Skill Difficulties Are Frequent Among Acutely-Hospitalized Frail Elderly Patients, And Predict Hospital Outcomes	2012	484	 10.3109/02703181.2012.736019			484	30.0	4.0	271.0	Purpose: To examine the relationship between ingestive skill performance while eating and drinking and frailty status in acutely-hospitalized elderly patients and to examine whether there is a relationship between the proportion of ingestive skill difficulties and Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) and discharge destination. Methods: Frail ( n = 64) and robust ( n = 40) acutely-hospitalized elderly patients were assessed using The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment. Results: Forty-three ingestive skills were significantly more affected in frail patients (21.9% to 95.3%) versus robust patients (2.5% to 65.0%). When adjusting for frailty status, difficulties in self-feeding and texture management were related to prolonged LOS, and difficulties in positioning and liquid ingestion were related to discharge to institutional care. Conclusion: Ingestive skill difficulties among acutely-hospitalized frail elderly patients were frequent and characterized by great complexity. This necessitates a broad range of management strategies related to the patientsâ€™ ability in positioning, self-feeding skills, as well as oropharyngeal sensorimotor skills.

Method: A total of 1,413 older adults were selected in 2006. To estimate the incidence of each frailty component, only individuals who did not exhibit a given component at baseline (independently of the presence of other components) were included in the study. The variables of interest were socioeconomic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric factors and physical performance. The incidence of each component in 2010 was the outcome. Results: Unintentional weight loss and slowness were more incident in men up to 74 years of age. The other frailty components were more incident in women at all age groups, except weakness. Besides age, the determinants of incidence of the components of frailty were different between genders. Discussion: Strategies for preventing or delaying the installation of frailty need to address gender differences, considering the greater complexity in the network determinants among women.

2	3	Management Of Depression And Referral Of Older People To Psychological Therapies: A Systematic Review Of Qualitative Studies.	2019	3	10.3399/bjgp19X701297	NLM30745355		3	69.0	680.0	e171	Background: Depressive symptoms are common in later life and increase both the risk of functional and cognitive decline and the use of healthcare services. Despite older people expressing preferences for talking therapies, they are less likely to be referred than younger adults, particularly when aged â‰¥80 years.Aim: To explore how healthcare professionals (HCPs) manage older people in relation to depression and referrals to psychological therapies.Design and Setting: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.Method: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Social Sciences Citation Index (inception-March 2018) were searched for studies exploring HCPs' views regarding management of late-life depression across all settings. Studies of older people's views or depression management across all ages were excluded.Results: In total, 27 studies, were included; these predominantly focused on the views of GPs and primary and community care nurses. Many HCPs felt that late-life depression was mainly attributable to social isolation and functional decline, but treatments appropriate for this were limited. Clinicians perceived depression to have associated stigma for older adults, which required time to negotiate. Limited time in consultations and the complexity of needs in later life meant physical health was often prioritised over mental health, particularly in people with frailty. Good management of late-life depression appeared to depend more on the skills and interest of individual GPs and nurses than on any structured approach.Conclusion: Mental ill health needs to be a more-prominent concern in the care of older adults, with greater provision of psychological services tailored to later life. This may facilitate future identification and management of depression.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=134963977&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	0	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	3	British Journal of General Practice		3	frost,rachael	frost	rachael		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
509	510	Prevalence And Impact Of Functional And Psychosocial Problems In Hospitalized Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study	2019	578	10.1016/j.jamda.2019.03.012	31078487	WOS:000487829800017	570	20.0	10.0	1294	Objectives: Underpinning standards for delivering comprehensive care in hospital is the need to identify issues contributing to patient complexity and risk of harm. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of functional and psychosocial problems in hospitalized adults, to compare prevalence rates across age groups, and to assess their impact on discharge outcomes. Design, setting, and participants: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 4 hospitals in Australia during September 2015 to June 2016, recruiting patients aged 18 and over. Measures: Research nurses assessed patients at admission using the interRAI Acute Care instrument, which includes algorithms for diagnostic and risk screening and measuring problem severity. Length of stay and discharge outcome were recorded from medical records. Results: The median age of the study population (n = 910) was 66 (range 18-99 years), and 47.7% were female. Although 64.6% of patients aged >= 70 years had at least 1 classic geriatric syndrome (cognitive impairment, dependency in activities of daily living, history of falls, or incontinence), similar problems were prevalent in younger cohorts (34.6% in those aged <50 and 38.9% in those aged 50-69 years). Of 17 health issues assessed across multiple domains, only 26 patients (2.9%) had no problems. Independent of age, gender, and Comorbidity Index, having a greater number of problems was significantly associated with an adverse discharge outcome, odds ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29); for each additional problem, the length of stay increased by 6.7% (95% CI 4.3%-9.2%). Conclusions/Implications: The high prevalence of functional and psychosocial problems across the age range of patients indicates that universal screening and assessment is warranted for all adult patients to aid in care planning to meet patient needs both in acute care and post discharge.

471	472	Clinical Global Impression Of Change In Physical Frailty: Development Of A Measure Based On Clinical Judgment	2004	512	 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52423.x			144	52.0	9.0	1560.0	Objectives: To expand the ability to assess physical frailty by developing a Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty (CGIC-PF) instrument. Design: Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. Setting: Academic centers. Participants: Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. Measurements: Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. Results: The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less. Conclusion: The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.

Evidence regarding the risk factors for, assessment of and interventions to address elder abuse is limited. Although multidisciplinary teams have existed for several decades, only one study has demonstrated a measurable effect of such teams, and it was limited to financial abuse. Elder abuse is probably best considered as a syndrome, similar to the other â€œgeriatric giantsâ€ such as falls and frailty, given its complexity. The best intervention strategy at this time appears to be education targeted at increasing awareness of elder abuse among health care professionals, analogous to the incorporation of child abuse training into the medical school curriculum.

652	653	Care Arrangements For Community-Dwelling People With Dementia In Germany As Perceived By Informal Carers - A Cross-Sectional Pilot Survey In A Provincial-Rural Setting.	2016	917	10.1111/hsc.12202			18	24.0	3.0	283	The majority of people with dementia live at home, and informal carers assume the role of key care providers, often supported by formal services. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess home-based care arrangements, to illustrate utilisation of formal services over time and to identify factors associated with perceived stability of the care situation from the informal carer's perspective. A self-administered questionnaire (D- IVA 'Instrument for Assessing Home-Based Care Arrangements for People with Dementia') was developed and distributed in a provincial-rural setting in Germany as a cross-sectional survey. Data analysis used descriptive statistics, unbiased conditional inference trees and thematic analysis for open-ended questions. In total, 84 care arrangements were assessed. The majority of participants were direct relatives of the care-dependent person [mostly adult children (48.8%) or spouses (27.4%)]. Formal services were already sought in the first year after onset of memory problems. The most frequently used formal services were home care nursing services (53.0%), day care (49.4%) and respite care (29.6%), whereas 15.5% did not use any type of formal support. Companion home visit, home care nursing service and day care were used over the longest periods of time. The recruitment strategy used in this study may have recruited persons who were relatively more dependent on their informal carers. In this small sample, carers' perceived stability of the care situation was high, and this was associated with the country of origin and sex of the person with dementia ( P = 0.004 and 0.023 respectively). Most care arrangements consisted of a mix of informal and formal services. However, informal carers assumed prime responsibility. The questionnaire D- IVA proved to be suitable. It remains a challenge to further examine factors associated with perceived stability and to explain the phenomenon in its whole complexity.

A Mixed-Methods Approach.	2014	947	10.1111/scs.12041	NLM23550895		170	28.0	1.0	104	Aims To describe and compare the perceived social provision for a group reporting never feeling lonely with that of a group reporting feeling lonely and to explore the meaning of loneliness. Subjects Participants (N = 101) were recruited from geriatric wards. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 65 years or more, the absence of dementia, one or more chronic physical disorders and plans to be discharged from the hospital to their home. The mean age was 81.3 years (range: 65-96 years), 68% were women, and 66% lived alone. Measures Assessments of social provisions and loneliness were collected by a subjective report using the Social Provision Scale ( SPS), and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS) was used to assess depression. The participants were also asked whether they felt lonely and were then asked to describe the meaning of loneliness if they had indicated feeling lonely. Narratives were then condensed by the participants into short sentences. Results Seventy-five per cent of the participants reported feeling lonely, of these 54% were living alone, and 18% identified with depression. Three subscales of SPS scores were significantly lower in the lonely group: attachment (p < 0.001), a sense of reliable alliance (p = 0.001) and the obtaining of guidance (p = 0.01). The overall view of the experience of loneliness was dominated by emptiness and negative emotions. The following themes were identified: Emotions were dominated by sadness, anxiety and restlessness, anger and guilt. Relationships were dominated by being left alone, being confined and feeling useless. Existential dimensions were characterised by emptiness, endless boredom, isolation and the potential for change. Conclusion The study shows that loneliness is prevalent among older people suffering from chronic physical illness and confirms the complexity of the concept. A mixed-methods design contributed to nuanced and detailed information about the meaning of loneliness.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104005342&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1.0	947	kvaal,kari	kvaal	kari		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
627	628	Dignity As A Guiding Principle For Family Care Partners In The Care Of An Old Relative With Dementia.	2020	865	10.1111/scs.12708			170	34.0	1.0	87	Aim: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many family care partners are involved in making helpâ€seeking choices. The aim of this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still maintaining their own dignity. Methods: Data were collected in 2009â€“2010 in open semiâ€structured interviews and followâ€up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an inâ€depth data analysis. Results: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the followâ€up of policy for older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141997556&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1.0	865	sÃ¶derberg,maria	sÃ¶derberg	maria		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
632	633	Does Informal Care Impact Utilisation Of Homeâ€Based Formal Care Services Among Endâ€Ofâ€Life Patients? A Decade Of Evidence From Ontario, Canada.	2019	876	10.1111/hsc.12664			18	27.0	2.0	437	Understanding how informal care impacts formal care utilisation for homeâ€based endâ€ofâ€life patients is an important policyâ€ and practiceâ€relevant question. This paper aims to assess the relationship between informal and formal home care among homeâ€based endâ€ofâ€life patients and how this relationship has changed over the last decade and over the endâ€ofâ€life trajectory. We focus on informal care provided by family members or friends, and three types of homeâ€based formal care services: care by personal support workers, physician visits, and nurse visits. Using survey data collected in a homeâ€based endâ€ofâ€life care programme in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2016, we build a twoâ€part utilisation model analysing both the propensity to use each type of formal care and the amount of formal care received by patients. The results suggest that informal care is a substitute for care by personal support workers, but a complement to physician visits and nurse visits. In the case of nurse visits, an increased complementary effect is observed in more recent years. For homeâ€based physician and nurse visits, the complementary effect grows with patient's proximity to death. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between informal and formal care among homeâ€based endâ€ofâ€life patients. Decisionâ€makers need to take into account the relationship between informal care and different types of formal services when introducing future policies.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=134685908&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1.0	876	sun,zhuolu	sun	zhuolu		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

612	613	Exploring A Nursing Home-Specific, Interdisciplinary, Function-Focused, Communicative Framework Based On Situation, Background, Assessment, And Recommendation.	2021	838	10.1097/jnr.0000000000000428			838	29.0	3.0	e151	Background: Improved methods of communication are needed among professionals in related fields to address the increasing complexity of clinical situations and various levels of functioning experienced by older adults who live in nursing homes. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore function-focused clinical communication among nurses and providers based on the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) approach toward interdisciplinary collaboration to maintain function among nursing home residents and to identify the characteristics of SBAR flows in nursing homes. Methods: Detailed interviews with 28 interdisciplinary professionals working in four nursing homes were conducted. Directed qualitative content analysis was used to identify the internal attributes of SBAR-based communication. Case analysis was conducted to identify SBAR flows. Results: Four themes emerged as key factors for function-focused interdisciplinary staff communication in nursing homes. Effective nursing care to maintain function among nursing home residents requires accurate awareness of abnormal circumstances. Knowledge of assessment and resident background are needed to address situations requiring intervention and identify the problems underlying a resident's current state. The optimal therapeutic environment is created by sharing roles and tasks among practitioners through referrals. Twelve generalized situations requiring function-focused communication (i.e., dislocation of body line because of joint contracture, change in walking, difficulty of moving because of pain, difficulty in eating, fever, change in sleep pattern, change in excretion pattern, change in weight, change in condition, change in problematic behavior, decrease in cognitive function, and change in relationships) and the related nurse-centered SBAR pathways were identified. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: These results represent a first prototype for developing practical communication guidelines for nursing-home-specific function-focused care and provide new insights into the interdisciplinary approach.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=150250201&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1.0	838	Journal of Nursing Research (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)	1.0	838	park,min.sun	park	min.sun		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

It is important to first understand the complexity of pain in older adults as well as the myths health care providers may believe, which could lead to undertreatment of their pain. The older adult patient experiences many types of pain; in some cases, these individuals may have combined types of pain. Many medications can be given safely to older patients; nonopioids, opioids, and adjuvant medications can be tried for pain relief.

More of these patients are choosing to be managed conservatively, without dialysis. Palliative provision for these patients within UK renal services is limited, but the recent National Service Framework for Renal Services (Department of Health, 2005) has promoted service development. However, few models of service provision have been described. This article describes a retrospective review of a new service for conservatively-managed patients with end-stage renal disease. The range and complexity of the health needs of this population is demonstrated, and an example of service development described. A model of the stages of the conservative pathway and appropriate interventions was developed. The absence of research evidence prevented development of formal audit standards, and highlighted the urgent need for evaluation of models of care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106422407&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	208	British Journal of Nursing	1.0	1016	murtagh,fem	murtagh	fem		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
678	679	The Link Between Chronic Conditions And Urinary Incontinence.	2010	987				987	16.0	1.0	7	Urinary incontinence is commonly associated with chronic diseases. Strong associations exist between continence problems, impairments outside the lower urinary tract and activity limitations. These associations also occur in diseases that directly affect the neurological control mechanism for continence. The World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a paradigm for thinking about disease and its consequences, including urinary incontinence. This paper reviews the association between disease, impairment and activity limitation for some common chronic diseases and for older adults. The complexity of the relationships between different aspects of urinary incontinence has important implications for the assessment and management of urinary incontinence in chronic disease and for older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105141180&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	987	Australian & New Zealand Continence Journal	1.0	987	chiarelli,p	chiarelli	p		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

A total of 24 seniors participated in individual face-to-face interviews. Through thematic analysis, the overarching theme identified that past experiences, life transitions, and future concerns influence seniors' participation in physical activity. This overarching theme helps explain the complexity of physical activity participation in later life. The subthemes included intergenerational influences, establishment of early physical activity patterns, family transitions over the life course, changing health status over the life course, and future health concerns. A greater understanding of an individual's life history is paramount for nurses to help increase participation in physical activity among seniors.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105793795&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	999	Journal of Gerontological Nursing	1.0	1003	weeks,le	weeks	le		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

This study is part of a larger project where interviews were used to follow 12 nursing home residents over time. The aim of the present study was to reach a deeper understanding of seven older people's thoughts, feelings and attitudes towards death. The participants were interviewed on four occasions across 18-24 months, and the interviews were analysed using a hermeneutic method. The findings revealed three main themes: 1. Zest for life, 2. Indifferent additude, 3. Longing for death. The themes mirror the complexity of what ageing and nearing the end of life can mean. A strong desire among the participants was to be more involved in their own personal care and in everyday life at the nursing home. Person-oriented care based on the philisophy of palliative care, and including conversation as a natural component, might promote the older person's possiblities to obtain a good death.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106358693&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0.0	311	International Journal of Palliative Nursing	1.0	1013	ternestedt,b	ternestedt	b		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

520	521	Structured Follow-Up Of Frail Home-Dwelling Older People In Primary Health Care: Is There A Special Need, And Could A Checklist Be Of Any Benefit? A Qualitative Study Of Experiences From Registered Nurses And Their Leaders	2019	594	10.2147/JMDH.S212283	31686832	WOS:000482134000001	594	12.0		675	Aim: To identify experiences and opinions about the need for a structured follow-up and to identify potential benefits and barriers to the use of a checklist (Sub Acute Functional decline in the Older people [SAFE]) when caring for frail home-dwelling older people. Background: The complexity of older peoples' health situation requires more coordinated health care across health care levels and a better structured follow-up than is currently being offered, especially in the transitional phase between hospital discharge and primary care, but also in more stable phases at home. Design: This was a qualitative study using focus group interviews. Methods: Data were collected during six focus group interviews in three districts in a municipality. Nineteen registered nurses (RNs) and seventeen leaders responsible for the follow-up of frail home-dwelling older people participated. Participants were representatives of the RNs in homecare and their leaders. Results: Our results highlight that although most RNs and their leaders saw a number of significant benefits to conducting a structured assessment and follow-up of frail older people home care recipients, a number of barriers made this difficult to realize on a daily basis. Conclusion: There is no common perception that a structured follow-up of frail homed-welling older people in primary health care is an important and contributing factor to better quality of health care. Despite this, most RNs and leaders found that the use of a structured checklist such as SAFE was a benefit to achieving a structured follow-up of the frail older people. We identified several factors of importance to whether a structured follow-up with a checklist is conducted in home care.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1.0	594	Journal Of Multidisciplinary Healthcare		594	naess,gro	naess	gro		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
533	534	Deprescribing In Older Adults: A New Concept For Nurses In Administering Medicines And As Prescribers Of Medicine	2017	631	10.1136/ejhpharm-2016-000908	31156898	WOS:000396467800013	631	24.0	1.0	47	Deprescribing is a new and emerging theme in the care of older adults living with multimorbidities including frailty. Deprescribing requires a comprehensive review of risk and benefits of a medication in the context of the quality of remaining life and patient and family priorities and preferences. Nursing to date has not engaged with this issue, yet in their roles administering medicines and prescribing medicines they are a fundamental part of the pathway in deprescribing decisions and in supporting patients to make such decisions. In administering medicines, nurses are in a position to observe the degree of difficulty or burden experienced by patients due to polypharmacy or side effects of medicines. While as prescribers for adults with multimorbidities, active review of the risk and benefits of all medicines using evidence-based instruments is part of prescribing responsibility. This article is calling for a critical examination of nurses' roles in deprescribing and in supporting patients to make informed choices about their treatment. There is a need to articulate the role of nursing in this emerging area of medicines management and contribute to a multidisciplinary discourse on deprescribing. Equally professional standards and continuous professional development for nurses as prescribers and administrators of medicines needs to reflect the complexity of an older population. A deprescribing ethos challenges nurses to actively elicit patients' experiences of medicines burden, while nurse prescribers should recognise that appropriate deprescribing is as much a part of their role as appropriate prescribing.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1.0	631	European Journal Of Hospital Pharmacy-Science And Practice		631	naughton,corina	naughton	corina		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

While AT may extend independence in ageing, there are racial and ethnic disparities in late-life AT use, with lower rates reported among Hispanic older populations. The aim of this study was to identify barriers experienced by Hispanic community-living older adults for using AT. Sixty Hispanic older adults (70 years and older) with functional limitations participated in this study. A descriptive qualitative research design was used guided by the principles of the Human Activity Assistive Technology Model to gain in-depth understanding of participants' perspectives regarding barriers to using AT devices. Individual in-depth semi-structure interviews were conducted, using the Assistive Technology Devices Cards (ATDC) assessment as a prompt to facilitate participants' qualitative responses. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and rigorous thematic content analysis. Lack of AT awareness and information, cost of AT, limited coverage of AT by heath care plans, and perceived complexity of AT were the predominant barriers experienced by the participants. A multi-level approach is required for a better understanding of the barriers for using AT devices. The personal, contextual, and activity-based barriers found in this study can be used to develop culturally sensitive AT interventions to reduce existent disparities in independent living disabilities among older Hispanics.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1.0	632	Journal Of Racial And Ethnic Health Disparities		632	orellano-colon,elsa m	orellano-colon	elsa m		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
597	598	A Systematic Review Of Predictors And Screening Instruments To Identify Older Hospitalized Patients At Risk For Functional Decline.	2007	802	10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01579.x	17181666		34	16.0	1.0	46	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated. BACKGROUND: Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on health-care costs is also high. RESULTS: Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described. CONCLUSION: These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1.0	802	hoogerduijn,jita.g	Hoogerduijn	Jita G		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Older adults who account for nearly 37% of all hospital discharges often need care and support of family members at the time of hospital discharge. This study examines decisions made by hospitalized older adults, families, and health care team members (HCTMs) about hospital discharge. The sample included older adults (n = 13, average age 84), family members (n = 12, average age 71), and HCTMs (n = 7, average age 47).

Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		100	Scandinavian Journal Of Caring Sciences	1.0	821	stenwall,ewa	Stenwall	Ewa		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

BACKGROUND: Admission into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. DATA SOURCES: The background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into nursing homes and psychological transitions. DISCUSSION: The concepts of transition from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that occurs when an older person is admitted into care. CONCLUSION: Improving the psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a more positive experience.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1.0	52	ellis,julie.m	Ellis	Julie M		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

To approach this new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal health and social care systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing specialists trained to address the needs of older people from a perspective of comprehensive care, both for healthy aging, and for the different health problems of this population group, characterized by the consequences of aging and chronicity, towards dependence, and develop the powers established by law in the framework of an interdisciplinary team, for those who have been trained and accredited, thus adding value to the response that health systems have to provide for this growing problem of the 'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.		2021-07-02 01:32:47	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		710	Enfermeria Clinica (English Edition)	1.0	710	viÃ±a-garcÃ­a-bericua,marÃ­a	ViÃ±a-GarcÃ­a-Bericua	MarÃ­a		1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1.0	699	Topics In Geriatric Rehabilitation		703	dennehy,ma	dennehy	ma	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

577	578	Nurse Practitioners' Role In Improving Service For Elderly Trauma Patients.	2019	721	10.1097/JTN.0000000000000445	31283744		721	26.0	4.0	174	Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 Â± 3.54 vs. 5.60 Â± 3.98, p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 Â± $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 Â± $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current practice model.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		721	Journal Of Trauma Nursing: The Official Journal Of The Society Of Trauma Nurses	1.0	721	bethea,audis	Bethea	Audis		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
581	582	Attributes Of Person-Centred Communication: A Qualitative Exploration Of Communication With Older Persons In Home Health Care.	2020	742	10.1111/opn.12284	31642182		33	15.0	1.0	e12284	BACKGROUND: Previous research points to challenges related to the home healthcare of older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although person-centred care has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home. METHODS: A descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the attributes of person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions. CONCLUSION: The nurses' attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. Implication for practice The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included in education and training.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1.0	742	sundler,annelie.j	Sundler	Annelie J		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
402	403	The Use Of Case Management For Communityâ€Dwelling Older People: The Effects On Loneliness, Symptoms Of Depression And Life Satisfaction In A Randomised Controlled Trial	2018	428	 10.1111/scs.12520			170	32.0	2.0	889.0	Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for communityâ€dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A twoâ€armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated followâ€ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: â‰¥ 65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more selfâ€reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intentionâ€toâ€treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intentionâ€toâ€treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the followâ€ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

400	401	Deprescribing For Frail Older Peopleâ€”Learning From The Case Of Mrs. Hansen	2018	426	 10.1016/j.sapharm.2017.07.003			426	14.0	6.0	612.0	Drug treatment is often an essential part in treatment and prevention of diseases in older people, but there is much concern about inappropriate medication use. This paper aims to describe the complexity of medication safety issues and clinical judgments when optimizing prescribing in older individuals. It uses the case of Mrs. Hansen, an aged nursing home resident, to illustrate the facilitators and barriers of this process. With decreasing life expectancy, medication use should shift from cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment to increase the patient's well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of (potentially) dangerous medications were reduced, and non-pharmacological alternatives were considered. There were some medicines added, as underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. Deprescribing long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family as â€œgiving up hopeâ€. More clinical evidence and practical communication tools are needed to guide deprescribing decisions, taking medical and patient-centered priorities into account. Studies evaluating such interventions should select outcome measures that are particularly relevant for frail old individuals.

Research Into Attitudes And Understanding Of Frailty In Undergraduate And Postgraduate Trainees.	2021	161	10.1093/ageing/afab030.124			161	50.0		i1	Introduction: Frailty is an increasingly recognised concept, with 25â€“50% of over 85â€™s estimated to be frail1,. Previous research considered medical studentsâ€™ attitudes towards older people2, yet despite the correlation between frailty and increased age3, little is known about attitudes of healthcare professionals towards frailty. We researched attitudes towards, and understanding of, frailty in undergraduate and postgraduate trainees, with a view to guiding future educational interventions. Method: Approval was granted by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHCT) Research and Development department, Newcastle Universityâ€™s Research Management Group and the HRA. 3 cohorts were recruited; 3rd year Newcastle University MBBS Students, 5th year Newcastle University MBBS Students and Foundation Year 2 and Core Medical Trainees working for NHCT (junior doctors). Data was collected during scheduled teaching at NHCT and individuals were invited to participate via email prior to this. Those not participating were still required to attend the teaching. Participants provided written consent. Within each cohort, small group discussions around frailty and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) were prompted using open questions (e.g. â€œwhat does frailty mean to you?â€), during which participants anonymously submitted phrases to an online word-cloud generator. Discussions were audio recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions and word-clouds were analysed using Simple Content Analysis. The overarching themes within each cohort were identified and compared with other cohorts. Interpretations were reviewed by an independent researcher to enhance rigour. Results: Each cohort associated frailty with older age and weakness, and often used it as a byword for complexity. Frailty was described as an abstract construct composed of personal experiences rather than an objectively defined descriptor. All associated it with negative emotions. Cohorts differed in their approach, with 3rd year students primarily focussed on defining frailty, whereas junior doctors prioritised the clinical challenges it presented. Junior doctors demonstrated limited understanding of CGA whilst undergraduate students were almost universally ignorant of it. Conclusions: The lack of understanding around frailty and CGA is concerning given its high prevalence.The identification of negative emotions increases this concern. To challenge this, focussed educational interventions addressing understanding and attitudes ought to be developed for tomorrowâ€™s doctors.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=149478846&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		161	hartley,s	hartley	s	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Adult children and spouses are often the first to assume care giving responsibilities for older adults when declining function results in increased care needs. By introducing policies tailored to enabling family members to combine gainful employment with providing care for older relatives, the sustainability of the future care for older individuals in Norway is more explicitly placed on the family and informal caregivers than previously. Care recipients and informal caregivers are expected to take an active consumer role and participate in the care decision-making process. This paper aims to describe the informal caregivers' experiences of influencing decision-making at and after hospital discharge for home-bound older relatives. METHODS: This paper reports findings from a follow-up study with an exploratory qualitative design. Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 19 informal caregivers of older individuals discharged from hospital in Norway. An inductive thematic content analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Informal caregivers take on comprehensive all-consuming roles as intermediaries between the care recipient and the health care services. In essence, the informal caregivers take the role of the active participant on behalf of their older relative. They describe extensive efforts struggling to establish dialogues with the ""gatekeepers"" of the health care services. Achieving the goal of the best possible care for the care recipient seem to depend on the informal caregivers having the resources to choose appropriate strategies for gaining influence over decisions. CONCLUSIONS: The care recipients' extensive frailty and increasing dependence on their families coupled with the complexity of health care services contribute to the perception of the informal caregivers' indispensable role as intermediaries. These findings accentuate the need to further discuss how frail older individuals and their informal caregivers can be supported and enabled to participate in decision-making regarding care arrangements that meet the care recipient's needs."		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	25	Bmc Health Services Research		118	bragstad,line.kildal	Bragstad	Line Kildal		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
129	130	An Investigation Of The Components Of Best Nursing Practice In The Care Of Acutely Ill Hospitalized Older Patients With Coincidental Dementia: A Multi-Method Design.	1999	132	10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01194.x	10564412		52	30.0	5.0	1127	The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method research.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1.0	132	tolson,d	Tolson	D	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

A State Of The Art Review.	2020	191	10.1111/anae.14910			191	75.0		e46	The increasing age and subsequent medical complexity of patients presenting for surgery grants the opportunity to examine the processes and delivery of peri-operative care. There is a need to redesign peri-operative pathways allowing room for shared decision making and personalised, evidence-based care. In times of financial constraint, this is no easy task. However, neglecting to transform services now may lead to challenges in the sustainability of the provision of peri-operative care in the long-term. Challenges in redesigning peri-operative care pathways include identification and optimisation of those at highest peri-operative risk to inform the difficult conversations surrounding the appropriateness of surgery. The moral burden of these conversations on patient and professionals alike is increasingly recognised and managing this issue requires innovative models of collaborative, multidisciplinary and interprofessional working. To operate or not can be a challenging question to answer with a number of different perspectives to consider; not least that of the patient.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141143000&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	191	Anaesthesia		191	santhirapala,r	santhirapala	r	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
189	190	The Seventh Age On Stage: Representation Of Older Adults And Aging In U.S. Broadway And Off-Broadway Theater.	2019	192	10.1080/03601277.2019.1685736			192	45.0	11.0	645	Older persons' involvement in theater often focuses on health, educational, and therapeutic benefits. Though less examined, artistic depictions of aging help bridge gerontological and humanities approaches to this topic. Qualitative textual script analysis was used to analyze the representation of older adults in six plays produced on and off Broadway, 1991â€“2017. Traditional character constructions of age and older adults emerged â€“ frailty, fear, caregiving burden â€“ with counternarratives of resilience, resistance, and self-reflexivity also present. Uncovered dyadic pairs (e.g. frailty/resistance) served as examples of the complexity of age portrayed on stage. From this dyadic tension present in the plays emerged a way to build upon and expand traditional, and often more limited, societal notions of aging.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=139742145&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	192	Educational Gerontology		192	weil,joyce	weil	joyce	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
196	197	156 Review Of Outcomes Of A Dedicated Geriatric Surgical Liaison Service.	2019	199	10.1093/ageing/afz103.91			161	48.0		iii17	Background In the United Kingdom, the 2010 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report 'An Age Old Problem' outlined significant shortcomings in the perioperative care of older people. Other than hip fractures, the care of older patients under surgical specialities is largely devoid of routine geriatrician input. In August 2018, we introduced daily geriatric reviews (GR) on the gastrointestinal surgical wards, aiming to improve length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Methods All acute general surgery admissions for patients â‰¥70 years were reviewed between September and October 2017 (pre-introduction) and 2018 (post-introduction), and outcomes compared. For 2018, comparisons were also made between those who had GR and those who didn't. Results There were 173 admissions in 2017, vs 190 in 2018. In both 2017 and 2018, median age was 80, median LOS was 4 days, and clinical frailty scale (CFS) 4. Twenty-two percent (38/173) of patients had a surgical procedure in 2017, vs 33% (63/190) in 2018. Inpatient mortality was 8% (13/173) in 2017 (median CFS 6), vs 6% (11/190) in 2018 (median CFS 6). In 2018, 21% (40/190) of patients had GR: median time to review 3 days. 54% (n=22) of the patients with GR underwent a surgical procedure, 37% (n=15) were admitted to ICU, and inpatient mortality was 5% (n=2), vs 28% (n=42), 4% (n=6) and 6% (n=9) respectively for those without GR. 30 day readmission for those with GR was 12.5% (n=5), vs 18.4% (n=28) for those not seen. Conclusion While more surgical procedures were performed in 2018 (post-introduction), overall LOS remained unchanged and improved mortality was observed compared to 2017. Geriatricians are seeing more post-operative and ICU patients, and despite presumed increased complexity, both mortality and readmission rates remain low. Screening for frailty and specific inclusion criteria may improve rates of GR.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865077&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		199	coary,roisin	coary	roisin	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
198	199	92 Medication Related Quality Of Life (Mrqol) In Ambulatory Older Adults With Polypharmacy And Multi-Morbidity â€“ A Measurable Outcome?	2019	201	10.1093/ageing/afz103.54			161	48.0		iii17	Background With increasing numbers of older multi-morbid people being exposed to polypharmacy, research needs to focus on medication-related outcomes affecting quality-of-life (QoL). This study examines older-patients' medication-related QoL (MRQoL), its relationship to medication burden/complexity, frailty, health-related QoL (HRQoL) and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs. Methods A cross-sectional-study was conducted in older-patients attending out-patients and day-hospital services of a tertiary-teaching-hospital. Participants were aged â‰¥65 years, first-time attendees, taking â‰¥5 chronic-medications for â‰¥3 chronic-conditions and mini-mental state examination score â‰¥26/30. Demographic, medication, comorbidity, frailty status, PIMs(STOPP/STARTv.2 criteria), MRQoL (MRQoL-LS v1.0) HRQoL (Short-form-12; SF-12) and medication burden (Living with Medicines Questionnaire v.2; LMQv2) data were collected. Drg compliance was measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). Lower MRQoL-LS v1.0 scores indicate better MRQoL (range 0-84). Higher LMQv2 scores indicate higher medication burden (range from 60-300). A negative age-specific mean-difference score in SF-12 physical and mental health composite scale scores (SF12-PCS, SF12-MCS) indicates poorer health. Results Over 12 months, 234 patients (attending 78 clinics) were screened, 59 met inclusion criteria and 30 were recruited; 3 patients were subsequently identified as ineligible. Eighteen patients were female (66%), mean age was 79.4 years (SDÂ±6.2), median number of daily medications was 10 (IQR 8-13), median number of comorbidities was 11 (IQR 9-14). Participants were generally drug-compliant, median MARS score of 9 (IQR 6.5-10). Patients' median MRQoL score was 14 (IQR 14-22.5); mean LMQ v2 score was 115.64 (SDÂ± 25.18). Mean age specific mean-difference SF12-PCS and SF12-MCS scores were -22.61 (SDÂ±11.7) and -22.1 (SDÂ±17.5) respectively. There was no significant correlation between MRQoL and number of daily medications, number of comorbidities, LMQ, HRQoL, or PIMs(Pearson's 2-tailed test). Conclusion This study demonstrates that MRQoL-LS v.1 is not applicable to most patients attending geriatric ambulatory services. Furthermore, polypharmacy, multimorbidity, presence of PIMs poorer HRQoL do not correlate significantly with MRQoL.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865040&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		201	jennings,emma	jennings	emma	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
200	201	210 Nursing Home Residents In Acute Hospital â€“ A Targeted Anpc Program To Improve Care.	2019	203	10.1093/ageing/afz103.127			161	48.0		iii17	Background NHR are the frailest group of older people and require a gerontologically attuned approach to combat multiple challenges presented to the practitioner. The in-reach ANPc liaison service aims to confront such challenges, by providing comprehensive gerontological input to all nursing home residents admitted to hospital under all specialities medical, geriatric, and surgical. Methods This service commenced in September of 2018, working 9-5 Monday to Friday with limited leave cross-cover. All nursing home residents are reviewed by a Gerontology Advanced Nurse Practitioner candidate. Each patient received comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) with recommendations for care. All had follow up 2 weeks after discharge in telephone review clinic. Results 118 nursing home residents were admitted for acute care in the study period; 96/118 (82%) were reviewed by the ANPc. 16/118 (14%) were discharged prior to review and 6/118 (5%) died within 24 hours of admission. All other patients were reviewed within 72 hours. All assessed residents had >1 recommendation for intervention to enhance care following CGA: Interventions included 31% (30/96) undiagnosed delirium identified and management advice given. 21% (20/96) had recurrent falls work up and advice. 27% (26/96) had recommendations and changes to admission medications. 37% (36/96) referrals to other HSCP therapy disciplines for complete holistic care. 11% (11/ 96) had advanced care planning regarding future illnesses. 13% (13/96) had palliative care advice and referral to community palliative care. Follow up telephone review clinics have further resulted in reduced readmission rates through liaison with NH staff post-discharge. Conclusion The high complexity of this cohort of patients requires a timely, comprehensive gerontological approach in order to provide holistic care. They require a clearly defined approach to enhance care and minimise the need for unnecessary hospitalisations.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865114&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		203	noonan,claire	noonan	claire	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
204	205	When Frail Older People Relocate In Very Old Age, Who Makes The Decision?	2019	207	10.1093/geroni/igz030			207	3.0	4.0	N.PAG	"Background and Objectives Older people are likely to transition to a new home closer to family who can provide assistance or to long-term residential care as their health declines and their care needs increase. A minority choose to move to ""age-friendly"" housing before the onset of disability, but the majority prefer to ""age in place"" and defer moving until health crises compel a transition. Older people living with dementia are likely to move into residential care, but not much is known about the role they play in decision making around these moves. This qualitative study addresses this gap in knowledge by examining how a rare cohort of ""older old"" people, most with some level of cognitive impairment, were involved in decisions surrounding assistance seeking and moving to a care home. Research Design and Methods Thematic analysis of qualitative interview data from Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) study participants aged 95 years and older, who had moved in later life, and their proxy informants (n = 26). Results Moves at such an old age were made due to a complexity of push and pull factors which had layered dynamics of decision making. In most cases (n = 22), decision making involved other people with varying degrees of decision ownership. Only four older people, who moved voluntarily, had full ownership of the decision to move. Many relatives reported being traumatized by events leading up to the move. Discussion and Implications ""Older old"" people are sometimes unable to make their own decisions about moving due to the urgency of health crisis and cognitive decline. There is a need to support relatives to discuss moving and housing options at timely junctures before health crises intervene in an effort to optimize older people's participation in decision making."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141055321&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	207	Innovation in Aging		207	scheibl,fiona	scheibl	fiona	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
184	185	The Role Of A Virtual Clinic In Reducing Waiting Times For Out-Patient Follow-Up.	2020	187	10.1093/ageing/afz183.30			161	49.0		i1	Topic: Hospital admissions for older people are increasing with subsequent pressure on outpatient (OP) clinics. By early 2018, 350 patients were waiting up to 6 months for follow-up, with limited capacity in existing clinics. There were concerns regarding potential harm to patients from delayed review of significant results. Intervention: A working group considered options for managing the OP waiting list. We decided to pilot a fortnightly virtual clinic (VC) where cases were reviewed without the patient present. All patients awaiting results were listed for the VC rather than routine OP. Each VC had 50 patients listed. Patientâ€™s GP received a clear action plan. Clinic rules were modified as issues were identified. Links with other specialities evolved reducing the number of missing results. Data was analysed for 50% of consultations between January 2018 and March 2019. Improvement: 311 VC appointments were reviewed: 207 in 2018 and 104 up to March 2019. Maximum 25 cases could be completed per clinic, additional sessions cleared initial backlog within 3 months. Completion time/case ranged from 2-15 minutes depending on complexity. Main reason for VC was test results: 82% in 2018, increasing to 93% in 2019. 61% in 2018, 80% in 2019 were discharged directly from VC. 20% required a 2nd VC for outstanding results. OP review post-VC fell from 16% in 2018 to just 2% in 2019. General OP requirements fell from 24hrs to 10 hours/week as a result of VCs, releasing consultants for other clinical areas. Discussion: VCs are an effective means of reviewing outstanding results fromrecent admissions and OP consultations. Routine listing of patients with outstanding investigations provides a safety net. Most results are normal and do not require follow-up. Repeat CXRs at 6 weeks continue to be requested for severely frail people who are unlikely to benefit.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761298&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		187	thomson,f	thomson	f	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
182	183	Medicine For Older People Liaison Service To Acute Surgery Reduces Length Of Stay Of Older People Living With Frailty.	2020	185	10.1093/ageing/afz183.32			161	49.0		i1	Background: Of people admitted to the acute surgical unit (ASU) only 23% of them are aged over 70. However the number of bed days they occupy are disproportionate to this; comprising 48% of the total bed days. The average number of bed days rises exponentially with age, with those aged under 70 averaging less than two days; those aged 80 averaging approximately 4.5 bed days and those aged over 90 approximately 7 bed days. This disparity was recognised and a Medicine for Older People (MOP) liaison team comprising consultant geriatrician and Advanced Clinical Practitioner in Frailty starting working with the acute surgical team in November 2018, initially providing support two days a week, increasing to 5 days in March 2019. Methods: The MOP liaison team meets with the acute surgical team each morning identifying and discussing relevant patients; those identified as living with frailty with associated complexity and uncertainty. This group of patients is then reviewed by the MOP liaison team utilising the principles of the comprehensive geriatric assessment to formulate a person-centred plan. Plans are discussed and coordinated with the surgical, nursing and therapy teams utilising a multi-disciplinary/ multi-professional approach. Results: Length of stay is the main outcome measure and readmissions are monitored. Data on admission length and readmissions was analysed from April 2018 and has continued following commencement of the liaison service. Primary results-Length of stay has reduced from 4.4 to 3.3 days on average for all over 70-year-olds admitted to the ASU team. Whilst admission rates have dropped across all age ranges the biggest reduction in readmissions is among the over 80-year-olds with an almost 50% reduction as opposed to a 33% reduction in the under 70 age group Conclusions: Proactively managing the admissions and discharges of patients with frailty allows them to receive the right care at the right time in their period of crisis and shortens their admissions by approximately 25%.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761300&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		185	everett,r	everett	r	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the goldâ€standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of frail older persons, and (3) designing personâ€tailored interventions. Materials and methods: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach to older patients with cancer. Results and discussion: A widespread use of this standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=147674413&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	167	European Journal of Clinical Investigation		167	fusco,domenico	fusco	domenico	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
179	180	"Chronic Disease Decision Making And ""What Matters Most""."	2020	182	10.1111/jgs.16371			144	68.0	3.0	474	"The increasing use of the question, ""What matters most to you?"" is a welcome development in the effort to provide patientâ€centered care. However, it is difficult for clinicians to translate answers to this question into treatment plans for chronic conditions, including recognizing when to consider options other than clinical practice guideline (CPG)â€“directed therapy. Goal elicitation is most helpful when a patient has different treatment options with clearly identifiable tradeâ€offs. In the face of tradeâ€offs, goal elicitation helps patients to prioritize among potentially competing outcomes. While decision aids (DAs) focus on tradeâ€offs by delineating options and outcomes, the robust outcome data necessary to create DAs for older patients with multimorbidity are often lacking and even mild cognitive impairment makes the use of DAs difficult. The challenges for providing chronic disease care to older patients who are at risk for adverse events from CPGâ€directed therapy because of multimorbidity and/or frailty are to organize the complexity of individual combinations of diseases, conditions, and syndromes into common sets of tradeâ€offs and to identify those goals or priorities that will directly inform a plan of care.

41	42	Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative: Early Implementation Results Of A National Veterans Affairs Program To Honor Veterans' Care Preferences.	2020	43	10.1007/s11606-020-05697-2	32096084		43	35.0	6.0	1803	BACKGROUND: On July 1, 2018, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) National Center for Ethics in Health Care implemented the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative (LSTDI). Its goal is to identify, document, and honor LST decisions of seriously ill veterans. Providers document veterans' goals and decisions using a standardized LST template and order set. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the first 7Â months of LSTDI implementation and identify predictors of LST template completion. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of clinical and administrative data. We identified all completed LST templates, defined as completion of four required template fields. Templates also include four non-required fields. Results were stratified by risk of hospitalization or death as estimated by the Care Assessment Need (CAN) score. SUBJECTS: All veterans with VA utilization between July 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Completed LST templates, goals and LST preferences, and predictors of documentation. RESULTS: LST templates were documented for 108,145 veterans, and 85% had one or more of the non-required fields completed in addition to the required fields. Approximately half documented a preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among those who documented specific goals, half wanted to improve or maintain function, independence, and quality of life while 28% had a goal of life prolongation irrespective of risk of hospitalization/death and 45% expressed a goal of comfort. Only 7% expressed a goal of being cured. Predictors of documentation included VA nursing home residence, older age, frailty, and comorbidity, while non-Caucasian race, rural residence, and receipt of care in a lower complexity medical center were predictive of no documentation. CONCLUSIONS: LST decisions were documented for veterans at high risk of hospitalization or death. While few expressed a preference for cure, half desire, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Predictors of documentation were generally consistent with existing literature. Opportunities to reduce observed disparities exist by leveraging available VA resources and programs.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	43	Journal Of General Internal Medicine		43	levy,cari	Levy	Cari		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
51	52	Caregivers' Experiences Of A Home Support Program After The Hospital Discharge Of An Older Family Member: A Qualitative Analysis.	2019	53	10.1186/s12913-019-4042-0	30971236		25	19.0	1.0	220	BACKGROUND: The ageing global population has seen increasing numbers of older people living with chronic health problems, declining function, and frailty. As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89â€‰years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were 'The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.

54	55	Service User, Carer And Provider Perspectives On Integrated Care For Older People With Frailty, And Factors Perceived To Facilitate And Hinder Implementation: A Systematic Review And Narrative Synthesis.	2019	56	10.1371/journal.pone.0216488	31083707		56	14.0	5.0	e0216488	INTRODUCTION: Older people with frailty (OPF) can experience reduced quality of care and adverse outcomes due to poorly coordinated and fragmented care, making this patient population a key target group for integrated care. This systematic review explores service user, carer and provider perspectives on integrated care for OPF, and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation, to draw out implications for policy, practice and research. METHODS: Systematic review and narrative synthesis of qualitative studies identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index, hand-searching of reference lists and citation tracking of included studies, and review of experts' online profiles. Quality of included studies was appraised with The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for qualitative research. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the synthesis. We identified four themes related to stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF: different preferences for integrated care among service users, system and service organisation components, relational aspects of care and support, and stakeholder perceptions of outcomes. Service users and carers highlighted continuity of care with a professional they could trust, whereas providers emphasised improved coordination of care between providers in different care sectors as key strategies for integrated care. We identified three themes related to factors facilitating and hindering implementation: perceptions of the integrated care intervention and target population, service organisational factors and system level factors influencing implementation. Different stakeholder groups perceived the complexity of care needs of this patient population, difficulties with system navigation and access, and limited service user and carer involvement in care decisions as key factors hindering implementation. Providers mainly also highlighted other organisational and system factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation of integrated care for OPF. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities and differences in lay and professional stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation were evident. Findings highlight the importance of addressing organisational and system level components of integrated care and factors influencing implementation for OPF. Greater attention needs to be placed on collaboratively involving service users, carers and providers to improve the co-design and implementation of integrated care programmes for this patient population.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	56	Plos One		56	sadler,euan	Sadler	Euan		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
26	27	Impact On Guidelines: The General Practitioner Point Of View.	2020	27	10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108091	32105769		27	166.0		108091	Primary care physicians are uniquely placed to offer holistic, patient-centred care to patients with T2DM. While the recent FDA-mandated cardiovascular outcome trials offer a wealth of data to inform treatment discussions, they have also contributed to increasing complexity in treatment decisions, and in the guidelines that seek to assist in making these decisions. To assist physicians in avoiding treatment inertia, Primary Care Diabetes Europe has formulated a position statement that summarises our current understanding of the available T2DM treatment options in various patient populations. New data from recent outcomes trials is contextualised and summarised for the primary care physician. This consensus paper also proposes a unique and simple tool to stratify patients into 'very high' and 'high' cardiovascular risk categories and outlines treatment recommendations for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Special consideration is given to elderly/frail patients and those with obesity. A visual patient assessment tool is provided, and a comprehensive set of prescribing tips is presented for all available classes of glucose-lowering therapies. This position statement will complement the already available, often specialist-focused, T2DM treatment guidelines and provide greater direction in how the wealth of outcome trial data can be applied to everyday practice.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	27	Diabetes Research And Clinical Practice		27	cos,x	Cos	X		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person-centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

94	95	Psychological And Social Resources Relate To Biomarkers Of Allostasis In Newly Admitted Nursing Home Residents.	2016	96	10.1080/13607863.2015.1072796	26237175		96	20.0	1.0	88	OBJECTIVES: This paper presents preliminary baseline data from a prospective study of nursing home adaptation that attempts to capture the complexity of residents' adaptive resources by examining psychological, social, and biological variables from a longitudinal conceptual framework. Our emphasis was on validating an index of allostasis. METHOD: In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes. RESULTS: Our results supported both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social support, optimism, and hope. CONCLUSION: Although these results are based on a small sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and physical resources and well-being.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	96	Aging & Mental Health		96	meeks,suzanne	Meeks	Suzanne		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
97	98	Complexity In Caring For An Ageing Heart Failure Population: Concomitant Chronic Conditions And Age Related Impairments.	2004	99	10.1016/j.ejcnurse.2004.08.004	15572013		75	3.0	4.0	263	The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure population.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	75	European Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing: Journal Of The Working Group On Cardiovascular Nursing Of The European Society Of Cardiology	1.0	99	de geest,sabina	De Geest	Sabina		1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
100	101	Diabetes Management And Education In Older Adults: The Development Of A National Consensus Of Key Research Priorities.	2016	102	10.1016/j.jcjd.2015.08.010	26616558		102	40.0	1.0	31	OBJECTIVES: Diabetes in older adults is increasing in its prevalence and complexity. To date, little research has been done to inform current diabetes management, including education and support, in older adults in Canada. The objective of this interactive national workshop was to develop key research priorities for future research related to diabetes in older adults. METHODS: Workshop participants comprised interprofessional healthcare providers, decision makers and policy makers from across Canada. Approximately 30 individuals attended an interactive 2-day meeting that included expert presentations and group consensus building using an electronic meeting system as well as nominal group techniques. RESULTS: The results of the 2-day meeting found more than 50 ideas that were summarized into 5 overall themes, with 14 subquestions, reflecting areas such as 1) identifying relevant outcomes for patients, providers and decision makers; 2) diabetes prevention; 3) the impact of diabetes on older adults and informal caregivers; 4) risk assessment tools and 5) effective models of care across a variety of healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS: To date, this workshop is the first of its kind and follows suit with other international working groups and associations. The research priorities developed through consensus from this workshop set forward a research agenda for diabetes in older adults in Canada.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	102	Canadian Journal Of Diabetes		102	sherifali,diana	Sherifali	Diana		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
104	105	Violence In Nursing Homes: Perceptions Of Female Caregivers.	2008	106	10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02196.x	18482127		34	17.0	12.0	1660	AIM: This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence. METHODS: Forty-one female caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The main finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the perception of violence is subjective, there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1.0	106	isaksson,ulf	Isaksson	Ulf		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The purpose of this prospective study was to describe the clinical profile of AC in LTC including risk factors, behavior patterns, etiologies, and 3-month outcomes. Seventy-four elderly LTC residents were assessed for AC, depression, and global cognitive impairment. Risk factors associated with AC included hearing deficits, depression, pulmonary disorders, and abnormal serum sodium or potassium levels. Behavior patterns of acutely confused residents included hyperactive (n = 9, 31%), hypoactive (n = 8, 28%), and mixed (n = 7, 24%). In the majority of the AC cases, the etiology was multIfactorial infections and dehydration were the most common causes. Residents with AC had very poor 3-month outcomes. Thirty-four percent (n = 10) of the residents with AC died within 3 months of the evaluation. This study highlights the complexity and serious nature of AC in this frail population.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	108	Clinical Nursing Research	1.0	108	cacchione,pamela.z	Cacchione	Pamela Z		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
69	70	The Chaos Of Hospitalisation For Patients With Critical Limb Ischaemia Approaching Major Amputation.	2018	71	10.1111/jocn.14536	29776002		34	27.0		3530	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To illuminate the hospital experience for patients and families when major amputation has been advised for critical limb ischaemia (CLI). BACKGROUND: CLI creates significant burden to the health system and the family, particularly as the person with CLI approaches amputation. Major amputation is often offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked deterioration of an ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced mobility, intractable pain, infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of clinical outcome data on CLI and amputation exists internationally, little is known about the patient/family-centred experience of hospitalisation to inform preservation of personhood and patient-centred care planning. DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative study using Heideggerian phenomenology. METHODS: Fourteen patients and 13 family carers provided a semistructured interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation followed, a second interview (6Â months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients and seven family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed. RESULTS: Hospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of chaos, characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile body and fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift within uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation and unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages (multiple stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity). CONCLUSIONS: Patients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful decision-making in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic process occurring within a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the care complexity and burden of family advocacy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A coordinated, interprofessional response should improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation scheduling and discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a sense of safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should be actively facilitated.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1.0	71	monaro,susan	Monaro	Susan		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
75	76	Symptom Trajectory And Symptom Burden In Older People With Multimorbidity, Secondary Outcome From The Rct Age-Fit Study.	2016	77	10.1111/jan.13032	27222059		52	72.0	11.0	2773	AIM: The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. BACKGROUND: Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. DESIGN: Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT). METHODS: Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24Â months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. RESULTS: Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1.0	77	eckerblad,jeanette	Eckerblad	Jeanette		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
84	85	A Community Virtual Ward Model To Support Older Persons With Complex Health Care And Social Care Needs.	2017	86	10.2147/CIA.S130876	28721026		61	12.0		985	BACKGROUND: Globally the older population is increasing rapidly. As a result there is an increase in frail older persons living within the community, with increased risks of a hospital admission and higher mortality and morbidity rates. Due to complexity of care, health care professionals face challenges in providing effective case management and avoiding unplanned admissions to hospital. A community virtual ward (CVW) model was developed to assist health care professionals to support older persons at home during periods of illness and/or functional decline. METHODS: A quantitative observational study was conducted to examine if a CVW model of care reduced unplanned hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations in 54 patients over a 12-month period. The sign-rank test examined matched data on bed days, ED presentations, and unplanned hospital admissions pre- and post-CVW implementation. Other risk factors for admission to hospital were examined using the Mann-Whitney test pre-and post-CVW admission, including falls, living alone, and cognition. Correlations between hospital admission avoidances and unplanned hospital admissions and ED presentations were tested using Spearman's Ï test. RESULTS: There was a reduction in ED presentations post-CVW admission (P<0.001), and median unscheduled admissions were reduced (P=0.001). Those living alone had a lower number of ED presentations (median 0.5, interquartile range 0-1) prior to admission in comparison to those living with a caregiver, with no differences observed during admission to CVW. For those who experienced a fall during CVW admission, the odds ratio (OR) of requiring long-term care doubled for each extra fall (OR =2.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.52, P=0.025). Reduced cognition was associated with an increased risk of ED presentations (Ï=0.292, P<0.05) but not associated with increased risks of unplanned hospital admissions (Ï=0.09, P=0.546). There were no significant correlations seen between admission avoidance and the number of unplanned hospital admissions or ED presentations. CONCLUSION: Through an integrated approach to care, a CVW model in the care of older persons can reduce ED presentations and unplanned hospital admissions.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1.0	61	Clinical Interventions In Aging		86	lewis,c	Lewis	C		1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
302	303	Challenges In End-Of-Life Care Management For Low-Income Frail Elders: A Case Study Of The Wisconsin Family Care Program.	2013	320	10.1177/0164027512446939			320	35.0	4.0	393	The need for well-coordinated care at the end of life is an important priority for meeting the needs of the growing number of low-income frail elders who are advancing in age. Partially integrated (Medicaid only) models of managed long-term care (MMLTC) are viewed as one promising and financially viable approach to enhance care coordination, yet we know little about the challenges that care managers face in managing the end-of-life care needs of poor elders. A case study design was used to explore challenges encountered in the provision of end-of-life care management for low-income elders enrolled in an innovative partially integrated model of long-term care, in Wisconsin, the Milwaukee County Family Care program. Data were collected via in-depth interviews with county administrators (n = 4) and selected lead supervisors or care managers (n = 7) and two focus groups with care management team members (n = 17). We identified five major themes representing essential challenges: (1) complexity of care and high level of support needs; (2) communication constraints in advance care planning; (3) family conflicts in end-of-life decision making for elders; (4) insufficient communication and collaboration between elders, families, teams, and service providers; and (5) limited bereavement and grief related support for families and teams after elders die. We discuss similarities and difference in the challenges reported here as compared to challenges reported in studies of other models of care and offer recommendations for program and policy development.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=88000044&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	320	Research on Aging		320	kwak,jung	kwak	jung	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
326	327	Practical Approaches To Pharmacologic Management Of Pain In Older Adults With Cancer.	2010	346	10.1188/10.ONF.S1.17-26			346	37.0		17	Purpose/Objectives: To identify appropriate strategies for pharmacotherapeutic agents in the management of pain in older adults with cancer.Data Sources: PubMed literature searches, personal reference collection, and clinical experience.Data Synthesis: To make good decisions about pain management when developing treatment plans for older adults, healthcare providers should focus on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in the context of the physiologic changes that occur with aging.Conclusions: Unrelieved pain can have a detrimental effect on older adults; conversely, overmedicating can lead to an increased risk of adverse events. With advancing age, physiologic changes alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs by reducing their absorption, changing their distribution, and modifying their metabolism and elimination. Also, common comorbidities increase the risk of pharmacologic toxicity and narrow the therapeutic window. In addition, polypharmacyâ€”an issue more common in older adultsâ€”increases the complexity of prescribing and risk of adverse events. Consequently, older adults require individualization of their pharmacotherapies. Healthcare providers should consider carefully the risks and benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjuvants before initiating an analgesic trial. The 2009 guidelines published by the American Geriatrics Society described several key principles for prescribing analgesics to older adults and offered specific recommendations and caveats for each drug class.Implications for Nursing: Current guidelines support appropriate management of cancer pain in older adults with specific recommendations for each class of analgesics as well as general prescribing principles.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=53296872&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1.0	346	Oncology Nursing Forum	1.0	346	brant,jeannine.m	brant	jeannine.m		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The availability of methods to measure cytokines and other inflammatory mediators or markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critically important. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the most widely used and best validated method, is limited by its ability to measure only a single protein in each sample. Recent developments in serum cytokine quantification technology include multiplex arrays, which offer the potential of better evaluating the complexity and dynamic nature of inflammatory responses and offer substantial cost and sample savings over traditional ELISA measurements. Despite potential advantages of this new technology, experience with these techniques is limited, and it has not emerged to date as the gold standard in inflammatory mediator measurement. This article reviews ELISA and the emerging multiplex technologies, compares the cost and effectiveness of recently developed multiplex arrays with traditional ELISA technology, and provides specific recommendations for investigators interested in measuring serum inflammatory mediators in older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=34637414&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		358	leng,sean.x	leng	sean.x	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
343	344	Giving Up Or Finding A Solution? The Experience Of Attempted Suicide In Later Life.	2006	367	10.1080/13607860600640905			96	10.0	6.0	638	Older people constitute one of the highest risk groups for suicide. Existing research in this area has been largely dominated by a risk factor approach. This is of limited usefulness since only a minority of those at risk go on to make an attempt. Therefore, prediction, prevention and the management of risk remain challenging. The present study aimed to capture the subjective experience of older people who had recently made a suicide attempt through exploring their understanding of the pathway to and from this attempt, within the context of ageing. Fifteen participants were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Three broad themes emergedâ€”Struggle (experiencing life as a struggle before and after the attempt, and in relation to growing older), Control (trying to maintain control over life before the attempt, and following it either failing or succeeding to regain control) and Visibility (feeling invisible or disconnected from others and trying to fight against this before the attempt and either becoming more or less connected afterwards). Risk factors identified in the literature were often absent or construed by participants as not relevant to their attempt. Individual accounts highlight the diversity and complexity of experience of older people who attempt suicide.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=22832018&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	96	Aging & Mental Health		367	crocker,l	crocker	l	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

We applied logistic regression models to identify clinical factors associated with mortality postoperatively. The participants included patients with lower-limb amputations (n = 2,375) who were discharged from Veterans Health Administration hospitals between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003. Most (98.9%) were male. We measured cumulative in-hospital, 3-month, and 1-year mortality. The results were 180 in-hospital deaths, 368 by 3 months, and 634 by the 1-year postsurgical amputation date. Those who had perioperative systemic sepsis (odds ratio = 4.28, 95% confidence interval = 2.87--6.39) had more than a fourfold increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality. Congestive heart failure, renal failure, and liver disease were significantly associated with mortality at all time periods. Metastatic cancer was associated only at 3 months and 1 year. We concluded that high medical complexity and mortality rates attest to the need for careful medical oversight during the postacute rehabilitation period.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=24639122&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	368	Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development		368	bates,barbara	bates	barbara	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current vacancies.

306	307	2012 â€“ That Was The Year That Was.	2013	324	10.1093/ageing/afs201			161	42.0	2.0	140	Geriatric medicine has an encyclopaedic sweep, reflecting the complexity of both the ageing process and of our patient group. Keeping up with, and making sense of, the relevant scientific literature is challenging, especially as ageing has increased in prominence as a focus of research across many branches of the sciences and the humanities. This review of research published in 2012 in generalist, geriatric medicine and gerontology journals has been compiled with a view to extracting those aspects of research into ageing which could be considered relevant not only to the practice of geriatric medicine, but also to our understanding of the ageing process and the relationship of geriatric medicine to other medical specialties and public health. The research discussed includes new insights into global ageing and the compression of morbidity; nosological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of dementia; an innovative study on the microbiome and ageing; epidemiological perspectives into multi-morbidity; an overview of the impact of the first waves of Baby Boomers; fresh thinking on geriatric syndromes such as orthostatic hypotension, kyphosis, urinary incontinence after stroke, frailty and elder abuse; an update of the Beers criteria and the first stirrings of recognition of the longevity dividend in the biomedical literature.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=85655713&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		324	o'neill,desmond	o'neill	desmond	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

This paper discusses the treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=60600095&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1.0	208	British Journal of Nursing	1.0	340	noble,helen	noble	helen		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
316	317	Exploring Biologically Relevant Pathways In Frailty.	2011	335				210		9.0	975	Background. Frailty is a late-life syndrome of vulnerability to adverse health outcomes characterized by a phenotype that includes muscle weakness, fatigue, and inflammatory pathway activation. The identification of biologically relevant pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically relevant pathways that contribute to frailty. Methods. Based on current understanding of the physiological basis of frailty, we hypothesize that variation in genes related to inflammation and muscle maintenance would associate with frailty. One thousand three hundred and fifty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped across 134 candidate genes using the Illumina Genotyping platform, and the rank order by strength of association between frailty and genotype was determined in a cross-sectional study. Results. Although no single-nucleotide polymorphism reached study-wide significance after controlling family-wise false-discovery rate at 0.05, single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), Caspase 8 (CASP8), CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), and beta-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) loci were among those strongly associated with frailty. Conclusions. The apoptosisâ€“ and transcription regulationâ€“related pathways highlighted by this preliminary analysis were consistent with prior gene expression studies in a frail mouse model and provide useful etiological insights for future biological studies of frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=64855331&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		335	ho,yen-yi	ho	yen-yi	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Studies that examined family involvement in various long-term care venues were identified through extensive searches of the literature. Future research and practice must consider the complexity of family structure, adopt longitudinal designs, provide direct empirical links between family involvement and resident outcomes, and offer rigorous evaluation of interventions in order to refine the literature.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=16573344&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	96	Aging & Mental Health		373	gaugler,j.e	gaugler	j.e	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
378	379	Demographically Corrected Normative Z Scores On The Neuropsychological Test Battery In Cognitively Normal Older Chinese Adults	2020	404	 10.1159/000505618			404	49.0	4.0	375.0	Background: Subjective questionnaires used for the diagnosis of pre-mild cognitive impairment (pre-MCI) and conventional criteria for MCI might mainly result in false-positive diagnostic errors. The integrated criteria based on demographically adjusted total and process Z scores on neuropsychological tests have been validated to be sensitive for measuring pre-MCI, MCI, and MCI subtypes. However, the underrepresentativity of Chinese populations and the complexity in some tests limit the use of the established Z scores in the elderly Chinese population. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a useful Z score calculator to assess individual cognitive performance after adjustment of the scores on each of the neuropsychological tests according to sex, age, and education and to establish preliminary norms for the objective assessment of cognition function in elderly Chinese individuals. Methods: The neuropsychological test battery consists of measures of performance on different cognitive domains, including episodic memory, language, executive function, processing speed, and attention. Data were obtained from 220 clinically cognitively normal Chinese volunteers aged 60 years or older from the cohort of the Shanghai study of health promotion among frail elderly individuals. Regression models were used to investigate the impact of age, education, and sex on test scores. Z scores were estimated for the different scores by subtracting the predicted mean from the raw score and dividing it by the root mean square error term for any given linear regression model. Results: Preliminary analyses indicated that age, sex, or level of education significantly affected test scores. A series of linear regression models was constructed for all instruments, i.e.: the Trail-Making Test A and B, to assess executive function or attention; the Boston Naming Test and animal list generation, to assess language; delayed free correct responses and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) recognition, as well as three process scores, i.e., intrusion errors, learning slope, and retroactive interference, from the HVLT-R, to assess memory, by adjusting for the covariates of age, sex, and level of education concurrently. The Z scores on all neuropsychological tests were estimated based on the corresponding regression coefficients. Conclusions: We constructed a multivariable regression-based normative Z score method for the measurement of cognition among older Chinese individuals in the community. The normative score will be useful for the accurate diagnosis of different subtypes of pre-MCI and MCI after preliminary rapid screening in the community.

382	383	The Seventh Age On Stage: Representation Of Older Adults And Aging In U.S. Broadway And Off-Broadway Theater	2019	408	 10.1080/03601277.2019.1685736			192	45.0	11.0	645.0	Older personsâ€™ involvement in theater often focuses on health, educational, and therapeutic benefits. Though less examined, artistic depictions of aging help bridge gerontological and humanities approaches to this topic. Qualitative textual script analysis was used to analyze the representation of older adults in six plays produced on and off Broadway, 1991â€“2017. Traditional character constructions of age and older adults emergedâ€”frailty, fear, caregiving burdenâ€”with counternarratives of resilience, resistance, and self-reflexivity also present. Uncovered dyadic pairs (e.g. frailty/resistance) served as examples of the complexity of age portrayed on stage. From this dyadic tension present in the plays emerged a way to build upon and expand traditional, and often more limited, societal notions of aging.

396	397	Health, Illness And Frailty In Old Age: A Phenomenological Exploration	2018	422	 10.1016/j.jaging.2018.10.002			410	47.0		24.0	The aim of this paper is to subject the clinical classification of frailty to scrutiny through exploring, via a phenomenological lens, the lived experiences of older people who meet the objective, or clinical, criteria of frailty. Drawing on a range of published research that explores the heterogeneous experiences of embodied ageing, the paper highlights the continuity of phenomenological structures of experience across successful ageing, normal ageing and frailty, suggesting the permeability and contestability of the boundaries between them and highlighting the complexity of health and illness in old age. Such data suggests a need to question the perception of frailty as something both apart from â€˜normalâ€™ ageing, and constitutive of frailed or failed ageing, and challenges the construction of the third age/fourth age polarity that underpins much of the meaning accorded to old age today.

372	373	Politics, Diversity, And Minority Aging.	1991	398				303	15.0	4.0	47	"This article discusses factors that affect the participation of ethnic and racial minority elders in the political process, underscoring the heterogeneity of the minority elder population and stressing that policies must reflect that complexity. Older persons in the United States are a formidable political force, whether measured by registration and voting rates, proliferation of old-age organizations, or presence of silver-haired legislatures. But what about elderly members of minority populations?By most account, minority elders do not enjoy political visibility, are not a major component of the membership base making up the national aging organizations, and have limited electoral ability at the local and state level. The minority population is aging. The benefits of improved public health measures in this country and the increased longevity enjoyed by young immigrant groups mean that they, too, will see major increases in the proportion of persons considered senior citizens. In this country, those who are dependent upon social services must have effective political advocates and they must learn to maneuver through the social services system. Factors like the ""youth culture"" orientation from the early sixties, the coming of age of the minority baby boom generation, and the changes in families being experienced by minority communities have combined to erode the status of the respected elders in culturally diverse communities. The effects of assimilation and acculturation are important indicators in understanding the past and future potential of minority elders to be political players."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=15906509&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	303	Generations		398	rivas,edgar.e	rivas	edgar.e	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. Academic centers. Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less. The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=14161231&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		377	studenski,stephanie	studenski	stephanie	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Six-hundred and sixty-five participants (596 elders with disabilities, 69 adults with disabilities) from Northern Florida, Southern California, and Western New York were surveyed through face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, or mailed surveys. The survey addressed satisfaction, importance, frequency of use, methods for learning, barriers to use, views on features, and ways the cell phone had helped. The majority of elders (60%) valued their cell phone, and a large proportion (87%) use the cell phone for emergencies. Only one third of elders reported using their cell phone daily. Suggestions for improving phone design included increasing button size (50% of subjects), increasing display size (29% of subjects), increasing overall size of the cell phone (24% subjects), and decreasing the complexity of the phone.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=13857294&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	381	Technology & Disability		381	mann,william.c	mann	william.c	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
359	360	Using Information Technology To Improve The Health Care Of Older Adults.	2003	384	10.7326/0003-4819-139-5_Part_2-200309021-00010			247	139.0	5.0	430	The high burden of illness and frailty common among our growing population of older adults often results in fragmentation of care across providers and health care systems, increasing the complexity and costs of caring for these patients. Information technology offers one way to meet this challenge. Scientists at the Regenstrief Institute have more than a quarter-century of experience in using medical informatics to support clinicians in the day-to-day care of older adults. Their research has progressed through several evolutionary cycles, beginning with the acquisition of relevant data and moving to studies of the most efficient and effective mechanisms that bring information to bear at the time of clinical decision making. Information technology designed with the input of the end user has the greatest promise of changing provider behavior because it balances technological challenges with the cultural context of the practice environment. One topic of active research is information technology to support transitions of care among sites and providers. These transitions place older adults at increased risk for avoidable illness, death, and health care costs. Information systems that improve communication among providers during these transitions have the potential to improve safety and reduce costs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=10802937&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	247	Annals of Internal Medicine		384	weiner,michael	weiner	michael	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
365	366	Evaluation Of An Inter-Organizational Prevention Program Against Injuries Among The Elderly In A Who Safe Community.	2001	391	10.1016/S0033-3506(01)00468-1			391	115.0	5.0	308	The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of a participatory community-based prevention program against injuries among the elderly. A population-based quasi-experimental design was used with pre- and post-implementation measurements in an intervention and a control area. The program was based on cross-sectoral participation in detecting and taking action against injuries among the elderly. Change in the relative risk of injury was estimated by the odds ratio. Morbidity in moderately (AIS 2) severe injury in the study area was reduced from 46 per 1000 population years to 25 per 1000 population years (odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.46â€“0.65), while the minor (AIS 1) injuries increased (odds ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval 1.21â€“1.91). The risk of severe or fatal (AIS 3â€“6) injuries remained constant. In the study area, only a slight decrease in the total morbidity rate was observed (odds ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.77â€“0.99). In the control area, there was no evident change in the total morbidity rates. Falls decreased or showed a tendency to decrease in the age groups 65 to 79-y-old in the study area, while they increased in the older age group. The results indicate that no sharp boundaries should be drawn between safety education, physical conditioning, environmental adjustments and secondary prevention measures when planning safety promotion among the elderly. Future studies should address these issues along with the methodological complexity associated with assessment of participatory community-based safety promotion programs.Public Health (2001) 115, 308â€“316.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=8910271&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	391	Public Health (Nature)		391	lindqvist,k	lindqvist	k	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The story takes place in a small New England town through one year: fall to summer. The plot involves daily events in the lives of several characters who represent various ages and psychosocial development. The tasks of adolescence, middle age, and old age are eloquently described in the motivation and experience of Sarton's characters. Youth, middle - aged, and elders play out their lives, but it is the elder characters who represent the richest opportunity to examine the struggle for integrity, inner life, gender shift, and meaning. As a text for the study of gerontology from a human development perspective, Kinds of Love demonstrates the sweep of growth and change that are made up in intricate day - to - day tasks, decisions, and quiet ruminations. The narrative, complexity of characters, and environmental context illuminate an array of developmental movements. When analyzed within Eriksonian, constructive developmental, and relational frameworks, the novel allows readers to study the nature of human change over time. This article explores psychosocial theory and research which are found in classroom reading of Kinds of Love by May Sarton.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=2015315&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	192	Educational Gerontology		395	wolf,mary.alice	wolf	mary.alice	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

Using data from the study Evaluating  Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or  mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales  receiving community care services, this investigation examines three  crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction  with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also  two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction  with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination  of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their  association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction.  This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each  characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each  satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant  effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping  warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with  reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work  involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction  was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life  satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its  dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently  satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below  average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from  this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and  suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need  to...	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=5895144&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1.0	392	chesterman,john	chesterman	john		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

It is unpleasant and distressing and can affect functioning and quality of life. Fatigue also may inhibit an older person from participating optimally in a physical therapy program aimed at rehabilitation or the promotion of better health. However, confusion surrounds the concept of self-reported aging-related fatigue, not only because of the complexity of the problem itself but also because of lack of clarity of definition and the use of the term ""fatigue"" to describe a range of different concepts. This article aims to provide clarification of the concept in the context of physical therapist clinical practice. The intention is to increase awareness of the issue among physical therapists, promoting their assessment and consideration of the problem when planning health interventions involving functioning, physical activity, and exercise for older people."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=90533177&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	281	Physical Therapy		314	egerton,thorlene	egerton	thorlene	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
235	236	Gender Differences In The Incidence And Determinants Of Components Of The Frailty Phenotype Among Older Adults: Findings From The Sabe Study.	2018	242	10.1177/0898264316671228			242	30.0	2.0	190	Objective: To analyze gender differences in incidence and determinants of the components of the frailty phenotype. Method: A total of 1,413 older adults were selected in 2006. To estimate the incidence of each frailty component, only individuals who did not exhibit a given component at baseline (independently of the presence of other components) were included in the study. The variables of interest were socioeconomic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric factors and physical performance. The incidence of each component in 2010 was the outcome. Results: Unintentional weight loss and slowness were more incident in men up to 74 years of age. The other frailty components were more incident in women at all age groups, except weakness. Besides age, the determinants of incidence of the components of frailty were different between genders. Discussion: Strategies for preventing or delaying the installation of frailty need to address gender differences, considering the greater complexity in the network determinants among women.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=127118166&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	242	Journal of Aging & Health		242	alexandre,tiago.da.s	alexandre	tiago.da.s	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
236	237	Multimorbidity: Will It Stand The Test Of Time?	2018	243	10.1093/ageing/afx159			161	47.0	1.0	6	The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical problems. However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and researchers.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=127189162&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	161	Age & Ageing		243	ford,joanna.c	ford	joanna.c	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
237	238	Simple Method Of Screening For Frailty In Older Adults Using A Chronometer And Tape Measure In Clinic.	2018	244	10.1111/jgs.15204			144	66.0	1.0	157	Objectives: Detecting frailty in older adults scheduled for surgery is important to predict the occurrence of adverse outcomes, but because of its complexity, frailty screening is not commonly performed. The objective of the current study was to assess whether frailty can be screened for using automatically measured usual gait speed (UGS) and midâ€arm circumference (MAC) in the outpatient clinic. Design: Prospective, crossâ€sectional study. Setting: Geriatric center of a tertiary hospital. Participants: Outpatients aged 65 and older (N = 113). Measurements: Frailty status was evaluated according to a multidimensional frailty score (MFS) using a comprehensive geriatric assessment, and participants were classified into 5 categories. UGS was evaluated by having participants walk through the clinic using an automated laserâ€gated chronometer. MAC was recorded using a tape measure on a blood pressure cuff. Correlations between these two physical measurements and MFS were assessed. Results: The mean age of the 93 participants who successfully underwent UGS evaluation was 75.8 Â± 4.7; 35 were male. In this population, the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2.2 Â± 1.4, mean MFS was 4.1 Â± 2.0, and 20 participants were considered to be at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Mean UGS was 0.75 Â± 0.16 m/s, and mean MAC was 31.2 Â± 1.9 cm); both physical parameters were correlated with MFS (UGS: standardized beta = âˆ’0.420, <italic>P</italic> < .001; MAC: standardized beta = âˆ’0.457, <italic>P</italic> < .001). Using UGS and MFS, the area under curve of receiver operating curve for determining which participants were at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes was 0.809 (<italic>P</italic> < .001). Conclusion: UGS and MAC are viable methods of clinically screening for frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=127501174&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		244	jung,heeâ€won	jung	heeâ€won	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
249	250	Biological Aging And The Future Of Geriatric Psychiatry.	2017	256	10.1093/gerona/glw241			210	72.0	3.0	343	Advances in understanding the biological bases of aging have intellectually revitalized the field of geriatric psychiatry and broadened its scope to include promoting successful aging and studying resilience factors in older adults. To describe the process by which this paradigm shift has occurred and illustrate its implications for treatment and research of late-life brain disorders, late-life depression is discussed as a prototype case. Prior phases of geriatric psychiatry research were focused on achieving depressive symptom relief, outlining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between older and younger adults, and identifying moderators of treatment response. Building on this work, current geriatric psychiatry researchers have begun to disentangle the etiologic complexity in late-life depression by focusing on the causative aging-related processes involved, identifying both neurobiological and behavioral intermediates, and finally delineating depression subtypes that are distinguishable by their underlying biology and the treatment approach required. In this review, we discuss several age-related processes that are critical to the development of late-life mood disorders, outline implications of these processes for the clinical evaluation and management of later-life psychiatric disorders, and finally put forth suggestions for better integrating aging and developmental processes into the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=121304393&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		256	rutherford,bret.r	rutherford	bret.r	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

In this study, we explore this through eight focus groups with different professionals involved in the field of elder abuse and older persons themselves and in interviews with 35 experts in the field. Our findings show that dependency, vulnerability, power and control, social isolation, stress, and care burden play a central role in their explanations for the occurrence of violence in later life. The role of a history of violence in violence in later life is equivocal. The complexity and ambiguity of dependency and vulnerability, the notion of mutual dependency, and diverse attitudes and expectations toward them that arise with the aging process are distinct features of violence in later life that were found.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=118518656&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	264	Journal of Interpersonal Violence		264	mysyuk,yuliya	mysyuk	yuliya	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
232	233	Geriatric Oral And Maxillofacial Dysfunctions In The Context Of Geriatric Syndrome.	2018	239	10.1111/odi.12647			239	24.0	3.0	317	Objectives: To propose the application of the concept of geriatric syndrome for common geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions and to suggest the necessity of developing effective evaluation methods for oral and maxillofacial frailty. Design: The concepts of frailty and geriatric syndrome based on multiâ€morbidity and polypharmacy were applied to five common geriatric oral medicinal dysfunctional problems: salivary gland hypofunction (dry mouth), chronic oral mucosal pain disorders (burning mouth symptoms), taste disorders (taste disturbances), swallowing disorders (dysphagia), and oral and maxillofacial movement disorders (oromandibular dyskinesia and dystonia). Results: Each of the dysfunctions is caused by various kinds of diseases and/or conditions and medications, thus the concept of geriatric syndrome could be applied. These dysfunctions, suggested as components of oral and maxillofacial geriatric syndrome, are associated and interacted with each other in a complexity of vicious cycle. The resulting functional impairments caused by this syndrome can cause oral and maxillofacial frailty. Conclusions: Geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions could be better appreciated in the context of geriatric syndrome. The development of effective methods for evaluating the severity of these dysfunctions and the resulting frailty is essential.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=128483337&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	239	Oral Diseases		239	nam,y	nam	y	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
219	220	An International Perspective On Chronic Multimorbidity: Approaching The Elephant In The Room.	2018	225	10.1093/gerona/glx178			210	73.0	10.0	1350	Multimorbidity is a common and burdensome condition that may affect quality of life, increase medical needs, and make people live more years of life with disability. Negative outcomes related to multimorbidity occur beyond what we would expect from the summed effect of single conditions, as chronic diseases interact with each other, mutually enhancing their negative effects, and eventually leading to new clinical phenotypes. Moreover, multimorbidity mirrors an accelerated global susceptibility and a loss of resilience, which are both hallmarks of aging. Due to the complexity of its assessment and definition, and the lack of clear evidence steering its management, multimorbidity represents one of the main current challenges for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The authors of this article recently reflected on these issues during two twin international symposia at the 2016 European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS) meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, and the 2016 Gerontological Society of America (GSA) meeting in New Orleans, USA. The present work summarizes the most relevant aspects related to multimorbidity, with the ultimate goal to identify knowledge gaps and suggest future directions to approach this condition.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=131785319&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		225	vetrano,davide.l	vetrano	davide.l	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
216	217	Tools For Deprescribing In Frail Older Persons And Those With Limited Life Expectancy: A Systematic Review.	2019	221	10.1111/jgs.15616			144	67.0	1.0	172	OBJECTIVES To summarize available tools that can assist clinicians in identifying and reducing or stopping (deprescribing) potentially inappropriate medications and that specifically consider frailty or limited life expectancy. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. SETTING We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL from inception to December 2017, along with grey literature. We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications. PARTICIPANTS Frail older persons and older persons with limited life expectancy. MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of tools. RESULTS: We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medicationâ€specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, stepâ€wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in very lowâ€quality studies). CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use.

218	219	Spousal Caregivers' Experiences Of Participation In Everyday Life When Living In Shifting Contexts.	2018	224	10.1080/11038128.2017.1337810			224	25.0	6.0	457	Background: To promote health and well-being, and to meet the desires of the growing elderly population to age in place, elderly spousal caregivers need adequate support such as respite care services. More knowledge is needed about elderly spousal caregivers' experiences in relation to participation, which is an aspect of health that remains relatively unexplored for this group. Aim: To explore and describe how elderly spousal caregivers experience and discuss participation in everyday life when living in shifting contexts due to the use of respite care. Method: A grounded theory approach was used during data generation and analysis, which involved repeated focus group interviews with 12 spousal caregivers. Results: Complexity and ambiguity was understood to imbue participation in everyday life. Being in charge of everyday life was challenging for spousal caregivers, and created a need for personal time. Respite care and home care service gave them time, although when interacting with social contexts other issues arose that influenced their own recovery. Conclusions: A holistic 'situation centered' approach that focuses on the elderly couple's life story and needs might capture a wider perspective and enable adequate support that influences their health, well-being, and participation in everyday life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=134622354&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	224	Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy		224	riekkola,carabante.jenni	riekkola	carabante.jenni	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

230	231	The Use Of Case Management For Communityâ€Dwelling Older People: The Effects On Loneliness, Symptoms Of Depression And Life Satisfaction In A Randomised Controlled Trial.	2018	237	10.1111/scs.12520			170	32.0	2.0	889	Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for communityâ€dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A twoâ€armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated followâ€ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: â‰¥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more selfâ€reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intentionâ€toâ€treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intentionâ€toâ€treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the followâ€ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=130361902&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1.0	237	taube,elin	taube	elin		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=115736727&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	10	Nursing Older People	1.0	270	north,chris	north	chris		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
274	275	The Role Of Micrornas In Cellular Senescence And Age-Related Conditions Of Cartilage And Bone.	2015	286	10.3109/17453674.2014.957079			286	86.0	1.0	92	Background and purpose - We reviewed the current state of research on microRNAs in age-related diseases in cartilage and bone. Methods - PubMed searches were conducted using separate terms to retrieve articles on (1) the role of microRNAs on aging and tissue degeneration, (2) specific microRNAs that influence cellular and organism senescence, (3) microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions, and (4) the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions. Results - An increasing number of studies have identified microRNAs associated with cellular aging and tissue degeneration. Specifically in regard to frailty, microRNAs have been found to influence the onset and course of age-related musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and posttraumatic arthritis. Both intracellular and extracellular microRNAs may be suitable to function as diagnostic biomarkers. In particular Interpretation - The research data currently available suggest that microRNAs play an important role in orchestrating age-related processes and conditions of the musculoskeletal system. Further research may help to improve our understanding of the complexity of these processes at the cellular and extracellular level. The option to develop microRNA biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents for the degenerating diseases of bone and cartilage appears to be promising.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=100576970&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	286	Acta Orthopaedica		286	weilner,sylvia	weilner	sylvia	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
291	292	Influence Of Frailty-Related Diagnoses, High-Risk Prescribing In Elderly Adults, And Primary Care Use On Readmissions In Fewer Than 30 Days For Veterans Aged 65 And Older.	2014	306	10.1111/jgs.12656			144	62.0	2.0	291	Objectives To determine the effect of two variables not previously studied in the readmissions literature (frailty-related diagnoses and high-risk medications in the elderly ( HRME)) and one understudied variable (volume of primary care visits in the prior year). Design Retrospective cohort study using data from a study designed to examine outcomes associated with inappropriate prescribing in elderly adults. Setting All Veterans Affairs ( VA) facilities with acute inpatient beds in fiscal year 2006 ( FY06). Participants All veterans aged 65 and older by October 1, 2005, who received VA care at least once per year between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, and were hospitalized at least once during FY06 on a medical or surgical unit. Measurements A generalized linear interactive risk prediction model included demographic and clinical characteristics (mental health and chronic medical conditions, frailty-related diagnoses, number of medications) in FY05; incident HRME in FY06 before index hospitalization or readmission; chronic HRME in FY05; and FY05 emergency department ( ED), hospital, geriatric, palliative, or primary care use. Facility-level variables were complexity, rural versus urban, and FY06 admission rate. Results The mean adjusted readmission rate was 18.3%. The new frailty-related diagnoses variable is a risk factor for readmission in addition to Charlson comorbidity score. Incident HRME use was associated with lower rates of readmission, as were higher numbers of primary care visits in the prior year. Conclusion Frailty-related diagnoses may help to target individuals at higher risk of readmission to receive more-intensive care transition services. HRME use does not help in this targeting. A higher number of face-to-face primary care visits in the prior year, unlike ED and hospital use, correlates with fewer readmissions and may be another avenue for targeting prevention strategies.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=94396668&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		306	pugh,jacqueline.a	pugh	jacqueline.a	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
294	295	Wading In The Water: A Case Study Approach To Engaging More Fully In The Patient Narrative.	2014	309	10.2190/IL.22.1.c			309	22.0	1.0	11	"Working in the patient narrative has become a familiar part of the common language used in the context of caring for patients. Working in the patient narrative encompasses sharing conversation that allows exploration of the entire patient experience as it relates to health and illness. However, the complexity of engaging in end-of-life conversations, standing steady with conflict, remaining present, maintaining neutrality, and actively listening remain challenging concepts in practice even though they are integral to effectively doing so. Literature review has identified and defined key elements of interactions that can lead to significant opportunities to ""wander more fully"" in the patient narrative. Two case studies reviewed therein demonstrate ways in which palliative care encounters and end-of-life discussions afford the interdisciplinary team members purposeful engagement with patients. One case discusses taking risks to delve more deeply into patient's fears related to dying. This exploration lays the foundation for assuring goals of care are aligned with individual patient values. The other case demonstrates the use of symbols to share dialog related to an individual's tasks of dying. When directed, intentional facilitation occurs, the patient's unique holistic needs and values are identified, and goals of care can be clarified. In conclusion, highlights of research and clinical applications provide advantageous practice implications."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=94450827&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	309	Illness, Crisis & Loss		309	tadel,patrice.m	tadel	patrice.m	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
262	263	Factors Related To Falls, Weight-Loss And Pressure Ulcers - More Insight In Risk Assessment Among Nursing Home Residents.	2016	272	10.1111/jocn.13154			267	25.0		940	Aims and objectives To describe how the included items in three different scales, Downton Fall Risk Index, the short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment and the Modified Norton Scale are associated to severe outcomes as falls, weight loss and pressure ulcers. Background Falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are common adverse events among nursing home residents and risk scoring are common preventive activities, mainly focusing on single risks. In Sweden the three scales are routinely used together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention. Design Longitudinal quantitative study. Methods Descriptive analyses and Cox regression analyses. Results Only 4% scored no risk for any of these serious events. Longitudinal risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating increased risks. This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general condition. There were no statistical significant differences between residents categorised at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of general health were most important. Conclusions Risk tendencies for falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are high in nursing homes, and when measure them at the same time the majority will have several of these risks. Items assessing mobility or items affecting mobility were of most importance. Care processes can always be improved and this study can add to the topic. Relevance to clinical practice A more comprehensive view is needed and prevention can not only be based on total scores. Mobility is an important factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both as a risk factor and a protective factor. This involves a challenge for care - to keep the inmates physical active and at the same time prevent falls.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=113877007&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	267	Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1.0	272	lannering,christina	lannering	christina		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
271	272	Failing To Focus On Healthy Aging: A Frailty Of Our Discipline?	2015	32	10.1111/jgs.13512			144	63.0	7.0	1459	The academic geriatrics community has provided outstanding leadership in addressing frailty and complexity in older adults, but a minority of older adults are frail. Although resources to treat older adults are limited, and it is appropriate to focus clinical efforts on those with frailty and multimorbidity, there is also important expertise that can be brought to bear on the health of ALL older adults. A review of the literature suggests that attention to healthy or successful aging has failed to keep pace with the focus on frailty. By providing leadership to promote successful aging, the quality of life of older adults across the spectrum can be improved and transitions to frailty reduced. The template that leaders have established in understanding frailty-defining and operationalizing it, understanding outcomes, identifying pathophysiology-can be used as an approach to successful aging. Several community-based programs have been successful in promoting successful aging. These are potentially highly scalable and could have a substantial effect on the aging population, but their essential components need to be better understood. The geriatrics community is uniquely positioned to take on this role. This is a critical time to work together to make the lives of all older adults as healthy and fulfilling as possible.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=108426343&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		32	friedman,susan.m	Friedman	Susan M	Y	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The complexity of this demand is also changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=102901173&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0.0	284	Nursing Management - UK	1.0	284	thompson,deborah	thompson	deborah		0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
