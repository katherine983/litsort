The aim of the study was to evaluate Palliative Needs and other conditions such as fragility, complexity, and prognosis and also to suggest new indicators for the establishment of the resident's advanced chronic condition. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 149 nursing homes Complex Chronic residents evaluated by trained professionals. Palliative Care Needs, assessed by the NECPAL ICO-CCOMS (c) tool, and fragility, case and palliative complexity and prognosis were evaluate through a comprehensive assessment. Descriptive analyses and association measures were performed setting the statistical significance at 0.05. Results: More than 50% of the residents had positive Surprise Question and other Palliative Needs and were classified as Advanced Chronic Patients. Distress and/or Severe Adaptative Disorder was the most frequent need shown by the residents and significant differences in levels of frailty and other characteristics, were found between the Positive and the Negative Surprise Question Groups. Statistically significant correlations were also found between aspects of both groups. Conclusions: Nursing homes residents show Palliative Needs regardless of the response to the Surprise Question of the NECPAL tool. Other characteristics such as presence of an intermediate level of frailty are suggested as a new perspective to identify advanced chronic patients among nursing homes residents.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1660-4601		WOS:000639190800001	33808567

Background Older people with aged natural dentition require preventive and curative oral health care. An intervention based on principles of situated learning was implemented to establish closer cooperation between dental and nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to improved oral hygiene in nursing home residents. Design An embedded multiple-case study combined with principles of realist evaluation unfolded in three phases: Formulation of initial programme theory, Testing and Refining the programme theory. The COREQ checklist is followed in reporting. Methods Observations, six group interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with dentists, dental practitioners, nursing home managers, care professionals and residents were conducted in three nursing homes (n = 41). Results Three main outcomes of a programme theory were identified, relating to (a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) interdisciplinary working, in the form of professional pride in performing sufficient oral care; (c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the creation of relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care professionals as well as nursing home management taking responsibility for structure, planning and knowledge sharing. Conclusion The situated learning perspective supported residents and care professionals' competencies in performing sufficient oral care. The shared oral care intervention supports an individual and multidisciplinary assessment of nursing home residents' ability to self-care concerning oral care. Contextual factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms influence the intervention's success. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the complexity within interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and unravelling the necessary properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health care are areas of improvement for care service in nursing homes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000542562300001	32533875

This reflects, in part, the frailty and vulnerability of older people living in care homes but has also, in part, been a consequence of the failure to include care homes in the systematic planning of a response to COVID, as well as a measure of neglect of standards and quality improvement in the sector. In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies in 2015. The standards consisted of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in nursing homes as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. The gravity of the concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as emerging insights on care improvement in nursing homes indicate that an update of these medical standards is timely. This was performed by the writing group from the original 2015 guidelines and is intended as an interim measure pending a more formal review incorporating a systematic review of emerging literature and a Delphi process.Key summary pointsAim The gravity of concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic mandates urgent review of medical standards for nursing homes. Findings Physicians providing medical care to nursing home residents should have a formal competence in geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry. Message The coordination of the broad range of complexities of care in nursing homes requires clearly specified clinical leadership commensurate with the range of services needed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1878-7649	1878-7657		WOS:000541013000001	32557250

Aims The aim of this study was (1) to design a multi-component training program which improves physical functioning and psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of this intervention in nursing home residents. Methods This study is a two-arm, stratified-randomized controlled feasibility trail. Twenty-four nursing home residents (aged 83.7 +/- 6.4, 21 women) were divided into an intervention and a waiting-list control group. The intervention group completed a multi-component training (including dual-task, dynamic balance, endurance and strength exercises) for 16 weeks (twice per week for 45-60 min). Primary outcomes were lower extremity functionality (SPPB), gait performance (GAITRite), health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as life satisfaction (SWLS). Results Life satisfaction (SWLS) and physical functioning (SPPB) increased in the intervention group after training whereas the control group showed a decrease. Gait parameters could only be analyzed forn = 5 participants of the intervention group andn = 2 of the control group and showed no time differences for the intervention group. The mean number of participants was 12.5 +/- 1.9 per session (attendance ranged between 66% and 90%). Conclusion A multi-component training seems (1) to lead to clinically relevant improvements in physical functioning as well as in psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to be feasible and well accepted in nursing home residents. Nevertheless, the complexity and progression of the program as well as the testing protocol have to be adapted. Further research should test the effectiveness of this adapted program in a larger sample size.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1594-0667	1720-8319		WOS:000540189800001	32537707

Understanding their needs and their use of resources is essential. The main objective of the study is to identify persons who are likely to enter residential care based upon their needs and resource utilization, so that care providers can plan interventions effectively and optimize services and resources to meet the persons' needs.MethodsThis is a longitudinal quasi-experimental study. The data consists of primary data from the community setting collected every six months during the period of 2010-2016. Interventions had the goal of keeping older people longer at home. Participants were at least 65years old and were living in the community. The interRAI Resource Utilization Group system (RUG-III) was used to calculate the case-mix indexes (CMI) of all participants. Comparisons were made between the case-mix of those who were still living at home and those who were admitted into residential care at follow-up.ResultsA total of 10,289 older persons participated in the study (81.27.1yrs., 69.1% female). From this population, 853 participants (8.3%) were admitted into residential care. The CMI of the persons receiving night care at home were the highest (1.6 at baseline and 1.7 at the entry point of residential care), followed by persons receiving occupational therapy (1.5 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care) and persons enrolled in case management interventions with rehabilitation (1.4 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care). The CMIs at follow-up were significantly higher than at baseline and the linear regression model showed that admission to residential care was a significant factor in the model.Conclusions The study showed that the RUG-III system offers possibilities for identifying persons at risk of institutionalization. Interventions designed to avoid early nursing home admission can make use of the RUG-III system to optimize care planning and the allocation of services and resources. Based on the RUG-III case-mix, resources can be allocated to keep older persons at home longer, bearing in mind the complexity of care and the availability of services in the community.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1471-2318		WOS:000540246300004	32503445

In total, 242 residents taking >= 1 medication regularly were included. Opportunities for simplification among participants at 4 RACFs were identified using the validated Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE (MRS GRACE). Simplification was possible for 62 of 99 residents in the intervention arm. Significant reductions in the mean number of daily medication administration times were observed at 8 months (-0.38, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.69 to -0.07) and 12 months (-0.47, 95%CI -0.84 to -0.09) in the intervention compared to the comparison arm. A higher incidence of falls was observed in the intervention arm (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.20, 95%CI 1.33 to 3.63) over 12-months, which was primarily driven by a high falls rate in one intervention RACF and a simultaneous decrease in comparison RACFs. No significant differences in hospitalizations (IRR 1.78, 95%CI 0.57-5.53) or mortality (relative risk 0.81, 95%CI 0.48-1.38) over 12 months were observed. Medication simplification achieves sustained reductions in medication administration times and should be implemented using a structured resident-centered approach that incorporates clinical judgement.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2077-0383		WOS:000531821000160	32276360

Multiple factors to consider when managing diabetes in the advancing age are risk of hypoglycemia, polypharmacy and assessment of functional status, cognitive impairment, depression, and fall risk. Therefore, it is important to individualize glycemia targets to optimize blood glucose levels while considering these factors and life expectancy. A multidisciplinary team approach with health care professionals in a primary care setting, Endocrinologists, Nutritionists, Diabetes Educators and mental health counselors is essential for the education, prevention, and individualized diabetic treatment plan in the elderly population.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2405-7991			WOS:000519093000014

The association of this score with in-hospital mortality was not investigated before. Having this information is relevant to define evidence-based criteria that hospital administrators can use to allocate nursing workforce according to the real and current patients' need for nursing care. The aim of this study is to assess the association between complexity of nursing care and in-hospital mortality.MethodsRegister-based cohort study on all patients admitted to acute medical wards of a middle-large hospital in the North of Italy between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015 and followed up to discharge. Out of all the eligible 7247 records identified in the Hospital Discharge Register, 6872 records from 5129 patients have been included. A multivariable frailty Cox model was adopted to estimate the association between the Informative System of Nursing Performance score, both as continuous variable and dichotomized as low (score<50) or high (score<greater than or equal to>50), and in-hospital mortality adjusting for several factors recorded at admission (age, gender, type of admission unit, type of access and Charlson Comorbidity Index).ResultsThe median age of the 5129 included patients was 76 [first-third quartiles 64-84] and 2657(52%) patients were males. Over the 6872 admissions, there were 395 in-hospital deaths among 2922 patients at high complexity of nursing care (13.5%) and 74/3950 (1.9%) among those at low complexity leading to a difference of 11.6% (95% CI: 10.3-13.0%). Adjusting by relevant confounders, the hazard rate of mortality in the first 10days from admission resulted 6 times significantly higher in patients at high complexity of nursing care with respect to patients at low complexity (hazard ratio, HR 6.58, 95%CI: 4.50;9.62, p<0.001). The HR was lower after 10days from admission but still significantly higher than 1. By considering the continuous score, the association was confirmed.ConclusionComplexity of nursing care is strongly associated to in-hospital mortality of acute patients admitted to medical departments. It predicts in-hospital mortality better than widely used indicators, such as comorbidity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1472-6963		WOS:000519059200010	32143625

General practitioners (GP) are particularly important in this context: they provide patients with low-threshold primary care close to their homes and provide both general palliative care and geriatric services. Objective What are the challenges for GPs in caring for frail older patients at the end of their lives? Material and methods A secondary data analysis of 52 qualitative interviews was carried out, which were serially obtained at 4 points in time over a period of 18 months with 14 family doctors. In addition, one focus group with five GPs took place. The analysis was carried out according to the principles of grounded theory. Results The results show that GPs see the care of frail older patients at the end of their lives through a) the growing number of older people, b) multimorbidity and complexity of the problem areas, c) the integration of geriatric and palliative approaches, d) the high average age of general practitioners and the lack of junior staff and e) the problem of ensuring care in rural areas as a major challenge. The practical transition between geriatric and palliative care is considered by GPs to be fluid and there is a desire for more integration of both disciplines. Conclusion In this study GPs perceived a large overlap between geriatric and palliative care. Both approaches should be offered for a selection of patients as a combined service. In the future a systematic network between GPs and geriatricians in practices, clinics, and day clinics will be necessary.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0948-6704	1435-1269		WOS:000566054900001	31828367

Although person-centred care has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons.AimThe aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home.MethodsA descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative thematic analysis.ResultsThe findings indicate that the attributes of person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions.ConclusionThe nurses' attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included in education and training.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000494120600001	31642182

Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant. Methods The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant. Discussion The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1471-2318		WOS:000479243100003	31382880	
J	Bethea, Audis; Samanta, Damayanti; White, Teresa; Payne, Nancy; Hardway, Jessica								Nurse Practitioners' Role in Improving Service for Elderly Trauma Patients								JOURNAL OF TRAUMA NURSING				26	4			174	179		10.1097/JTN.0000000000000445				JUL-AUG 2019	2019	Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort 4.38 +/- 3.54 vs. 5.60 +/- 3.98, p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 +/- $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 +/- $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current practice model.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1078-7496	1932-3883		WOS:000480716300003	31283744

As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital.Methods: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis.Results: Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role.Conclusions: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.									3	0	0	0	0	1	4			1472-6963			WOS:000464839800001	30971236

Sullivan, Suzanne S./0000-0003-3064-6884			Mortality Risk in Homebound Older Adults Predicted From Routinely Collected Nursing Data								NURSING RESEARCH				68	2			156	166		10.1097/NNR.0000000000000328				MAR-APR 2019	2019	Background: Newer analytic approaches for developing predictive models provide a method of creating decision support to translate findings into practice.Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a clinically interpretable predictive model for 12-month mortality risk among community-dwelling older adults. This is done by using routinely collected nursing assessment data to aide homecare nurses in identifying older adults who are at risk for decline, providing an opportunity to develop care plans that support patient and family goals for care.Methods: A retrospective secondary analysis of Medicare and Medicaid data of 635,590 Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-C) start-of-care assessments from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, was linked to the Master Beneficiary Summary File (2012-2013) for date of death. The decision tree was benchmarked against gold standards for predictive modeling, logistic regression, and artificial neural network (ANN). The models underwent k-fold cross-validation and were compared using area under the curve (AUC) and other data science metrics, including Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).Results: Decision tree variables associated with 12-month mortality risk included OASIS items: age, (M1034) overall status, (M1800-M1890) activities of daily living total score, cancer, frailty, (M1410) oxygen, and (M2020) oral medication management. The final models had good discrimination: decision tree, AUC = .71, 95% confidence interval (CI) [. 705, .712], sensitivity = .73, specificity = .58, MCC = .31; ANN, AUC = .74, 95% CI [. 74,.74], sensitivity = .68, specificity = .68, MCC = .35; and logistic regression, AUC = .74, 95% CI [.735, .742], sensitivity = .64, specificity = .70, MCC = .35.Discussion: The AUC and 95% CI for the decision tree are slightly less accurate than logistic regression and ANN; however, the decision tree was more accurate in detecting mortality. The OASIS data set was useful to predict 12-month mortality risk. The decision tree is an interpretable predictive model developed from routinely collected nursing data that may be incorporated into a decision support tool to identify older adults at risk for death.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0029-6562	1538-9847		WOS:000461444300431	30531348

The SIMPLER study recruited 242 residents with at least one medication charted for regular administration from 8 RACFs in South Australia. Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Dementia severity was assessed using the Dementia Severity Rating Scale. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL-NH scale. Dependence in ADLs was assessed using the Katz ADL scale.Results: The median age of participants was 87 years (interquartile range 81-92). Over one-third of participants (n=86, 36%) had 5 or more daily medication administration times. The number of daily administration times and MRCI scores were positively correlated with resident length of stay (r(s)=0.19; 0.27), FRAIL-NH score (r(s)=0.23; 0.34) and dependence in ADLs (r(s)=-0.21; -0.33) (all p<0.01). MRCI was weakly negatively correlated with CCI score (r(s)=-0.16; p=0.013). Neither number of daily administration times nor MRCI score were correlated with age or dementia severity. In multivariate analysis, frailty was associated with number of daily administration times (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.24) and MRCI score (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.13-1.41). Dementia severity was inversely associated with both multiple medication administration times (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99) and high MRCI score (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98).Conclusion: Residents with longer lengths of stay, more dependent in ADLs and most frail had the most complex medication regimens and, therefore, may benefit from targeted strategies to reduce medication regimen complexity.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				1178-1998		WOS:000491874500001	31695348

The patient characteristics, social environment and results of clinical practice were studied.Results: 190 patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 (59.8%) cases from the Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with dementia, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative healthcare resource (p <0.05).Conclusions: Patients presenting with advanced age, complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other patients. After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional capacity and present less polypharmacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Major amputation is often offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked deterioration of an ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced mobility, intractable pain, infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of clinical outcome data on CLI and amputation exists internationally, little is known about the patient/family-centred experience of hospitalisation to inform preservation of personhood and patient-centred care planning.DesignLongitudinal qualitative study using Heideggerian phenomenology.MethodsFourteen patients and 13 family carers provided a semistructured interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation followed, a second interview (6months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients and seven family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed.ResultsHospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of chaos, characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile body and fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift within uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation and unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages (multiple stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity).ConclusionsPatients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful decision-making in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic process occurring within a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the care complexity and burden of family advocacy.Relevance to clinical practiceA coordinated, interprofessional response should improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation scheduling and discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a sense of safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should be actively facilitated.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000444077000011	29776002

Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses.ResultsDuring the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months.ConclusionsThe use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000436254800046	28895175

Functional decline in residents 1 year after surgery was associated with decline in function in the 6 months before surgery (adjusted hazard ratio (aH)=2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.29-2.49), emergency procedures (aHR=1.37, 95% CI=1.31-1.43), older age (85 vs 65-74, aHR=1.17, 95% CI=1.11-1.23), and baseline cognitive impairment (aHR=1.15, 95% CI=1.11-1.20).CONCLUSION: Despite the low complexity of minor urological procedures, NH residents experience high mortality and many demonstrate sustained functional decline up to 1-year postoperatively.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0002-8614	1532-5415		WOS:000433585500012	29572851

To appraise this complexity, geriatricians have developed a multidimensional comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), which may be difficult to apply in primary care settings. Our primary objective was to compare the effect on morbimortality of usual care compared with two complex interventions combining educational seminars about CGA: a dedicated geriatric hotline for general practitioners (GPs) and CGA by trained nurses or GPs.Methods and analysis The Clinical Epidemiology and Ageing study is an open-label, pragmatic, multicentre, three-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial comparing two intervention groups and one control group. Patients must be 70 years or older with a long-term illness or with unscheduled hospitalisation in the past 3 months (750 patients planned). This study involves volunteering GPs practising in French primary care centres, with randomisation at the practice level. The multifaceted interventions for interventional arms comprise an educational interactive multiprofessional seminar for GPs and nurses, a geriatric hotline dedicated to GPs in case of difficulties and the performance of a CGA updated to primary care. The CGA is systematically performed by a nurse in arm 1 but is GP-led on a case-by-case basis in arm 2. The primary endpoint is a composite criterion comprising overall death, unscheduled hospitalisations, emergency admissions and institutionalisation within 12 months after inclusion. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed using mixed-effects logistic regression models, with adjustment for potential confounders.Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by an appropriate ethics committee (CPP Ile-de-France IV, Paris, France, approval April 2015; 15 664). This study is conducted according to principles of good clinical practice in the context of current care and will provide useful knowledge on the clinical benefits achievable by CGA in primary care.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-6055			WOS:000435176700177	29654038

Therefore, we examined whether a theory-based method for process description of implementation can contribute to improvement of evidence-based care. MOVIT, a Dutch project aimed at implementing integrated care for older vulnerable persons in residential care homes, was used as a case study. The project activities were defined according to implementation taxonomy and mapped in a matrix of theoretical levels and domains. Project activities mainly targeted professionals (both individual and group). A few activities targeted the organizational level, whereas none targeted the policy level, or the patient, or the social, political, and legal domains. However, the resulting changes in care delivery arrangement had consequences for professionals, patients, organizations, and the social, political, and legal domains. A structured process description of a pragmatic implementation project can help assess the fidelity and quality of the implementation, and identify relevant contextual factors for immediate adaptation and future research. The description showed that, in the MOVIT project, there was a discrepancy between the levels and domains targeted by the implementation activities and those influenced by the resulting changes in delivery arrangement. This could have influenced, in particular, the adoption and sustainability of the project.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0046-9580	1945-7243		WOS:000416002800001	29161944

However, women who experience intimate partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole.DesignMeta-ethnographic synthesis of qualitative evidence.MethodsA systematic search of PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end of December 2015.ResultsThe review identified that intimate partner violence exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice.ConclusionsThis study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service providers need to be aware of these.Relevance to clinical practiceurses and healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of abuse and this includes older women.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000405562600006	27487083

Twenty senior-living facilities were randomized to either a 3 day per week group-based ENP led by a trained facility staff member or a health education program (SAP). Participants (N = 121) completed a short physical performance battery, 400-m walk, handgrip strength test, and mini-nutrition assessment. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], insulin-like growth-factor 1 (IGF-1), and activity level were also measured. The ENP did not significantly improve physical function or nutritional status compared with the SAP. Compared with baseline, participants in the ENP engaged in 39 min less physical activity per week at 6 months. Several facility characteristics hindered implementation of the ENP. This study highlights the complexity of implementing an evidence-based program in a field setting.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1063-8652	1543-267X		WOS:000406826700015	28095099

These patients tend to be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of stay (LOS).Aim: This series review provides a description of the patient complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb amputation for peripheral arterial disease.Method: Medical records coded for major amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed.Findings: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial morbidity and 30-day mortality.Conclusion: Major amputation continues to present challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding to surgery require further investigation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1062-0303	1532-6578		WOS:000402535900002	28527727

The care of a frail elder requires an interdisciplinary team approach, yet dental professionals are often absent from these teams. As an educational intervention, dental hygiene students, in addition to providing clinical care to residents and education to staff in a LTC facility, have been participating in interdisciplinary care conferences for 4years.Methods : Nine LTC facility staff and eight students participated in two focus groups and five personal interviews to discuss their experiences of the care conferences. Narratives were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted.Results: Four major themes emerged that described the essence of the experience of involving dental professionals within interdisciplinary care conference: (i) addressing oral health, (ii) reciprocal learning, (iii) dealing with complexity and (iv) impact of collaborative care.Conclusion: Overall, students found the educational intervention to be worthwhile that allowed for the development of interdisciplinary skills and a greater understanding of dental geriatrics. The dental support in care conferences was welcomed by the staff as it facilitated a new way of exchanging knowledge and experiences so that a more holistic approach to care could be undertaken by all.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0734-0664	1741-2358		WOS:000400306000013	28168829

Culturally linked risk factors and socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare disparities, and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy (HL) and HF are less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease management, or preventative health strategies. Objective: In this systematic review, we analyzed the literature studying older Latinos with HF and limited HL. Method: We searched the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. Inclusion criteria were research studies, Latinos, HF, and HL. Results: Eight quantitative studies were identified for final review. Inadequate HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL was associated with more HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL levels and higher medical complexity. Conclusions: Nurses and advanced practice nurses serve a pivotal role improving access and understanding of health information. Before conducting intervention research affecting clinical outcomes, it is essential to describe elderly Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. Barriers identified confirm the need to alter research protocols for older adults and ensure the availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older Latinos with HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients with limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be reliable predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, and develop, implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their health.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0889-4655	1550-5049		WOS:000394459400012	26646599

The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment.Background. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity.Design. Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT).Methods. Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care.Results. Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms.Conclusions. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.									14	1	0	0	4	0	15			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000386079500019	27222059	
J	Peris-Martí, Juan F.; Fernández-Villalba, Elia; Bravo-José, Patricia; Sáez-Lleó, Carmen; García-Mina Freire, María								Reflection on the pharmaceutical service in nursing homes: understanding reality to cover needs	Reflexión sobre la prestación farmacéutica en centros sociosanitarios: entendiendo la realidad para cubrir las necesidades							Farmacia Hospitalaria				40	4			302	315		10.7399/fh.2016.40.4.10430				2016-08	2016	The increasing concern regarding chronic care, which is a consequence of the current demographic progression, and the need to decrease the costs associated with its care, places a focus on social care homes caring for highly dependent patients. Simultaneously, the residential facilities are progressing in order to care for fragile patients with increasingly complexity, even though, with some exceptions, it is in parallel with the healthcare system. Within this reality, pharmaceutical care is developing very differently in all the autonomic regions, and has become a reason for controversy. In this sense, diverse factors related with the patient care setting, but also linked to different pharmaceutical levels, make it difficult to implement a patient care model. Faced with this scenario, it seems reasonable to analyze the situation from the perspective of the healthcare requirements of the institutionalized persons in these facilities, and in terms of the patient care that we can and should provide; subsequently, and based on this, we should be able to propose the basic guidelines for developing an efficient model of pharmaceutical care integrated within this patient care setting.	La creciente preocupación por la atención a la cronicidad, consecuencia de la progresión demográfica actual, y la necesidad de disminuir los costes asociados a su cuidado, sitúa uno de sus focos en los centros de asistencia social que atienden a personas de alta dependencia. A su vez, el ámbito sociosanitario está evolucionando para atender a un paciente frágil cada vez más complejo aunque, salvo excepciones, lo hace de forma paralela al sistema de salud. Dentro de esta realidad, la prestación farmacéutica se está desarrollando de forma muy heterogénea entre las comunidades autónomas y es motivo de controversia. En este sentido, diversos factores relacionados con el ámbito asistencial, pero también con los distintos estamentos farmacéuticos, dificultan el establecimiento de un modelo asistencial. Ante esta situación, parece razonable realizar un análisis de la situación desde la perspectiva de las necesidades sanitarias de las personas institucionalizadas en estos centros y de la atención que podemos y debemos prestar para, posteriormente, ser capaces de proponer las líneas básicas sobre las que desarrollar un modelo de atención farmacéutica eficiente e integrado para este ámbito asistencial.								2	0	0	0	0	3	5			2171-8695			SCIELO:S1130-63432016000400008	27571498

In Sweden the three scales are routinely used together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention.DesignLongitudinal quantitative study.MethodsDescriptive analyses and Cox regression analyses.ResultsOnly 4% scored no risk for any of these serious events. Longitudinal risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating increased risks. This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general condition. There were no statistical significant differences between residents categorised at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of general health were most important.ConclusionsRisk tendencies for falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are high in nursing homes, and when measure them at the same time the majority will have several of these risks. Items assessing mobility or items affecting mobility were of most importance. Care processes can always be improved and this study can add to the topic.Relevance to clinical practiceA more comprehensive view is needed and prevention can not only be based on total scores. Mobility is an important factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both as a risk factor and a protective factor. This involves a challenge for care - to keep the inmates physical active and at the same time prevent falls.									10	1	0	0	2	2	12			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000372928900006	26813994

Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective. Objectives: To critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes. Methods: A review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose. Results: Five surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient. Conclusions: Historical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1463-4236	1477-1128		WOS:000369934500004	25939731

Our emphasis was on validating an index of allostasis.Method: In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes.Results: Our results supported both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social support, optimism, and hope.Conclusion: Although these results are based on a small sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and physical resources and well-being.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1360-7863	1364-6915		WOS:000363771300012	26237175	
J	Shin, So Young								Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis: An Integration of Theory of Symptom Management and Disablement Process Model								ASIAN NURSING RESEARCH				8	4			241	246		10.1016/j.anr.2014.08.004				DEC 2014	2014	To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

This type of long-term health care intervention involves contextual factors and human interactions. These underlying complex mechanisms can be usefully informed with field experts' knowledge, which are hard to make explicit. However, computer simulation has been suggested as one possible method of overcoming the difficulty of articulating such elicited qualitative views.Methods A simulation model of case management was designed using an agent-based methodology, based on the initial qualitative research material. Variables and rules of interaction were formulated into a simple conceptual framework. This model has been implemented and was used as a support for a structured discussion with experts in case management.Results The rigorous formulation provided by the agent-based methodology clarified the descriptions of the interventions and the problems encountered regarding:1 the diverse network topologies of health care actors in the project;2 the adaptation time required by the intervention;3 the communication between the health care actors;4 the institutional context;5 the organization of the care; and6 the role of the case manager and his or hers personal ability to interpret the informal demands of the frail older person.Conclusion The simulation model should be seen primarily as a tool for thinking and learning. A number of insights were gained as part of a valuable cognitive process. Computer simulation supporting field experts' elicitation can lead to better-informed decisions in the organization of complex health care interventions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1356-1294	1365-2753		WOS:000339385300035	24299258

Adult children and spouses are often the first to assume care giving responsibilities for older adults when declining function results in increased care needs. By introducing policies tailored to enabling family members to combine gainful employment with providing care for older relatives, the sustainability of the future care for older individuals in Norway is more explicitly placed on the family and informal caregivers than previously. Care recipients and informal caregivers are expected to take an active consumer role and participate in the care decision-making process. This paper aims to describe the informal caregivers' experiences of influencing decision-making at and after hospital discharge for home-bound older relatives.Methods: This paper reports findings from a follow-up study with an exploratory qualitative design. Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 19 informal caregivers of older individuals discharged from hospital in Norway. An inductive thematic content analysis was undertaken.Results: Informal caregivers take on comprehensive all-consuming roles as intermediaries between the care recipient and the health care services. In essence, the informal caregivers take the role of the active participant on behalf of their older relative. They describe extensive efforts struggling to establish dialogues with the "gatekeepers" of the health care services. Achieving the goal of the best possible care for the care recipient seem to depend on the informal caregivers having the resources to choose appropriate strategies for gaining influence over decisions.Conclusions: The care recipients' extensive frailty and increasing dependence on their families coupled with the complexity of health care services contribute to the perception of the informal caregivers' indispensable role as intermediaries. These findings accentuate the need to further discuss how frail older individuals and their informal caregivers can be supported and enabled to participate in decision-making regarding care arrangements that meet the care recipient's needs.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35				1472-6963		WOS:000339675800001	25078610

The use of an assessment of vulnerability will be essential in the development of care pathways that are based on patient and population need rather than demand.MethodsAs an example of the health needs of a vulnerable population data are presented on an oral health needs assessment within nursing and residential homes in the North West of England.FindingsThese data serve to demonstrate the challenges of the disease burden within such a population but also the complexities of commissioning and delivering services to this group of patients.ConclusionsCare pathways designed to assist such patients should consider not only prevention and treatment modalities but also the means of implementing such therapies in varying settings and utilising the whole dental team.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0734-0664	1741-2358		WOS:000331109200001	24446973

Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.									51	2	0	0	17	1	53			1099-8004	1552-4175		WOS:000324395900007	23086382

In the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated.Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers.Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design.Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands.Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (>= 70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded.Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions.Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes.Conclusions: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the protocol need special attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Elbourne, Heather Fillmore; Hominick, Kathryn; Mallery, Laurie; Rockwood, Kenneth				Rockwood, Kenneth/AAD-8951-2019				Characteristics of Patients Described as Sub-acute in an Acute Care Hospital								CANADIAN JOURNAL ON AGING-REVUE CANADIENNE DU VIEILLISSEMENT				32	2			203	208		10.1017/S0714980813000214				2013	2013	Frail older patients suffer from multiple, complex needs that often go unmet in an acute care setting. Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated "sub-acute" frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants (n = 62) required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home.									6	3	0	0	1	0	9			0714-9808	1710-1107		WOS:000320696900008	23721760

During transitions, residents frequently experience care that is delayed, unnecessary, not evidence-based, potentially unsafe, and fragmented. Furthermore, a high proportion of residents and their family caregivers report substantial unmet needs during transitions. This study is part of a program of research whose overall aim is to improve quality of care for frail older adults who reside in NHs. The purpose of this study is to identify successful transitions from multiple perspectives and to identify organizational and individual factors related to transition success, in order to inform improvements in care for frail elderly NH residents during transitions to and from acute care. Specific objectives are to:1. define successful and unsuccessful elements of transitions from multiple perspectives;2. develop and test a practical tool to assess transition success;3. assess transition processes in a discrete set of transfers in two study sites over a one year period;4. assess the influence of organizational factors in key practice locations, e.g., NHs, emergency medical services (EMS), and EDs, on transition success;and 5. identify opportunities for evidence-informed management and quality improvement decisions related to the management of NH - ED transitions.Methods/Design: This is a mixed-methods observational study incorporating an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) approach. It uses data from multiple levels (facility, care unit, individual) and sources (healthcare providers, residents, health records, and administrative databases).Discussion: Key to study success is operationalizing the IKT approach by using a partnership model in which the OPTIC governance structure provides for team decision-makers and researchers to participate equally in developing study goals, design, data collection, analysis and implications of findings. As preliminary and ongoing study findings are developed, their implications for practice and policy in study settings will be discussed by the research team and shared with study site administrators and staff. The study is designed to investigate the complexities of transitions and to enhance the potential for successful and sustained improvement of these transitions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1471-2318			WOS:000315579200001	23241360

S. EDs from 2005 to 2008.PARTICIPANTS: Individuals visiting U. S. EDs stratified according to nursing home residency.MEASUREMENTS: All ED visits by nursing home residents were identified. The demographic and clinical characteristics and ED resource utilization, length of stay, and outcomes of nursing home residents and nonresidents were compared.RESULTS: During 2005 to 2008, nursing home residents accounted for 9,104,735 of 475,077,828 U. S. ED visits (1.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-2.1%). The annualized number of ED visits by nursing home residents was 2,276,184. Most nursing home residents were older (mean age 76.7, 95% CI = 75.8-77.5), female (63.3%), and non-Hispanic white (74.8%). Nursing home residents were more likely to have been discharged from the hospital in the prior 7 days (adjusted odds ratio (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9), to present with fever (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5-2.4) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure <= 90 mmHg, aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5-2.2), and to receive diagnostic tests (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.6-2.2), imaging (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3-1.7), or procedures (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.4-1.7) in the ED. Almost half of nursing home residents visiting the ED were admitted to the hospital. Nursing home residents were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.6-2.0) and to die (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6-3.3).CONCLUSION: Nursing home residents account for more than 2.2 million ED visits annually in the United States. Nursing home residents have greater medical acuity and complexity. These observations highlight the national challenges of organizing and delivering ED care to nursing home residents in the United States.

Older adults who account for nearly 37% of all hospital discharges often need care and support of family members at the time of hospital discharge. This study examines decisions made by hospitalized older adults, families, and health care team members (HCTMs) about hospital discharge. The sample included older adults (n = 13, average age 84), family members (n = 12, average age 71), and HCTMs (n = 7, average age 47). Findings revealed the complexity of hospital discharge planning for older adults through five themes as follows: (a) home, (b) staying independent, (c) "advocating for them," (d) deciding what to tell, and (e) changing the plan.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1074-8407	1552-549X		WOS:000287587000004	21343622

Unravelling the differences between complexity and frailty in old age: findings from a constructivist grounded theory study								JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING				18	1			67	73		10.1111/j.1365-2850.2010.01630.x				FEB 2011	2011	Accessible summaryUK health policy is often concerned with meeting the needs of the increasing number of older people in society and within some of this policy the concepts 'frailty' and 'complexity' have been used interchangeably. The concepts are not seen as the same by registered nurses who work in an older people's mental health service.Frailty is generally described as a physical state leading to inevitable decline and death. There is an abundance of research into frailty, much of which has the ultimate aim of prevention of disability and reduction of health care needs. Some critics view the emphasis on frailty as an example of the way that some health staff turn old age into a problem. To date, there has been little research into complexity in either old age, in mental health, or from a nursing perspective.Nurses described complexity as a dynamic state from which there can be 'recovery' and movement back and forth.Understanding complexity is important if the needs of older people are to be met effectively. This study found that nurses share common perceptions of complexity but do not always find it easy to articulate these.AbstractUK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.									7	0	0	0	4	0	8			1351-0126	1365-2850		WOS:000286056000009	21214686

A close interaction between oncologists and geriatricians becomes necessary to (1) better evaluate the elders' health status, (2) determine their residual clinical/biological reserves, and (3) optimize the provided medical care. In fact, aggressive antineoplastic managements are often denied to older patients, possibly because of the common misconception suggesting older age and/or clinical complexity as absolute contraindications to advanced treatments.Methods: The primary aim of the presented project is to assess whether assigning a geriatrician to provide daily medical care to older cancer patients (aged 65 years and older) admitted to an oncology ward increases the number of patients eligible for a chemotherapeutic and/or surgical intervention. The project is articulated in 2 phases: (1) a retrospective phase based on analysis of data collected over the 2 years before the beginning of the study, and (2) a prospective 2-year intervention. Additional information about clinical conditions, biological parameters, adverse drug reactions, body composition, physical function, and 1-year health-related events will also be recorded.Outcomes: The combination of expertise from oncologists and geriatricians is likely to result in (1) an improved selection of candidates for interventions aimed at increasing disability-free life expectancy and/or overall survival, and (2) a more rational exclusion of patients at higher risk of toxicity or with poor prognosis. In this article, the development of an onco-geriatric unit aimed at the evaluation, management, and treatment of older women with gynecological cancer is also described.

Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is important to implement strategies for including relatives in care.Data sources.The background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into nursing homes and psychological transitions.Discussion.The concepts of transition from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will support residents and their relatives during the admission phase.Implications for nursing.Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that occurs when an older person is admitted into care.Conclusion.Improving the psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a more positive experience.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			0309-2402			WOS:000276246800022	20423358

The evidence for improving balance is somewhat conflicting because few research studies identify which balance exercises are effective. The question of how TC achieves improvements in balance remains. To promote functional independence and improve quality of life in the later years of one's life, it is important to improve balance and prevent falls in older adults. TC poses challenges related to the complexity of the practice. By reviewing the current research literature on TC focusing on balance and falls in older adults, strategies may be developed to incorporate TC to improve balance and modify the known risk factors for falling. This article also discusses potential applications and limitations of the current research.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0744-6020	1542-538X		WOS:000275956200006	20335770

Directors of geriatrics academic programs (DGAPs) at all 145 U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were asked this question as part of a winter 2007 on-line survey. The DGAPs were to indicate the types of patients who would most benefit from a geriatrician's services in three practice Situations: primary care, consultations, and care in the hospital. The survey response rate was 74.5%. There was high consensus among the DGAPs on the benefits of having a geriatrician care for the most complex and vulnerable older adults in primary care and hospital setting,,. There was slightly less consensus as to when geriatrics consultations are beneficial. The patient Subsets that were viewed as benefiting the most from, geriatric geriatrician care were aged 85 and older, frailty, sybdromes, severe functional impairment, and complexity. The results of this Survey suggest that, because of the predicted shortage of geriatricians, the DGAPs would target geriatricians to work with the most vulnerable older adults. These findings offer the beginning of a consensus statement as to the role of geriatricians in the continuum of American medical care.

This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence.Background. Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence.Methods. Forty-one female caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis.Findings. The main finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes.Conclusion and relevance to clinical practice. As the perception of violence is subjective, there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0962-1067			WOS:000255837100015	18482127

Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost as distressing as the patients' themselves do.Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with older confused patients.Methodological design and justification: Data was collected from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with older confused patients.Ethics issues and approval: A Regional Board of Research Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been changed in order to ensure confidentiality.Results: The encounter with the confused patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool.Relevance to clinical practice: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0283-9318			WOS:000251206600013	18036015	
J	Munikrishnappa, Devaraj								Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly - a geriatrician's perspective								AGING MALE				10	3			113	137		10.1080/13685530701419096				SEP 2007	2007	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality, of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.									5	0	0	0	1	1	6			1368-5538	1473-0790		WOS:000249831700001	17701657

A systematic review of predictors and screening instruments to identify older hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING				16	1			46	57		10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01579.x				JAN 2007	2007	Aims and objectives. To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated.Background. Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on healthcare costs is also high.Results. Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described.Conclusion. These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population.Relevance to clinical practice. Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.									179	5	1	0	50	5	190			0962-1067			WOS:000242965000006	17181666

The presence of 3 or more of these features is associated with adverse outcomes including falls, new or worsened function impairment, hospitalization, and death. In this article, we use the case of Mrs K to describe the challenges of recognizing frailty in clinical practice, common problems and symptoms that frail older adults experience, and approaches to these issues that clinicians may incorporate into their practices. We discuss the importance of advance care planning, provider-patient communication, and appropriate palliative care and hospice referral for frail older adults. Frailty is associated with symptomatic long-term disease, decline in function, and abbreviated survival. Therefore, when frailty is severe, delivery of palliative care focused on relief of discomfort and enhancement of quality of life is highly appropriate. The application of multidisciplinary, team-based palliative approaches and of up-to-date geriatrics knowledge is beneficial for treating these patients because of the complexity of their coexisting social, psychological, and medical needs.									62	0	0	0	16	0	63			0098-7484	1538-3598		WOS:000241827700025	17090771	
J	Cohen-Mansfield, Jiska; Lipson, Steven					Cohen-Mansfield, Jiska/0000-0003-0209-7304			To hospitalize or not to hospitalize? That is the question: An analysis of decision making in the nursing home								BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE				32	2			64	70		10.3200/BMED.32.2.64-70				SUM 2006	2006	The authors examined the processes and factors that influence physicians' decision-making processes as regarding hospitalization of nursing home residents. In a large nonprofit nursing home, 6 full-time male physicians and I female nurse practitioner completed questionnaires that described the medical decision-making process for 52 nursing home residents for whom hospitalization was considered. The questionnaire covered the following topics: medical event description, the decision-making process, considerations in making treatment decisions, and the role of advance directives. Hospitalized residents had fewer treatments considered and fewer treatments chosen than those who were not hospitalized. Residents with fractures were the most commonly hospitalized residents, whereas residents in frailer conditions, with breathing problems, and for whom the physician considered quality of life to be most important were less likely to be hospitalized. The results of this study clarify the complexity of factors affecting the decision-making process and suggest a methodology that may assist in discerning those factors in the future.									19	0	0	0	4	0	19			0896-4289			WOS:000239401300004	16903616

Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility outcomes.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0148-4834			WOS:000189031100010	14974517	
J	Tolson, D; Smith, M; Knight, P								An investigation of the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized older patients with coincidental dementia: a multi-method design								JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING				30	5			1127	1136		10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01194.x				NOV 1999	1999	The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level, The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method research.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000083384700034	10564412

However, the data indicate that effectiveness of treatment was likely attenuated by including participants with dementia.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			0031-5125			WOS:A1996UP56000047	8774040	
J	DENNEHY, MA								HANDLE WITH CARE - CONSIDERATIONS AND APPROACHES TO NURSING THE FRAIL OLDER PERSON								TOPICS IN GERIATRIC REHABILITATION				11	2			44	54						DEC 1995	1995	As society ages, a challenge is presented to health care providers. The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0882-7524	1550-2414		WOS:A1995TF62200007

Home care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A major theme identified was ''Circles of Care.'' Grounded in rural culture. the circles assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			0161-9268			WOS:A1994MX44100005	8203828
