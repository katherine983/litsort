A New Approach to the Identification of Palliative Care Needs and Advanced Chronic Patients among Nursing Home Residents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						palliative care; chronic patient; nursing homes; palliative needs; elderly; residents; advanced chronicity; frailty; complexity; prognosis		Background: Proper planning of Palliative Care in nursing homes requires advanced knowledge of the care needs that residents show. The aim of the study was to evaluate Palliative Needs and other conditions such as fragility, complexity, and prognosis and also to suggest new indicators for the establishment of the resident's advanced chronic condition. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 149 nursing homes Complex Chronic residents evaluated by trained professionals. Palliative Care Needs, assessed by the NECPAL ICO-CCOMS (c) tool, and fragility, case and palliative complexity and prognosis were evaluate through a comprehensive assessment. Descriptive analyses and association measures were performed setting the statistical significance at 0.05. Results: More than 50% of the residents had positive Surprise Question and other Palliative Needs and were classified as Advanced Chronic Patients. Distress and/or Severe Adaptative Disorder was the most frequent need shown by the residents and significant differences in levels of frailty and other characteristics, were found between the Positive and the Negative Surprise Question Groups. Statistically significant correlations were also found between aspects of both groups. Conclusions: Nursing homes residents show Palliative Needs regardless of the response to the Surprise Question of the NECPAL tool. Other characteristics such as presence of an intermediate level of frailty are suggested as a new perspective to identify advanced chronic patients among nursing homes residents.

The Cardiac Care Bridge randomized trial in high-risk older cardiac patients: A mixed-methods process evaluation	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						cardiology; caregivers; frailty; nurses; midwives; nursing; process assessment; qualitative research; transitional care		Aim To evaluate healthcare professionals' performance and treatment fidelity in the Cardiac Care Bridge (CCB) nurse-coordinated transitional care intervention in older cardiac patients to understand and interpret the study results. Design A mixed-methods process evaluation based on the Medical Research Council Process Evaluation framework. Methods Quantitative data on intervention key elements were collected from 153 logbooks of all intervention patients. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 CCB professionals (cardiac nurses, community nurses and primary care physical therapists), from June 2017 until October 2018. Qualitative data-analysis is based on thematic analysis and integrated with quantitative key element outcomes. The analysis was blinded to trial outcomes. Fidelity was defined as the level of intervention adherence. Results The overall intervention fidelity was 67%, ranging from severely low fidelity in the consultation of in-hospital geriatric teams (17%) to maximum fidelity in the comprehensive geriatric assessment (100%). Main themes of influence in the intervention performance that emerged from the interviews are interdisciplinary collaboration, organizational preconditions, confidence in the programme, time management and patient characteristics. In addition to practical issues, the patient's frailty status and limited motivation were barriers to the intervention. Conclusion Although involved healthcare professionals expressed their confidence in the intervention, the fidelity rate was suboptimal. This could have influenced the non-significant effect of the CCB intervention on the primary composite outcome of readmission and mortality 6 months after randomization. Feasibility of intervention key elements should be reconsidered in relation to experienced barriers and the population. Impact In addition to insight in effectiveness, insight in intervention fidelity and performance is necessary to understand the mechanism of impact. This study demonstrates that the suboptimal fidelity was subject to a complex interplay of organizational, professionals' and patients' issues. The results support intervention redesign and inform future development of transitional care interventions in older cardiac patients.	[Verweij, Lotte; Jepma, Patricia; Peters, Ron J.

Due to its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in their own environment. Implications for practice: This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.

Transitional care from skilled nursing facilities to home: study protocol for a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Transitional care; Skilled nursing facilities; Patient discharge; Caregivers; Aging; Frailty		Background Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. Methods The study will test the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden and distress. Discussion Study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications.

However, attracting, recruiting and retaining staff is one of the biggest challenges facing this sector. There is evidence available that describes factors that influence staff decisions to join and/or remain in the care home workforce, for example, individual rewards (such as feeling valued at work or training opportunities), relationships with colleagues and residents, supportive management or working arrangements (including flexible hours). However, it is less clear how different strategies are informed by evidence to improve recruitment and retention. Care homes are heterogeneous in terms of their size, staffing levels and mix, staff age groups, geographical location and working conditions. What matters to different members of the care home workforce will vary across nurses and care workers of different ages and levels of qualification or experience. Recognising this diversity is key: understanding how to attract, recruit and retain staff needs to discriminate and offer solutions that address this diversity. This important area of practice does not lend itself to a 'one-approach-fits-all' solution. This commentary provides a brief overview of known workforce challenges for the care home sector and argues for studies that use empirical evidence to test different theories of what might work for different staff, how and why, and in different circumstances.

Nurses have to decide on care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.

Frailty Index, Hospital Admission and Number of Days Spent in Hospital in Nursing Home Residents: Results from the INCUR Study	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Article						Frailty index; nursing home; hospital admission; days spent in hospital; prospective study	FUNCTIONAL DECLINE	Objectives To investigate the predictive capacity of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood) for hospital admission (HA) and number of days spent in hospital (DSH) among nursing home residents. Design, setting and participants Data are from a longitudinal cohort study, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents (INCUR), of 768 elder people (75.4% women) living in 13 nursing homes in France. Measurements The FI was computed taking into account 30 possible deficits at the baseline visit. Hospital admissions were defined as all urgent and involuntary admissions including unplanned readmissions. The length of stay was the total number of days spent by the resident in the hospital. Cox proportional hazard models in the presence of competing risks (death) were performed to study the relationship between the FI and HA over a 12-month follow-up. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was performed to study the association between the FI and DSH. Results Mean age of participants was 86.7 (standard deviation [SD] 6.9) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11). At the end of the follow-up, 238 (30.9%) HA events were recorded. Positive associations of the FI with DSH and HA were reported (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.020-1.297, p=0.02 and OR 1.209 (1.075-1.359, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusions and Implications The FI is a strong predictor of negative health-related outcomes as HA and DSH events, even with very old and complex nursing home residents.

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Prognosticating after ICH is complex and may be influenced by clinicians' subjective impressions and biases, which may, in turn, influence decision making regarding the level of care provided. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore perceptions of neurocritical care in relation to the expected functional outcome for ICH patients. Design Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with neurocritical care doctors and nurses. Setting Neurocritical care (NCC) department in a UK neuroscience tertiary referral center. Subjects Eleven neurocritical care nurses, five consultant neurointensivists, two stroke physicians, three neurosurgeons. Intervention None. Measurements and Main Results We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews and identified five key themes: (1) prognostic uncertainty (2) subjectivity of good versus poor outcome (3) perceived inappropriate care (PIC) situations (including for frail elderly patients) (4) challenging nature of decision-making (5) clinician distress. Conclusions Caring for severely affected ICH patients in need of neurocritical care is challenging, particularly with frail elderly patients. Awareness of the challenges could facilitate interventions to improve decision-making for this group of stroke patients and their families, as well as measures to reduce the distress on clinicians who care for this patient group. Our findings highlight the need for effective interdisciplinary shared decision making involving the family, taking into account patients' previously expressed values and preferences and incorporating these into bespoke care planning.

Transcending human frailties with technological enhancements and replacements: Transhumanist perspective in nursing and healthcare	NURSING INQUIRY			English	Article						artificial intelligence; caring in nursing; human frailties; nursing technologies; technological competency as caring in nursing; transcendence; TRETON	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; ROBOTS; MEDICINE; REALITY; IMPACT	As human beings age, they become weak, fragile, and feeble. It is a slowly progressing yet complex syndrome in which old age or some disabilities are not prerequisites; neither does loss of human parts lead to frailty among the physically fit older persons. This paper aims to describe the influences of transhumanist perspectives on human-technology enhancements and replacements in the transcendence of human frailties, including those of older persons, in which technology is projected to deliver solutions toward transcending these frailties. Through technologies including genetic screening and other technological manipulations, intelligent machines and augmented humans improve, maintain, and remedy human-linked susceptibilities. Furthermore, other technologies replace parts fabricated through inorganic-mechanical processes such as 3D-printing. Advancing technologies are reaching the summit of technological sophistication contributing to the transhumanist views of being human in a technological world. Technologies enhance the transcendence of human frailties as essential expressions of the symbiosis between human beings and technology in a transcendental world.

Design A qualitative descriptive study design was used. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. Results The participants described the use or non-use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a "legitimation process". This process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at which to start using it. During this process, each person weighs her or his "ageing self" and "perception of technology" then decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use. "Critical events" initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance. Conclusion The legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life. Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex decision-making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the device. Impact Older persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their independence.

A scoping review	WOUND PRACTICE AND RESEARCH			English	Review						trauma; wounds; elderly; nursing; clinical practice	INJURY SEVERITY; DRUG-DELIVERY; FRAILTY; CARE; OUTCOMES; HEALTH; SKIN; MANAGEMENT; NURSES; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY	The ability to heal an acute traumatic wound or wounds is a complex matrix of overlapping biological processes impacted by intrinsic and extrinsic human factors. As we age, the body's physiological resilience is compromised and homeostasis becomes difficult to maintain. This scoping review examines the influence of biological ageing and the impact of age-related concerns on wound healing, including frailty, malnutrition, pre-existing medical conditions and clinician practices. Frailty rather than age was seen to have a greater physiological impact on outcome, resilience and healing. Clinician support, education and engagement were fundamental to achieve acute wound healing in the aged population. With an increasing ageing population, specialised knowledge, guidelines and structures to support geriatric care are recommended for best clinical practice.

The chronicity care model deeply affects the quality of life and degree of dependence. Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyse the perceived quality of life and dependence degree in complex chronic patients within a chronicity care model in the Autonomous Communities of Cantabria and the Balearic Islands (Spain). Design: This was a multicentred, transversal, descriptive, and observational study on a cohort of 206 chronic patients included in a chronicity care program. Methods: Patients' sociodemographic variables, integral valuation, nurse follow-up records, nursing outcomes classification (NOC)/nursing interventions classification (NIC), nurse diagnoses, and hospitalization data were analysed. A descriptive analysis of all data was carried out. The bivariate analysis assessed the relation between covariables and the overall scoring in European Quality of Life Scale (EuroQuol-5D), Barthel, Braden, and Chronic Patient eXperience Assessment Instrument (IEXPAC in the Spanish abbreviation). A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted. Results: The mean age was 79.4 years (standard deviation (SD) = 9.12; range: 39-94). A percentage of 79.3% of the study population shows functional impairment in one or more activities of daily life. A percentage of 83.3% of patients showed a physical dependence. There is a significant relationship between the gender and kinship degree of the caregiver (chi(2) = 18.2; p = 0.001). An overall mean score of 55.38 points in EuroQuol-5D was obtained, along with a 36.87-point satisfaction with the care given in IEXPAC. The overall score correlated positively and significantly with Barthel, Braden, and IEXPAC. The dependence levels improved slightly in the observed patients, which was a very significant outcome in statistical terms (t = 2.08; p = 0.039). A percentage of 66% (R-2 = 0.66) of the score variability at the Barthel index could be predicted from Braden scale scoring. Conclusions: Dependence is not only affected by the related pathology, but also by the effect on mobility and daily-life activities, which cause a worse perception of the quality of life. The health-care model based on the case management nurse is having positive effects, especially on dependence and patients with ulcer issues.

We developed the Participation Enabling CAre in Nursing (PECAN) intervention, a complex intervention to enable nurses to promote participation in nursing home residents with joint contractures. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of the implementation strategy and to identify enablers and barriers for a successful implementation.MethodsThe implementation of PECAN was investigated in a 6-month pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial (c-RCT). As a key component of the implementation strategy, nominated nurses were trained as facilitators in a one-day workshop and supported by peer-mentoring (visit, telephone counselling). A mixed-methods approach was conducted in conjunction with the pilot trial and guided by a framework for process evaluations of c-RCTs. Data were collected using standardised questionnaires (nursing staff), documentation forms, problem-centred qualitative interviews (facilitators, therapists, social workers, relatives, peer-mentors), and a group discussion (facilitators). A set of predefined criteria on the nursing home level was examined. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using directed content analysis.ResultsSeven nursing homes (n =4 intervention groups, n =3 control groups) in two regions of Germany took part in the study. Facilitators responded well to the qualification measures (workshop participation: 14/14; workshop rating: "good"; peer-mentor visit participation: 10/14). The usage of peer-mentoring via telephone varied (one to seven contacts per nursing home). Our implementation strategy was not successful in connection with supplying the intervention to all the nurses. The clear commitment of the entire nursing home and the respect for the expertise of different healthcare professionals were emphasised as enablers, whereas a lack of impact on organisational conditions and routines and a lack of time and staff competence were mentioned as barriers.ConclusionThe PECAN intervention was delivered as planned to the facilitators but was unable to produce comprehensive changes in the nursing homes and subsequently for the residents. Strategies to systematically include the management and the nursing team from the beginning are needed to support the facilitators during implementation in the main trial.Trial registrationGerman clinical trials register, DRKS00010037.

This demand is set to continue due to an increasingly older population who are likely to have higher levels of dependency, dementia, and comorbidity. If admitted to the hospital, people with dementia are at higher risk of poor outcomes during and following a hospital admission. Yet, there remains a significant lack of specialist support within acute hospitals to support people with dementia, their families and hospital staff. Methods: Admiral Nurses are specialists that work with families affected by dementia and provide consultancy and support to health and social care colleagues to improve the delivery of evidenced based dementia care. Historically, Admiral Nurses have predominantly been based in community settings. In response to the increasing fragmentation of services across the dementia trajectory, the Admiral Nurse model is evolving and adapting to meet the complex needs of families impacted upon by dementia inclusive of acute hospital care. Results: The Admiral Nurse acute hospital model provides specialist interventions which improve staff confidence and competence and enables positive change by improving skills and knowledge in the provision of person-centred dementia care. The role has the capacity to address some of the barriers to delivering person centred dementia care in the acute hospital and contribute to improvements across the hospital both as a result of direct interventions or influencing the practice of others. Conclusion: Improving services for people with dementia and their families requires a whole system approach to enable care coordination and service integration, this must include acute hospital care. The increasing numbers of people with dementia in hospitals, and the detrimental effects of admission, make providing equitable, consistent, safe, quality care and support to people with dementia and their families a national priority requiring immediate investment. The inclusion of Admiral Nursing within acute hospital services supports service and quality improvement which positively impacts upon the experience and outcomes for families affected by dementia.

It is therefore crucial to deploy strategies that promote continuous adjustment to these barriers so as to improve the benefits of integrating care. Measuring the implementation and effects of integrated care models are key component of these strategies. However, measuring integrated care also faces major challenges. This study aims to identify and characterise integrated care measurement challenges. Methods: A review of reviews on the measurement of integrated care identified 12 papers. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify and categorize measurement challenges. Document analysis was done on the measurement of an integrated care model for older adults in Quebec. Results: Eight categories of measurement challenges were identified. These challenges include difficulties in measuring structures, processes, and effects of models; conceptual ambiguity and heterogeneity of organisational forms; involving multiple actors in the measurement strategy; and including multiple data sources, amongst others. These challenges revealed and explained potential gaps in the measurement of integrated care for older adults in Quebec. For instance, the Quebec measurement strategy did not include effects indicators. Conclusion: Although the measurement of integrated care is a complex endeavour, there is a need for adequate measurement strategies that allow to appreciate important elements of integrate care. The findings of this study could be used as a reflexive tool in advancing research and practice of measuring integrated care.

Design: A phenomenological inquiry inspired by Reflective Lifeworld Research. Method: Semi-structured lifeworld interviews with 11 persons aged 80+ years were conducted following their discharge. The interviews lasted 35-83 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Both interviews and the analysis followed the epistemological and methodological principles of Reflective Lifeworld Research. Findings: We identified the essential meaning 'It means everything' and four constituents illuminating different aspects inherent in the complex phenomenon of caring responsibility; 'A life-constraining transition,' 'Trusting the children to fill the gaps and be the glue,' 'Tacit responsibility, agreement and acceptance' and 'Depending on the children and knowing they are burdened by you.' Conclusions: Caring responsibility is based on a trusting relationship and tacit agreements indicating an understanding of interdependence and acceptance of dependence on adult children. However, a paradox appears when older persons express a deep-rooted perception of autonomy and independence as they have difficulties with their growing dependency and feelings of being burdensome. Older persons try to balance the continuum of autonomy, their existential self-image and actual capability. The practical part of caring responsibility seems to dominate and strongly affect the parent-child relationship because the child needs to take care of practical issues related to healthcare management and instrumental activities of daily living, leaving less time for meaningful togetherness. Implications for practice: Older persons want their adult children to be involved and acknowledged when planning care and treatment because they often seem to serve as the 'glue' that makes it possible for the parent to remain in his/her own home.

J	Vatnoy, TK; Skinner, MS; Karlsen, TI; Dale, B				Vatnoy, Torunn Kitty; Sundlisaeter Skinner, Marianne; Karlsen, Tor-Ivar; Dale, Bjorg			Nursing competence in municipal in-patient acute care in Norway: a cross-sectional study	BMC NURSING			English	Article						Acute care; Advanced practice nursing; Municipal health services; Older adults; Primary health care; Survey	PATIENT SAFETY OUTCOMES; OLDER-PEOPLE; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; NURSES; FRAILTY; IMPACT	Background The primary health care services are becoming increasingly complex, which presents challenges for the municipal nursing services. In Norway, municipal in-patient acute care (MipAC) has been introduced in all municipalities, and the competence at the services has been questioned. Few studies have examined the nursing services in the units. This study aims to get an overview of the nursing competence in those units across geographical regions, and different groups of organisation and localisation. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted, and an ad hoc questionnaire was distributed to first-line leaders in all the MipAC units in Norway. Data were collected in the period between 6 March 2019 to 6 June 2019. Measures to get an overview of the nursing competence were ratio of registered nurses (RNs) in staff, count of shifts with only one RN on duty and count of RNs with master's degrees/specialisation. Descriptive comparative statistics were used. Results Of all 226 first-line leaders invited to participate, 207 (91.6%) responded to the questionnaire. Overall a considerable variance across the sample was revealed. The median ratio of RNs in staff was 56 (IQR = 40-70), the count of shifts with only one RN on duty median 28 (IQR = 5-49), and the count of RNs with a master's degree or specialisation median 3 (IQR = 0-5). The regions of Northern and Central Norway, MipACs located in nursing home and MipACs organised at long-term care units, showed significantly lower nursing competence in staff compared to the remaining institution and organisations. Conclusion This study generates knowledge that can inform planning, priorities and interventions that may be initiated at all organisational and political levels concerning the MipAC services. An overall conclusion is that advanced nursing competence is lacking. The study also highlights the most urgent direction for improvements regarding nursing competence in the services. It seemed to be MipACs in Northern and Central Norway, and those located at nursing homes organised together with long-term care units, that needed improvements the most.

Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.

Background Older people with aged natural dentition require preventive and curative oral health care. An intervention based on principles of situated learning was implemented to establish closer cooperation between dental and nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to improved oral hygiene in nursing home residents. Design An embedded multiple-case study combined with principles of realist evaluation unfolded in three phases: Formulation of initial programme theory, Testing and Refining the programme theory. The COREQ checklist is followed in reporting. Methods Observations, six group interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with dentists, dental practitioners, nursing home managers, care professionals and residents were conducted in three nursing homes (n = 41). Results Three main outcomes of a programme theory were identified, relating to (a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) interdisciplinary working, in the form of professional pride in performing sufficient oral care; (c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the creation of relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care professionals as well as nursing home management taking responsibility for structure, planning and knowledge sharing. Conclusion The situated learning perspective supported residents and care professionals' competencies in performing sufficient oral care. The shared oral care intervention supports an individual and multidisciplinary assessment of nursing home residents' ability to self-care concerning oral care. Contextual factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms influence the intervention's success. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the complexity within interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and unravelling the necessary properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health care are areas of improvement for care service in nursing homes.

European Geriatric Med Soc	COVID-19 highlights the need for universal adoption of standards of medical care for physicians in nursing homes in Europe	EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE			English	Article						MeSH; Nursing home; Standard of care; Physicians; COVID-19	OLDER-PEOPLE; RESIDENTS; FUTURE; STAFF	The nursing home sector has seen a disproportionately high number of deaths as part of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reflects, in part, the frailty and vulnerability of older people living in care homes but has also, in part, been a consequence of the failure to include care homes in the systematic planning of a response to COVID, as well as a measure of neglect of standards and quality improvement in the sector. In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies in 2015. The standards consisted of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in nursing homes as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. The gravity of the concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as emerging insights on care improvement in nursing homes indicate that an update of these medical standards is timely. This was performed by the writing group from the original 2015 guidelines and is intended as an interim measure pending a more formal review incorporating a systematic review of emerging literature and a Delphi process. Key summary pointsAim The gravity of concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic mandates urgent review of medical standards for nursing homes. Findings Physicians providing medical care to nursing home residents should have a formal competence in geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry. Message The coordination of the broad range of complexities of care in nursing homes requires clearly specified clinical leadership commensurate with the range of services needed.

Aims The aim of this study was (1) to design a multi-component training program which improves physical functioning and psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of this intervention in nursing home residents. Methods This study is a two-arm, stratified-randomized controlled feasibility trail. Twenty-four nursing home residents (aged 83.7 +/- 6.4, 21 women) were divided into an intervention and a waiting-list control group. The intervention group completed a multi-component training (including dual-task, dynamic balance, endurance and strength exercises) for 16 weeks (twice per week for 45-60 min). Primary outcomes were lower extremity functionality (SPPB), gait performance (GAITRite), health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as life satisfaction (SWLS). Results Life satisfaction (SWLS) and physical functioning (SPPB) increased in the intervention group after training whereas the control group showed a decrease. Gait parameters could only be analyzed forn = 5 participants of the intervention group andn = 2 of the control group and showed no time differences for the intervention group. The mean number of participants was 12.5 +/- 1.9 per session (attendance ranged between 66% and 90%). Conclusion A multi-component training seems (1) to lead to clinically relevant improvements in physical functioning as well as in psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to be feasible and well accepted in nursing home residents. Nevertheless, the complexity and progression of the program as well as the testing protocol have to be adapted. Further research should test the effectiveness of this adapted program in a larger sample size.

Texture-Modified Diet for Improving the Management of Oropharyngeal Dysphagia in Nursing Home Residents: An Expert Review	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Review						Dysphagia; malnutrition; nursing home; texture-modified diet	LONG-TERM-CARE; AGED CARE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; OLDER PATIENTS; PUREED FOOD; MALNUTRITION; NUTRITION; QUALITY; PROTEIN; ENERGY	Objectives This paper provides evidence-based and, when appropriate, expert reviewed recommendations for long-stay residents who are prescribed texture-modified diets (TMDs), with the consideration that these residents are at high risk of worsening oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD), malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, and OD-associated mortality, poorer quality of life and high costs. Design Nestle Health Science funded an initial virtual meeting attended by all authors, in which the unmet needs and subsequent recommendations for OD management were discussed. The opinions, results, and recommendations detailed in this paper are those of the authors, and are independent of funding sources. Setting OD is common in nursing home (NH) residents, and is defined as the inability to initiate and perform safe swallowing. The long-stay NH resident population has specific characteristics marked by a shorter life expectancy relative to community-dwelling older adults, high prevalence of multimorbidity with a high rate of complications, dementia, frailty, disability, and often polypharmacy. As a result, OD is associated with malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, functional decline, and death. Complications of OD can potentially be prevented with the use of TMDs. Results This report presents expert opinion and evidence-informed recommendations for best practice on the nutritional management of OD. It aims to highlight the practice gaps between the evidence-based management of OD and real-world patterns, including inadequate dietary provision and insufficient staff training. In addition, the unmet need for OD screening and improvements in therapeutic diets are explored and discussed. Conclusion There is currently limited empirical evidence to guide practice in OD management. Given the complex and heterogeneous population of long-stay NH residents, some 'best practice' approaches and interventions require extensive efficacy testing before further changes in policy can be implemented.

The association of this score with in-hospital mortality was not investigated before. Having this information is relevant to define evidence-based criteria that hospital administrators can use to allocate nursing workforce according to the real and current patients' need for nursing care. The aim of this study is to assess the association between complexity of nursing care and in-hospital mortality.MethodsRegister-based cohort study on all patients admitted to acute medical wards of a middle-large hospital in the North of Italy between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015 and followed up to discharge. Out of all the eligible 7247 records identified in the Hospital Discharge Register, 6872 records from 5129 patients have been included. A multivariable frailty Cox model was adopted to estimate the association between the Informative System of Nursing Performance score, both as continuous variable and dichotomized as low (score<50) or high (score<greater than or equal to>50), and in-hospital mortality adjusting for several factors recorded at admission (age, gender, type of admission unit, type of access and Charlson Comorbidity Index).ResultsThe median age of the 5129 included patients was 76 [first-third quartiles 64-84] and 2657(52%) patients were males. Over the 6872 admissions, there were 395 in-hospital deaths among 2922 patients at high complexity of nursing care (13.5%) and 74/3950 (1.9%) among those at low complexity leading to a difference of 11.6% (95% CI: 10.3-13.0%). Adjusting by relevant confounders, the hazard rate of mortality in the first 10days from admission resulted 6 times significantly higher in patients at high complexity of nursing care with respect to patients at low complexity (hazard ratio, HR 6.58, 95%CI: 4.50;9.62, p<0.001). The HR was lower after 10days from admission but still significantly higher than 1. By considering the continuous score, the association was confirmed.ConclusionComplexity of nursing care is strongly associated to in-hospital mortality of acute patients admitted to medical departments. It predicts in-hospital mortality better than widely used indicators, such as comorbidity.

Hypertension Management in Nursing Homes: Review of Evidence and Considerations for Care	CURRENT HYPERTENSION REPORTS			English	Review						Nursing homes; Hypertension; Antihypertensives; Deprescribing; Older adults; Frailty	BLOOD-PRESSURE; ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; MEDICATIONS; GUIDELINES	Purpose of Review We sought to summarize recent evidence regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) treatment targets and antihypertensive regimen intensity for nursing home (NH) residents and similar older, complex patients with hypertension. Recent Findings Recent trials have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits from more intensive BP targets among ambulatory, less complex older adults, but generalizability to NH residents is questionable. Other trials have demonstrated that de-intensifying antihypertensives in frail, older patients is feasible, with no or modest increases in BP, but most have not assessed effects on patient-centered outcomes. Observational studies with patients more representative of NH residents suggest harms associated with more intensive BP treatment and reduction in fall risk associated with deintensification, but findings and potential for bias vary across studies. Randomized trials and rigorous observational studies examining effects of deintensified BP management on patient-centered outcomes in complex, older populations are needed to inform improved guidelines and treatment for NH residents.

S	Rohrmann, S		Veronese, N		Rohrmann, Sabine			Epidemiology of Frailty in Older People	FRAILTY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES: RESEARCH INTO AN ELDERLY POPULATION	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Epidemiology; Frailty; Community; Nursing home	PHYSICAL FRAILTY; PREVALENCE; POPULATION; ADULTS	Frailty is a complex of symptoms that is characterized by impaired stress tolerance due to a decline in the functionality of different organs. Due to its multifactorial aetiology, several definitions and assessments of this symptom complex have been developed, of which the Fried Frailty Score (Phenotype Score) and the broader Frailty Index (Deficit Accumulation Index) are the most commonly used. The prevalence of frailty increases with age independently of the assessment instrument and ranges between 4 and 59% in community-dwelling elderly populations and is higher in women than in men. The actual prevalence rate in a population depends on the prevalence of chronic diseases including depression, nutritional status, and inherently socio-economic background and education. Frailty is, however, not a steady state and progression, but also reversion is common. Although numerous studies on the prevalence of frailty have been conducted, systematic assessments in different populations are rare, which reduces the comparability of results. Similarly heterogeneous, but less frequent are studies on the incidence and on trajectories and transitions of frailty, calling for further, more systematic studies on this topic.

Nonspecific symptoms, complex medical conditions, insufficient awareness of diagnostic criteria, and unnecessary urine studies all contribute to the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in PALTC residents. In 2017, the Infection Advisory Subcommittee at AMDA-The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine convened a workgroup comprised of experts in geriatrics and infectious diseases to review recent literature regarding UTIs in the PALTC population. The workgroup used evidence as well as their collective clinical expertise to develop this consensus statement with the goal of providing comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of UTIs in PALTC residents. The recommendations acknowledge limitations inherent to providing medical care for frail older adults, practicing within a resource limited setting, and prevention strategies tailored to PALTC populations. In addition, the consensus statement encourages integrating antibiotic stewardship principles into the policies and procedures used by PALTC nursing staff and by prescribing clinicians as they care for residents with a suspected UTI.

Objectives To investigate the associations of frailty status with oral cleaning habits and oral hygiene taking into account the effects of preventive oral health intervention among home care clients aged 75 or over. Methods Data were gathered by interviews and clinical oral examinations at baseline and after a 6-month follow-up. Frailty status was evaluated at baseline using the abbreviated comprehensive geriatric assessment (aCGA) scale, which consists of 15 questions from three different domains: cognitive status, functional status and depression. A total of 231 home care clients completed the aCGA at baseline and the interview and clinical oral examination both at baseline and after the follow-up. Results Using the aCGA classification with at least one score in the >= 2 domain, 62% of clients were classified as frail at baseline. They had poorer oral cleaning habits and hygiene, and they had lost more teeth than nonfrail participants. Multivariate analysis showed that being frail at baseline was statistically significantly associated with a lower frequency of toothbrushing and denture cleaning (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9 and OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.8) at baseline, but not after the follow-up. Membership in the intervention group was associated with better oral cleaning at the follow-up. However, among the frail participants, toothbrushing frequency was still significantly lower and oral hygiene poorer than among the nonfrail group. Conclusions Oral cleaning habits of frail elderly people were slightly improved as a result of external support, which had a positive effect on oral hygiene. Individual preventive actions in the context of oral health and hygiene should be integrated into the daily care plan of home care clients with the first signs of frailty.

These presentations are often complex and time consuming in the chaotic and potentially hazardous ED environment. The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention (GEDI) model was developed to optimise the care of frail older adults, especially RACF residents, in the ED. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the GEDI model on the primary outcomes of disposition (admission, discharge or death) and ED length of stay for residents of RACFs, presenting to an ED in regional Queensland, Australia. Methods GEDI is a nurse-led, physician-championed, innovative model delivered by advanced practice nurses with expertise in gerontology. This quasi-experimental pragmatic study compared outcomes for RACF residents who presented to a regional Queensland ED during three time periods: pre-GEDI, interim GEDI and post-GEDI implementation of the GEDI model. Outcomes included disposition, ED length of stay, ED re-presentation and mortality. Results A significant increase in the likelihood of discharge from ED (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.26) and reductions in ED length of stay (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.78) were evident for RACF residents following the implementation of the GEDI intervention. There were no differences in mortality, ED re-presentation or in-hospital length of stay between the three time periods. Conclusion There is a paucity of evidence to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in EDs designed to target older adults living in RACFs. The GEDI model was effective in reducing ED length of stay while increasing the likelihood of safe discharge for RACF residents.

J	Ludwig, C; Busnel, C				Ludwig, Catherine; Busnel, Catherine			Protocol of a case-control longitudinal study (fraXity) assessing frailty and complexity among Swiss home service recipients using interRAI-HC assessments	BMC GERIATRICS			English	Article						Frailty; Complexity; Standardized geriatric assessment; Home care; Nursing	ELDERLY-PEOPLE; CARE; TRANSITION; DECLINE; DISEASE; QUALITY	Background The early screening of frail individuals and of patients with complex care needs are challenges that countries witnessing population aging face. Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant. Methods The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant. Discussion The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.

In order to follow up on older patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy at home, we implemented remote phone monitoring conducted by skilled oncology nurses. However, given the rising number of patients assessed and the limited time that hospital professionals can spend on their patients after discharge, we needed to modernize this program. In this paper we present the preliminary results and the ongoing evaluation. Method: We implemented a semi-automated messaging application to upgrade the current follow-up procedures. The primary aim is to collect patient's key data over time and to free up nurses' time so that during phone calls they can focus on education and support. The Chatbot feasibility was assessed in a sub-sample of unselected patients before its wider dissemination and pragmatic evaluation. Main results: During the first deployment period, 9 unselected patients benefited from the Chatbot (mean 83 y.o.) with a total of 52 completed remote evaluations. Each participant answered 6 questionnaires over 7 weeks with an 86% compliance rate. The average completion time for the questionnaires was 3.5 min and the answer rate was 100%. The 'free text' field was used in 58% of the questionnaires. The Chatbot solution is currently proposed to all eligible patients thanks to the regional cancer network support. We are measuring acceptability, health outcomes and health network impact. Discussion and conclusion: The results of this first phase are encouraging. The integration of the solution into the health care organization was feasible and acceptable. Moreover, the answers revealed serious health (e.g. fever) or adherence (e.g. blood test) issues that require timely interventions. The major strength of this solution is to rely on end-users' current knowledge of technologies (text-messaging), which allows a seamless integration into a complex clinical network.

This feasibility randomized controlled trial (fRCT) will test the proposed intervention and its implementation and determine methods for the design of a conclusive randomized controlled trial. Methods The fRCT, with embedded qualitative study, aims to recruit 60 participants. Moderately and severely frail older people will be identified using the electronic frailty index (eFI) and the intervention will be delivered by senior community nurses. The control participants will receive usual primary care for frailty. The study is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR; funding granted in May 2016, ref: ICA-CDRF-2016-02-018) and received NHS and University Research Ethics Committee approval in 2018. Discussion There is evidence that the delivery of complex interventions for community-dwelling older people can reduce care home and hospital admissions and falls, there is less evidence for the benefit of any specific type or intensity of intervention or the additional benefits of targeting the frail population. This trial will determine feasibility of the intervention, define recruitment and retention parameters and trial logistics, and decide outcome measures. Impact This study aims to address the limitations of current research by using a systematic method of frailty diagnosis and participant identification, trialling implementation of a person-centred intervention, and testing of feasibility parameters.

J	Pulst, A; Fassmer, AM; Schmiemann, G				Pulst, Alexandra; Fassmer, Alexander Maximilian; Schmiemann, Guido			Experiences and involvement of family members in transfer decisions from nursing home to hospital: a systematic review of qualitative research	BMC GERIATRICS			English	Review						Nursing home; Hospitalization; Patient transfer; Decision making; Family; Qualitative evidence synthesis	RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE; OF-LIFE CARE; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENTS; ADVANCE DIRECTIVES; END; PERSPECTIVES; COMMUNICATION; TRANSITIONS; PREVALENCE; FACILITIES	BackgroundNursing home residents (NHR) are characterized by increasing frailty, multimorbidity and care dependency. These conditions result in frequent hospital transfers which can lead to negative effects on residents' health status and are often avoidable. Reasons for emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions are complex. Prior research indicated factors influencing transfer decisions in view of nursing staff and general practitioners. The aim of this systematic review is to explore how family members experience and influence transfers from nursing home (NH) to hospital and how they are involved in the transfer decision.MethodsA systematic literature search was performed in Medline via PubMed, Ebsco Scopus and CINAHL in May 2018. Studies were eligible if they contained information a) about the decision to transfer NHR to hospital and b) the experiences or influence of family members. The review followed Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) approach for qualitative systematic reviews. Screening, selection and quality appraisal of studies were performed independently by two reviewers. Synthesis of qualitative data was conducted through meta-aggregation.ResultsAfter screening of n=2863 articles, in total n=10 qualitative studies were included in the review. Results indicate that family members of NHR experience decision-making before hospitalization differently. They mainly reported NH-related, hospital-related, and family/resident-related factors influencing the transfer decision. The involvement of family members in the decision-making process varies - from no involvement to insistence on a decision in favor of their personal preferences. However, hospital transfer decisions and other treatment decisions (e.g. advance care planning (ACP) discussions) were commonly discussed with physicians and nurses. Conflicts between family members and healthcare providers mostly arose around the interpretation of resident's best interest. In general, family members perceive discussions as challenging thus leading to emotional stress and discomfort.ConclusionThe influence of NHR family members concerning hospital transfer decisions varies. Family members are an important link for communication between resident and medical staff and for communication between NH and hospital. Interventions aiming to reduce hospitalization rates have to take these findings into account.

J	Hedman, K				Hedman, Karl			Strengths and support of older people affected by precarity in South Louisiana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING			English	Article						care of older people; Louisiana; precarity; strengths; support	EXPERIENCE; FRAILTY	BackgroundFew empirical studies have examined strengths and support of older people in circumstances of precarity. A better understanding of this problem has the potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery. PurposeTo investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana. MethodMore than 300hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for low-income older persons and two senior citizen centres. ResultsThe findings demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home-based healthcare services, (b) stress after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home-based services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships and activities, and (i) grocery store and cafe contacts. ConclusionHome-based services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services. Implications for practiceThis study adds to the literature about precarity among community-based older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home-based services are necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths and supportive resources of older people.

Traditional medicine and models of care may no longer meet complex patient needs. Older patients present with multifaceted issues while living longer with chronic health conditions. The changing environment requires a cross-disciplinary perspective. Changes in reimbursement are in the early stages of implementation and will be used to evaluate measurable outcomes. Preparing to care for this population can only occur with enough health professionals and expanded use of advance practice nurses. Health improvement is economically advantageous.

As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital. Methods: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role. Conclusions: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.

The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. Design A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Results Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self-management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. Discussion The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team "works" is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live.

Background Existential loneliness (EL) is an unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older people, the experience of EL can be reduced. Design In this qualitative study, we used an exploratory and descriptive design. Methods The study was based on 22 narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were receiving long-term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis. Results Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the rear-view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract themselves. Conclusion Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person-centred care and create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherne	[Sjoberg, Marina] Malmo Univ, Fac Hlth & Soc, Dept Care Sci, Malmo, Sweden; [Sjoberg, Marina; Edberg, Anna-Karin; Beck, Ingela] Kristianstad Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Platform Collaborat Hlth, Kristianstad, Sweden; [Rasmussen, Birgit H.; Beck, Ingela] Lund Univ & Reg Skane, Inst Palliat Care, Lund, Sweden; [Rasmussen, Birgit H.] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Beck, Ingela] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Div Oncol, Dept Clin Sci Lund, Lund, Sweden	Sjoberg, M (corresponding author), Kristianstad Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Platform Collaborat Hlth, Kristianstad, Sweden.	marina.sjoberg@hkr.se		Edberg, Anna-Karin/0000-0003-0161-4795	Research Platform for Collaboration for Health at Kristianstad University [7/2014]; Crafoordska Stiftelsen [2013-0841]; Greta och Johan Kocks stiftelser [2014-231-401]; Vardal Foundation; Gyllenstiernska Krapperup Foundation	The Research Platform for Collaboration for Health at Kristianstad University, Grant/Award Number: 7/2014; Crafoordska Stiftelsen, Grant/Award Number: 2013-0841; Greta och Johan Kocks stiftelser, Grant/Award Number: 2014-231-401; Vardal Foundation; Gyllenstiernska Krapperup Foundation		42	8	8	2	7	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1748-3735	1748-3743		INT J OLDER PEOPLE N	Int.

Medication Regimen Complexity In 8 Australian Residential Aged Care Facilities: Impact Of Age, Length Of Stay, Comorbidity, Frailty, And Dependence In Activities Of Daily Living	CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING			English	Article						Aged; nursing homes; medication regimen complexity; frailty index; activities of daily living; multimorbidity; long-term care facilities	OLDER-ADULTS; ADMINISTRATION ERRORS; NURSING-HOMES; HEALTH; POLYPHARMACY; DEMENTIA; PEOPLE; INDEX; NH; PREVALENCE	Objective: To explore variation in medication regimen complexity in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) according to resident age, length of stay, comorbidity, dementia severity, frailty, and dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs), and compare number of daily administration times and Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) as measures of regimen complexity. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the SImplification of Medications Prescribed to Long-tErm care Residents (SIMPLER) cluster-randomized controlled trial. The SIMPLER study recruited 242 residents with at least one medication charted for regular administration from 8 RACFs in South Australia. Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Dementia severity was assessed using the Dementia Severity Rating Scale. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL-NH scale. Dependence in ADLs was assessed using the Katz ADL scale. Results: The median age of participants was 87 years (interquartile range 81-92). Over one-third of participants (n=86, 36%) had 5 or more daily medication administration times. The number of daily administration times and MRCI scores were positively correlated with resident length of stay (r(s)=0.19; 0.27), FRAIL-NH score (r(s)=0.23; 0.34) and dependence in ADLs (r(s)=-0.21; -0.33) (all p<0.01). MRCI was weakly negatively correlated with CCI score (r(s)=-0.16; p=0.013). Neither number of daily administration times nor MRCI score were correlated with age or dementia severity. In multivariate analysis, frailty was associated with number of daily administration times (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.24) and MRCI score (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.13-1.41). Dementia severity was inversely associated with both multiple medication administration times (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99) and high MRCI score (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98). Conclusion: Residents with longer lengths of stay, more dependent in ADLs and most frail had the most complex medication regimens and, therefore, may benefit from targeted strategies to reduce medication regimen complexity.

METHODS This longitudinal study with a 3-year follow-up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3-year period. CONCLUSIONS To prevent frailty, we suggest weight-loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower-limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. Implications for Nursing Practice The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.

Care decisions are complex because patients may have multiple comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Additionally, older adults often have vague symptomology, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and a reported delay of treatment. Although multiple clinical guidelines are available, the applicability of guidelines to the older population needs to be evaluated based on a holistic, individualized basis. Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes and priorities, incorporating risk-benefit assessment, quality of life, functional assessment, and frailty assessment when making treatment decisions.

Integrated care seems to respond to this issue, with collaborative working and integration efforts of the care system components professionals and service providers aimed at improving efficiency, appropriateness and person centeredness of care. We conducted a narrative review to analyse the available evidences published on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated care models targeted on the management of such elderly patients. Methods: MEDLINE, Scopus and EBSCO were searched. We reported this narrative review according to the PRISMA Checklist. For studies to be included, they had to: (i) refer to integrated care models through implemented experimental or demonstration projects; (ii) focus on frail elderly 65 years old, with complex health and social needs, not disease-specific; (iii) evaluate effectiveness and/or cost and/or cost-effectiveness; (iv) report quantitative data (e.g. health outcomes, utilization outcomes, cost and cost-effectiveness). Results: Thirty articles were included, identifying 13 integrated care models. Common features were identified in case management, geriatric assessment and multidisciplinary team. Favourable impacts on healthcare facilities utilization rates, though with mixed results on costs, were found. The development of community-based and cost-effective integrated systems of care for the elderly is possible, thanks to the cooperation across care professionals and providers, to achieving a relevant impact on healthcare and efficient resource management. The elements of success or failure are not always unique and identifiable, but the potential clearly exists for these models to be successful and generalized on a large scale. Discussion: We found out a favourable impact of integrated care models/methods on health outcomes, care utilization and costs. The selected interventions are likely to be implemented at community level, focused on the patient management in terms of continuity of care. Thus, we propose a value-based framework for the evaluation of these services.

In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients >= 70 years of age were evaluated with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age was 76 (70-92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p 0.001) and GA group (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.

A survey of frail older persons with cognitive impairment transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES			English	Article						frail older persons; cognitive impairment; emergency department; specially trained nurses; medical care plans; typical case	CARE; STRESS; CONSCIENCE	BackgroundProviding care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is associated with a high risk of them developing complications. AimTo survey the most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. MethodA retrospective descriptive survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. FindingsThe persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. ConclusionFrail older persons with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end-of-life care, should be prevented from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making house calls.

However, nursing staff often has insufficient knowledge and skills to adequately address the needs of frail older adults. There is therefore a need for nurses with advanced qualifications. To meet this need, advanced geriatric nursing has been introduced in Norway. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses with their new role as advanced geriatric nurses in care of older adults and to determine what strategies the nurses considered important in the development of their new role. Design: This study applied a descriptive, exploratory design. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 nurses who had undergone an educational programme to become advanced geriatric nurses in Norway in 2016. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The participants described a complex and extensive nursing role, which they related to a new understanding of the patients, relatives and the system in which they worked. This new gaze had developed based on a combination of their new knowledge, their skills, experiences and professional interests. The opportunities to use their role depended on their workplace conditions. They related to contextual challenges at their workplace in different ways to optimise the use of their new gaze. Conclusions: Common for all participants was a broader and deeper understanding of the patient's health and life situation, which guided participants' actions. The key issue in developing the new role was developing effective strategies to foster role integration. Implications for Practice: Advanced geriatric nurses should collaborate with their managers to create a role that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills, as well as collaborate with colleagues to enhance understanding of utilisation of their role.

DesignA two-armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow-ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. MethodInclusion criteria were the following: 65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self-reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. ResultsDuring the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. ConclusionsThe use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

Although it is associated with disability and multiple comorbidities, it can also be present in individuals who seem healthy. Frailty is multidimensional and its pathophysiology is complex. Early identification and intervention can potentially decrease or reverse frailty, especially in the early stages. Primary care physicians, community nurses and community social networks have important roles in the identification of pre-frail and frail elderly through the use of simple frailty screening tools and rapid geriatric assessments. Appropriate interventions that can be initiated in a primary care setting include a targeted medical review for reversible medical causes of frailty, medication appropriateness, nutritional advice and exercise prescription. With ongoing training and education, the multidisciplinary engagement and coordination of care of the elderly in the community can help to build resilience and combat frailty in our rapidly ageing society.

Background: A critical time for appropriate health decisions occurs during hospital discharge planning with nursing staff. However, little is known how the 89% of elderly living at home make decisions regarding their health care. Research into older adults' management of chronic conditions emerges as an important step to potentially encourage symptom monitoring, prevent missed care and detect deterioration. All should reduce the risk of hospital re-admission. Design: A mixed methods thematic literature review was undertaken. The structure followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews recommended by the EQUATOR network. Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus online databases were searched using keywords, inclusion and exclusion criteria. References drawn from relevant publications, identified by experts and published between 1995 and 2017 were also considered. Twenty-five qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies and reviews were critically appraised (CASP 2013) before inclusion in the review. Analysis of each study's findings was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (2006) steps to identify major themes and sub-themes. Results: Four main themes associated with health-related decision-making in the elderly were identified: "the importance of maintaining independence," "decision making style," "management of conditions at home" and "discharge planning." Conclusion: Health care decision preferences in the elderly emerged as highly complex and influenced by multiple factors. Development of a tool to assess these components has been recommended. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses play a vital role in exploring and understanding the influence that maintaining independence has with each patient.

J	Skilbeck, JK; Arthur, A; Seymour, J				Skilbeck, Julie Kathryn; Arthur, Antony; Seymour, Jane			Making sense of frailty: An ethnographic study of the experience of older people living with complex health problems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING			English	Article						frailty; long-term conditions; nurse; nursing; older people; resilience; transitions	CARE; AGE	Aim: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in their daily lives. Background: A better understanding of the personal experience of frailty in the context of fluctuating ill-health has the potential to contribute to the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. Design: An ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a community matron service in a large city in the North of England. Methods: Up to six care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4-year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method. Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: Fluctuating ill-health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living. Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person-centred care . Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.

Previous evidence suggested that the effectiveness of CGA programs may be influenced by settings where the CGA is performed [i.e., hospital, posthospital discharge/long-term care facilities (LTCFs), or community/home] as well as the specific clinical conditions of older frail individuals. In this scenario, CGA and quality of care in LTCFs have been a challenge for decades. In the present article, we systematically reviewed evidence from the last three decades of clinical research devoted to systematic implementation of CGA programs in LTCFs, that is, nursing homes, care homes, residential homes, and rehabilitation facilities. In the United States, all LTC residents must undergo a CGA on a regular basis on admission to a facility, prompting the development of the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) Minimum Data Set, a specific CGA-based assessment tool in this population. In the LTCF setting, the present reviewed evidence suggested that most complex older subjects may benefit from a CGA in terms of improved quality of care and reduced hospitalization events and that CGA must be standardized across healthcare settings to promote greater health system integration and coordination. In the LTCF setting, particularly in nursing homes, other new and promising CGA programs have also been proposed to develop rapid screening CGA-based tools to enhance in the future the ability of primary care physicians to recognize and treat geriatric syndromes in this setting. However, at present, the interRAI suite of instruments represented an integrated health information system that has the potential to provide person-centered information transcending healthcare settings.

Identifying a Relationship Between Physical Frailty and Heart Failure Symptoms	JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING			English	Article						heart failure; physical frailty; symptoms	VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE; MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; DESTINATION THERAPY; GAIT SPEED; IMPAIRMENT; VALIDITY; DISEASE; CARE; TRANSPLANTATION	Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant symptom burden; however, our understanding of the relationship between symptoms and physical frailty in HF is limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. Methods: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. Results: The mean age of the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 +/- 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P < .001), 75% worse wake disturbances (P < .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. Conclusions: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.

Although equally considered in the computation of the SPPB score, each of the components may present a specific and different weight in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between SPPB and its component of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood). Method: Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 730 older persons (74.29% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. The FI was computed as the ratio between 30 actual and potential deficits the participant might have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 deficits]). Physical status was assessed using the SPPB score at baseline. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between the SPPB and FI and estimate which components of the SPPB were most strongly associated with the FI. Results: Mean age of participants was 86.5 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11) and SPPB of 2.5 (range between 0 and 12). The SPPB and its components were all significantly associated with the FI, but the magnitude of the associations varied. Linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, showed that the balance test [beta = -0.045 (95% CI -0.042; -0.028), p < 0.0001] and chair stand test [beta = -0.040 (95% CI -0.054; -0.027), p < 0.0001] was more strongly associated with the FI than the gait speed [beta = -0.015 (95% CI -0.021; -0.008), p < 0.0001]. Conclusion: Of the 3 components of the SPPB, both balance and chair tests seem particularly relevant indicator of frailty among very old and complex elders living in nursing homes.

Barriers and enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in heart failure with atrial fibrillation: patient and provider perspectives	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; caregiver; heart failure; medication adherence; stroke prevention; thromboprophylaxis	ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY; MEDICATION ADHERENCE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; SELF-CARE; RISK; OUTCOMES; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; FRAILTY; HEALTH	Aims & ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to elucidate the barriers and enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in individuals with chronic heart failure (CHF) with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) from the perspective of patients and providers. BackgroundCHF and AF commonly coexist and are associated with increased stroke risk and mortality. Oral anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke risk and improves outcomes. Yet, in approximately 30% of cases, anticoagulation is not commenced for a variety of reasons. DesignQualitative study using narrative inquiry. MethodsData from face-to-face individual interviews with patients and information retrieved from healthcare file note review documented the clinician perspective. This study is a synthesis of the two data sources, obtained during patient clinical assessments as part of the Atrial Fibrillation And Stroke Thromboprophylaxis in hEart failuRe (AFASTER) Study. ResultsPatient choice and preference were important factors in anticoagulation decisions, including treatment burden, unfavourable or intolerable side effects and patient refusal. Financial barriers included cost of travel, medication cost and reimbursement. Psychological factors included psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment and depression. Social barriers included homelessness and the absence of a caregiver or lack of caregiver assistance. Clinician reticence included fear of falls, frailty, age, fear of bleeding and the challenges of multimorbidity. Facilitators to successful prescription and adherence were caregiver support, reminders and routine, self-testing and the use of technology. ConclusionsMany barriers remain to high-risk individuals being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. There are a number of enabling factors that facilitate prescription and optimise treatment adherence. Nurses should challenge these treatment barriers and seek enabling factors to optimise therapy. Relevance to clinical practiceNurses can help patients and caregivers to understand complex anticoagulant risk-benefit information, and act as a patient advocate when making complex stroke prevention decisions.

J	Ljungbeck, B; Forss, KS				Ljungbeck, Birgitta; Forss, Katarina Sjogren			Advanced nurse practitioners in municipal healthcare as a way to meet the growing healthcare needs of the frail elderly: a qualitative interview study with managers, doctors and specialist nurses	BMC NURSING			English	Article						Advanced nurse practitioner; Content analysis; Doctors; Manager; Municipal healthcare; Qualitative research; Primary care; Specialist nurse	SATISFACTION; EXPERIENCES; FINLAND; ROLES	Background: The number of frail elderly people with complex nursing and medical care needs is increasing, and consequently, the healthcare burden. The implementation of Advanced Nurse Practitioners globally has been shown to make healthcare more effective and increase patient safety, continuity of care and access to care. In Sweden, research about Advanced Nurse Practitioners is limited. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the opinions of managers, doctors and nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare about the role of ANPs in municipal healthcare as a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of the frail elderly. Methods: Managers, doctors and specialist nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare adopted a qualitative, descriptive design through 12 semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using content analysis. Results: The participants expressed both opportunities as well as challenges with Advanced Nurse Practitioners in municipal healthcare. This role considered to satisfy frail elderly people's healthcare needs and making the healthcare more effective as the doctors would have more time for other patients. The challenges mainly consist of doubts from the managers whether the nurses would be motivated to pursue further education to become an Advanced Nurse Practitioner if the role becomes a reality. The doctors were unsure if the nurses would consider taking the responsibility the role would imply. Conclusions: Advanced Nurse Practitioner is considered to be a valuable resource not only for the frail elderly but also for the nurses in the municipal healthcare and for the doctors in primary care as they probably would make healthcare more effective. They might be a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of frail elderly, however there are also challenges to overcome before they can become a reality in a Swedish healthcare context. Consequently, this role deserves further investigation.

Our knowledge is limited regarding which needs for nursing interventions patients being cared for in their home have, and how they are met. We aimed at assessing aspects of health and function in a representative sample of the most vulnerable home-dwelling elderly, to identify their needs for nursing interventions and how these needs were met. Methods: In this observational study we included patients aged 75+ living in their own homes in Oslo, who received daily home care, had three or more chronic diagnoses, received daily medication, and had been hospitalized during the last year. Focused attention and cognitive processing speed were assessed with the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), handgrip strength was used as a measure of sarcopenia, mobility was assessed with the "Timed Up-and-Go" test, and independence in primary activities of daily living by the Barthel Index. Diagnoses and medication were collected from electronic medical records. For each diagnosis, medication and functional impairment, a consensus group defined which nursing service that the particular condition necessitated. We then assessed whether these needs were fulfilled for each participant. Results: Of 150 eligible patients, 83 were included (mean age 87 years, 25% men). They had on average 6 diagnoses and used 9 daily medications. Of the 83 patients, 61 (75%) had grip strength indicating sarcopenia, 27 (33%) impaired mobility, and 69 (83%) an impaired TMT-A score. Median amount of home nursing per week was 3.6 h (interquartile range 2.6 to 23.4). Fulfilment of pre-specified needs was >60% for skin and wound care in patients with skin diseases, observation of blood glucose in patients taking antidiabetic drugs, and in supporting food intake in patients with eating difficulties. Most other needs as defined by the consensus group were fulfilled in <10% of the patients. Conclusions: We identified a very frail group of home-dwelling patients. For this group, resources for home nursing should probably be used in a more flexible and pro-active way to aim for preserving functional status, minimize symptom burden, and prevent avoidable hospitalisations.

J	Monaro, S; West, S; Gullick, J				Monaro, Susan; West, Sandra; Gullick, Janice			Patient outcomes following lower leg major amputations for peripheral arterial disease: A series review	JOURNAL OF VASCULAR NURSING			English	Article							SURGICAL-PATIENT; MORTALITY; FRAILTY; COMPLICATIONS; MORBIDITY	Introduction: Despite improvements in revascularization, major amputation remains a significant part of the case-mix in vascular surgical units. These patients tend to be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of stay (LOS). Aim: This series review provides a description of the patient complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb amputation for peripheral arterial disease. Method: Medical records coded for major amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed. Findings: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial morbidity and 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Major amputation continues to present challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding to surgery require further investigation.

PRagmatic trial Of Video Education in Nursing homes: The design and rationale for a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in the nursing home setting	CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						Cluster randomized clinical trial; advance care planning; end of life; decision aids; pragmatic trial; nursing home	RESIDENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT; IMPROVING DECISION-MAKING; FEEDING-TUBE INSERTION; ADVANCED DEMENTIA; HOSPICE ENROLLMENT; RESUSCITATE ORDERS; REGULATORY ISSUES; INFORMED-CONSENT; CARE; END	Background/Aims: Nursing homes are complex healthcare systems serving an increasingly sick population. Nursing homes must engage patients in advance care planning, but do so inconsistently. Video decision support tools improved advance care planning in small randomized controlled trials. Pragmatic trials are increasingly employed in health services research, although not commonly in the nursing home setting to which they are well-suited. This report presents the design and rationale for a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial that evaluated the ''real world'' application of an Advance Care Planning Video Program in two large US nursing home healthcare systems. Methods: PRagmatic trial Of Video Education in Nursing homes was conducted in 360 nursing homes (N = 119 intervention/N = 241 control) owned by two healthcare systems. Over an 18-month implementation period, intervention facilities were instructed to offer the Advance Care Planning Video Program to all patients. Control facilities employed usual advance care planning practices. Patient characteristics and outcomes were ascertained from Medicare Claims, Minimum Data Set assessments, and facility electronic medical record data. Intervention adherence was measured using a Video Status Report embedded into electronic medical record systems. The primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations/person-day alive among long-stay patients with advanced dementia or cardiopulmonary disease. The rationale for the approaches to facility randomization and recruitment, intervention implementation, population selection, data acquisition, regulatory issues, and statistical analyses are discussed. Results: The large number of well-characterized candidate facilities enabled several unique design features including stratification on historical hospitalization rates, randomization prior to recruitment, and 2: 1 control to intervention facilities ratio. Strong endorsement from corporate leadership made randomization prior to recruitment feasible with 100% participation of facilities randomized to the intervention arm. Critical regulatory issues included minimal risk determination, waiver of informed consent, and determination that nursing home providers were not engaged in human subjects research. Intervention training and implementation were initiated on 5 January 2016 using corporate infrastructures for new program roll-out guided by standardized training elements designed by the research team. Video Status Reports in facilities' electronic medical records permitted "real-time'' adherence monitoring and corrective actions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Virtual Research Data Center allowed for rapid outcomes ascertainment. Conclusion: We must rigorously evaluate interventions to deliver more patient-focused care to an increasingly frail nursing home population. Video decision support is a practical approach to improve advance care planning. PRagmatic trial Of Video Education in Nursing homes has the potential to promote goal-directed care among millions of older Americans in nursing homes and establish a methodology for future pragmatic randomized controlled trials in this complex healthcare setting.

Given the ageing population, the importance of providing appropriate, quality health care in the emergency department for this cohort is paramount. One possible solution, a nurse-led, physician-championed, emergency department gerontological intervention team, which provides frontload assessment, early collateral communication and appropriate discharge planning, has been developed. The aim of this Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention is to maximise the quality of care for this vulnerable cohort in a cost effective manner. Methods: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention research project consists of three interrelated studies within a program evaluation design. The research comprises of a structure, process and outcome framework to ascertain the overall utility of such a program. The first study is a pre-post comparison of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention in the emergency department, comparing the patient-level outcomes before and after service introduction using a quasi-experimental design with historical controls. The second study is a descriptive qualitative study of the structures and processes required for the operation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention and clinician and patient satisfaction with service models. The third study is an economic evaluation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention model of care. Discussion: There is a paucity of evidence in the literature to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in emergency departments designed to target frail older persons living in the community and residential aged care facilities. This is despite the high economic and patient morbidity and mortality experienced in these vulnerable cohorts. This research project will provide guidance related to the optimal structures and processes required to implement the model of care and the associated cost related outcomes.

Culturally linked risk factors and socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare disparities, and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy (HL) and HF are less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease management, or preventative health strategies. Objective: In this systematic review, we analyzed the literature studying older Latinos with HF and limited HL. Method: We searched the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. Inclusion criteria were research studies, Latinos, HF, and HL. Results: Eight quantitative studies were identified for final review. Inadequate HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL was associated with more HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL levels and higher medical complexity. Conclusions: Nurses and advanced practice nurses serve a pivotal role improving access and understanding of health information. Before conducting intervention research affecting clinical outcomes, it is essential to describe elderly Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. Barriers identified confirm the need to alter research protocols for older adults and ensure the availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older Latinos with HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients with limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be reliable predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, and develop, implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their health.

J	Smith, MB; Thomson, WM				Smith, Moira B.; Thomson, William Murray			'Not on the radar': dentists' perspectives on the oral health care of dependent older people	GERODONTOLOGY			English	Article						Older people; elderly; oral care; nursing homes; qualitative study; dental care		Objectives: We explored the following research questions: (i) what challenges do dentists face when providing oral health care to dependent older adults; and (ii) to overcome those challenges, what recommendations would dentists providing care give those planning and implementing oral health policy and services for dependent older adults? Background: The dentate older population is steadily increasing, and about half will end up in residential care, where dental caries rates over time are at least twice as great as those observed elsewhere. Materials and methods: A qualitative study was used, with semi-structured interviews conducted by a single interviewer. Dental examiners in a recent national survey of oral health in dependent older people in New Zealand were interviewed about their experiences and perspectives of that. Results: The challenges participants identified stemmed from three areas - the patient, the care facility and the oral health sector. To address those challenges, the participants recommended actions at the patient, system and sector levels. Each of the challenges and recommendations had a number of subthemes. Overall, the dentists felt that it is a very complex situation urgently requiring policy development, cross-sectoral collaboration and upskilling of the dental profession, carers, the private sector and the State to ensure a care environment which supports achieving and maintaining oral health among frail elders. Conclusions: Urgent attention to frail older New Zealanders' oral health is needed. Such attention needs to focus on not only the narrow dental clinical preventive and therapeutic implications of those needs, but also on the broader health system and policy development challenges.

Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these syndromes, particularly stroke. Purpose: This study sought to describe the clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors of adverse events. Methods: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding. Results: All-cause readmission to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. Self-reported self-care behaviour and not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Conclusion: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients and caregivers offers the potential to improve treatment knowledge, adherence and outcomes in this group of patients with complex care needs.

A formative evaluation of a nurse practitioner-led interprofessional geriatric outpatient clinic	JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE			English	Article						Geriatric assessment; interprofessional care; nurse practitioner-led; older adults; practice		The number of older adults with multiple complex comorbidities and frailty is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades, which will necessitate a concomitant increase in the need for skilled clinicians who are able to manage complex geriatric needs. Many physicians, however, lack the required formal training, often leading to long wait-lists for specialist clinics. Yet, clinics led by non-physician professionals specialising in geriatric care could decrease these delays. This article describes the development and evaluation of a nurse practitioner-led interprofessional geriatric outpatient clinic (Inter-D Clinic). A combination of semi-structured clinician interviews, post-clinic follow-up phone calls, satisfaction surveys, and information from the hospital workload management system served as data sources for this formative programme evaluation. Between January 2013 and December 2014, 293 patients were seen in the clinic with the majority being referred for either memory issues (49%) or functional decline (35%). The clinic assessment frequently uncovered other issues, which led to guidance around falls prevention, improved nutrition, medication management, and referrals to available community supports. Both patients and referring physicians were very satisfied with this model of care, which is likely transferable to other locations provided the needed clinical expertise and community support services are available.

Factors influencing deprescribing for residents in Advanced Care Facilities: insights from General Practitioners in Australia and Sweden	BMC FAMILY PRACTICE			English	Article						Deprescribing practice; General Practitioners; Polypharmacy; Ageing; Advanced Care Facilities; Nursing homes	NURSING-HOMES; OLDER-ADULTS; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; AGED-CARE; POLYPHARMACY; PERCEPTIONS; MEDICATIONS; FRAILTY; DRUGS	Background: General Practitioners (GPs) are responsible for primary prescribing decisions in most settings. Elderly patients living in Advanced Care Facilities (ACFs) often have significant co-morbidities to consider when selecting an appropriate drug therapy. Careful assessment is required when considering appropriate medication use in frail older patients as they have multiple diseases and thus multiple medication. Many physicians seem reluctant to discontinue other physicians' prescriptions, resulting in further polypharmacy. Therefore it is relevant to ascertain and synthesise the GP views from multiple settings to understand the processes that might promote appropriate deprescribing medications in the elderly. The aims of this study were to 1) compare and contrast behavioural factors influencing the deprescribing practices of GPs providing care for ACF residents in two separate countries, 2) review health policy and ACF systems in each setting for their potential impact on the prescribing of medications for an older person in residential care of the elderly, and 3) based on these findings, provide recommendations for future ACF deprescribing initiatives. Methods: A review and critical synthesis of qualitative data from two interview studies of knowledge, attitudes, and behavioural practices held by GPs towards medication management and deprescribing for residents of ACFs in Australia and Sweden was conducted. A review of policies and health care infrastructure was also carried out to describe the system of residential aged care in the both countries. Results: Our study has identified that deprescribing by GPs in ACFs is a complex process and that there are numerous barriers to medication reduction for aged care residents in both countries, both with similarities and differences. The factors affecting deprescribing behaviour were identified and divided into: intentions, skills and abilities and environmental factors. Conclusions: In this study we show that the GPs' behaviour of deprescribing in two different countries is much dependent on the larger health care system. There is a need for more education to both GPs and ACF staff as well as better cooperation between the different health care systems and appropriate monetary incentives for elderly care to achieve better conditions for deprescribing practice.

J	Bail, K; Grealish, L				Bail, Kasia; Grealish, Laurie			'Failure to Maintain': A theoretical proposition for a new quality indicator of nurse care rationing for complex older people in hospital	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						Adverse events; Cross infection; Delirium; Dementia; Ethics; Geriatrics; Health care rationing; Hospital; Frail elderly; Resource allocation	URINARY-TRACT-INFECTIONS; ELDER-LIFE-PROGRAM; PATIENT OUTCOMES; PRESSURE ULCERS; OF-CARE; LEFT UNDONE; FUNCTIONAL DECLINE; WORK ENVIRONMENTS; STAFFING LEVELS; ADVERSE EVENTS	Complex older patients represent about half of all acute public hospital admissions in Australia. People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed. This paper offers a theoretical proposition of 'Failure to Maintain' as a conceptual framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of 'Failure to Maintain'. Hospital focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). 'Failure to Maintain' offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, this vulnerable population. Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide patient focussed care, and avoid 'Failing to Maintain'. The research field of acute geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.

The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. Background. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. Design. Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT). Methods. Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. Results. Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. Conclusions. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.

J	Smith, MC; O'May, F; Tropea, S; Berg, J				Smith, Margaret Coulter; O'May, Fiona; Tropea, Savina; Berg, Jackie			Framing moving and handling as a complex healthcare intervention within the acute care of older people with osteoporosis: a qualitative study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						moving and handling patients; older people; osteoporosis; patient safety; qualitative research	HIP-FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; RISK; PREVENTION; MORTALITY; FRAILTY; NURSES; WOMEN; FALLS; STAFF	Aims and objectives. To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. Background. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched. Design. An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism. Methods. The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. Results. Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions. Conclusions. This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention.

Recently graduated nurses' experiences in municipal health care settings	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES			English	Article						Recently graduated nurses; municipal health care; virtues; professional pride; phenomenological hermeneutical	TRANSITION	BackgroundRecently graduated nurses are the future of the nursing profession and the municipal health care that will need nursing competency for an increasing number of frail elderly persons. This study is part of a larger project on newly graduated nurses where previous research indicated that building professional pride at their workplace could be important for remaining in the profession and in municipal health care. However, the recently graduated nurse's first job assignment in municipal health care can also be a critical period with cuts in their pride as nurses who may have an impact on nursing care for their patients. AimThe aim of this study is to illuminate recently graduated nurses' experiences with professional pride in municipal health and care services. MethodsA phenomenological hermeneutic approach was chosen to illuminate meaning. A purposive sample of eight recently graduated nurses working in nursing homes or home health care was chosen for this study with narrative interviews and diaries. FindingsThree themes were identified: doing the good thing and doing what is right; being recognized and confirmed; and finally thriving in a community of practice. An important source of pride is the relation to patients. Recently graduated nurses build their professional pride in an active and social process in a community of practice. The first cut in their professional pride seems to take place when they were not recognized and confirmed as professional persons. ConclusionRecently graduated nurses in municipal health care describe their professional pride as a complex phenomenon with relational, dynamic and collective dimensions. The cuts in their pride may hurt their identity and nursing care.

J	Nyborg, I; Kvigne, K; Danbolt, LJ; Kirkevold, M				Nyborg, Ingrid; Kvigne, Kari; Danbolt, Lars Johan; Kirkevold, Marit			Ambiguous participation in older hospitalized patients: gaining influence through active and passive approaches-a qualitative study	BMC NURSING			English	Article						Patient participation; Older patients; Family; Next of kin; Geriatrics; Hospital ward; Phenomenological hermeneutics	FRAIL ELDERLY-PATIENTS; DECISION-MAKING; HEALTH-CARE; INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCES; PREFERENCES; ADULTS; WARDS	Background: Patient participation is required by law in Norway and in several western countries. Current participation ideology is based on individualism, which may conflict with the older generation's commonly held values of solidarity and community. Hence, different values and ideologies may come in conflict when older patients receive treatment and rehabilitation in geriatric wards. Participation is a guiding principle in rehabilitation. Criteria for admission of older patients to geriatric wards are complex health problems, acute illness and/or acute physical and/or cognitive functional failure. The ideal is an active and engaged patient. The aim of the study was to describe the difficulties experienced by older patients on acute geriatric wards when involving themselves with their own treatment and care. Methods: In this qualitative study older patients were interviewed during hospitalization in geriatric wards and asked to tell about their experiences with participation. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. Results: The patients experienced difficulties in participating in decisions and care. They linked their difficulties to their own diminishing capabilities, and cited the ward's busy schedule as a reason for abstaining from participation. However, despite their reservations, they did participate in decisions in different ways. Their participatory practices appeared ambiguous and they employed various strategies to put themselves in a position of influence. The most important of these involved their relatives. The patients delegated to family the tasks of seeking, receiving and giving information to the nurses and the staff, and, to some extent, for the dialogues with hospital staff about their needs and plan of care. The family appeared to accept the responsibility willingly. Conclusions: The patients addressed their difficulties by authorizing family members to act and participate on their behalf. This underlines the family's important role in patient participation and the role that nurses and other staff must play in collaborating with the patient and their family to facilitate participation independently of the patients' performances of participation.

They are more likely than people who reside in the community to become acutely unwell, present to the Emergency Department (ED) and require admission to hospital. For many, hospitalisation carries with it risks. Importantly, evidence suggests that some admissions are avoidable. A new collaborative model of care, the Aged Care Emergency Service (ACE), was developed to provide clinical support to nurses in the RACFs, allowing residents to be managed in place and avoid transfer to the ED. This paper examines the effects of the ACE service on RACF residents' transfer to hospital using a controlled pre-post design. Methods: Four intervention RACFs were matched with eight control RACFs based on number of total beds, dementia specific beds, and ratio of high to low care beds in Newcastle, Australia, between March and November 2011. The intervention consisted of a clinical care manual to support care along with a nurse led telephone triage line, education, establishing goals of care prior to ED transfer, case management when in the ED, along with the development of collaborative relationships between stakeholders. Outcomes included ED presentations, length of stay, hospital admission and 28-day readmission pre- and post-intervention. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate mean differences in outcomes between intervention and controls RACFs, pre- and post-intervention means, and their interaction, accounting for repeated measures and adjusting for matching factors. Results: Residents had a mean age of 86 years. ED presentations ranged between 16 and 211 visits/100 RACF beds/year across all RACFs. There was no overall reduction in ED presentations (OR = 1.17, p = 0.56) with the ACE intervention. However, when compared to the controls, the intervention group reduced their ED length of stay by 45 min (p = 0.0575), and was 40 % less likely to be admitted to hospital,. The latter was highly significant (p = 0.0012). Conclusions: Transfers to ED and admission to hospital are common for residents of RACFs. This study has demonstrated that a complex multi-strategy intervention led by nursing staff can successfully reduce hospital admissions for older people living in Residential Aged Care Facilities. By defining goals of care prior to transfer to the ED, clinicians have the opportunity to better deliver care that patients require. Integrated care requires accountability from multiple stakeholders.

Research show that these acute care environments can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them. AimThis study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff. MethodA purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. FindingsCaring for older, acutely ill cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed. ConclusionThe comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' personal-professional integrity.

Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective. Objectives: To critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes. Methods: A review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose. Results: Five surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient. Conclusions: Historical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.

J	Morgan, B; Tarbi, E				Morgan, Brianna; Tarbi, Elise			THE ROLE OF THE ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSE IN GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY CARE	SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY NURSING			English	Article						older adult; geriatric oncology; gero-oncology nursing; advanced practice nurse	PATIENT-CENTERED CARE; PALLIATIVE CARE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; OLDER-ADULTS; CANCER CARE; DECISION-MAKING; SURVIVORSHIP; IMPACT; OUTCOMES; QUALITY	OBJECTIVES: To describe how the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) is uniquely suited to meet the needs of older adults throughout the continuum of cancer, to explore the progress that APNs have made in gero-oncology care, and make suggestions for future directions. DATA SOURCE: Google Scholar, PubMed, and CINAHL. Search terms included: "gero-oncology," "geriatric oncology," "Advanced Practice Nurse," "Nurse Practitioner," "older adult," "elderly," and "cancer." CONCLUSION: Over the last decade, APNs have made advances in caring for older adults with cancer by playing a role in prevention, screening, and diagnosis; through evidence-based gero-oncology care during cancer treatment; and in designing tailored survivorship care models. APNs must combat ageism in treatment choice for older adults, standardize comprehensive geriatric assessments, and focus on providing person-centered care, specifically during care transitions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: APNs are well-positioned to help understand the complex relationship between risk factors, geriatric syndromes, and frailty and translate research into practice. Palliative care must expand beyond specialty providers and shift toward APNs with a focus on early advanced care planning. Finally, APNs should continue to establish multidisciplinary survivorship models across care settings, with a focus on primary care.

Results from a competence measurement of nursing staff	BMC NURSING			English	Article							FOLLOW-UP; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS; HOME PATIENTS; OLDER-PEOPLE; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; DEMENTIA; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; NURSES	Background: Multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment leave many old patients in a frail condition with a high risk of adverse outcomes if proper health care is not provided. Knowledge about available competence is necessary to evaluate whether we are able to offer equitable and balanced health care to older persons with acute and/ or complex health care needs. This study investigates the sufficiency of nursing staff competence in Norwegian community elderly care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1016 nursing staff in nursing homes and home care services with the instrument "Nursing Older People - Competence Evaluation Tool". Statistical analyses were ANOVA and multiple regression. Results: We found that nursing staff have competence in all areas measured, but that the level of competence was insufficient in the areas nursing measures, advanced procedures, and nursing documentation. Nursing staff in nursing homes scored higher than staff in home care services, and older nursing staff scored lower than younger nursing staff. Conclusions: A reason for the relatively low influence of education and training on competence could be the diffuse roles that nursing staff have in community elderly care, implying that they have poor standards against which to judge their own competence. Clearer role descriptions for all groups of nursing staff are recommended as well as general competence development in geriatric nursing care.

Our emphasis was on validating an index of allostasis.Method: In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes.Results: Our results supported both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social support, optimism, and hope.Conclusion: Although these results are based on a small sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and physical resources and well-being.

The aim of this study was to examine loneliness, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and health complaints in relation to health care consumption of in- and outpatient care among frail older people living at home. The study, with a cross-sectional design, comprised a sample of 153 respondents aged from 65years (mean age 81.5years) or older, who lived at home and were frail. Data was collected utilising structured interviews in the respondent's home assessing demographic data, loneliness, HRQoL and health complaints. Patient administrative registers were used to collect data on health care consumption. Loneliness was the dependent variable in the majority of the analyses and dichotomised. For group comparisons Students t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used. The results showed that 60% of the respondents had experienced loneliness during the previous year, at least occasionally. The study identified that lonely respondents had a lower HRQoL (p=0.022), with a higher total number of reported health complaints (p=0.001), and used more outpatient services including more acute visits at the emergency department, compared to not lonely respondents (p=0.026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a depressed mood was independently associated to total use of outpatient care (B=7.4, p<0.001). Therefore, it might not be loneliness, per se, that is the reason for seeking health care. However, reasons for using health care services are difficult to determine due to the complex situation for the frail older person. To avoid emergency department visits and to benefit the well-being of the frail older person, interventions targeting the complex health situation, including loneliness, are suggested.

Feasibility of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac surgery: A mixed-methods study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING			English	Article						Feasibility; frailty; older people; cardiac surgery; prevention; postoperative complications	COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTIONS; HIGH-RISK; CARE; PREVENTION; DELIRIUM; QUALITY; COMPLICATIONS; INSTRUMENTS; DEPRESSION	Background: Given the growing number of vulnerable, older cardiac surgery patients, the preadmission PREvention Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery patients (PREDOCS) programme was developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with the acceptability, compliance and delivery. Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings. Methods: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI). Results: Twenty-one females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients. Conclusions: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 773 older persons (74.4% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. Measurements: The FI was computed as the ratio between actual and 30 potential deficits the participant might have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 deficits]). Death events were monitored and detected over a 12-month follow-up. The risk of death was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Mean age of participants was 86.2 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.35 (SD 0.11). At the end of the follow-up, 135 (17.4%) death events were recorded. A positive association between the FI and mortality (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.018, 95% confidence interval 1.002-1.035, P = .03) was reported. The use of the traditional 0.25 cut-point for detecting the frailty status is inadequate in this population. Conclusion: The FI is able to predict mortality even in very old and complex elders, such as nursing home residents. (C) 2015 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

The intervention included geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes. BackgroundImprovements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life satisfaction are not well explored. DesignRandomised controlled study. MethodsThe validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12months after the baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as well as six- to 12-month follow-ups. ResultsOlder persons who received the intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who received usual care, between 6 and 12month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. ConclusionsA comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Relevance to clinical practiceFrail older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.

It is challenging to nurse frail older people in hospitals, and a lack of appropriate knowledge of geriatric giants can result in work-related stress. Sources of stress and coping mechanisms have been studied, but the impact of intervention with regular teaching sessions at the ward level is unclear. Aims: This work aims to find out the prevalence of work-related stress level in care of the elderly wards and also to find out whether improvement in the knowledge of common problems (geriatric giants) in older people would help alleviate the stress level in our study group. Methods: All nurses in the two care of the elderly wards were enrolled for the study. Teaching on understanding and management of delirium, dementia, malnutrition, incontinence, pressure sores, postural instability, and falls was delivered twice per week for 6 consecutive weeks. The teaching cycle of 6 weeks was repeated two more times to cover night shifts and leaves. This was done to ensure that each staff member has attended at least one teaching session on each of the six topics over 18 weeks. Results: Stress levels among staff members were measured using a validated scale, the Expanded Nursing Stress Scale, at the beginning and end of these 18 weeks. Conclusion: Although the mean overall stress scores were lower after the teaching, this was not statistically significant. However, subanalyses showed significant reduction in stress from their routine workload in managing complex and frail older people.

J	Tocchi, C				Tocchi, Christine			Frailty in Older Adults: An Evolutionary Concept Analysis	RESEARCH AND THEORY FOR NURSING PRACTICE			English	Article						frailty; concept analysis; older adult; elderly	HEALTH; DISABILITY; DEFINITION; PREVALENCE; OUTCOMES; DECLINE	The term frailty is often used to describe a subset of the older population with complex health issues. It is associated with dependence, disability, increased health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.

J	Shin, SY				Shin, So Young			Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis: An Integration of Theory of Symptom Management and Disablement Process Model	ASIAN NURSING RESEARCH			English	Review						arthritis; disabled persons; disease management; frail elderly; nursing theory	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; PREVALENCE	To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

Development of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac surgery (the PREDOCS programme), following phase one of the guidelines of the Medical Research Council	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING			English	Article						Frailty; older people; cardiac surgery; prevention; postoperative complications	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; EVALUATING COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; HIGH-RISK; CABG SURGERY; DELIRIUM; COMPLICATIONS; CHLORHEXIDINE; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION	Background: In older patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the timely identification and preparation of patients at risk for frequent postoperative hospital complications provide opportunities to reduce the risk of these complications. Aims: We developed an evidence-based, multi-component nursing intervention (Prevention of Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery Patients; the PREDOCS programme) for application in the preadmission period to improve patients' physical and psychosocial condition to reduce their risk of postoperative complications. This paper describes in detail the process used to design and develop this multi-component intervention. Methods: In a team of researchers, experts, cardiac surgeons, registered cardiac surgery nurses, and patients, the revised guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions of the Medical Research Council (MRC) were followed, including identifying existing evidence, identifying and developing theory and modelling the process and outcomes. Additionally, the criteria for reporting the development of complex interventions in healthcare (CReDECI) were followed. Results: The intervention is administered during a consultation by the nurse two to four weeks before the surgery procedure. The consultation includes three parts: a general part for all patients, a second part in which patients with an increased risk are identified, and a third part in which selected patients are informed about how to prepare themselves for the hospital admission to reduce their risk. Conclusions: Following the MRC guidelines, an extended, stepwise, multi-method procedure was used to develop the multi-component nursing intervention to prepare older patients for cardiac surgery, creating transparency in the assumed working mechanisms. Additionally, a detailed description of the intervention is provided.	[Ettema, Roelof G.

Do Gerontology Nurse Specialists Make a Difference in Hospitalization of Long-Term Care Residents? Results of a Randomized Comparison Trial	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article						homes for the aged; clinical nurse specialist; frail older adults; community outreach	POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS; OLDER-PEOPLE; AGED CARE; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; QUALITY; HOMES; POPULATION	Residents of long-term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program (RACIP) is a quality improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on-site support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology nurse specialists (GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of hospitalization 1year before and after program implementation. The sample included 29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention group (rate ratio (RR)=0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.61-0.86, P<.001). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group (69% increase) (RR=0.67, 95% CI=0.56-0.82, P<.001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention and comparison groups (RR= 1.0, 95% CI=0.68-1.46, P=.99). The integration of GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.

We report on the development and implementation of four such pathways within two National Health Service primary care trusts in England: (a) frail elderly care, (b) stroke care, (c) diabetic retinopathy screening and (d) intermediate care. The pathways were selected because each represents a different type of information and data couplings', in terms of task interdependency with some pathways/systems reflecting more complex coordinating patterns than others. Our aim here is identify and explain how health professionals and information specialists in two organisational National Health Service primary care trusts organisationally construct and use such systems and, in particular, the implications this has for issues of professional and managerial control and autonomy.

The Modified Hospital Elder Life Program Adapting a Complex Intervention for Feasibility and Scalability in a Surgical Setting	JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING			English	Article							SHARED RISK-FACTORS; GERIATRIC SYNDROMES; OLDER PATIENTS; INPATIENTS; EXERCISE; SURGERY; FRAILTY; ADULTS	The purpose of this article is to provide the rationale and methods for adapting the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP). The HELP is a complex intervention that has been shown to reduce rates of delirium and functional decline. However, modification of the program may be required to meet local circumstances and specialized populations. We selected three key elements based on our prior work and the concept of shared risk factors and modified the HELP to include only three shared risk factors (functional, nutritional, and cognitive status) that were targeted by three nursing protocols: early mobilization, oral and nutritional assistance, and orienting communication. These protocols were adapted, refined, and pilot-tested for feasibility and efficacy. We hope by reporting the rationale and protocols for the modified HELP, we will advance the field for others adapting evidence-based, complex nursing interventions.

Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.

Exploring the expectations, needs and experiences of general practitioners and nurses towards a proactive and structured care programme for frail older patients: a mixed-methods study	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						frailty; practice nurses; general practitioner; older people; primary care	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS; HEALTH-CARE; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; RESEARCH AGENDA; MULTIMORBIDITY; PEOPLE; METAANALYSIS; CHALLENGES; DESIGN	Abstract Aim To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and practice nurses regarding the U-CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. Background Care for older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. Design An explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. Methods The barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and expectations regarding the U-CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires sent to all participating general practitioners (n = 32) and practice nurses (n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. Results Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to provide structured care. Conclusion This explanatory mixed-methods study showed that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U-CARE programme as feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care towards a proactive and preventive care approach.

Development of a Proactive Care Program (U-CARE) to Preserve Physical Functioning of Frail Older People in Primary Care	JOURNAL OF NURSING SCHOLARSHIP			English	Article						Frailty; comprehensive geriatric assessment; older people; primary care; nurse	COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; HEALTH-CARE; GERIATRIC SYNDROMES; CHRONIC ILLNESS; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; GUIDED CARE; ADULTS; INSTITUTE; DECLINE	Purpose: Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. Methods: The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. Findings: Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. Conclusions: Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice. Clinical Relevances: The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.

The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated. Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design. Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands. Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (>= 70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded. Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions. Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. Conclusions: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the protocol need special attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination and technology. Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. Setting: Older adults having difficulty in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. Methods: All participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. Discussion: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.

Background Few studies have examined the interrelationships among caregivers' working conditions, care-giving dynamics and caregiver well-being. Design Cross-sectional, correlational study. Methods Data were collected by self-completed questionnaires from 176 primary family caregivers of patients with dementia in Taiwan from May 2005January 2006. Caregiver role strain and mental health were analysed by multiple regressions using a hierarchical method to enter independent variables and two- and three-way interaction terms after controlling for caregiver age and gender, employment status, and work flexibility and the simple effect of each independent variable. Results More preparedness was associated with less role strain for family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict. More care-giving demand was associated with poorer mental health only for caregivers with low work/care-giving conflict and with average and low preparedness, but not high preparedness. For family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict, more preparedness decreased role strain and maintained mental health even when care-giving demand was high. Conclusion These results provide a knowledge base for understanding complex family caregiver phenomena and serve as a guide for developing interventions. Future studies with longitudinal follow-ups are suggested to explore actual causal relationships.

During transitions, residents frequently experience care that is delayed, unnecessary, not evidence-based, potentially unsafe, and fragmented. Furthermore, a high proportion of residents and their family caregivers report substantial unmet needs during transitions. This study is part of a program of research whose overall aim is to improve quality of care for frail older adults who reside in NHs. The purpose of this study is to identify successful transitions from multiple perspectives and to identify organizational and individual factors related to transition success, in order to inform improvements in care for frail elderly NH residents during transitions to and from acute care. Specific objectives are to: 1. define successful and unsuccessful elements of transitions from multiple perspectives; 2. develop and test a practical tool to assess transition success; 3. assess transition processes in a discrete set of transfers in two study sites over a one year period; 4. assess the influence of organizational factors in key practice locations, e.g., NHs, emergency medical services (EMS), and EDs, on transition success; and 5. identify opportunities for evidence-informed management and quality improvement decisions related to the management of NH - ED transitions. Methods/Design: This is a mixed-methods observational study incorporating an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) approach. It uses data from multiple levels (facility, care unit, individual) and sources (healthcare providers, residents, health records, and administrative databases). Discussion: Key to study success is operationalizing the IKT approach by using a partnership model in which the OPTIC governance structure provides for team decision-makers and researchers to participate equally in developing study goals, design, data collection, analysis and implications of findings. As preliminary and ongoing study findings are developed, their implications for practice and policy in study settings will be discussed by the research team and shared with study site administrators and staff. The study is designed to investigate the complexities of transitions and to enhance the potential for successful and sustained improvement of these transitions.

Standards of medical care for nursing home residents in Europe	EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE			English	Article						Aged; Nursing homes; Care standards	OLDER-PEOPLE; PHYSICIAN	Objective: Nursing home inhabitants represent the most vulnerable and frail group of older people. They have more complex medical backgrounds and more significant care requirements. With an ever-ageing European population, the number of people requiring nursing home care will only increase. It is important then that we optimise the medical care of older people living in nursing homes. Methods: Formalized care standards are essential to optimal care but we feel that such guidelines are lacking. We decided to investigate this by means of a survey on nursing home care standards sent to the geriatric medicine societies around Europe. Results: Only five of 25 (20%) health services have a requirement for specific training in geriatric medicine for doctors in nursing homes, while only three of 25 (12%) countries have written medical care standards applicable to nursing home care provided by professional organizations. Four of 25 (16%) had a nursing home doctor society and one of these, The Netherlands, provided written medical care standards for nursing homes which were also adopted by the relevant general practitioner society. Discussion: The Europe-wide deficiency of documented care standards for nursing homes is alarming. It should be a prerequisite that physicians dealing with these complex patients have undertaken some level of specific training in geriatric medicine. It is important that geriatricians, old age psychiatrists and family doctors across European countries engage more formally on the development of appropriate models for both developing care standards and specifying appropriate training and support for doctors working in nursing homes.

This will lead to an increased need for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance personnel to understand and meet these patients' care needs. Using a caring science approach, we apply the patient's perspective, and the aim of this study is to identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the assessment category "general affected health condition". Thus, we have analyzed the characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state of "general affected health condition", as either illness or ill-health. This offers a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the concept of frailty ought to be included in "The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (ICD-10). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Effective partnerships between primary and secondary care will be of benefit to these residents. We looked at 1954 admission episodes to our Trust from April 2006 to March 2009 inclusive. 3 nursing homes had the highest number of multiple admissions (>= 4). Four strategies to reduce hospital admissions were used at these nursing homes for 3 months. An alert was also sent to the geriatrician if one of the residents was admitted so that their discharge from hospital could be expedited. The project was then extended for another 4 months with 6 nursing homes. The results showed that geriatrician input into nursing homes had a significant impact on admissions from nursing homes (chi(2)(2) = 6.261, p < 0.05). The second part of the project also showed significant impact on admissions (chi(2)(2) = 12.552, p < 0.05). Furthermore, in both parts of the project the length of stay in hospital for the residents was reduced. Geriatricians working together with co-ordinated multidisciplinary teams are well placed to manage the care needs of frail, elderly care home residents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Nursing home residents are frail older adults with complex needs, dependent on advanced nursing care. Long-term residents in nursing homes have long-term relationships with the nurses, which require a unique approach to the interpersonal aspects of nursing care. Understanding what is experienced as care quality, including quality of interpersonal processes, requires insight into the residents' perspectives for best value in care to be realized. Objective: Main objective was to describe the nursing home residents' experience with direct nursing care, related to the interpersonal aspects of quality of care. Design: A descriptive, exploratory design was used. Settings: Four public municipal nursing homes in Norway with long-term residents were purposely selected for the study. Participants: Fifteen mentally lucid residents were included. The inclusion criteria were aged 65 and over, being a resident of the nursing home for one month or longer, and physical and mental capacity to participate in the interview. Method: In-depth interviews with the residents were performed. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using meaning categorizing. Results: The residents emphasized the importance of nurses acknowledging their individual needs, which included need for general and specialized care, health promotion and prevention of complications, and prioritizing the individuals. The challenging balance between self-determination and dependency, the altered role from homeowner to resident, and feelings of indignity and depreciation of social status were key issues in which the residents perceived that their integrity was at risk in the patient-nurse interaction and care. Psychosocial well-being was a major issue, and the residents expressed an important role of the nursing staff helping them to balance the need for social contact and to be alone, and preserving a social network. Conclusions: Quality nursing care in nursing home implies a balanced, individual approach to medical, physical and psychosocial care, including interpersonal aspects of care. The interpersonal relationship between resident and nurse implies long-term commitment, reciprocal relationship on a personal level and interpersonal competence of the nurses to understand each resident's needs.

Contextual factors influencing success or failure of emergency department interventions for cognitively impaired older people: a scoping and integrative review	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Review						cognitively impaired; emergency department; frail older people; older adults; quality improvement	CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD; NURSES IMPROVING CARE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; MENTAL STATUS; HOSPITAL ADMISSION; REPEAT EMERGENCY; ADVERSE EVENTS; PATIENT SAFETY; SCREENING TOOL; ED PATIENTS	Aim. This paper is a report of a scoping review of research on cognitive impairment in older adults who visit Emergency Departments of acute care hospitals, followed by an integrative review that included a quality assessment to determine the effectiveness of interventions for this population. Background. Being old and cognitively impaired in the Emergency Department - a fast-paced intervention system -is a complex phenomenon that challenges many healthcare professionals. The rise in the incidence and prevalence of dementia will have a large impact on healthcare systems. Data sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, AgeLine, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2008, for qualitative or quantitative studies reporting extractable data on delirium or dementia in non-institutionalized older people (65+ years) in the Emergency Department. Review methods. Titles screened by a project researcher and checked against inclusion criteria by another researcher. Two reviewers completed independent data extraction and synthesis of included studies. Quality assessment occurred using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tools. Results. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for integrative review. Analysis of these studies indicates that the prevalence of cognitive impairment is high and improvements are needed. Contextual details and relevant features of an appropriate intervention are poorly explained. Conclusion. Although the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment is recognized, appropriate interventions and programmatic responses remain elusive. Quality improvements require more thorough examination of emergency department context to identify modifiable influencing factors that are transferable across settings.

Linking Home Care Interventions and Hospitalization Outcomes for Frail and Non-Frail Elderly Patients	RESEARCH IN NURSING & HEALTH			English	Article						systems research/patterns of care; nursing care/interventions; home care; computers/technology; statistical test development/refinement	HEALTH-CARE; OLDER-PEOPLE; PREVENTION; TRIALS	Structured clinical data generated using standardized terminologies such as the Omaha System are available for evaluating healthcare quality and patient outcomes. New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is needed and the level of care that is provided.

Unravelling the differences between complexity and frailty in old age: findings from a constructivist grounded theory study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						elderly care; geriatric psychiatry; mental health; nursing; qualitative methodology	ADULTS	Accessible summary UK health policy is often concerned with meeting the needs of the increasing number of older people in society and within some of this policy the concepts 'frailty' and 'complexity' have been used interchangeably. The concepts are not seen as the same by registered nurses who work in an older people's mental health service. Frailty is generally described as a physical state leading to inevitable decline and death. There is an abundance of research into frailty, much of which has the ultimate aim of prevention of disability and reduction of health care needs. Some critics view the emphasis on frailty as an example of the way that some health staff turn old age into a problem. To date, there has been little research into complexity in either old age, in mental health, or from a nursing perspective. Nurses described complexity as a dynamic state from which there can be 'recovery' and movement back and forth. Understanding complexity is important if the needs of older people are to be met effectively. This study found that nurses share common perceptions of complexity but do not always find it easy to articulate these. Abstract UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						Hong Kong; nurses; nursing; older patients; qualitative; urinary tract infection	URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION; LONG-TERM; MANAGEMENT; RESISTANCE; ERA	Aims. This study aims to explore nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem. Background. Urinary tract infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition. Design. Qualitative. Methods. A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Results. When managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed the basis for deciding whether the patient's urinary condition should be managed by nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to improve nurses' existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified. Conclusion. Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem. Relevance to clinical practice. Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive 'basic urinary tract infection care' on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.

This article describes the content of and adherence with a nurse-led home visiting programme (Dutch Geriatric Intervention Programme; DGIP) for vulnerable older people. The randomised Dutch EASYcare Study showed positive patient endpoints for DGIP. Describing content and adherence is rarely performed, but highly important for understanding the results of trials. Method. DGIP is a complex multicomponent intervention tailored to the patients' needs. This process evaluation describes these components and patient characteristics and creates meaningful clusters of these specific components using hierarchical cluster analysis. Both patient/caregiver and physician adherence rates and possible predictors were investigated. Results. In line with the heterogeneity among the subjects, the individual treatment plans turned out to be highly tailored. Cluster analysis identified five clusters of intervention components. DGIP turned out to be largely unsuitable for one group of very vulnerable older participants in urgent need of more care. Overall, physician adherence was 75% and was better than patient adherence (51% complete/partial adherence). Adherence levels increased when both patients, caregivers and physicians received recommendations. Conclusions. The content of a multicomponent tailored home-visiting programme was very diverse, matching the heterogeneity among frail elderly subjects. Detailed process and cluster analysis helped to understand the content of the intervention, sharpen target criteria and identify possibilities to improve adherence.	[Melis, Rene J.

The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement. Background. Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations. Design. This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. Methods. The convenience sample (n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results. Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. Conclusions. Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues. Relevance to clinical practice. Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.

These conditions frequently coexist, and each carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with hypertension. Data sources A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. Conclusions Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication management accordingly. Implications for practice This article will assist the NP to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.

Minimal effect on energy intake by additional evening meal for frail elderly service flat residents - A pilot study	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Article						nutrition; meals; energy intake; frail elderly; nursing care; community care	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MENTAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; OLDER-PEOPLE; HEALTH; FOOD; RISK; SUPPLEMENTATION; MALNUTRITION; POPULATION	Background: Nutritional problems are common in frail elderly individuals receiving municipal care. Objective: To evaluate if an additional evening meal could improve total daily food intake, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in frail elderly service flat (SF) residents. Design: Out of 122 residents in two SF complexes, 60 subjects agreed to participate, of which 49 subjects (median 84 (79-90) years, (25th-75th percentile)) completed the study. For six months 23 residents in one SF complex were served 530 kcal in addition to their regular meals, i.e. intervention group (I-group). Twenty-six residents in the other SF building were controls (C-group). Nutritional status, energy and nutrient intake, length of night time fast, cognitive function and HRQOL was assessed before and after the intervention. Results: At the start, the Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 27% as malnourished and 63% as at risk for malnutrition, with no difference between the groups. After six months the median body weight was unchanged in the 1-group, +0.6 (-1.7 - +1.6) kg (p=0.72) and the C-group -0.6 (-2.0 - +0.5) kg (p=0.15). Weight change ranged from -13% to +15%. The evening meal improved the protein and carbohydrate intake (p<0.01) but the energy intake increased by only 180 kcal/day (p=0.15). The night time fast decreased in the I-group from 15.0 (13.0-16.0) to 13.0 (12.0-14.0) hours (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in cognitive function or HRQOL between the groups. Conclusion: Nine out of ten frail elderly SF residents had nutritional problems.

Who cares for older people with mental illness? A survey of residential aged care facilities in the Australian Capital Territory: Implications for mental health nursing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						dementia; mental health nursing; mental illness; residential aged care; social justice		Residential aged care facilities are increasingly becoming locations wherein the most frail and older people with mental illness live out the remainder of their lives, yet it has become apparent in recent years that these institutions are fraught with a variety of social and clinical problems. One issue of concern has been the exodus of registered nurses (both general and psychiatric), who have been increasingly replaced by carers with little or no expertise in psychiatric illness or disorders of cognitive decline. This 'de-professionalizing' of aged care has important implications for the well-being of clients, particularity those with complex mental health problems. In this survey we sought to discover demographic information concerning those who provide front-line care to this population of aged Australians, and we sought also to ascertain how much education in caring for residents who suffer specifically from neurodegenerative disorders (the dementias) and mental illness was provided by the facilities to those who care for such older people. The lack of training in the areas of mental health and cognitive impairment raises a variety of issues that mental health nurses need to address. These issues cover clinical, professional, and social justice dimensions. We believe that mental health nurses are strategically and professionally placed to take a leadership role in raising the profile of aged care in this country and they need to act proactively to secure the well-being of this particularly vulnerable client group.

Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what matters most in relation to their quality of life.

As a first step in developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer services than NHs. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Garg, AX; Papaioannou, A; Ferko, N; Campbell, G; Clarke, JA; Ray, JG				Garg, AX; Papaioannou, A; Ferko, N; Campbell, G; Clarke, JA; Ray, JG			Estimating the prevalence of renal insufficiency in seniors requiring long-term care	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						nursing homes; mass screening; geriatric assessment; kidney diseases; glomerular filtration rate; cross-sectional studies; prevalence	GLOMERULAR-FILTRATION-RATE; SERUM CREATININE LEVELS; 3RD NATIONAL-HEALTH; CLEARANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; PREDICTION; DISEASE	Background. Renal function declines with age, but little is known about the extent of renal insufficiency among the institutionalized elderly. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a large sample of elderly adults living in long-term care facilities, and to compare two commonly used methods for estimating GFR. Methods. A total of 9931 residents aged 65 years and older participated in a retrospective cross-sectional study of 87 long-term care facilities in Ontario. GFR was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equations. The prevalence of low GFR, using the Cockcroft-Gault equation ( 30 mL/min), was compared with the MDRD equation (<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Results. A total of 17.0% (95% CI 15.6 to 18.5) of men and 14.4% (95% CI 13.6 to 15.3) of women had a serum creatinine concentration above the laboratory reported upper reference limit of normal. The prevalence of both elevated serum creatinine and low GFR were observed to increase with age (P < 0.0001). The Cockcroft-Gault equation produced a consistently lower estimate of GFR than did the MDRD equation, a discrepancy most pronounced in the oldest residents. Among all men, a low GFR was more prevalent using the Cockcroft-Gault (10.3%, 95% CI 9.2 to 11.5) than MDRD (3.5%, 95% CI 2.8 to 4.2) equation, with a similar difference also seen in women (23.3%, 95% CI 22.4 to 24.3 versus 4.0%, 95% CI 3.6 to 4.5, respectively). Of all residents whose Cockcroft-Gault estimated GFR was under 30 mL/min, 14.7% (95% CI 13.2 to 16.3) were found to have GFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) according to the MDRD equation. Conclusion. Age-associated renal impairment is common among elderly long-term care residents, but there exists a clear discrepancy between the Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD equations in predicting GFR. Consideration should be given to medication dose adjustment, based on a practical estimate of GFR. However clarification is needed about which method, if either, is most valid among the frail elderly. Complex patient and societal issues surrounding advanced care directives, treatments associated with renal insufficiency, and, if and when to initiate dialysis, require further attention.

The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy in identifying and describing older adults as frail. Background. Despite the dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. Method. The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. Conclusion. The review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the contribution of both individual and environmental factors.

With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. Aims of the paper. This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of research related to ethical practice. Conclusions. Recruitment of frail older people to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older people to research while protecting their right to refuse.

Although much has been written about how health professionals and family caregivers should relate to one another, we know very little about the relationships that develop between them. Using data from a qualitative study, this article illustrates that relationships between community nurses and family members caring for frail elders are complex. dynamic, and multifaceted. Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient. Each type is described, and implications for nursing practice and research are discussed.

Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively with members of a multidisciplinary team.

(1) To identify resident and organizational factors associated with the use of advance care plans pre-and post-implementation of the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA), and (2) to identify changes (pre-and post-implementation of the PSDA) in the relationship between these factors and the use of advance care plans. Design. Complex, multistage cluster sampling. Setting. Ten states were selected for variation in geographic location, Medicaid reimbursement rate, and average staffing patterns. Participants were 4,215 nursing home residents in 268 facilities. Principal Findings. Seventeen resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders in 1990, and 12 resident and organizational factors were associated with their use in 1993. Five factors showed a significant change from 1990 to 1993: activities of daily living (ADL) scores, race, cognitive performance scale (CPS) scores, full-time equivalent (FTE) nurse aides per resident, and bed size. Ten resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of do-not-hospitalize (DNH) orders in 1990 and six resident and organizational factors were associated with DNH orders in 1993. Four factors showed a significant change from 1990 to 1993: legal guardian, FTE LPNs per resident, Medicaid census, and for-profit ownership. Five resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of living wills in 1990 and seven resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of living wills in 1993. Four factors showed a significant change from 1990 to 1993: ADL scores, race, length of stay, and for-profit ownership. Conclusion. The results indicate that the PSDA may have been successful in increasing the use of advance care plans and in changing the types of residents who use advance care plans. However, they also show that the use of advance care plans is associated with organizational characteristics, indicating that some types of facilities may be more willing and able to address the PSDA mandates.

The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.

There are few studies that document the outcomes experienced by very old patients who undergo major surgery. Methods. This is a case series and 7-year follow-up of 116 consecutive patients who were aged 90 years or older and underwent major surgery at a large university-affiliated community hospital. We describe the functional status, short- and long-term mortality, and predictors of mortality in this group of frail elders. Results. The 116 nonagenarians in this study underwent 134 major operations. Sixty-three patients were admitted to the hospital from a nursing home. The most common surgical procedures were for hip fracture, lower extremity amputation, and abdominal problems. Nineteen patients died in the hospital following surgery, and 23 patients died within 30 days of operation. Follow-up at 7 years revealed that all but three patients had died. Survival was worse for patients admitted from nursing homes, those who were nonambulatory before surgery, and those with major or complete functional impairment. Conclusions. Major surgery in nonagenarians is associated with a 20% perioperative mortality. Functional status and ambulatory ability are maintained in most patients. Whether to operate on these frail elders is a complex decision.

Home care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A major theme identified was ''Circles of Care.'' Grounded in rural culture. the circles assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.

J	JACKSON, MF				JACKSON, MF			DISCHARGE PLANNING - ISSUES AND CHALLENGES FOR GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING - A CRITIQUE OF THE LITERATURE	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article							GERIATRIC CONSULTATION TEAM; FRAIL ELDERLY PATIENTS; REHABILITATION UNIT; CONTROLLED TRIAL; CLINICAL-TRIAL; MEDICAL WARDS; CARE; STAY; HOSPITALIZATION; PLACEMENT	Families are rapidly becoming unpaid givers of complex care. Using McKeehan & Coulton's systems model, this critique reviews the evolution of the structure and processes of discharge planning programmes. It explores three common assumptions: discharge planning programmes are cost-effective, allow for enhancement of patients' and families' quality of life, and ensure continuity of care between hospital and community. Funds are saved due to decreased lengths of initial hospital admissions and readmission rates. However, the cost of additional hospital and community resources is rarely considered. Little evidence supports the concept that discharge planning directly affects a patient's health status. Patients and families often do not perceive the same level of benefit from discharge planning as do health professionals. Several issues surrounding research methodologies used in the reviewed studies are identified. Of particular concern is the lack of qualitative research into patients' and families' experiences. The critique concludes with an exploration of ethical issues and challenges arising from increased emphasis on cost-effective discharge planning. These include patients' rights, provision of sufficient human, social and financial resources, improved hospital-community communications, and control over hospital-developed but community-implemented programmes.
