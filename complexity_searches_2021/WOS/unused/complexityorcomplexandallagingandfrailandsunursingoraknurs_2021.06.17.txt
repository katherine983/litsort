Andrew, Melissa/AAR-7052-2021				Impact of Social Frailty on Relocation of Older Adults								JOURNAL OF FRAILTY & AGING											10.14283/jfa.2021.3		MAY 2021			2021	Background: The relationship between frailty and variables such as housing are the least included in models of frailty and research on frailty or social frailty and relocation is negligible. The decision to relocate is complex and demanding for older adults with a loss of independence but little is known about what makes older adults relocate to congregated housing designated for older adults, let alone in combination with social frailty, and how they navigate this transition. Objectives: This mixed method descriptive study aims to understand the influence of social frailty for a population of French-speaking semi-independent older adults relocating to a housing continuum community. Design: Semi-structured individual interviews including sociodemographic data and the PRISMA-7 Frailty Scale were conducted with recently relocated older adults. Setting: A newly opened French-speaking housing continuum community in Eastern Canada that offers luxury apartments for independent older adults, two assisted living facilities for semi-independent older adults along with a long-term care facility. Participants: Twenty-nine older adults with a mean age of 85 years, mostly female, married or widowed and highly educated. Measurements Content analysis of the transcribed recorded interviews and descriptive statistical analyses to examine relationships between the frailty PRISMA-7 scale, answers to additional questions and the sociodemographic data. Results: There was not a significant difference in the scores for socialization before and after relocation nor between prior help and current help; however, there was a significant negative correlation between help and socialization before and after relocation. Three main themes included: imposed influences, push and pull factors and post relocation. Conclusions: The results indicate that several social factors contributed to relocation and that participants were experiencing social frailty. Participants were at the crossover point of being vulnerable to experiencing additional deficits which would potentially have led to higher frailty had they not relocated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2260-1341	2273-4309		WOS:000649209100001	34105710

The aim of the study was to evaluate Palliative Needs and other conditions such as fragility, complexity, and prognosis and also to suggest new indicators for the establishment of the resident's advanced chronic condition. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 149 nursing homes Complex Chronic residents evaluated by trained professionals. Palliative Care Needs, assessed by the NECPAL ICO-CCOMS (c) tool, and fragility, case and palliative complexity and prognosis were evaluate through a comprehensive assessment. Descriptive analyses and association measures were performed setting the statistical significance at 0.05. Results: More than 50% of the residents had positive Surprise Question and other Palliative Needs and were classified as Advanced Chronic Patients. Distress and/or Severe Adaptative Disorder was the most frequent need shown by the residents and significant differences in levels of frailty and other characteristics, were found between the Positive and the Negative Surprise Question Groups. Statistically significant correlations were also found between aspects of both groups. Conclusions: Nursing homes residents show Palliative Needs regardless of the response to the Surprise Question of the NECPAL tool. Other characteristics such as presence of an intermediate level of frailty are suggested as a new perspective to identify advanced chronic patients among nursing homes residents.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1660-4601		WOS:000639190800001	33808567

Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 CCB professionals (cardiac nurses, community nurses and primary care physical therapists), from June 2017 until October 2018. Qualitative data-analysis is based on thematic analysis and integrated with quantitative key element outcomes. The analysis was blinded to trial outcomes. Fidelity was defined as the level of intervention adherence.Results The overall intervention fidelity was 67%, ranging from severely low fidelity in the consultation of in-hospital geriatric teams (17%) to maximum fidelity in the comprehensive geriatric assessment (100%). Main themes of influence in the intervention performance that emerged from the interviews are interdisciplinary collaboration, organizational preconditions, confidence in the programme, time management and patient characteristics. In addition to practical issues, the patient's frailty status and limited motivation were barriers to the intervention.Conclusion Although involved healthcare professionals expressed their confidence in the intervention, the fidelity rate was suboptimal. This could have influenced the non-significant effect of the CCB intervention on the primary composite outcome of readmission and mortality 6 months after randomization. Feasibility of intervention key elements should be reconsidered in relation to experienced barriers and the population.Impact In addition to insight in effectiveness, insight in intervention fidelity and performance is necessary to understand the mechanism of impact. This study demonstrates that the suboptimal fidelity was subject to a complex interplay of organizational, professionals' and patients' issues. The results support intervention redesign and inform future development of transitional care interventions in older cardiac patients.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000618632800001	33594695	
J	Deschacht, Martha; Malfait, Simon; Eeckloo, Kristof								Integrated care for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium: Lessons learned the hard way								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING				16	3					e12366	10.1111/opn.12366		FEB 2021		MAY 2021	2021	The corona pandemic challenges countries worldwide in many different ways. Due to its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in their own environment.Implications for practice: This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000616831800001	33570259

Transitional care from skilled nursing facilities to home: study protocol for a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial								TRIALS				22	1					120	10.1186/s13063-021-05068-0				FEB 5 2021	2021	Background Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. Methods The study will test the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden and distress. Discussion Study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1745-6215		WOS:000617401000005	33546737

However, attracting, recruiting and retaining staff is one of the biggest challenges facing this sector. There is evidence available that describes factors that influence staff decisions to join and/or remain in the care home workforce, for example, individual rewards (such as feeling valued at work or training opportunities), relationships with colleagues and residents, supportive management or working arrangements (including flexible hours). However, it is less clear how different strategies are informed by evidence to improve recruitment and retention. Care homes are heterogeneous in terms of their size, staffing levels and mix, staff age groups, geographical location and working conditions. What matters to different members of the care home workforce will vary across nurses and care workers of different ages and levels of qualification or experience. Recognising this diversity is key: understanding how to attract, recruit and retain staff needs to discriminate and offer solutions that address this diversity. This important area of practice does not lend itself to a 'one-approach-fits-all' solution. This commentary provides a brief overview of known workforce challenges for the care home sector and argues for studies that use empirical evidence to test different theories of what might work for different staff, how and why, and in different circumstances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-0729	1468-2834		WOS:000646848300015	32614968	
J	van der Cingel, Margreet; Bulle-Smid, Loes; Holterman, Sander; Prins, Hilco; Keuning, Wouter; Hettinga, Marike								From clinical reasoning to ehealth interventions; a study on how nurses asses care and ehealth in home care								NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE				50						102925	10.1016/j.nepr.2020.102925				JAN 2021	2021	The assessment of care in homecare today is complex. Nurses have to decide on care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-5953			WOS:000614932700007	33285403

Frailty Index, Hospital Admission and Number of Days Spent in Hospital in Nursing Home Residents: Results from the INCUR Study								JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING				25	2			155	159		10.1007/s12603-020-1561-7		DEC 2020		FEB 2021	2021	Objectives To investigate the predictive capacity of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood) for hospital admission (HA) and number of days spent in hospital (DSH) among nursing home residents. Design, setting and participants Data are from a longitudinal cohort study, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents (INCUR), of 768 elder people (75.4% women) living in 13 nursing homes in France. Measurements The FI was computed taking into account 30 possible deficits at the baseline visit. Hospital admissions were defined as all urgent and involuntary admissions including unplanned readmissions. The length of stay was the total number of days spent by the resident in the hospital. Cox proportional hazard models in the presence of competing risks (death) were performed to study the relationship between the FI and HA over a 12-month follow-up. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was performed to study the association between the FI and DSH. Results Mean age of participants was 86.7 (standard deviation [SD] 6.9) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11). At the end of the follow-up, 238 (30.9%) HA events were recorded. Positive associations of the FI with DSH and HA were reported (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.020-1.297, p=0.02 and OR 1.209 (1.075-1.359, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusions and Implications The FI is a strong predictor of negative health-related outcomes as HA and DSH events, even with very old and complex nursing home residents.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1279-7707	1760-4788		WOS:000602291900003	33491028

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Prognosticating after ICH is complex and may be influenced by clinicians' subjective impressions and biases, which may, in turn, influence decision making regarding the level of care provided. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore perceptions of neurocritical care in relation to the expected functional outcome for ICH patients. Design Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with neurocritical care doctors and nurses. Setting Neurocritical care (NCC) department in a UK neuroscience tertiary referral center. Subjects Eleven neurocritical care nurses, five consultant neurointensivists, two stroke physicians, three neurosurgeons. Intervention None. Measurements and Main Results We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews and identified five key themes: (1) prognostic uncertainty (2) subjectivity of good versus poor outcome (3) perceived inappropriate care (PIC) situations (including for frail elderly patients) (4) challenging nature of decision-making (5) clinician distress. Conclusions Caring for severely affected ICH patients in need of neurocritical care is challenging, particularly with frail elderly patients. Awareness of the challenges could facilitate interventions to improve decision-making for this group of stroke patients and their families, as well as measures to reduce the distress on clinicians who care for this patient group. Our findings highlight the need for effective interdisciplinary shared decision making involving the family, taking into account patients' previously expressed values and preferences and incorporating these into bespoke care planning.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1541-6933	1556-0961		WOS:000595031400002	33263147

It is a slowly progressing yet complex syndrome in which old age or some disabilities are not prerequisites; neither does loss of human parts lead to frailty among the physically fit older persons. This paper aims to describe the influences of transhumanist perspectives on human-technology enhancements and replacements in the transcendence of human frailties, including those of older persons, in which technology is projected to deliver solutions toward transcending these frailties. Through technologies including genetic screening and other technological manipulations, intelligent machines and augmented humans improve, maintain, and remedy human-linked susceptibilities. Furthermore, other technologies replace parts fabricated through inorganic-mechanical processes such as 3D-printing. Advancing technologies are reaching the summit of technological sophistication contributing to the transhumanist views of being human in a technological world. Technologies enhance the transcendence of human frailties as essential expressions of the symbiosis between human beings and technology in a transcendental world.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1320-7881	1440-1800		WOS:000587000600001	33159824

We aimed to measure the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and to describe changes over time, using STOPPFrail, in frail nursing home residents (NHRs) with limited life expectancy included in a medication review trial. Methods We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the COME-ON study, a cluster-controlled trial that evaluated the effect of a complex intervention on appropriateness of prescribing in Belgian nursing homes. We identified NHRs eligible for the application of STOPPFrail based on functional status, comorbidities, level of care and survival. PIM use was measured at baseline and at 8 months. Changes over time were compared in the control group (CG) and intervention group (IG). Results At baseline, 308 NHRs met the STOPPFrail eligibility criteria, of whom 196 (64.1%) had one or more PIM. At 8 months, among the 218 NHRs who were alive, there was an absolute reduction in the prevalence of PIMs of 9.1% in the CG (p < 0.05) and 10.2% in the IG (p < 0.05). We found large reductions for some medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors) but no reduction for others (e.g. calcium). The percentage of NHRs with one or more PIM discontinued without a new PIM initiated was higher in the IG than the CG but the difference was not significant (35.1% vs 23.6%,p = 0.127). Conclusion Among frail NHRs with poor survival prognosis, a significant and encouraging decrease in PIM prevalence over time was observed, probably facilitated by medication reviews. The overall prevalence of PIMs remained high, however.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1170-229X	1179-1969		WOS:000577057300001	33047252

Design A qualitative descriptive study design was used. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. Results The participants described the use or non-use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a "legitimation process". This process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at which to start using it. During this process, each person weighs her or his "ageing self" and "perception of technology" then decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use. "Critical events" initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance. Conclusion The legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life. Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex decision-making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the device. Impact Older persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their independence.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000578746100001	33048381	
J	Upton, L.								What is the effect of age on wound healing in the acute trauma setting? A scoping review								WOUND PRACTICE AND RESEARCH				28	3			115	126		10.33235/wpr.28.3.115-126				SEP 2020	2020	The ability to heal an acute traumatic wound or wounds is a complex matrix of overlapping biological processes impacted by intrinsic and extrinsic human factors. As we age, the body's physiological resilience is compromised and homeostasis becomes difficult to maintain. This scoping review examines the influence of biological ageing and the impact of age-related concerns on wound healing, including frailty, malnutrition, pre-existing medical conditions and clinician practices. Frailty rather than age was seen to have a greater physiological impact on outcome, resilience and healing. Clinician support, education and engagement were fundamental to achieve acute wound healing in the aged population. With an increasing ageing population, specialised knowledge, guidelines and structures to support geriatric care are recommended for best clinical practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1837-6304	2202-9729		WOS:000607903300003

The chronicity care model deeply affects the quality of life and degree of dependence. Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyse the perceived quality of life and dependence degree in complex chronic patients within a chronicity care model in the Autonomous Communities of Cantabria and the Balearic Islands (Spain). Design: This was a multicentred, transversal, descriptive, and observational study on a cohort of 206 chronic patients included in a chronicity care program. Methods: Patients' sociodemographic variables, integral valuation, nurse follow-up records, nursing outcomes classification (NOC)/nursing interventions classification (NIC), nurse diagnoses, and hospitalization data were analysed. A descriptive analysis of all data was carried out. The bivariate analysis assessed the relation between covariables and the overall scoring in European Quality of Life Scale (EuroQuol-5D), Barthel, Braden, and Chronic Patient eXperience Assessment Instrument (IEXPAC in the Spanish abbreviation). A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted. Results: The mean age was 79.4 years (standard deviation (SD) = 9.12; range: 39-94). A percentage of 79.3% of the study population shows functional impairment in one or more activities of daily life. A percentage of 83.3% of patients showed a physical dependence. There is a significant relationship between the gender and kinship degree of the caregiver (chi(2) = 18.2; p = 0.001). An overall mean score of 55.38 points in EuroQuol-5D was obtained, along with a 36.87-point satisfaction with the care given in IEXPAC. The overall score correlated positively and significantly with Barthel, Braden, and IEXPAC. The dependence levels improved slightly in the observed patients, which was a very significant outcome in statistical terms (t = 2.08; p = 0.039). A percentage of 66% (R-2 = 0.66) of the score variability at the Barthel index could be predicted from Braden scale scoring. Conclusions: Dependence is not only affected by the related pathology, but also by the effect on mobility and daily-life activities, which cause a worse perception of the quality of life. The health-care model based on the case management nurse is having positive effects, especially on dependence and patients with ulcer issues.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2227-9032		WOS:000582171100001	32846995

The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of the implementation strategy and to identify enablers and barriers for a successful implementation.MethodsThe implementation of PECAN was investigated in a 6-month pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial (c-RCT). As a key component of the implementation strategy, nominated nurses were trained as facilitators in a one-day workshop and supported by peer-mentoring (visit, telephone counselling). A mixed-methods approach was conducted in conjunction with the pilot trial and guided by a framework for process evaluations of c-RCTs. Data were collected using standardised questionnaires (nursing staff), documentation forms, problem-centred qualitative interviews (facilitators, therapists, social workers, relatives, peer-mentors), and a group discussion (facilitators). A set of predefined criteria on the nursing home level was examined. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using directed content analysis.ResultsSeven nursing homes (n =4 intervention groups, n =3 control groups) in two regions of Germany took part in the study. Facilitators responded well to the qualification measures (workshop participation: 14/14; workshop rating: "good"; peer-mentor visit participation: 10/14). The usage of peer-mentoring via telephone varied (one to seven contacts per nursing home). Our implementation strategy was not successful in connection with supplying the intervention to all the nurses. The clear commitment of the entire nursing home and the respect for the expertise of different healthcare professionals were emphasised as enablers, whereas a lack of impact on organisational conditions and routines and a lack of time and staff competence were mentioned as barriers.ConclusionThe PECAN intervention was delivered as planned to the facilitators but was unable to produce comprehensive changes in the nursing homes and subsequently for the residents. Strategies to systematically include the management and the nursing team from the beginning are needed to support the facilitators during implementation in the main trial.Trial registrationGerman clinical trials register, DRKS00010037.

This demand is set to continue due to an increasingly older population who are likely to have higher levels of dependency, dementia, and comorbidity. If admitted to the hospital, people with dementia are at higher risk of poor outcomes during and following a hospital admission. Yet, there remains a significant lack of specialist support within acute hospitals to support people with dementia, their families and hospital staff.Methods: Admiral Nurses are specialists that work with families affected by dementia and provide consultancy and support to health and social care colleagues to improve the delivery of evidenced based dementia care. Historically, Admiral Nurses have predominantly been based in community settings. In response to the increasing fragmentation of services across the dementia trajectory, the Admiral Nurse model is evolving and adapting to meet the complex needs of families impacted upon by dementia inclusive of acute hospital care.Results: The Admiral Nurse acute hospital model provides specialist interventions which improve staff confidence and competence and enables positive change by improving skills and knowledge in the provision of person-centred dementia care. The role has the capacity to address some of the barriers to delivering person centred dementia care in the acute hospital and contribute to improvements across the hospital both as a result of direct interventions or influencing the practice of others.Conclusion: Improving services for people with dementia and their families requires a whole system approach to enable care coordination and service integration, this must include acute hospital care. The increasing numbers of people with dementia in hospitals, and the detrimental effects of admission, make providing equitable, consistent, safe, quality care and support to people with dementia and their families a national priority requiring immediate investment. The inclusion of Admiral Nursing within acute hospital services supports service and quality improvement which positively impacts upon the experience and outcomes for families affected by dementia.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2377-9608			WOS:000567938000001	33415301

It is therefore crucial to deploy strategies that promote continuous adjustment to these barriers so as to improve the benefits of integrating care. Measuring the implementation and effects of integrated care models are key component of these strategies. However, measuring integrated care also faces major challenges. This study aims to identify and characterise integrated care measurement challenges.Methods: A review of reviews on the measurement of integrated care identified 12 papers. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify and categorize measurement challenges. Document analysis was done on the measurement of an integrated care model for older adults in Quebec.Results: Eight categories of measurement challenges were identified. These challenges include difficulties in measuring structures, processes, and effects of models; conceptual ambiguity and heterogeneity of organisational forms; involving multiple actors in the measurement strategy; and including multiple data sources, amongst others. These challenges revealed and explained potential gaps in the measurement of integrated care for older adults in Quebec. For instance, the Quebec measurement strategy did not include effects indicators.Conclusion: Although the measurement of integrated care is a complex endeavour, there is a need for adequate measurement strategies that allow to appreciate important elements of integrate care. The findings of this study could be used as a reflexive tool in advancing research and practice of measuring integrated care.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2053-4345	2053-4353		WOS:000558584500001

The interviews lasted 35-83 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Both interviews and the analysis followed the epistemological and methodological principles of Reflective Lifeworld Research.Findings: We identified the essential meaning 'It means everything' and four constituents illuminating different aspects inherent in the complex phenomenon of caring responsibility; 'A life-constraining transition,' 'Trusting the children to fill the gaps and be the glue,' 'Tacit responsibility, agreement and acceptance' and 'Depending on the children and knowing they are burdened by you.'Conclusions: Caring responsibility is based on a trusting relationship and tacit agreements indicating an understanding of interdependence and acceptance of dependence on adult children. However, a paradox appears when older persons express a deep-rooted perception of autonomy and independence as they have difficulties with their growing dependency and feelings of being burdensome. Older persons try to balance the continuum of autonomy, their existential self-image and actual capability. The practical part of caring responsibility seems to dominate and strongly affect the parent-child relationship because the child needs to take care of practical issues related to healthcare management and instrumental activities of daily living, leaving less time for meaningful togetherness.Implications for practice: Older persons want their adult children to be involved and acknowledged when planning care and treatment because they often seem to serve as the 'glue' that makes it possible for the parent to remain in his/her own home.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000552464400001	32716593	
J	Vatnoy, Torunn Kitty; Sundlisaeter Skinner, Marianne; Karlsen, Tor-Ivar; Dale, Bjorg								Nursing competence in municipal in-patient acute care in Norway: a cross-sectional study								BMC NURSING				19	1					70	10.1186/s12912-020-00463-5				JUL 22 2020	2020	Background The primary health care services are becoming increasingly complex, which presents challenges for the municipal nursing services. In Norway, municipal in-patient acute care (MipAC) has been introduced in all municipalities, and the competence at the services has been questioned. Few studies have examined the nursing services in the units. This study aims to get an overview of the nursing competence in those units across geographical regions, and different groups of organisation and localisation. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted, and an ad hoc questionnaire was distributed to first-line leaders in all the MipAC units in Norway. Data were collected in the period between 6 March 2019 to 6 June 2019. Measures to get an overview of the nursing competence were ratio of registered nurses (RNs) in staff, count of shifts with only one RN on duty and count of RNs with master's degrees/specialisation. Descriptive comparative statistics were used. Results Of all 226 first-line leaders invited to participate, 207 (91.6%) responded to the questionnaire. Overall a considerable variance across the sample was revealed. The median ratio of RNs in staff was 56 (IQR = 40-70), the count of shifts with only one RN on duty median 28 (IQR = 5-49), and the count of RNs with a master's degree or specialisation median 3 (IQR = 0-5). The regions of Northern and Central Norway, MipACs located in nursing home and MipACs organised at long-term care units, showed significantly lower nursing competence in staff compared to the remaining institution and organisations. Conclusion This study generates knowledge that can inform planning, priorities and interventions that may be initiated at all organisational and political levels concerning the MipAC services. An overall conclusion is that advanced nursing competence is lacking. The study also highlights the most urgent direction for improvements regarding nursing competence in the services. It seemed to be MipACs in Northern and Central Norway, and those located at nursing homes organised together with long-term care units, that needed improvements the most.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1472-6955			WOS:000555091300001

Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.

Background Older people with aged natural dentition require preventive and curative oral health care. An intervention based on principles of situated learning was implemented to establish closer cooperation between dental and nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to improved oral hygiene in nursing home residents. Design An embedded multiple-case study combined with principles of realist evaluation unfolded in three phases: Formulation of initial programme theory, Testing and Refining the programme theory. The COREQ checklist is followed in reporting. Methods Observations, six group interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with dentists, dental practitioners, nursing home managers, care professionals and residents were conducted in three nursing homes (n = 41). Results Three main outcomes of a programme theory were identified, relating to (a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) interdisciplinary working, in the form of professional pride in performing sufficient oral care; (c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the creation of relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care professionals as well as nursing home management taking responsibility for structure, planning and knowledge sharing. Conclusion The situated learning perspective supported residents and care professionals' competencies in performing sufficient oral care. The shared oral care intervention supports an individual and multidisciplinary assessment of nursing home residents' ability to self-care concerning oral care. Contextual factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms influence the intervention's success. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the complexity within interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and unravelling the necessary properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health care are areas of improvement for care service in nursing homes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000542562300001	32533875

This reflects, in part, the frailty and vulnerability of older people living in care homes but has also, in part, been a consequence of the failure to include care homes in the systematic planning of a response to COVID, as well as a measure of neglect of standards and quality improvement in the sector. In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies in 2015. The standards consisted of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in nursing homes as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. The gravity of the concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as emerging insights on care improvement in nursing homes indicate that an update of these medical standards is timely. This was performed by the writing group from the original 2015 guidelines and is intended as an interim measure pending a more formal review incorporating a systematic review of emerging literature and a Delphi process.Key summary pointsAim The gravity of concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic mandates urgent review of medical standards for nursing homes. Findings Physicians providing medical care to nursing home residents should have a formal competence in geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry. Message The coordination of the broad range of complexities of care in nursing homes requires clearly specified clinical leadership commensurate with the range of services needed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1878-7649	1878-7657		WOS:000541013000001	32557250

Aims The aim of this study was (1) to design a multi-component training program which improves physical functioning and psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of this intervention in nursing home residents. Methods This study is a two-arm, stratified-randomized controlled feasibility trail. Twenty-four nursing home residents (aged 83.7 +/- 6.4, 21 women) were divided into an intervention and a waiting-list control group. The intervention group completed a multi-component training (including dual-task, dynamic balance, endurance and strength exercises) for 16 weeks (twice per week for 45-60 min). Primary outcomes were lower extremity functionality (SPPB), gait performance (GAITRite), health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as life satisfaction (SWLS). Results Life satisfaction (SWLS) and physical functioning (SPPB) increased in the intervention group after training whereas the control group showed a decrease. Gait parameters could only be analyzed forn = 5 participants of the intervention group andn = 2 of the control group and showed no time differences for the intervention group. The mean number of participants was 12.5 +/- 1.9 per session (attendance ranged between 66% and 90%). Conclusion A multi-component training seems (1) to lead to clinically relevant improvements in physical functioning as well as in psychosocial wellbeing and (2) to be feasible and well accepted in nursing home residents. Nevertheless, the complexity and progression of the program as well as the testing protocol have to be adapted. Further research should test the effectiveness of this adapted program in a larger sample size.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1594-0667	1720-8319		WOS:000540189800001	32537707

Understanding their needs and their use of resources is essential. The main objective of the study is to identify persons who are likely to enter residential care based upon their needs and resource utilization, so that care providers can plan interventions effectively and optimize services and resources to meet the persons' needs.MethodsThis is a longitudinal quasi-experimental study. The data consists of primary data from the community setting collected every six months during the period of 2010-2016. Interventions had the goal of keeping older people longer at home. Participants were at least 65years old and were living in the community. The interRAI Resource Utilization Group system (RUG-III) was used to calculate the case-mix indexes (CMI) of all participants. Comparisons were made between the case-mix of those who were still living at home and those who were admitted into residential care at follow-up.ResultsA total of 10,289 older persons participated in the study (81.27.1yrs., 69.1% female). From this population, 853 participants (8.3%) were admitted into residential care. The CMI of the persons receiving night care at home were the highest (1.6 at baseline and 1.7 at the entry point of residential care), followed by persons receiving occupational therapy (1.5 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care) and persons enrolled in case management interventions with rehabilitation (1.4 at baseline and 1.6 at the entry point of residential care). The CMIs at follow-up were significantly higher than at baseline and the linear regression model showed that admission to residential care was a significant factor in the model.Conclusions The study showed that the RUG-III system offers possibilities for identifying persons at risk of institutionalization. Interventions designed to avoid early nursing home admission can make use of the RUG-III system to optimize care planning and the allocation of services and resources. Based on the RUG-III case-mix, resources can be allocated to keep older persons at home longer, bearing in mind the complexity of care and the availability of services in the community.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1471-2318		WOS:000540246300004	32503445

Design Nestle Health Science funded an initial virtual meeting attended by all authors, in which the unmet needs and subsequent recommendations for OD management were discussed. The opinions, results, and recommendations detailed in this paper are those of the authors, and are independent of funding sources. Setting OD is common in nursing home (NH) residents, and is defined as the inability to initiate and perform safe swallowing. The long-stay NH resident population has specific characteristics marked by a shorter life expectancy relative to community-dwelling older adults, high prevalence of multimorbidity with a high rate of complications, dementia, frailty, disability, and often polypharmacy. As a result, OD is associated with malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, functional decline, and death. Complications of OD can potentially be prevented with the use of TMDs. Results This report presents expert opinion and evidence-informed recommendations for best practice on the nutritional management of OD. It aims to highlight the practice gaps between the evidence-based management of OD and real-world patterns, including inadequate dietary provision and insufficient staff training. In addition, the unmet need for OD screening and improvements in therapeutic diets are explored and discussed. Conclusion There is currently limited empirical evidence to guide practice in OD management. Given the complex and heterogeneous population of long-stay NH residents, some 'best practice' approaches and interventions require extensive efficacy testing before further changes in policy can be implemented.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1279-7707	1760-4788		WOS:000530254000001	32510109

In total, 242 residents taking >= 1 medication regularly were included. Opportunities for simplification among participants at 4 RACFs were identified using the validated Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE (MRS GRACE). Simplification was possible for 62 of 99 residents in the intervention arm. Significant reductions in the mean number of daily medication administration times were observed at 8 months (-0.38, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.69 to -0.07) and 12 months (-0.47, 95%CI -0.84 to -0.09) in the intervention compared to the comparison arm. A higher incidence of falls was observed in the intervention arm (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.20, 95%CI 1.33 to 3.63) over 12-months, which was primarily driven by a high falls rate in one intervention RACF and a simultaneous decrease in comparison RACFs. No significant differences in hospitalizations (IRR 1.78, 95%CI 0.57-5.53) or mortality (relative risk 0.81, 95%CI 0.48-1.38) over 12 months were observed. Medication simplification achieves sustained reductions in medication administration times and should be implemented using a structured resident-centered approach that incorporates clinical judgement.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2077-0383		WOS:000531821000160	32276360

Multiple factors to consider when managing diabetes in the advancing age are risk of hypoglycemia, polypharmacy and assessment of functional status, cognitive impairment, depression, and fall risk. Therefore, it is important to individualize glycemia targets to optimize blood glucose levels while considering these factors and life expectancy. A multidisciplinary team approach with health care professionals in a primary care setting, Endocrinologists, Nutritionists, Diabetes Educators and mental health counselors is essential for the education, prevention, and individualized diabetic treatment plan in the elderly population.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2405-7991			WOS:000519093000014

The aim of this study is to assess the association between complexity of nursing care and in-hospital mortality.MethodsRegister-based cohort study on all patients admitted to acute medical wards of a middle-large hospital in the North of Italy between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015 and followed up to discharge. Out of all the eligible 7247 records identified in the Hospital Discharge Register, 6872 records from 5129 patients have been included. A multivariable frailty Cox model was adopted to estimate the association between the Informative System of Nursing Performance score, both as continuous variable and dichotomized as low (score<50) or high (score<greater than or equal to>50), and in-hospital mortality adjusting for several factors recorded at admission (age, gender, type of admission unit, type of access and Charlson Comorbidity Index).ResultsThe median age of the 5129 included patients was 76 [first-third quartiles 64-84] and 2657(52%) patients were males. Over the 6872 admissions, there were 395 in-hospital deaths among 2922 patients at high complexity of nursing care (13.5%) and 74/3950 (1.9%) among those at low complexity leading to a difference of 11.6% (95% CI: 10.3-13.0%). Adjusting by relevant confounders, the hazard rate of mortality in the first 10days from admission resulted 6 times significantly higher in patients at high complexity of nursing care with respect to patients at low complexity (hazard ratio, HR 6.58, 95%CI: 4.50;9.62, p<0.001). The HR was lower after 10days from admission but still significantly higher than 1. By considering the continuous score, the association was confirmed.ConclusionComplexity of nursing care is strongly associated to in-hospital mortality of acute patients admitted to medical departments. It predicts in-hospital mortality better than widely used indicators, such as comorbidity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1472-6963		WOS:000519059200010	32143625

Images were sent by electronic mail, together with an anonymous questionnaire that was sent back to a referee of the research group. We suggested 8 options for classification: pressure ulcer (categories I, II, III, IV, or 'suspect of deep-tissue damage'), moisture-associated damage, pressure-moisture combined aetiology and multifactorial lesion. Concordance index was calculated for every photography. Cohen's Kappa index with 'jackknife' technique were calculated for every photograph and category. We used the statistical programme Epidat 4.2.Results: Observed agreement was variable, between 4 and 1 depending on the photography. A consensus of 100% was observed in 6 images. Global Kappa resulted as moderate: 0.5202 (IC95%: 0.3850- 0.6542). Intra-group concordance resulted moderate in 4 categories, low in 3, and high only for pressure ulcer category II (Kappa 0.8924. IC 95%: 0.7388-1.0456). Interobserver concordance was 0.6602 (IC 95%: 0.4969-0.8081).Conclusions: The reliability of the use of photographs for the categorization of dependence-related lesions is moderate, being higher for category II pressure ulcers and low for more complex wounds. This method must be used with care, and education on the subject is required. (C) 2019 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

In recent years, the understanding of the pathobiology of sepsis has been refined, with research describing an altered host response as the underlying cause. Survivors of sepsis often have long hospital stays and suffer from subsequent frailty and long-term health consequences. Predicting attributes of sepsis survivors remains challenging; however, an obesity paradox exists, wherein obese individuals survive sepsis at higher rates than their normal-weight counterparts. We present a model that describes the relationships between sepsis and obesity, focusing on inflammation as a shared pathway for dysregulation in obese and healthy-weight adults. Understanding the interaction of these complex variables is an important first step toward developing interventions and treatments to augment sepsis survival.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1099-8004	1552-4175		WOS:000514028200001	32064902

Recent Findings Recent trials have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits from more intensive BP targets among ambulatory, less complex older adults, but generalizability to NH residents is questionable. Other trials have demonstrated that de-intensifying antihypertensives in frail, older patients is feasible, with no or modest increases in BP, but most have not assessed effects on patient-centered outcomes. Observational studies with patients more representative of NH residents suggest harms associated with more intensive BP treatment and reduction in fall risk associated with deintensification, but findings and potential for bias vary across studies. Randomized trials and rigorous observational studies examining effects of deintensified BP management on patient-centered outcomes in complex, older populations are needed to inform improved guidelines and treatment for NH residents.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1522-6417	1534-3111		WOS:000515372500002	31938958

Due to its multifactorial aetiology, several definitions and assessments of this symptom complex have been developed, of which the Fried Frailty Score (Phenotype Score) and the broader Frailty Index (Deficit Accumulation Index) are the most commonly used. The prevalence of frailty increases with age independently of the assessment instrument and ranges between 4 and 59% in community-dwelling elderly populations and is higher in women than in men. The actual prevalence rate in a population depends on the prevalence of chronic diseases including depression, nutritional status, and inherently socio-economic background and education. Frailty is, however, not a steady state and progression, but also reversion is common. Although numerous studies on the prevalence of frailty have been conducted, systematic assessments in different populations are rare, which reduces the comparability of results. Similarly heterogeneous, but less frequent are studies on the incidence and on trajectories and transitions of frailty, calling for further, more systematic studies on this topic.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-33330-0; 978-3-030-33329-4	WOS:000554916800004	31894543

Nonspecific symptoms, complex medical conditions, insufficient awareness of diagnostic criteria, and unnecessary urine studies all contribute to the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in PALTC residents. In 2017, the Infection Advisory Subcommittee at AMDA-The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine convened a workgroup comprised of experts in geriatrics and infectious diseases to review recent literature regarding UTIs in the PALTC population. The workgroup used evidence as well as their collective clinical expertise to develop this consensus statement with the goal of providing comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of UTIs in PALTC residents. The recommendations acknowledge limitations inherent to providing medical care for frail older adults, practicing within a resource limited setting, and prevention strategies tailored to PALTC populations. In addition, the consensus statement encourages integrating antibiotic stewardship principles into the policies and procedures used by PALTC nursing staff and by prescribing clinicians as they care for residents with a suspected UTI.

Background This manuscript describes the second phase of an unpublished larger study in the northern province of Lampang, Thailand. Phase One revealed that 14% of 1,788 older persons surveyed were found to have experienced frailty according to Fried's frailty phenotypes, and low physical activity was associated with frailty. In the light of frailty, how older persons experience physical activity in their day-to-day living environments warrants in-depth exploration. Design This was a qualitative study guided by narrative inquiry. Methods In-depth interviews and observations were conducted with 13 older persons living with frailty. The method of analysis was thematic and performance analysis. Results Two broad themes relating to the environmental landscapes were as follows: (a) limiting environmental landscapes and (b) engaging environmental landscapes. These landscapes, which change across time, refer to physical and social spaces, and beliefs of older persons and their family that have either positive or negative impacts on physical activity of frail older persons. Conclusion Complex interactions between physical and social spaces and beliefs of older persons and family influence the physical activity behaviours of older persons living with frailty. Implications for practice This study warrants education and policy aiming at creating optimal environmental landscapes to promote physical activity in frail older persons.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000504161900001	31874119

Objectives To investigate the associations of frailty status with oral cleaning habits and oral hygiene taking into account the effects of preventive oral health intervention among home care clients aged 75 or over. Methods Data were gathered by interviews and clinical oral examinations at baseline and after a 6-month follow-up. Frailty status was evaluated at baseline using the abbreviated comprehensive geriatric assessment (aCGA) scale, which consists of 15 questions from three different domains: cognitive status, functional status and depression. A total of 231 home care clients completed the aCGA at baseline and the interview and clinical oral examination both at baseline and after the follow-up. Results Using the aCGA classification with at least one score in the >= 2 domain, 62% of clients were classified as frail at baseline. They had poorer oral cleaning habits and hygiene, and they had lost more teeth than nonfrail participants. Multivariate analysis showed that being frail at baseline was statistically significantly associated with a lower frequency of toothbrushing and denture cleaning (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9 and OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.8) at baseline, but not after the follow-up. Membership in the intervention group was associated with better oral cleaning at the follow-up. However, among the frail participants, toothbrushing frequency was still significantly lower and oral hygiene poorer than among the nonfrail group. Conclusions Oral cleaning habits of frail elderly people were slightly improved as a result of external support, which had a positive effect on oral hygiene. Individual preventive actions in the context of oral health and hygiene should be integrated into the daily care plan of home care clients with the first signs of frailty.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000502854100001	31845365

General practitioners (GP) are particularly important in this context: they provide patients with low-threshold primary care close to their homes and provide both general palliative care and geriatric services. Objective What are the challenges for GPs in caring for frail older patients at the end of their lives? Material and methods A secondary data analysis of 52 qualitative interviews was carried out, which were serially obtained at 4 points in time over a period of 18 months with 14 family doctors. In addition, one focus group with five GPs took place. The analysis was carried out according to the principles of grounded theory. Results The results show that GPs see the care of frail older patients at the end of their lives through a) the growing number of older people, b) multimorbidity and complexity of the problem areas, c) the integration of geriatric and palliative approaches, d) the high average age of general practitioners and the lack of junior staff and e) the problem of ensuring care in rural areas as a major challenge. The practical transition between geriatric and palliative care is considered by GPs to be fluid and there is a desire for more integration of both disciplines. Conclusion In this study GPs perceived a large overlap between geriatric and palliative care. Both approaches should be offered for a selection of patients as a combined service. In the future a systematic network between GPs and geriatricians in practices, clinics, and day clinics will be necessary.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0948-6704	1435-1269		WOS:000566054900001	31828367

These presentations are often complex and time consuming in the chaotic and potentially hazardous ED environment. The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention (GEDI) model was developed to optimise the care of frail older adults, especially RACF residents, in the ED. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the GEDI model on the primary outcomes of disposition (admission, discharge or death) and ED length of stay for residents of RACFs, presenting to an ED in regional Queensland, Australia. Methods GEDI is a nurse-led, physician-championed, innovative model delivered by advanced practice nurses with expertise in gerontology. This quasi-experimental pragmatic study compared outcomes for RACF residents who presented to a regional Queensland ED during three time periods: pre-GEDI, interim GEDI and post-GEDI implementation of the GEDI model. Outcomes included disposition, ED length of stay, ED re-presentation and mortality. Results A significant increase in the likelihood of discharge from ED (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.26) and reductions in ED length of stay (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.78) were evident for RACF residents following the implementation of the GEDI intervention. There were no differences in mortality, ED re-presentation or in-hospital length of stay between the three time periods. Conclusion There is a paucity of evidence to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in EDs designed to target older adults living in RACFs. The GEDI model was effective in reducing ED length of stay while increasing the likelihood of safe discharge for RACF residents.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1742-6731	1742-6723		WOS:000498594800001	31773885

Although person-centred care has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons.AimThe aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home.MethodsA descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative thematic analysis.ResultsThe findings indicate that the attributes of person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions.ConclusionThe nurses' attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included in education and training.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000494120600001	31642182

This article provides an overview of literature related to hydration interventions and highlights gaps in knowledge.Sources of data: This paper draws on UK-focused literature from Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), CINAHL, Medline, Proquest Hospital Premium Collection, Cochrane Library and RCN databases on hydration interventions for older people living with multi-morbidity and dementia in care homes.Areas of agreement: Fluid intake is too low in care home residents, and no single hydration intervention is effective in addressing the complex problems that older residents present.Areas of controversy: There is a lack of consensus about how much fluid an older person should consume daily for optimum health. There is also lack of agreement about what interventions are effective in supporting individuals with complex physical and cognitive problems to achieve daily fluid intake targets.Growing points: To improve hydration care for residents, care home teams should be competent in the delivery of hydration care, and work closely with integrated multi-professional healthcare specialists to provide proactive case management.Areas timely for developing research: There is a need for understanding of what hydration practices and processes are effective for care home residents and including these in multi-component interventions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0007-1420	1471-8391		WOS:000509507600007	31556943

Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study's aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant. Methods The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant. Discussion The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses. These outcomes should contribute to outfitting key actors of the health system with means of enhancing their part in a collective endeavor targeting the best care and quality of life for aged citizens.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1471-2318		WOS:000479243100003	31382880	
J	Piau, Antoine; Crissey, Rachel; Brechemier, Delphine; Balardy, Laurent; Nourhashemi, Fati								A smartphone Chatbot application to optimize monitoring of older patients with cancer								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS				128				18	23		10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.05.013				AUG 2019	2019	Background: Almost two thirds of patients diagnosed with cancer are age 65 years or older. In order to follow up on older patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy at home, we implemented remote phone monitoring conducted by skilled oncology nurses. However, given the rising number of patients assessed and the limited time that hospital professionals can spend on their patients after discharge, we needed to modernize this program. In this paper we present the preliminary results and the ongoing evaluation.Method: We implemented a semi-automated messaging application to upgrade the current follow-up procedures. The primary aim is to collect patient's key data over time and to free up nurses' time so that during phone calls they can focus on education and support. The Chatbot feasibility was assessed in a sub-sample of unselected patients before its wider dissemination and pragmatic evaluation.Main results: During the first deployment period, 9 unselected patients benefited from the Chatbot (mean 83 y.o.) with a total of 52 completed remote evaluations. Each participant answered 6 questionnaires over 7 weeks with an 86% compliance rate. The average completion time for the questionnaires was 3.5 min and the answer rate was 100%. The 'free text' field was used in 58% of the questionnaires. The Chatbot solution is currently proposed to all eligible patients thanks to the regional cancer network support. We are measuring acceptability, health outcomes and health network impact.Discussion and conclusion: The results of this first phase are encouraging. The integration of the solution into the health care organization was feasible and acceptable. Moreover, the answers revealed serious health (e.g. fever) or adherence (e.g. blood test) issues that require timely interventions. The major strength of this solution is to rely on end-users' current knowledge of technologies (text-messaging), which allows a seamless integration into a complex clinical network.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1386-5056	1872-8243		WOS:000469815100003	31160007

This feasibility randomized controlled trial (fRCT) will test the proposed intervention and its implementation and determine methods for the design of a conclusive randomized controlled trial. Methods The fRCT, with embedded qualitative study, aims to recruit 60 participants. Moderately and severely frail older people will be identified using the electronic frailty index (eFI) and the intervention will be delivered by senior community nurses. The control participants will receive usual primary care for frailty. The study is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR; funding granted in May 2016, ref: ICA-CDRF-2016-02-018) and received NHS and University Research Ethics Committee approval in 2018. Discussion There is evidence that the delivery of complex interventions for community-dwelling older people can reduce care home and hospital admissions and falls, there is less evidence for the benefit of any specific type or intensity of intervention or the additional benefits of targeting the frail population. This trial will determine feasibility of the intervention, define recruitment and retention parameters and trial logistics, and decide outcome measures. Impact This study aims to address the limitations of current research by using a systematic method of frailty diagnosis and participant identification, trialling implementation of a person-centred intervention, and testing of feasibility parameters.

Palliative care for older persons has been less prioritised than palliative care for younger people with cancer, which may lead to unnecessary suffering and decreased quality of life at the final stage of life. Aim To evaluate whether a palliative care intervention had any influence on the perceived quality of life of older persons (>= 65 years). Methods This study was conducted as a complex intervention performed with an experimental crossover design. The intervention was implemented in 20 nursing homes, with a six-month intervention period in each nursing home. Twenty-three older persons (>= 65 years) in the intervention group and 29 in the control group were interviewed using the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD questionnaires at both baseline and follow-up. The collected data were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare paired data between baseline and follow-up. Results In the intervention group, no statistically significant increases in quality of life were found. This result contrasted with the control group, which revealed statistically significant declines in quality of life at both the dimension and item levels. Accordingly, this study showed a trend of decreased health after nine months in both the intervention and control groups. Conclusion It is reasonable to believe that quality of life decreases with age as part of the natural course of the ageing process. However, it seems that the palliative care approach of the intervention prevented unnecessary quality of life decline by supporting sensory abilities, autonomy and social participation among older persons in nursing homes. From the ageing perspective, it may not be realistic to strive for an increased quality of life in older people living in nursing homes; maybe the goal should be to delay or prevent reduced quality of life. Based on this perspective, the intervention prevented decline in quality of life in nursing home residents. Implications for practice The high number of deaths shows the importance to identify palliative care needs in older persons at an early stage to prevent or delay deterioration of quality of life.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000475177700001	31298499	
J	Bethea, Audis; Samanta, Damayanti; White, Teresa; Payne, Nancy; Hardway, Jessica								Nurse Practitioners' Role in Improving Service for Elderly Trauma Patients								JOURNAL OF TRAUMA NURSING				26	4			174	179		10.1097/JTN.0000000000000445				JUL-AUG 2019	2019	Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort 4.38 +/- 3.54 vs. 5.60 +/- 3.98, p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 +/- $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 +/- $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current practice model.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1078-7496	1932-3883		WOS:000480716300003	31283744

These conditions result in frequent hospital transfers which can lead to negative effects on residents' health status and are often avoidable. Reasons for emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions are complex. Prior research indicated factors influencing transfer decisions in view of nursing staff and general practitioners. The aim of this systematic review is to explore how family members experience and influence transfers from nursing home (NH) to hospital and how they are involved in the transfer decision.MethodsA systematic literature search was performed in Medline via PubMed, Ebsco Scopus and CINAHL in May 2018. Studies were eligible if they contained information a) about the decision to transfer NHR to hospital and b) the experiences or influence of family members. The review followed Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) approach for qualitative systematic reviews. Screening, selection and quality appraisal of studies were performed independently by two reviewers. Synthesis of qualitative data was conducted through meta-aggregation.ResultsAfter screening of n=2863 articles, in total n=10 qualitative studies were included in the review. Results indicate that family members of NHR experience decision-making before hospitalization differently. They mainly reported NH-related, hospital-related, and family/resident-related factors influencing the transfer decision. The involvement of family members in the decision-making process varies - from no involvement to insistence on a decision in favor of their personal preferences. However, hospital transfer decisions and other treatment decisions (e.g. advance care planning (ACP) discussions) were commonly discussed with physicians and nurses. Conflicts between family members and healthcare providers mostly arose around the interpretation of resident's best interest. In general, family members perceive discussions as challenging thus leading to emotional stress and discomfort.ConclusionThe influence of NHR family members concerning hospital transfer decisions varies. Family members are an important link for communication between resident and medical staff and for communication between NH and hospital. Interventions aiming to reduce hospitalization rates have to take these findings into account.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				1471-2318		WOS:000470286200001	31164101

A better understanding of this problem has the potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery.PurposeTo investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana.MethodMore than 300hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for low-income older persons and two senior citizen centres.ResultsThe findings demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home-based healthcare services, (b) stress after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home-based services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships and activities, and (i) grocery store and cafe contacts.ConclusionHome-based services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services.Implications for practiceThis study adds to the literature about precarity among community-based older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home-based services are necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths and supportive resources of older people.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000474861100009	30861633

Traditional medicine and models of care may no longer meet complex patient needs. Older patients present with multifaceted issues while living longer with chronic health conditions. The changing environment requires a cross-disciplinary perspective. Changes in reimbursement are in the early stages of implementation and will be used to evaluate measurable outcomes. Preparing to care for this population can only occur with enough health professionals and expanded use of advance practice nurses.

The aim of this study was to compare symptoms before death in LTC for those with cancer, dementia or chronic illness.Methods After-death prospective staff survey of resident deaths with random cluster sampling in 61 representative LTC facilities across New Zealand (3709 beds). Deaths (n = 286) were studied over 3 months in each facility. Standardised questionnaires - Symptom Management (SM-EOLD) and Comfort Assessment in End of life with Dementia (CAD-EOLD) - were administered to staff after the resident's death.Results Primary diagnoses at the time of death were dementia (49%), chronic illness (30%), cancer (17%), and dementia and cancer (4%). Residents with cancer had more community hospice involvement (30%) than those with chronic illness (12%) or dementia (5%). There was no difference in mean SM-EOLD in the last month of life by diagnosis (cancer 26.9 (8.6), dementia 26.5(8.2), chronic illness 26.9(8.6). Planned contrast analyses of individual items found people with dementia had more pain and those with cancer had less anxiety. There was no difference in mean CAD-EOLD scores in the week before death by diagnosis (total sample 33.7(SD 5.2), dementia 34.4(SD 5.2), chronic illness 33.0(SD 5.1), cancer 33.3(5.1)). Planned contrast analyses showed significantly more physical symptoms for those with dementia and chronic illness in the last month of life than those with cancer.Conclusions Overall, symptoms in the last week and month of life did not vary by diagnosis. However, sub-group planned contrast analyses found those with dementia and chronic illness experienced more physical distress during the last weeks and months of life than those with cancer. These results highlight the complex nature of LTC end of life care that requires an integrated gerontology/palliative care approach.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				1471-2318		WOS:000468783100001	31117991

As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital.Methods: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis.Results: Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role.Conclusions: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.									3	0	0	0	0	1	4			1472-6963			WOS:000464839800001	30971236

We discuss the essay, which intended to make eldercare work more visible and valued. The purpose of this paper is to ask, 'Why were these photographs so uncomfortable to view, and why did they elicit such strong polysemous reactions from viewers?' We argue that in order to address this question, sites of eldercare may be understood as heterotopias, or places of exclusion from social norms. While the photographs were meant to make it possible for viewers to look into the daily reality of eldercare work, we suggest the visual essay instead acted as a heterotopic hall of mirrors, revealing tensions that obscured the labour value to viewers. As observers looked into the mirror of their own lives, the utopian discourse of a residential care 'home' was disrupted, as the idealised version of eldercare work we have become attuned to in the media was punctured by the powerful heterotopia of the photographic essay. This article illustrates the way in which eldercare work is made invisible through complex social processes involving sight and site related to contemporary visual and spatial practices of aging and eldercare.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0890-4065	1879-193X		WOS:000462421500003	30832926

The current model of care is failing to meet these needs in an effective or sustainable way.People with complex chronic diseases are vulnerable, they deteriorate as diseases progress, and they require individualized and coordinated professional care that takes into account the progression of the disease, transitions and people's preferences.It is essential to determine a new care paradigm as a framework for the projects and actions that should be promoted to reach transversal, sustainable and quality care directed at people with complex and advanced chronic diseases in all stages of life.Different studies show that case management is an added value in terms of quality, safety and cost-effectiveness. However, its implementation in Spain is uneven and heterogeneous, and no regulations have yet been developed to give stability to this new nurse figure. The Ministry and the Autonomous Communities now have the responsibility to create regulations and institutionalize the figure of case management nurses/advanced practice nurses, with a clear definition of their professional competences and functions, as has been done in other countries.

Sullivan, Suzanne S./0000-0003-3064-6884			Mortality Risk in Homebound Older Adults Predicted From Routinely Collected Nursing Data								NURSING RESEARCH				68	2			156	166		10.1097/NNR.0000000000000328				MAR-APR 2019	2019	Background: Newer analytic approaches for developing predictive models provide a method of creating decision support to translate findings into practice.Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a clinically interpretable predictive model for 12-month mortality risk among community-dwelling older adults. This is done by using routinely collected nursing assessment data to aide homecare nurses in identifying older adults who are at risk for decline, providing an opportunity to develop care plans that support patient and family goals for care.Methods: A retrospective secondary analysis of Medicare and Medicaid data of 635,590 Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-C) start-of-care assessments from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, was linked to the Master Beneficiary Summary File (2012-2013) for date of death. The decision tree was benchmarked against gold standards for predictive modeling, logistic regression, and artificial neural network (ANN). The models underwent k-fold cross-validation and were compared using area under the curve (AUC) and other data science metrics, including Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).Results: Decision tree variables associated with 12-month mortality risk included OASIS items: age, (M1034) overall status, (M1800-M1890) activities of daily living total score, cancer, frailty, (M1410) oxygen, and (M2020) oral medication management. The final models had good discrimination: decision tree, AUC = .71, 95% confidence interval (CI) [. 705, .712], sensitivity = .73, specificity = .58, MCC = .31; ANN, AUC = .74, 95% CI [. 74,.74], sensitivity = .68, specificity = .68, MCC = .35; and logistic regression, AUC = .74, 95% CI [.735, .742], sensitivity = .64, specificity = .70, MCC = .35.Discussion: The AUC and 95% CI for the decision tree are slightly less accurate than logistic regression and ANN; however, the decision tree was more accurate in detecting mortality. The OASIS data set was useful to predict 12-month mortality risk. The decision tree is an interpretable predictive model developed from routinely collected nursing data that may be incorporated into a decision support tool to identify older adults at risk for death.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0029-6562	1538-9847		WOS:000461444300431	30531348

The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. Design A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Results Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self-management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. Discussion The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team "works" is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live. Conclusion Severely frail older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a complex and flexible person-centred approach									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000459481400009	30592173

Background Existential loneliness (EL) is an unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older people, the experience of EL can be reduced. Design In this qualitative study, we used an exploratory and descriptive design. Methods The study was based on 22 narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were receiving long-term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis. Results Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the rear-view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract themselves. Conclusion Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person-centred care and create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherne									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000459481400006	30403002

R	Liddy, Clare; Joschko, Justin; Guglani, Sheena; Afkham, Amir; Keely, Erin								Table_1_Improving Equity of Access Through Electronic Consultation: A Case Study of an eConsult Service.DOCX								Figshare											http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00279.s001				2019-11-20	2019	Background: Patients with complex circumstances pertaining to geography, socioeconomic status, or functional health often face inequities in accessing care. Electronic consultation (eConsult) is a secure online application that allows primary care providers (PCPs) and specialists to communicate regarding a patient's care. eConsult has demonstrated an ability to improve access to specialist care, and may be of particular use in cases of inequitable access. Methods: We examined how eConsult is used to improve equity of access for patients in complex circumstances by conducting a multiple case study of eConsults from seven patient groups: addiction, frail elderly, homeless, long-term care, rural, special needs, and transgender. Cases from these groups were selected from all eConsult cases completed between January 1 and December 31, 2017 using a data collection strategy tailored to each group. An access framework by Levesque et al. was applied to the data to examine five dimensions of access, arranged in chronological order, that reflect the process of a patient seeking care: approachability, acceptability; availability, affordability, and appropriateness. Two reviewers analyzed the cases using an iterative approach, regularly presenting findings to the research team for discussion and interpretation. Results: Eight hundred and twenty-five cases emerged across the seven target groups. The selected cases highlighted a number of key factors, including the value of the patient-PCP relationship, the importance of considering patient perspectives when providing care, and efforts to accommodate patients facing particular challenges to accessing care. Examples emerged among all five dimensions of the Levesque et al. access framework, with the final dimension, appropriateness, emerging across all cases. Conclusions: By leveraging the eConsult platform, PCPs can help improve equitable access to specialist care. More research is needed to understand why patients with complex circumstances face a longer wait time compared to the general population, and the impact that eConsults can have in improving health outcomes and wait times for this population.

The SIMPLER study recruited 242 residents with at least one medication charted for regular administration from 8 RACFs in South Australia. Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Dementia severity was assessed using the Dementia Severity Rating Scale. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL-NH scale. Dependence in ADLs was assessed using the Katz ADL scale.Results: The median age of participants was 87 years (interquartile range 81-92). Over one-third of participants (n=86, 36%) had 5 or more daily medication administration times. The number of daily administration times and MRCI scores were positively correlated with resident length of stay (r(s)=0.19; 0.27), FRAIL-NH score (r(s)=0.23; 0.34) and dependence in ADLs (r(s)=-0.21; -0.33) (all p<0.01). MRCI was weakly negatively correlated with CCI score (r(s)=-0.16; p=0.013). Neither number of daily administration times nor MRCI score were correlated with age or dementia severity. In multivariate analysis, frailty was associated with number of daily administration times (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.24) and MRCI score (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.13-1.41). Dementia severity was inversely associated with both multiple medication administration times (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99) and high MRCI score (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98).Conclusion: Residents with longer lengths of stay, more dependent in ADLs and most frail had the most complex medication regimens and, therefore, may benefit from targeted strategies to reduce medication regimen complexity.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				1178-1998		WOS:000491874500001	31695348

Methods: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used for the nonequivalent control group. The follow-up group (n=75) and non-follow-up group (n=68) received the same multifactorial program comprising muscle strength exercise, cognitive training, and psychosocial programs for 12 weeks. After completion of multifactorial program, the follow-up group took follow-up programs applying the capacity building strategy for following 12 weeks. The data of physical function, cognitive function, and psychological function, and self-rated health were collected from both groups three times: before intervention, after intervention, and 12 weeks after intervention. The data were analyzed using x2 test and t-test.Results: In comparison with the non-follow-up group, the scores of Timed Up & Go Test, and physical activities energy expenditure were significantly improved in the follow-up group. Conclusion: These results indicate that a multifactorial program with follow-up adapting the strategies of capacity building for the older adults group is feasible to prevent the physical frailty in community.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-9594			KJD:ART002476023

METHODS This longitudinal study with a 3-year follow-up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3-year period. CONCLUSIONS To prevent frailty, we suggest weight-loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower-limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. Implications for Nursing Practice The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2047-3087	2047-3095		WOS:000455261000009	29316345

Care decisions are complex because patients may have multiple comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Additionally, older adults often have vague symptomology, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and a reported delay of treatment. Although multiple clinical guidelines are available, the applicability of guidelines to the older population needs to be evaluated based on a holistic, individualized basis. Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes and priorities, incorporating risk-benefit assessment, quality of life, functional assessment, and frailty assessment when making treatment decisions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1555-4155	1878-058X		WOS:000454545800027

Professional and family caregivers' attitudes towards involuntary treatment in community-dwelling people with dementia								JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING				75	1			96	107		10.1111/jan.13839				JAN 2019	2019	Aims The aim of this study was to gain insight into professional and family caregivers' attitudes towards involuntary treatment in community-dwelling people with dementia (PwD). Background The number of PwD with complex care needs living at home is increasing rapidly. In some situations, caregivers provide care against the will of PwD, referred to as involuntary treatment, which includes non-consensual care, psychotropic medication and physical restraints. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods A total of 228 professional (nursing staff, general practitioners (GPs) and other healthcare professionals such as physical therapists and psychologists) and 77 family caregivers of PwD completed the Maastricht Attitude Questionnaire-Home Care. This questionnaire measures attitudes towards involuntary treatment and perceived restrictiveness of and experienced discomfort in using involuntary treatment. Data were collected in the Netherlands between June and November 2016. Results Family caregivers and GPs had more positive attitudes towards involuntary treatment than nursing staff and other healthcare professionals, indicating that they are more accepting of involuntary treatment. A more positive attitude was associated with higher perceived caregiver burden and being a family caregiver. Family caregivers and GPs found the use of involuntary treatment less restrictive and indicated feeling more comfortable when using these measures. Conclusion It is important to account for the differences in attitudes and foster dialogue among professional and family caregivers to find common ground about alternatives to involuntary treatment. These results will inform the development of an intervention that aims to prevent involuntary treatment in home care.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000453873300012	30168165

Background The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an educational programme. Design Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). Methods This trial was undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be evaluated on an intention-to-treat analysis. Discussion It is vital to manage and reduce resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and may improve comprehensive evidence-based care for older people residing in aged care facilities.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000453873300020	30109725

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARE COORDINATION				21	4			120	139		10.1177/2053434518817019				DEC 2018	2018	Introduction: The management of patients with complex health and social needs is one of the main challenges for healthcare systems. Integrated care seems to respond to this issue, with collaborative working and integration efforts of the care system components professionals and service providers aimed at improving efficiency, appropriateness and person centeredness of care. We conducted a narrative review to analyse the available evidences published on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated care models targeted on the management of such elderly patients.Methods: MEDLINE, Scopus and EBSCO were searched. We reported this narrative review according to the PRISMA Checklist. For studies to be included, they had to: (i) refer to integrated care models through implemented experimental or demonstration projects; (ii) focus on frail elderly 65 years old, with complex health and social needs, not disease-specific; (iii) evaluate effectiveness and/or cost and/or cost-effectiveness; (iv) report quantitative data (e.g. health outcomes, utilization outcomes, cost and cost-effectiveness).Results: Thirty articles were included, identifying 13 integrated care models. Common features were identified in case management, geriatric assessment and multidisciplinary team. Favourable impacts on healthcare facilities utilization rates, though with mixed results on costs, were found. The development of community-based and cost-effective integrated systems of care for the elderly is possible, thanks to the cooperation across care professionals and providers, to achieving a relevant impact on healthcare and efficient resource management. The elements of success or failure are not always unique and identifiable, but the potential clearly exists for these models to be successful and generalized on a large scale.Discussion: We found out a favourable impact of integrated care models/methods on health outcomes, care utilization and costs. The selected interventions are likely to be implemented at community level, focused on the patient management in terms of continuity of care. Thus, we propose a value-based framework for the evaluation of these services.									6	0	0	0	0	1	6			2053-4345	2053-4353		WOS:000455363400004

A coordinated preventive approach that integrates the provision of health and social care services could promote healthy ageing. Such an approach can be organised differently, depending on the availability and organizational structures in the local context. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of a coordinated preventive care approach in various European settings.Objectives: This study explored the effects of a coordinated preventive health and social care approach on the lifestyle, health and quality of life of community-dwelling older persons in five European cities.Design: International multi-center pre-post controlled trial.Setting: Community settings in cities in the United Kingdom, Greece, Croatia, the Netherlands and Spain.Participants: 1844 community-dwelling older persons (mean age = 79.5; SD = 5.6).Methods: The Urban Health Centres Europe (UHCE) approach consisted of a preventive multidimensional health assessment and, if a person was at-risk, coordinated care-pathways targeted at fall risk, appropriate medication use, loneliness and frailty. Intervention and control sites were chosen based on their location in distinct neighbourhoods in the participating cities. Persons in the catchment area of the intervention sites 'the intervention group' received the UHCE approach and persons in catchment areas of the control sites 'the control group' received care as usual. A questionnaire and two measurements were taken at baseline and at one-year follow-up to assess healthy lifestyle, fall risk, appropriate medication use, loneliness level, frailty, level of independence, health-related quality of life and care use. To evaluate differences in outcomes between intervention group and control group for the total study population, for those who received follow-up care-pathways and for each city separately (multilevel) logistic and linear regression analyses were used.Results: Persons in the intervention group had less recurrent falls (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.48; 0.88) and lower frailty (B =-0.43, 95% CI = -0.65 to -0.22) at follow-up compared with persons in the control group. Physical health-related quality of life and mental well-being was better (B = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.14-1.76; and B = 1.50; 95% CI = 0.15-2.84 respectively). The effects of the UHCE approach were stronger in the subgroup of persons (53.6%) enrolled in care-pathways.Conclusions: Our study found promising but minor effects for the use of a coordinated preventive health and social care approach for the promotion of healthy ageing of older persons. Future studies should further evaluate effects of coordinated preventive health and social care aimed at healthy ageing.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0020-7489	1873-491X		WOS:000454965600019	30296635

Increased life expectancy, technical advances in treatment and symptom control, and the extension of palliative care in community settings not only lengthen life but also make it possible for many patients to be cared for, and to die, at home. Moreover, death increasingly occurs in late old age and after a prolonged period of comorbidity and/or frailty. This has far-reaching consequences for the way that professional services are resourced and organized and for the informal carers who are often responsible for providing the greater part of patient care, including management of complex medication regimes.Objectives. To explore the literature focused on family caregivers' (FCGs) experiences of medication management for patients being cared for and dying at home.Methods. This literature review takes a critical interpretive synthesis approach to the review of 15 identified articles.Results. Findings show that FCGs can struggle to manage medications for someone who is dying at home, yet there is an expectation that they will take on these roles and are often judged by professional standards. Five key themes identified particular issues around administration, organizational skills, empowerment, relationships, and support.Conclusion. As increasing demands are placed on FCGs, there remains limited acknowledgment or understanding of the challenges they face, how they cope, or could be best supported. Alongside training, FCGs need access to 24 hours of support and medication reviews to rationalize unnecessary medications. Furthermore, the ethical challenges arising from administering medicines at the end of life also need to be acknowledged and discussed.

In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients >= 70 years of age were evaluated with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age was 76 (70-92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p 0.001) and GA group (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0961-5423	1365-2354		WOS:000451570300007	30357951

The patient characteristics, social environment and results of clinical practice were studied.Results: 190 patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 (59.8%) cases from the Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with dementia, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative healthcare resource (p <0.05).Conclusions: Patients presenting with advanced age, complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other patients. After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional capacity and present less polypharmacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Geriatric co-management has demonstrated potential to improve functional status, and reduce complications and length of stay, but evidence on the effectiveness in cardiology patients is lacking. This study aims to determine if geriatric co-management is superior to usual care in preventing functional decline, complications, mortality, readmission rates, reducing length of stay and improving quality of life in older patients admitted for acute heart disease or for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and to identify determinants of success for geriatric co-management in this population.Methods and analysis This prospective quasi-experimental before-and-after study will be performed on two cardiology units of the University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium in patients aged >= 75 years. In the precohort (n=227), usual care will be documented. A multitude of implementation strategies will be applied to allow for successful implementation of the model. Patients in the after cohort (n=227) will undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment within 24 hours of admission to stratify them into one of three groups based on their baseline risk for developing functional decline: low-risk patients receive proactive consultation, high-risk patients will be co-managed by the geriatric nurse to prevent complications and patients with acute geriatric problems will receive an additional medication review and co-management by the geriatrician.Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee UZ Leuven/KU Leuven (S58296). Written voluntary (proxy-) informed consent will be obtained from all participants at the start of the study. Dissemination of results will be through articles in scientific and professional journals both in English and Dutch and by conference presentations.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2044-6055			WOS:000454739500154	30344179

Major amputation is often offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked deterioration of an ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced mobility, intractable pain, infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of clinical outcome data on CLI and amputation exists internationally, little is known about the patient/family-centred experience of hospitalisation to inform preservation of personhood and patient-centred care planning.DesignLongitudinal qualitative study using Heideggerian phenomenology.MethodsFourteen patients and 13 family carers provided a semistructured interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation followed, a second interview (6months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients and seven family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed.ResultsHospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of chaos, characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile body and fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift within uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation and unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages (multiple stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity).ConclusionsPatients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful decision-making in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic process occurring within a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the care complexity and burden of family advocacy.Relevance to clinical practiceA coordinated, interprofessional response should improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation scheduling and discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a sense of safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should be actively facilitated.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000444077000011	29776002

This qualitative study builds on previous research and investigates enduring issues older people face when interacting with healthcare services.AimTo gain an in-depth understanding of what is involved in providing good quality health care for older people who need support to live at home.Methodological designWe adopted an interpretive descriptive approach and conducted semi-structured interviews with older people (n=7), carers (n=8) and key informants (n=11). Initial and secondary analysis of qualitative data was completed.FindingsMajor themes emerged about meanings of partnership in health care, and invisibility of the older person as a partner in health care. Partnership in health care was understood to mean being treated as an equal, being involved in decision-making, and making contributions which impact on health care and health systems. The metaphorical concept of invisibility' related to the older person not being seen and heard as a partner in health care, as well as being a recipient of care.ConclusionsWe concluded that older people who need support to live at home are not highly visible to health providers, policymakers and researchers as a central partner and consumer to be meaningfully engaged in shaping their health care. Opportunities to address persistent issues with quality of health care may in future be achieved through stronger partnerships between older people and health providers, to find new ways to improve the quality of care for older people.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000445450800005	29171678

A survey of frail older persons with cognitive impairment transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department								SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES				32	3			1138	1147		10.1111/scs.12559				SEP 2018	2018	BackgroundProviding care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is associated with a high risk of them developing complications.AimTo survey the most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, symptoms and actions taken at the hospital.MethodA retrospective descriptive survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives.FindingsThe persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care.ConclusionFrail older persons with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end-of-life care, should be prevented from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making house calls.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000445450800016	29436003

However, nursing staff often has insufficient knowledge and skills to adequately address the needs of frail older adults. There is therefore a need for nurses with advanced qualifications. To meet this need, advanced geriatric nursing has been introduced in Norway.Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses with their new role as advanced geriatric nurses in care of older adults and to determine what strategies the nurses considered important in the development of their new role.Design: This study applied a descriptive, exploratory design.Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 nurses who had undergone an educational programme to become advanced geriatric nurses in Norway in 2016. Content analysis was used to analyse the data.Findings: The participants described a complex and extensive nursing role, which they related to a new understanding of the patients, relatives and the system in which they worked. This new gaze had developed based on a combination of their new knowledge, their skills, experiences and professional interests. The opportunities to use their role depended on their workplace conditions. They related to contextual challenges at their workplace in different ways to optimise the use of their new gaze.Conclusions: Common for all participants was a broader and deeper understanding of the patient's health and life situation, which guided participants' actions. The key issue in developing the new role was developing effective strategies to foster role integration.Implications for Practice: Advanced geriatric nurses should collaborate with their managers to create a role that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills, as well as collaborate with colleagues to enhance understanding of utilisation of their role.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000442344100001	29527828

Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses.ResultsDuring the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months.ConclusionsThe use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000436254800046	28895175

Functional decline in residents 1 year after surgery was associated with decline in function in the 6 months before surgery (adjusted hazard ratio (aH)=2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.29-2.49), emergency procedures (aHR=1.37, 95% CI=1.31-1.43), older age (85 vs 65-74, aHR=1.17, 95% CI=1.11-1.23), and baseline cognitive impairment (aHR=1.15, 95% CI=1.11-1.20).CONCLUSION: Despite the low complexity of minor urological procedures, NH residents experience high mortality and many demonstrate sustained functional decline up to 1-year postoperatively.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0002-8614	1532-5415		WOS:000433585500012	29572851

Although it is associated with disability and multiple comorbidities, it can also be present in individuals who seem healthy. Frailty is multidimensional and its pathophysiology is complex. Early identification and intervention can potentially decrease or reverse frailty, especially in the early stages. Primary care physicians, community nurses and community social networks have important roles in the identification of pre-frail and frail elderly through the use of simple frailty screening tools and rapid geriatric assessments. Appropriate interventions that can be initiated in a primary care setting include a targeted medical review for reversible medical causes of frailty, medication appropriateness, nutritional advice and exercise prescription. With ongoing training and education, the multidisciplinary engagement and coordination of care of the elderly in the community can help to build resilience and combat frailty in our rapidly ageing society.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0037-5675			WOS:000433260200002	29799055

However, little is known how the 89% of elderly living at home make decisions regarding their health care. Research into older adults' management of chronic conditions emerges as an important step to potentially encourage symptom monitoring, prevent missed care and detect deterioration. All should reduce the risk of hospital re-admission.Design: A mixed methods thematic literature review was undertaken. The structure followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews recommended by the EQUATOR network.Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus online databases were searched using keywords, inclusion and exclusion criteria. References drawn from relevant publications, identified by experts and published between 1995 and 2017 were also considered. Twenty-five qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies and reviews were critically appraised (CASP 2013) before inclusion in the review. Analysis of each study's findings was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (2006) steps to identify major themes and sub-themes.Results: Four main themes associated with health-related decision-making in the elderly were identified: "the importance of maintaining independence," "decision making style," "management of conditions at home" and "discharge planning."Conclusion: Health care decision preferences in the elderly emerged as highly complex and influenced by multiple factors. Development of a tool to assess these components has been recommended.Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses play a vital role in exploring and understanding the influence that maintaining independence has with each patient. This understanding provides an initial step toward development of a tool to assist collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals involved in their care.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000430825100007	29322576

To appraise this complexity, geriatricians have developed a multidimensional comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), which may be difficult to apply in primary care settings. Our primary objective was to compare the effect on morbimortality of usual care compared with two complex interventions combining educational seminars about CGA: a dedicated geriatric hotline for general practitioners (GPs) and CGA by trained nurses or GPs.Methods and analysis The Clinical Epidemiology and Ageing study is an open-label, pragmatic, multicentre, three-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial comparing two intervention groups and one control group. Patients must be 70 years or older with a long-term illness or with unscheduled hospitalisation in the past 3 months (750 patients planned). This study involves volunteering GPs practising in French primary care centres, with randomisation at the practice level. The multifaceted interventions for interventional arms comprise an educational interactive multiprofessional seminar for GPs and nurses, a geriatric hotline dedicated to GPs in case of difficulties and the performance of a CGA updated to primary care. The CGA is systematically performed by a nurse in arm 1 but is GP-led on a case-by-case basis in arm 2. The primary endpoint is a composite criterion comprising overall death, unscheduled hospitalisations, emergency admissions and institutionalisation within 12 months after inclusion. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed using mixed-effects logistic regression models, with adjustment for potential confounders.Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by an appropriate ethics committee (CPP Ile-de-France IV, Paris, France, approval April 2015; 15 664). This study is conducted according to principles of good clinical practice in the context of current care and will provide useful knowledge on the clinical benefits achievable by CGA in primary care.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-6055			WOS:000435176700177	29654038

Because of this change to a higher proportion of older people, the WHO has called for improved palliative care for older persons. A large number of all deaths in the industrialised world occur while older people are living in nursing homes and therefore a key question becomes how the principles of palliative care can be implemented in that context. The aims of this study are: a) to describe a model of an educational intervention with the goal of implementing knowledge-based palliative care in nursing homes, and b) to describe the design of the evaluation of the effectiveness regarding the implementation of knowledge-based palliative care.Methods/design: A complex intervention is evaluated by means of a cross-over design. An educational intervention concerning palliative care consisting of five seminars during 6 months for staff and managers has been developed and conducted in 20 nursing homes in two counties. Before the intervention started, the feasibility was tested in a pilot study conducted in nursing homes not included in the main study. The intervention is evaluated through a non-randomized experimental design with intervention and control groups and pre- and post-assessments. The evaluation includes older persons living in nursing homes, next-of-kin, staff and managers. Data collection consists of quantitative methods such as questionnaires and register data and qualitative methods in the form of individual interviews, focus-group interviews and participant observations.Discussion: The research will contribute to new knowledge about how to implement knowledge-based palliative care in a nursing home setting. A strength of this project is that the Medical Research Council framework of complex intervention is applied. The four recommended stages, Development, Feasibility and piloting, Evaluation and Implementation, are combined for the educational intervention, which functions as a strategy to achieve knowledge-based palliative care in the nursing homes. Implementation is always a question of change and a good theoretical understanding is needed for drawing valid conclusions about the causal mechanisms of change. The topic is highly relevant considering the world's ageing population. The data collection is completed and the analysis is ongoing.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			1472-684X			WOS:000428245000001	29566688

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4-year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method.Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: Fluctuating ill-health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living.Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person-centred care .Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1748-3735	1748-3743		WOS:000425184600008	28990309

Hence many professions and organisations are involved. Lack of interprofessional and interorganisational collaboration leads to fragmented care. Care planning meetings before hospital discharge have long been used to overcome this fragmentation, but meetings conducted at the hospital have limitations in identifying long-term needs at home. A new model for health and social care planning in collaboration (HSCPC) in older persons' homes was introduced in two Swedish municipalities. The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the HSCPC-meeting from the perspectives of older persons, family members, and professionals. Ten care planning meetings from two municipalities were consecutively included. Interviews in retrospect with ten older persons, eight family members, and ten groups of professionals who had attended the HSCPC-meeting at home were analysed with a hermeneutic approach. Four themes emerged: unspoken agendas and unpreparedness, security and enhanced understanding, asymmetric relationships, and ambiguity about the mission and need for follow-up. The comprehensive interpretation is that the professionals handled the HSCPC-meeting mainly as a routine task, while the older persons and family members viewed it as part of their life course. Older persons are in an inferior institutional, cognitive and existential position. However, meeting together in the home partly reduced their inferior position. Findings from this study provide some general suggestions for how HSCPC-meetings should be designed and developed: attention of power relations, the importance of meeting skills and follow-up.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000426524200014	28543670

We aimed to develop a theory that outlines the hypothetical causal pathway of ACP in nursing homes, i.e. what changes are expected, by means of which processes and under what circumstances.Methods: The Theory of Change approach is a participatory method of programme design and evaluation whose underlying intention is to improve understanding of how and why a programme works. It results in a Theory of Change map that visually represents how, why and under what circumstances ACP is expected to work in nursing home settings in Belgium. Using this approach, we integrated the results of two workshops with stakeholders (n=27) with the results of a contextual analysis and a systematic literature review.Results: We identified two long-term outcomes that ACP can achieve: to improve the correspondence between residents' wishes and the care/treatment they receive and to make sure residents and their family feel involved in planning their future care and are confident their care will be according to their wishes. Besides willingness on the part of nursing home management to implement ACP and act accordingly, other necessary preconditions are identified and put in chronological order. These preconditions serve as precursors to, or requirements for, accomplishing successful ACP. Nine original key intervention components with specific rationales are identified at several levels (resident/family, staff or nursing home) to target the preconditions: selection of a trainer, ensuring engagement by management, training ACP reference persons, in-service education for healthcare staff, information for staff, general practitioners, residents and their family, ACP conversations and documentation, regular reflection sessions, multidisciplinary meetings, and formal monitoring.Conclusions: The Theory of Change map presented here illustrates a theory of how ACP is expected to work in order to achieve its desired long-term outcomes while highlighting organisational factors that potentially facilitate the implementation and sustainability of ACP. We provide the first comprehensive rationale of how ACP is expected to work in nursing homes, something that has been called for repeatedly.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25				1471-2318		WOS:000425465200001	29444645

A thematic analysis identified core challenges that were presented to 64 clinicians over five feedback sessions, validating interview findings, and identifying shared priorities for improving palliative care delivery.Results: Eight challenges emerged: patient age; access to information; communication with patients, family members, and clinicians; understanding of palliative care; role uncertainty; complex systems and processes; time constraints; and limited training and education. Through feedback sessions, clinicians selected four challenges as improvement priorities: time constraints; communication and information; systems and processes; and understanding of palliative care. As resulting improvement plans evolved, training and education replaced time constraints as a priority.Conclusion: Clinician priorities for improving emergency department-based palliative care were identified through collaborative, iterative processes. Though generally aware of older palliative patients' needs, clinicians struggled to provide high-quality care due to a range of complex factors. Further research should identify whether priorities are shared across other emergency departments, and develop, implement, and evaluate strategies developed by clinicians.									12	0	0	0	0	1	13			0269-2163	1477-030X		WOS:000423322000013	28429643

Previous evidence suggested that the effectiveness of CGA programs may be influenced by settings where the CGA is performed [i.e., hospital, posthospital discharge/long-term care facilities (LTCFs), or community/home] as well as the specific clinical conditions of older frail individuals. In this scenario, CGA and quality of care in LTCFs have been a challenge for decades. In the present article, we systematically reviewed evidence from the last three decades of clinical research devoted to systematic implementation of CGA programs in LTCFs, that is, nursing homes, care homes, residential homes, and rehabilitation facilities. In the United States, all LTC residents must undergo a CGA on a regular basis on admission to a facility, prompting the development of the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) Minimum Data Set, a specific CGA-based assessment tool in this population. In the LTCF setting, the present reviewed evidence suggested that most complex older subjects may benefit from a CGA in terms of improved quality of care and reduced hospitalization events and that CGA must be standardized across healthcare settings to promote greater health system integration and coordination. In the LTCF setting, particularly in nursing homes, other new and promising CGA programs have also been proposed to develop rapid screening CGA-based tools to enhance in the future the ability of primary care physicians to recognize and treat geriatric syndromes in this setting. However, at present, the interRAI suite of instruments represented an integrated health information system that has the potential to provide person-centered information transcending healthcare settings.									10	1	0	0	3	0	11			1549-1684	1557-8577		WOS:000425663200002	28635539

In some countries, telephone communication between primary nurses and patients in General Practice is already seen as a routine practice, but determining the value of this type of communication as a specific health service needs more understanding.DesignA qualitative exploratory study as the aim was to explore the older person's experiences.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 older people from General Practices in New Zealand during 2014-2015. Thematic analysis was informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach.FindingsThe overarching theme was the difficulties older people face in making decisions about whether to contact a health professional by telephone and whether this should be the Primary nurse. Accounting for some of their symptoms as age related added to the uncertainty of decision-making. Importantly, some older people were not raising concerns e.g. emotional state.ConclusionDecision-making by older people around treatment seeking is complex. Increasing the awareness of the nurse role in the General Practice is integral to creating a health system which will meet the needs of a growing older population. Primary care practices can review their systems to better inform older people how the nurse-telephone role as a specific health service works and what they can expect when using this service.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000419718200015	28881437

The microbiome from nursing home (NH) residents is marked by a loss in diversity that is associated with increased frailty. Our objective was to explore the associations of NH environment, frailty, nutritional status and residents' age to microbiome composition and potential metabolic function.Methodology. We conducted a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 23 residents, 65 years or older, from one NH that had four floors: two separate medical intensive floors and two floors with active elders. Residents were assessed using the mini nutritional assessment tool and clinical frailty scale. Bacterial composition and metabolic potential of residents' stool samples was determined by metagenomic sequencing. We performed traditional unsupervised correspondence analysis and linear mixed effect modelling regression to assess the bacteria and functional pathways significantly affected by these covariates.Results/Key findings. NH resident microbiomes demonstrated temporal stability (PERMANOVA P=0.001) and differing dysbiotic associations with increasing age, frailty and malnutrition scores. As residents aged, the abundance of microbiotaencoded genes and pathways related to essential amino acid, nitrogenous base and vitamin B production declined. With increasing frailty, residents had lower abundances of butyrate-producing organisms, which are associated with increased health and higher abundances of known dysbiotic species. As residents became malnourished, butyrate-producing organisms declined and dysbiotic bacterial species increased. Finally, the microbiome of residents living in proximity shared similar species and, as demonstrated for Escherichia coli, similar strains.Conclusion. These findings support the conclusion that a signature 'NH' microbiota may exist that is affected by the residents' age, frailty, nutritional status and physical location.									27	0	0	0	14	0	27			0022-2615	1473-5644		WOS:000425273400005	29134939

Although equally considered in the computation of the SPPB score, each of the components may present a specific and different weight in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between SPPB and its component of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood).Method: Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 730 older persons (74.29% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. The FI was computed as the ratio between 30 actual and potential deficits the participant might have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 deficits]). Physical status was assessed using the SPPB score at baseline. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between the SPPB and FI and estimate which components of the SPPB were most strongly associated with the FI.Results: Mean age of participants was 86.5 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11) and SPPB of 2.5 (range between 0 and 12). The SPPB and its components were all significantly associated with the FI, but the magnitude of the associations varied. Linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, showed that the balance test [beta = -0.045 (95% CI -0.042; -0.028), p < 0.0001] and chair stand test [beta = -0.040 (95% CI -0.054; -0.027), p < 0.0001] was more strongly associated with the FI than the gait speed [beta = -0.015 (95% CI -0.021; -0.008), p < 0.0001].Conclusion: Of the 3 components of the SPPB, both balance and chair tests seem particularly relevant indicator of frailty among very old and complex elders living in nursing homes.									10	0	0	0	4	0	10			0167-4943	1872-6976		WOS:000415983300012	29040887

Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. Methods: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. Results: The mean age of the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 +/- 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P < .001), 75% worse wake disturbances (P < .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. Conclusions: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0889-4655	1550-5049		WOS:000432450100001	28353543

The aim of this study was to conduct a process evaluation to examine the implementation of a randomized controlled trial of home modifications designed to reduce the risk of falls and improve daily activity performance among community-dwelling older adults.METHOD. A process evaluation was conducted alongside a blinded, randomized sham-controlled trial (n = 92). Participants were followed for 1 yr after intervention. The process evaluation was framed using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework.RESULTS. The treatment group improved daily activity performance over 12 mo compared with the sham control group (F = 4.13; p = .024). The intervention elements and dose were delivered with greater than 90% accuracy. Participants reported a 91% adherence rate at 12 mo.CONCLUSION.

Limited research exists on why, when, and how Amish older adults and their caregivers experience health care services outside of their family and community. The purpose of the current study was to describe and explore the perspectives of Amish caregivers caring for older adults and their experiences with health care services outside of their community. A qualitative phenomenological research design was used in combination with a community-based participatory framework with caregivers in a small, rural Amish settlement. Amish caregiving of older adults is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by cultural characteristics. Caregivers place significant cultural value on home caregiving, emphasize the experience as a blessing, and relate misunderstandings between themselves and outside health care providers as significant concerns.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1940-4921	1938-2464		WOS:000423439400005	29370444	
J	Hainstock, Taylor; Cloutier, Denise; Penning, Margaret								From home to 'home': Mapping the caregiver journey in the transition from home care into residential care								JOURNAL OF AGING STUDIES				43				32	39		10.1016/j.jaging.2017.09.003				DEC 2017	2017	Family caregivers play a pivotal role in supporting the functional independence and quality of life of older relatives, often taking on a wide variety of care-related activities over the course of their caregiving journey. These activities help family members to remain in the community and age-in-place for as long as possible. However, when needs exceed family capacities to provide care, the older family member may need to transition from one care environment to another (e.g., home care to nursing home care), or one level of cam to another (from less intense to more intensive services).Drawing upon qualitative interview data collected in a populous health region in British Columbia, Canada, this study explores the roles and responsibilities of family caregivers for family members making the care transition from home care to residential care. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts resulted in the development of a conceptual framework to characterize the "Caregiver Journey" as a process that could be divided into at least three phases: 1) Precursors to transition-recognizing frailty in family members and caregivers prior to transition; 2) Preparing to transition into residential nursing home care (RC) and 3) Post transition: Finding a new balance-where caregivers adjust and adapt to new caregiving responsibilities.Our analyses revealed that the second phase is the most complex involving a consideration of the various activities, and roles that family caregivers take on to prepare for the care transition including: information gathering, advocacy and system navigation. We conclude that there is a need for family caregivers to be better supported during care transitions; notably through ongoing and enhanced investments in strategies to support caregiver communication and education.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0890-4065	1879-193X		WOS:000418215400005	29173512

Oral anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke risk and improves outcomes. Yet, in approximately 30% of cases, anticoagulation is not commenced for a variety of reasons.DesignQualitative study using narrative inquiry.MethodsData from face-to-face individual interviews with patients and information retrieved from healthcare file note review documented the clinician perspective. This study is a synthesis of the two data sources, obtained during patient clinical assessments as part of the Atrial Fibrillation And Stroke Thromboprophylaxis in hEart failuRe (AFASTER) Study.ResultsPatient choice and preference were important factors in anticoagulation decisions, including treatment burden, unfavourable or intolerable side effects and patient refusal. Financial barriers included cost of travel, medication cost and reimbursement. Psychological factors included psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment and depression. Social barriers included homelessness and the absence of a caregiver or lack of caregiver assistance. Clinician reticence included fear of falls, frailty, age, fear of bleeding and the challenges of multimorbidity. Facilitators to successful prescription and adherence were caregiver support, reminders and routine, self-testing and the use of technology.ConclusionsMany barriers remain to high-risk individuals being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. There are a number of enabling factors that facilitate prescription and optimise treatment adherence. Nurses should challenge these treatment barriers and seek enabling factors to optimise therapy.Relevance to clinical practiceNurses can help patients and caregivers to understand complex anticoagulant risk-benefit information, and act as a patient advocate when making complex stroke prevention decisions.									10	0	1	0	2	0	11			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000416319600046	28178370

Therefore, we examined whether a theory-based method for process description of implementation can contribute to improvement of evidence-based care. MOVIT, a Dutch project aimed at implementing integrated care for older vulnerable persons in residential care homes, was used as a case study. The project activities were defined according to implementation taxonomy and mapped in a matrix of theoretical levels and domains. Project activities mainly targeted professionals (both individual and group). A few activities targeted the organizational level, whereas none targeted the policy level, or the patient, or the social, political, and legal domains. However, the resulting changes in care delivery arrangement had consequences for professionals, patients, organizations, and the social, political, and legal domains. A structured process description of a pragmatic implementation project can help assess the fidelity and quality of the implementation, and identify relevant contextual factors for immediate adaptation and future research. The description showed that, in the MOVIT project, there was a discrepancy between the levels and domains targeted by the implementation activities and those influenced by the resulting changes in delivery arrangement. This could have influenced, in particular, the adoption and sustainability of the project.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0046-9580	1945-7243		WOS:000416002800001	29161944

The implementation of Advanced Nurse Practitioners globally has been shown to make healthcare more effective and increase patient safety, continuity of care and access to care. In Sweden, research about Advanced Nurse Practitioners is limited. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the opinions of managers, doctors and nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare about the role of ANPs in municipal healthcare as a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of the frail elderly.Methods: Managers, doctors and specialist nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare adopted a qualitative, descriptive design through 12 semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using content analysis.Results: The participants expressed both opportunities as well as challenges with Advanced Nurse Practitioners in municipal healthcare. This role considered to satisfy frail elderly people's healthcare needs and making the healthcare more effective as the doctors would have more time for other patients. The challenges mainly consist of doubts from the managers whether the nurses would be motivated to pursue further education to become an Advanced Nurse Practitioner if the role becomes a reality. The doctors were unsure if the nurses would consider taking the responsibility the role would imply.Conclusions: Advanced Nurse Practitioner is considered to be a valuable resource not only for the frail elderly but also for the nurses in the municipal healthcare and for the doctors in primary care as they probably would make healthcare more effective. They might be a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of frail elderly, however there are also challenges to overcome before they can become a reality in a Swedish healthcare context. Consequently, this role deserves further investigation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1472-6955			WOS:000415314500001	29176932

Our knowledge is limited regarding which needs for nursing interventions patients being cared for in their home have, and how they are met. We aimed at assessing aspects of health and function in a representative sample of the most vulnerable home-dwelling elderly, to identify their needs for nursing interventions and how these needs were met.Methods: In this observational study we included patients aged 75+ living in their own homes in Oslo, who received daily home care, had three or more chronic diagnoses, received daily medication, and had been hospitalized during the last year. Focused attention and cognitive processing speed were assessed with the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), handgrip strength was used as a measure of sarcopenia, mobility was assessed with the "Timed Up-and-Go" test, and independence in primary activities of daily living by the Barthel Index. Diagnoses and medication were collected from electronic medical records. For each diagnosis, medication and functional impairment, a consensus group defined which nursing service that the particular condition necessitated. We then assessed whether these needs were fulfilled for each participant.Results: Of 150 eligible patients, 83 were included (mean age 87 years, 25% men). They had on average 6 diagnoses and used 9 daily medications. Of the 83 patients, 61 (75%) had grip strength indicating sarcopenia, 27 (33%) impaired mobility, and 69 (83%) an impaired TMT-A score. Median amount of home nursing per week was 3.6 h (interquartile range 2.6 to 23.4). Fulfilment of pre-specified needs was >60% for skin and wound care in patients with skin diseases, observation of blood glucose in patients taking antidiabetic drugs, and in supporting food intake in patients with eating difficulties. Most other needs as defined by the consensus group were fulfilled in <10% of the patients.Conclusions: We identified a very frail group of home-dwelling patients. For this group, resources for home nursing should probably be used in a more flexible and pro-active way to aim for preserving functional status, minimize symptom burden, and prevent avoidable hospitalisations.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1472-6963			WOS:000410714000003	28899369

However, women who experience intimate partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole.DesignMeta-ethnographic synthesis of qualitative evidence.MethodsA systematic search of PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end of December 2015.ResultsThe review identified that intimate partner violence exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice.ConclusionsThis study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service providers need to be aware of these.Relevance to clinical practiceurses and healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of abuse and this includes older women.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000405562600006	27487083

Efficacy of an Exercise and Nutritional Supplement Program on Physical Performance and Nutritional Status in Older Adults With Mobility Limitations Residing at Senior Living Facilities								JOURNAL OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY				25	3			453	463		10.1123/japa.2016-0173				JUL 2017	2017	This cluster-randomized trial was designed to determine the efficacy of a 6-month exercise-nutritional supplement program (ENP) on physical function and nutritional status for older adults and the feasibility of implementing this program in a senior living setting. Twenty senior-living facilities were randomized to either a 3 day per week group-based ENP led by a trained facility staff member or a health education program (SAP). Participants (N = 121) completed a short physical performance battery, 400-m walk, handgrip strength test, and mini-nutrition assessment. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], insulin-like growth-factor 1 (IGF-1), and activity level were also measured. The ENP did not significantly improve physical function or nutritional status compared with the SAP. Compared with baseline, participants in the ENP engaged in 39 min less physical activity per week at 6 months. Several facility characteristics hindered implementation of the ENP. This study highlights the complexity of implementing an evidence-based program in a field setting.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1063-8652	1543-267X		WOS:000406826700015	28095099

These patients tend to be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of stay (LOS).Aim: This series review provides a description of the patient complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb amputation for peripheral arterial disease.Method: Medical records coded for major amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed.Findings: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial morbidity and 30-day mortality.Conclusion: Major amputation continues to present challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding to surgery require further investigation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1062-0303	1532-6578		WOS:000402535900002	28527727

The care of a frail elder requires an interdisciplinary team approach, yet dental professionals are often absent from these teams. As an educational intervention, dental hygiene students, in addition to providing clinical care to residents and education to staff in a LTC facility, have been participating in interdisciplinary care conferences for 4years.Methods : Nine LTC facility staff and eight students participated in two focus groups and five personal interviews to discuss their experiences of the care conferences. Narratives were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted.Results: Four major themes emerged that described the essence of the experience of involving dental professionals within interdisciplinary care conference: (i) addressing oral health, (ii) reciprocal learning, (iii) dealing with complexity and (iv) impact of collaborative care.Conclusion: Overall, students found the educational intervention to be worthwhile that allowed for the development of interdisciplinary skills and a greater understanding of dental geriatrics. The dental support in care conferences was welcomed by the staff as it facilitated a new way of exchanging knowledge and experiences so that a more holistic approach to care could be undertaken by all.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0734-0664	1741-2358		WOS:000400306000013	28168829

Nursing homes must engage patients in advance care planning, but do so inconsistently. Video decision support tools improved advance care planning in small randomized controlled trials. Pragmatic trials are increasingly employed in health services research, although not commonly in the nursing home setting to which they are well-suited. This report presents the design and rationale for a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial that evaluated the ''real world'' application of an Advance Care Planning Video Program in two large US nursing home healthcare systems.Methods: PRagmatic trial Of Video Education in Nursing homes was conducted in 360 nursing homes (N = 119 intervention/N = 241 control) owned by two healthcare systems. Over an 18-month implementation period, intervention facilities were instructed to offer the Advance Care Planning Video Program to all patients. Control facilities employed usual advance care planning practices. Patient characteristics and outcomes were ascertained from Medicare Claims, Minimum Data Set assessments, and facility electronic medical record data. Intervention adherence was measured using a Video Status Report embedded into electronic medical record systems. The primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations/person-day alive among long-stay patients with advanced dementia or cardiopulmonary disease. The rationale for the approaches to facility randomization and recruitment, intervention implementation, population selection, data acquisition, regulatory issues, and statistical analyses are discussed.Results: The large number of well-characterized candidate facilities enabled several unique design features including stratification on historical hospitalization rates, randomization prior to recruitment, and 2: 1 control to intervention facilities ratio. Strong endorsement from corporate leadership made randomization prior to recruitment feasible with 100% participation of facilities randomized to the intervention arm. Critical regulatory issues included minimal risk determination, waiver of informed consent, and determination that nursing home providers were not engaged in human subjects research. Intervention training and implementation were initiated on 5 January 2016 using corporate infrastructures for new program roll-out guided by standardized training elements designed by the research team. Video Status Reports in facilities' electronic medical records permitted "real-time'' adherence monitoring and corrective actions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Virtual Research Data Center allowed for rapid outcomes ascertainment.Conclusion: We must rigorously evaluate interventions to deliver more patient-focused care to an increasingly frail nursing home population. Video decision support is a practical approach to improve advance care planning. PRagmatic trial Of Video Education in Nursing homes has the potential to promote goal-directed care among millions of older Americans in nursing homes and establish a methodology for future pragmatic randomized controlled trials in this complex healthcare setting.									22	0	0	0	9	0	22			1740-7745	1740-7753		WOS:000397934800005	28068789

Given the ageing population, the importance of providing appropriate, quality health care in the emergency department for this cohort is paramount. One possible solution, a nurse-led, physician-championed, emergency department gerontological intervention team, which provides frontload assessment, early collateral communication and appropriate discharge planning, has been developed. The aim of this Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention is to maximise the quality of care for this vulnerable cohort in a cost effective manner.Methods: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention research project consists of three interrelated studies within a program evaluation design. The research comprises of a structure, process and outcome framework to ascertain the overall utility of such a program. The first study is a pre-post comparison of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention in the emergency department, comparing the patient-level outcomes before and after service introduction using a quasi-experimental design with historical controls. The second study is a descriptive qualitative study of the structures and processes required for the operation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention and clinician and patient satisfaction with service models. The third study is an economic evaluation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention model of care.Discussion: There is a paucity of evidence in the literature to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in emergency departments designed to target frail older persons living in the community and residential aged care facilities. This is despite the high economic and patient morbidity and mortality experienced in these vulnerable cohorts. This research project will provide guidance related to the optimal structures and processes required to implement the model of care and the associated cost related outcomes.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1471-2318			WOS:000397463200001	28330452

Culturally linked risk factors and socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare disparities, and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy (HL) and HF are less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease management, or preventative health strategies. Objective: In this systematic review, we analyzed the literature studying older Latinos with HF and limited HL. Method: We searched the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. Inclusion criteria were research studies, Latinos, HF, and HL. Results: Eight quantitative studies were identified for final review. Inadequate HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL was associated with more HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL levels and higher medical complexity. Conclusions: Nurses and advanced practice nurses serve a pivotal role improving access and understanding of health information. Before conducting intervention research affecting clinical outcomes, it is essential to describe elderly Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. Barriers identified confirm the need to alter research protocols for older adults and ensure the availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older Latinos with HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients with limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be reliable predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, and develop, implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their health.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0889-4655	1550-5049		WOS:000394459400012	26646599

Dental examiners in a recent national survey of oral health in dependent older people in New Zealand were interviewed about their experiences and perspectives of that.Results: The challenges participants identified stemmed from three areas - the patient, the care facility and the oral health sector. To address those challenges, the participants recommended actions at the patient, system and sector levels. Each of the challenges and recommendations had a number of subthemes. Overall, the dentists felt that it is a very complex situation urgently requiring policy development, cross-sectoral collaboration and upskilling of the dental profession, carers, the private sector and the State to ensure a care environment which supports achieving and maintaining oral health among frail elders.Conclusions: Urgent attention to frail older New Zealanders' oral health is needed.

Janus at the Crossroads: Perspectives on Long-term Care Trajectories for Older Women With Dementia in a Canadian Context								GERONTOLOGIST				57	1	SI		68	81		10.1093/geront/gnw158				FEB 2017	2017	Purpose of the Study: Janus, the two-faced, Roman god of beginnings and transitions, is used as a metaphor to explore our personal narratives and our quantitative research on the experiences of older women with dementia in long-term care (LTC). Two research questions are addressed: (a) How do our quantitative data map onto our mothers' experiences? (b) What lessons do our mothers' experiences offer for the care of older women with dementia?Design and Methods: Informed by a life-course perspective, we triangulate administrative data on 3,717 women with dementia receiving LTC in British Columbia, Canada, with personal narratives-the stories of our mothers who made the transition from home care into residential (nursing home) care.Results: Our quantitative data reveal that the home care to residential care transition is the most common LTC trajectory for women with dementia who are most likely to be widowed and living alone in suburban areas. On entry into residential care, they exhibit greater frailty in terms of activities of daily living, cognition, aggression, and incontinence. Our personal narrative data on our mothers reveals that the relatively straightforward pathways through LTC for women with dementia, are often considerably more complex in a real-world context. Attention is drawn to the public and private services, hospitalization patterns, and substantial communication gaps experienced by our moms and families.Implications: A life-course perspective, and qualitative and quantitative data facilitate understanding the care journeys-health and service trajectories of older women with dementia.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0016-9013	1758-5341		WOS:000397054800011	27852640

Outcomes of the AFASTER study								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING				16	2			113	124		10.1177/1474515116642604				FEB 2017	2017	Background: Chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are complex cardiogeriatric syndromes mediated by physical, psychological and social factors. Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these syndromes, particularly stroke.Purpose: This study sought to describe the clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors of adverse events.Methods: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding.Results: All-cause readmission to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. Self-reported self-care behaviour and not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge.Conclusion: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients and caregivers offers the potential to improve treatment knowledge, adherence and outcomes in this group of patients with complex care needs.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1474-5151	1873-1953		WOS:000398177200003	27036952	
J	Heiberg, Kristi Elisabeth; Bruun-Olsen, Vigdis; Bergland, Astrid								The effects of habitual functional training on physical functioning in patients after hip fracture: the protocol of the HIPFRAC study								BMC GERIATRICS				17						23	10.1186/s12877-016-0398-8				JAN 17 2017	2017	Background: The survivors after hip fracture often report severe pain and loss of physical functioning. The poor outcomes cause negative impact on the person's physical functioning and quality of life and put a financial burden on society. Rehabilitation is important to improve physical functioning after hip fracture. To maintain the continuity in rehabilitation we have an assumption that it is of utmost importance to continue and progress the functional training that already started at the hospital, while the patients are transferred to short-term stays in a nursing home before they are returning to home. The aim presently is to examine the effects of a functional training program, initiated by the physiotherapist and performed by the nurses, on physical functioning while the patients are at short term stays in primary health care.Methods/design: Inclusion and randomization will take place during hospital stay. All patients 65 years or above who have sustained a hip fracture are eligible, except if they have a score on Mini Mental State (MMS-E) of less than 15, could walk less than 10 m prior to the fracture, or are terminally ill. The intervention consists of additional functional training as part of the habitual daily routine during short term stays at nursing homes after discharge from hospital. The primary outcome is physical functioning measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes are Timed "Up & Go" (TUG), hand grip strength, activPAL accelerometer, and self-reported measures like new Mobility Score (NMS), Walking Habits, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Fall efficacy scale (FES), EuroQol health status measure (EQ-5D-5 L), and pain.Discussion: Issues related to internal and external validity in the study are discussed. The outline for the arguments in this protocol is organized according to the guidelines of the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on how to develop and evaluate complex interventions.									11	1	0	0	3	0	12				1471-2318		WOS:000392024300002	28095787

Many physicians, however, lack the required formal training, often leading to long wait-lists for specialist clinics. Yet, clinics led by non-physician professionals specialising in geriatric care could decrease these delays. This article describes the development and evaluation of a nurse practitioner-led interprofessional geriatric outpatient clinic (Inter-D Clinic). A combination of semi-structured clinician interviews, post-clinic follow-up phone calls, satisfaction surveys, and information from the hospital workload management system served as data sources for this formative programme evaluation. Between January 2013 and December 2014, 293 patients were seen in the clinic with the majority being referred for either memory issues (49%) or functional decline (35%). The clinic assessment frequently uncovered other issues, which led to guidance around falls prevention, improved nutrition, medication management, and referrals to available community supports. Both patients and referring physicians were very satisfied with this model of care, which is likely transferable to other locations provided the needed clinical expertise and community support services are available.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1356-1820	1469-9567		WOS:000407634600020	28388276

Elderly patients living in Advanced Care Facilities (ACFs) often have significant co-morbidities to consider when selecting an appropriate drug therapy. Careful assessment is required when considering appropriate medication use in frail older patients as they have multiple diseases and thus multiple medication. Many physicians seem reluctant to discontinue other physicians' prescriptions, resulting in further polypharmacy. Therefore it is relevant to ascertain and synthesise the GP views from multiple settings to understand the processes that might promote appropriate deprescribing medications in the elderly.The aims of this study were to 1) compare and contrast behavioural factors influencing the deprescribing practices of GPs providing care for ACF residents in two separate countries, 2) review health policy and ACF systems in each setting for their potential impact on the prescribing of medications for an older person in residential care of the elderly, and 3) based on these findings, provide recommendations for future ACF deprescribing initiatives.Methods: A review and critical synthesis of qualitative data from two interview studies of knowledge, attitudes, and behavioural practices held by GPs towards medication management and deprescribing for residents of ACFs in Australia and Sweden was conducted. A review of policies and health care infrastructure was also carried out to describe the system of residential aged care in the both countries.Results: Our study has identified that deprescribing by GPs in ACFs is a complex process and that there are numerous barriers to medication reduction for aged care residents in both countries, both with similarities and differences. The factors affecting deprescribing behaviour were identified and divided into: intentions, skills and abilities and environmental factors.Conclusions: In this study we show that the GPs' behaviour of deprescribing in two different countries is much dependent on the larger health care system. There is a need for more education to both GPs and ACF staff as well as better cooperation between the different health care systems and appropriate monetary incentives for elderly care to achieve better conditions for deprescribing practice.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1471-2296			WOS:000386978000001	27814691

We aimed to develop a community-based episodic model of short-term integrated palliative and supportive care (SIPS) based on the views of service users and other key stakeholders in the United Kingdom.Method: transparent expert consultations with health professionals, voluntary sector and carer representatives including a consensus survey; and focus groups with older people and carers were used to generate recommendations for the SIPS model. Discussions focused on three key components of the model: potential benefit of SIPS, timing of delivery and processes of integrated working between specialist palliative care and generalist practitioners. Content and descriptive analysis was employed and findings were integrated across the data sources.Findings: we conducted two expert consultations (n = 63), a consensus survey (n = 42) and three focus groups (n = 17). Potential benefits of SIPS included holistic assessment, opportunity for end of life discussion, symptom management and carer reassurance. Older people and carers advocated early access to SIPS, while other stakeholders proposed delivery based on complex symptom burden. A priority for integrated working was the assignment of a key worker to co-ordinate care, but the assignment criteria remain uncertain.Interpretation: key stakeholders agree that a model of SIPS for frail older people with non-malignant conditions has potential benefits within community settings, but differ in opinion on the optimal timing and indications for this service. Our findings highlight the importance of consulting all key stakeholders in model development prior to feasibility evaluation.									20	1	0	0	4	0	21			0002-0729	1468-2834		WOS:000392702200024	27586857

People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed.This paper offers a theoretical proposition of 'Failure to Maintain' as a conceptual framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of 'Failure to Maintain'.Hospital focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). 'Failure to Maintain' offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, this vulnerable population.Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide patient focussed care, and avoid 'Failing to Maintain'.The research field of acute geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.

The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment.Background. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity.Design. Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT).Methods. Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care.Results. Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms.Conclusions. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.									14	1	0	0	4	0	15			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000386079500019	27222059	
J	Smith, Margaret Coulter; O'May, Fiona; Tropea, Savina; Berg, Jackie								Framing moving and handling as a complex healthcare intervention within the acute care of older people with osteoporosis: a qualitative study								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING				25	19-20			2906	2920		10.1111/jocn.13344				OCT 2016	2016	Aims and objectives. To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis.Background. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched.Design. An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism.Methods. The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used.Results. Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions.Conclusions. This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000388921200019	27550628	
J	Sneltvedt, Torild; Bondas, Terese				Bondas, Terese/L-2009-2019				Proud to be a nurse?

This study is part of a larger project on newly graduated nurses where previous research indicated that building professional pride at their workplace could be important for remaining in the profession and in municipal health care. However, the recently graduated nurse's first job assignment in municipal health care can also be a critical period with cuts in their pride as nurses who may have an impact on nursing care for their patients.AimThe aim of this study is to illuminate recently graduated nurses' experiences with professional pride in municipal health and care services.MethodsA phenomenological hermeneutic approach was chosen to illuminate meaning. A purposive sample of eight recently graduated nurses working in nursing homes or home health care was chosen for this study with narrative interviews and diaries.FindingsThree themes were identified: doing the good thing and doing what is right; being recognized and confirmed; and finally thriving in a community of practice. An important source of pride is the relation to patients. Recently graduated nurses build their professional pride in an active and social process in a community of practice. The first cut in their professional pride seems to take place when they were not recognized and confirmed as professional persons.ConclusionRecently graduated nurses in municipal health care describe their professional pride as a complex phenomenon with relational, dynamic and collective dimensions. The cuts in their pride may hurt their identity and nursing care.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000383803300014	26459623

Current participation ideology is based on individualism, which may conflict with the older generation's commonly held values of solidarity and community. Hence, different values and ideologies may come in conflict when older patients receive treatment and rehabilitation in geriatric wards. Participation is a guiding principle in rehabilitation. Criteria for admission of older patients to geriatric wards are complex health problems, acute illness and/or acute physical and/or cognitive functional failure. The ideal is an active and engaged patient. The aim of the study was to describe the difficulties experienced by older patients on acute geriatric wards when involving themselves with their own treatment and care.Methods: In this qualitative study older patients were interviewed during hospitalization in geriatric wards and asked to tell about their experiences with participation. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method.Results: The patients experienced difficulties in participating in decisions and care. They linked their difficulties to their own diminishing capabilities, and cited the ward's busy schedule as a reason for abstaining from participation. However, despite their reservations, they did participate in decisions in different ways. Their participatory practices appeared ambiguous and they employed various strategies to put themselves in a position of influence. The most important of these involved their relatives. The patients delegated to family the tasks of seeking, receiving and giving information to the nurses and the staff, and, to some extent, for the dialogues with hospital staff about their needs and plan of care. The family appeared to accept the responsibility willingly.Conclusions: The patients addressed their difficulties by authorizing family members to act and participate on their behalf. This underlines the family's important role in patient participation and the role that nurses and other staff must play in collaborating with the patient and their family to facilitate participation independently of the patients' performances of participation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1472-6955			WOS:000382358400001	27563281

Elderly Persons in the Risk Zone was designed to determine whether a preventive home visit or multiprofessional senior group meetings could postpone deterioration in frailty if the intervention is carried out when the person is not so frail. Design and Sample: The study was a RCT with follow-ups at 1 and 2 years. A total of 459 persons (80+), still living at home, were included. Participants were independent in activities of daily life and cognitively intact. Measures: Frailty was measured in two complementary ways, with the sum of eight frailty indicators and with the Mob-T Scale measuring tiredness in daily activities. Results: Both interventions showed favorable effects in postponing the progression of frailty measured as tiredness in daily activities for up to 1 year. However, neither of the two interventions was effective in postponing frailty measured with the sum of frailty indicators. Conclusions: The results in this study show the potential of health promotion to older persons. The multiprofessional approach, including a broad spectrum of information and knowledge, might have been an important factor contributing to a more positive view of aging.									17	0	0	0	3	3	19			0737-1209	1525-1446		WOS:000384579600005	26568469	
J	Peris-Martí, Juan F.; Fernández-Villalba, Elia; Bravo-José, Patricia; Sáez-Lleó, Carmen; García-Mina Freire, María								Reflection on the pharmaceutical service in nursing homes: understanding reality to cover needs	Reflexión sobre la prestación farmacéutica en centros sociosanitarios: entendiendo la realidad para cubrir las necesidades							Farmacia Hospitalaria				40	4			302	315		10.7399/fh.2016.40.4.10430				2016-08	2016	The increasing concern regarding chronic care, which is a consequence of the current demographic progression, and the need to decrease the costs associated with its care, places a focus on social care homes caring for highly dependent patients. Simultaneously, the residential facilities are progressing in order to care for fragile patients with increasingly complexity, even though, with some exceptions, it is in parallel with the healthcare system. Within this reality, pharmaceutical care is developing very differently in all the autonomic regions, and has become a reason for controversy. In this sense, diverse factors related with the patient care setting, but also linked to different pharmaceutical levels, make it difficult to implement a patient care model. Faced with this scenario, it seems reasonable to analyze the situation from the perspective of the healthcare requirements of the institutionalized persons in these facilities, and in terms of the patient care that we can and should provide; subsequently, and based on this, we should be able to propose the basic guidelines for developing an efficient model of pharmaceutical care integrated within this patient care setting.	La creciente preocupación por la atención a la cronicidad, consecuencia de la progresión demográfica actual, y la necesidad de disminuir los costes asociados a su cuidado, sitúa uno de sus focos en los centros de asistencia social que atienden a personas de alta dependencia. A su vez, el ámbito sociosanitario está evolucionando para atender a un paciente frágil cada vez más complejo aunque, salvo excepciones, lo hace de forma paralela al sistema de salud. Dentro de esta realidad, la prestación farmacéutica se está desarrollando de forma muy heterogénea entre las comunidades autónomas y es motivo de controversia. En este sentido, diversos factores relacionados con el ámbito asistencial, pero también con los distintos estamentos farmacéuticos, dificultan el establecimiento de un modelo asistencial. Ante esta situación, parece razonable realizar un análisis de la situación desde la perspectiva de las necesidades sanitarias de las personas institucionalizadas en estos centros y de la atención que podemos y debemos prestar para, posteriormente, ser capaces de proponer las líneas básicas sobre las que desarrollar un modelo de atención farmacéutica eficiente e integrado para este ámbito asistencial.								2	0	0	0	0	3	5			2171-8695			SCIELO:S1130-63432016000400008	27571498

There is a lack of knowledge on this symptom in the nursing home (NH) setting. The aim of this study was to investigate whether lack of energy was associated with hospitalization and mortality in NH residents.Design: Longitudinal observational cohort study.Setting and Participants: A total of 575 NH residents (72% women) in 13 French NHs from the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents (INCUR) study cohort.Measurements: Lack of energy was measured at the baseline visit as part of the 10-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were performed to test the association of lack of energy with hospitalization events and mortality over 12 months of follow-up.Results: The mean age of the study sample was 86.3 (SD = 7.5) years. At the baseline, 250 (43.5%) residents complained about lack of energy. Overall, 192 (33.4%) individuals experienced at least 1 hospitalization event and 98 (17.0%) died during the 12-month follow-up. Lack of energy was significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.02-1.80; P =.03), even after adjustment for potential confounders (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.04-1.91; P =.02). No statistically significant association was found between lack of energy and 12-month mortality.Conclusion: Lack of energy is a predictor of hospitalization in older people living in NHs. It may be considered a relevant clinical feature for identifying individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes, thus potentially serving as a screening tool for subsequently conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment in this highly vulnerable and complex population.

They are more likely than people who reside in the community to become acutely unwell, present to the Emergency Department (ED) and require admission to hospital. For many, hospitalisation carries with it risks. Importantly, evidence suggests that some admissions are avoidable. A new collaborative model of care, the Aged Care Emergency Service (ACE), was developed to provide clinical support to nurses in the RACFs, allowing residents to be managed in place and avoid transfer to the ED. This paper examines the effects of the ACE service on RACF residents' transfer to hospital using a controlled pre-post design.Methods: Four intervention RACFs were matched with eight control RACFs based on number of total beds, dementia specific beds, and ratio of high to low care beds in Newcastle, Australia, between March and November 2011. The intervention consisted of a clinical care manual to support care along with a nurse led telephone triage line, education, establishing goals of care prior to ED transfer, case management when in the ED, along with the development of collaborative relationships between stakeholders. Outcomes included ED presentations, length of stay, hospital admission and 28-day readmission pre- and post-intervention. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate mean differences in outcomes between intervention and controls RACFs, pre- and post-intervention means, and their interaction, accounting for repeated measures and adjusting for matching factors.Results: Residents had a mean age of 86 years. ED presentations ranged between 16 and 211 visits/100 RACF beds/year across all RACFs. There was no overall reduction in ED presentations (OR = 1.17, p = 0.56) with the ACE intervention. However, when compared to the controls, the intervention group reduced their ED length of stay by 45 min (p = 0.0575), and was 40 % less likely to be admitted to hospital,. The latter was highly significant (p = 0.0012).Conclusions: Transfers to ED and admission to hospital are common for residents of RACFs. This study has demonstrated that a complex multi-strategy intervention led by nursing staff can successfully reduce hospital admissions for older people living in Residential Aged Care Facilities. By defining goals of care prior to transfer to the ED, clinicians have the opportunity to better deliver care that patients require. Integrated care requires accountability from multiple stakeholders.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			1471-2318			WOS:000375806900002	27175921

In Sweden the three scales are routinely used together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention.DesignLongitudinal quantitative study.MethodsDescriptive analyses and Cox regression analyses.ResultsOnly 4% scored no risk for any of these serious events. Longitudinal risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating increased risks. This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general condition. There were no statistical significant differences between residents categorised at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of general health were most important.ConclusionsRisk tendencies for falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are high in nursing homes, and when measure them at the same time the majority will have several of these risks. Items assessing mobility or items affecting mobility were of most importance. Care processes can always be improved and this study can add to the topic.Relevance to clinical practiceA more comprehensive view is needed and prevention can not only be based on total scores. Mobility is an important factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both as a risk factor and a protective factor. This involves a challenge for care - to keep the inmates physical active and at the same time prevent falls.									10	1	0	0	2	2	12			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000372928900006	26813994	
J	Nilsson, Anita; Rasmussen, Birgit H.; Edvardsson, David								A threat to our integrity - Meanings of providing nursing care for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings								SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES				30	1			48	56		10.1111/scs.12220				MAR 2016	2016	BackgroundOlder people with cognitive impairment represent a large group of patients in acute care settings. Research show that these acute care environments can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them.AimThis study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff.MethodA purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method.FindingsCaring for older, acutely ill cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed.ConclusionThe comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' personal-professional integrity.									17	0	0	0	8	0	17			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000371477400005	25919338

JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES				50	2			299	320						SPR 2016	2016	Compared to a decade ago, long-term care residents are likely to be older, frailer, more functionally impaired, more medically complex, and closer to the end of life. Because of this, residents are also less likely to benefit from and more likely to be harmed by the same drugs and routine medical interventions that may have worked well for them earlier in life. Family physicians are well positioned to play a key role in navigating the tensions between life extension, rehabilitation, symptom management, and palliation. Unfortunately, in many jurisdictions, despite more than a decade of primary care reform, family physicians are not attracted to working in long-term residential care (LTRC). The proportion of those working in LTRC has been declining over time, and there is no mandatory training of family physicians in LTRC work. This article reviews the influence of Canadian primary care policy related to the physician role in LTRC facilities and describes a number of promising practices across Canadian provinces to engage them in LTRC teamwork.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9495	1911-0251		WOS:000404497100003

Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective. Objectives: To critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes. Methods: A review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose. Results: Five surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient. Conclusions: Historical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1463-4236	1477-1128		WOS:000369934500004	25939731

Treatment Fidelity of an Evidence-Based Nurse-Led Intervention in a Proactive Primary Care Program for Older People								WORLDVIEWS ON EVIDENCE-BASED NURSING				13	1	SI		75	84		10.1111/wvn.12151				FEB 2016	2016	BackgroundIn a large randomized trial, Utrecht PROactive Frailty Intervention Trial (U-PROFIT), we evaluated the effectiveness of an integrated program on the preservation of daily functioning in older people in primary care that consisted of a frailty identification tool and a multicomponent nurse-led care program. Examination of treatment fidelity is critical to successful translation of evidence-based interventions into practice.AimsTo assess treatment delivery, dose and content of nursing care delivered within the nurse-led care program, and to explore if the delivery may have influenced the trial results.MethodsA mixed-methods study was conducted. Type and dose of nursing care were collected during the trial. Shortly after the trial, a focus group with nurses was conducted to explore reasons for the observed differences between the type and dose of nursing care delivered.ResultsA total of 835 older persons were included in the nurse-led care program. The mean age was 75 years, 64% were female and 53.5% were living alone. The most frequent self-reported conditions were loneliness (60.8%) and cognitive problems (59.4%). One-third of the patients with a geriatric condition received an additional assessment (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination), and the majority of these patients received at least one nurse intervention (>85%). Most nursing care was delivered to patients at risk of falling and to those with urinary incontinence. Patients with nutrition problems seldom received nursing interventions. The nurses explained that differences in type and dose were influenced by the preference of the patient, the type of geriatric problem, and the time required to apply a nurse intervention.Linking Evidence to ActionAll intervention components were delivered; however, differences were observed in the type and dose of nursing care delivered across geriatric conditions. The findings better explain the treatment fidelity and suggest that there is room for improvement that may result in more beneficial patient outcomes.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1545-102X	1741-6787		WOS:000370483100010	26873373

Search terms included: "gero-oncology," "geriatric oncology," "Advanced Practice Nurse," "Nurse Practitioner," "older adult," "elderly," and "cancer."CONCLUSION: Over the last decade, APNs have made advances in caring for older adults with cancer by playing a role in prevention, screening, and diagnosis; through evidence-based gero-oncology care during cancer treatment; and in designing tailored survivorship care models. APNs must combat ageism in treatment choice for older adults, standardize comprehensive geriatric assessments, and focus on providing person-centered care, specifically during care transitions.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: APNs are well-positioned to help understand the complex relationship between risk factors, geriatric syndromes, and frailty and translate research into practice. Palliative care must expand beyond specialty providers and shift toward APNs with a focus on early advanced care planning. Finally, APNs should continue to establish multidisciplinary survivorship models across care settings, with a focus on primary care.									12	1	0	0	1	1	14			0749-2081	1878-3449		WOS:000418788400005	26830266

Semistructured interviews were conducted with family members of 22 deceased older adults to explore their experiences with end-of-life decision-making with/for their loved ones. Participants did not identify a specific time they made an end-of-life care decision as they did not know the older adult was at the end of life, health care providers did not ask them to make a decision, or they had to make forced decisions, and subsequently they experienced regret about the end-of-life care their family member received. End-of-life care decisions were dependent on the awareness of approaching death by participants, their loved ones, and health care providers. Health care providers being aware of the possibility of approaching death and assisting family members to make decisions that would honor the older adult's preference by explaining possible care options and what each care options would mean to them are key to providing quality end-of-life care for these individuals.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1522-2179	1539-0705		WOS:000368592400004

Results from a competence measurement of nursing staff								BMC NURSING				15						5	10.1186/s12912-016-0124-z				JAN 14 2016	2016	Background: Multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment leave many old patients in a frail condition with a high risk of adverse outcomes if proper health care is not provided. Knowledge about available competence is necessary to evaluate whether we are able to offer equitable and balanced health care to older persons with acute and/ or complex health care needs. This study investigates the sufficiency of nursing staff competence in Norwegian community elderly care.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1016 nursing staff in nursing homes and home care services with the instrument "Nursing Older People - Competence Evaluation Tool". Statistical analyses were ANOVA and multiple regression.Results: We found that nursing staff have competence in all areas measured, but that the level of competence was insufficient in the areas nursing measures, advanced procedures, and nursing documentation. Nursing staff in nursing homes scored higher than staff in home care services, and older nursing staff scored lower than younger nursing staff.Conclusions: A reason for the relatively low influence of education and training on competence could be the diffuse roles that nursing staff have in community elderly care, implying that they have poor standards against which to judge their own competence. Clearer role descriptions for all groups of nursing staff are recommended as well as general competence development in geriatric nursing care.									47	0	0	0	1	0	47			1472-6955			WOS:000377514400002	26778919

Our emphasis was on validating an index of allostasis.Method: In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes.Results: Our results supported both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social support, optimism, and hope.Conclusion: Although these results are based on a small sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and physical resources and well-being.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1360-7863	1364-6915		WOS:000363771300012	26237175

The aim of this study was to examine loneliness, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and health complaints in relation to health care consumption of in- and outpatient care among frail older people living at home. The study, with a cross-sectional design, comprised a sample of 153 respondents aged from 65years (mean age 81.5years) or older, who lived at home and were frail. Data was collected utilising structured interviews in the respondent's home assessing demographic data, loneliness, HRQoL and health complaints. Patient administrative registers were used to collect data on health care consumption. Loneliness was the dependent variable in the majority of the analyses and dichotomised. For group comparisons Students t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used. The results showed that 60% of the respondents had experienced loneliness during the previous year, at least occasionally. The study identified that lonely respondents had a lower HRQoL (p=0.022), with a higher total number of reported health complaints (p=0.001), and used more outpatient services including more acute visits at the emergency department, compared to not lonely respondents (p=0.026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a depressed mood was independently associated to total use of outpatient care (B=7.4, p<0.001). Therefore, it might not be loneliness, per se, that is the reason for seeking health care. However, reasons for using health care services are difficult to determine due to the complex situation for the frail older person. To avoid emergency department visits and to benefit the well-being of the frail older person, interventions targeting the complex health situation, including loneliness, are suggested.									33	2	0	0	3	2	37			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000359867700005	24826811

Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with the acceptability, compliance and delivery.Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings.Methods: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI).Results: Twenty-one females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients.Conclusions: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.									4	1	0	0	1	0	4			1474-5151	1873-1953		WOS:000357949600009	24821716

A popular method of managing this pressure is identification of patients in primary care 'at-risk' of hospitalisation, and delivering case management to improve outcomes and avoid admissions. However, the effectiveness of this model has not been subjected to rigorous quantitative synthesis.Methods and FindingsWe carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of case management for 'at-risk' patients in primary care. Six bibliographic databases were searched using terms for 'case management', 'primary care', and a methodology filter (Cochrane EPOC group). Effectiveness compared to usual care was measured across a number of relevant outcomes: Health - self-assessed health status, mortality; Cost - total cost of care, healthcare utilisation (primary and non-specialist care and secondary care separately), and; Satisfaction - patient satisfaction. We conducted secondary subgroup analyses to assess whether effectiveness was moderated by the particular model of case management, context, and study design. A total of 15,327 titles and abstracts were screened, 36 unique studies were included. Meta-analyses showed no significant differences in total cost, mortality, utilisation of primary or secondary care. A very small significant effect favouring case management was found for self-reported health status in the short-term (0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.14). A small significant effect favouring case management was found for patient satisfaction in the short- (0.26, 0.16 to 0.36) and long-term (0.35, 0.04 to 0.66). Secondary subgroup analyses suggested the effectiveness of case management may be increased when delivered by a multidisciplinary team, when a social worker was involved, and when delivered in a setting rated as low in initial 'strength' of primary care.ConclusionsThis was the first meta-analytic review which examined the effects of case management on a wide range of outcomes and considered also the effects of key moderators. Current results do not support case management as an effective model, especially concerning reduction of secondary care use or total costs. We consider reasons for lack of effect and highlight key research questions for the future.									73	3	0	0	9	1	76			1932-6203			WOS:000358198700038	26186598	
J	Frank, Christopher; Wilson, C. Ruth								Models of primary care for frail patients								CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN				61	7			601	606						JUL 2015	2015	Objective To discuss models of care for frail seniors provided in primary care settings and those developed by Canadian FPs.Sources of information Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane database were searched from 2010 to January 2014 using the terms models of care, family medicine, elderly, and geriatrics.Main message New models of funding for primary care have opened opportunities for ways of caring for complex frail older patients. Severity of frailty is an important factor, and more severe frailty should prompt consideration of using an alternate model of care for a senior. In Canada, models in use include integrated care systems, shared care models, home-based care models, and family medicine specialty clinics. No one model should take precedence but FPs should be involved in developing and implementing strategies that meet the needs of individual patients and communities. Organizational and remunerative supports will need to be put in place to achieve widespread uptake of such models.Conclusion Given the increased numbers of frail seniors and the decrease in access to hospital beds, prioritized care models should include ones focused on optimizing health, decreasing frailty, and helping to avoid hospitalization of frail and well seniors alike. The Health Care of the Elderly Program Committee at the College of Family Physicians of Canada is hosting a repository for models of care used by FPs and is asking physicians to submit their ideas for how to best care for frail seniors.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0008-350X	1715-5258		WOS:000360988200019	26380850

Death events were monitored and detected over a 12-month follow-up. The risk of death was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.Results: Mean age of participants was 86.2 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.35 (SD 0.11). At the end of the follow-up, 135 (17.4%) death events were recorded. A positive association between the FI and mortality (per 0.01 FI increment: age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio 1.018, 95% confidence interval 1.002-1.035, P = .03) was reported. The use of the traditional 0.25 cut-point for detecting the frailty status is inadequate in this population.Conclusion: The FI is able to predict mortality even in very old and complex elders, such as nursing home residents.

The intervention included geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes.BackgroundImprovements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life satisfaction are not well explored.DesignRandomised controlled study.MethodsThe validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12months after the baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as well as six- to 12-month follow-ups.ResultsOlder persons who received the intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who received usual care, between 6 and 12month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation.ConclusionsA comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation.Relevance to clinical practiceFrail older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.									13	1	0	0	2	1	15			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000351633800019	25293644

We surveyed 1,381 care aides in a representative sample of 30 urban nursing homes in the three Canadian Prairie provinces and report demographic, health and well-being, and work-related characteristics. Over 50 per cent of respondents were not born in Canada and did not speak English as their first language. They reported moderately high levels of burnout and a strong sense of their work's worth. Few respondents reported attending educational sessions. This direct caregiver workforce is poorly understood, has limited training or standards for minimum education, and training varies widely across provinces. Workplace characteristics affecting care aides reflect factors that precipitate burnout in allied health professions, with implications for quality of care, staff health, and staff retention.									58	0	0	0	1	1	58			0714-9808	1710-1107		WOS:000349102000005	25525838

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL GERONTOLOGY & GERIATRICS				6	1			34	37		10.1016/j.jcgg.2014.09.003				MAR 2015	2015	Background: High stress levels have been reported among nurses from various backgrounds. It is challenging to nurse frail older people in hospitals, and a lack of appropriate knowledge of geriatric giants can result in work-related stress. Sources of stress and coping mechanisms have been studied, but the impact of intervention with regular teaching sessions at the ward level is unclear.Aims: This work aims to find out the prevalence of work-related stress level in care of the elderly wards and also to find out whether improvement in the knowledge of common problems (geriatric giants) in older people would help alleviate the stress level in our study group.Methods: All nurses in the two care of the elderly wards were enrolled for the study. Teaching on understanding and management of delirium, dementia, malnutrition, incontinence, pressure sores, postural instability, and falls was delivered twice per week for 6 consecutive weeks. The teaching cycle of 6 weeks was repeated two more times to cover night shifts and leaves. This was done to ensure that each staff member has attended at least one teaching session on each of the six topics over 18 weeks.Results: Stress levels among staff members were measured using a validated scale, the Expanded Nursing Stress Scale, at the beginning and end of these 18 weeks.Conclusion: Although the mean overall stress scores were lower after the teaching, this was not statistically significant. However, subanalyses showed significant reduction in stress from their routine workload in managing complex and frail older people.

Hospital-based care is emphasized because interprofessionalism is difficult in that setting since the setting is constantly changing and since multiple healthcare professionals care for many complex, very ill patients, only some of whom are frail older people. Interprofessionalism is particularly important and challenging in teaching units in the acute care setting, where many health professionals practice and learn together and team membership changes frequently. Learning is enhanced and interprofessionalism can enhance learning by viewing the patient as a key part of the teaching team. While 'best practice' interventions have been identified for frail older adults who are hospitalized, these interventions are not easily implemented in routine hospital care. Three interdependent processes in clinical practice - representation, sense-making, and improvisation - are described, which contribute to an understanding of how practices change when implemented in a way that takes the local context into account and keeps person-centered care as the central consideration.

It is associated with dependence, disability, increased health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1541-6577	1945-7286		WOS:000356019400007	25799697	
J	Shin, So Young								Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis: An Integration of Theory of Symptom Management and Disablement Process Model								ASIAN NURSING RESEARCH				8	4			241	246		10.1016/j.anr.2014.08.004				DEC 2014	2014	To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

This paper describes in detail the process used to design and develop this multi-component intervention.Methods: In a team of researchers, experts, cardiac surgeons, registered cardiac surgery nurses, and patients, the revised guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions of the Medical Research Council (MRC) were followed, including identifying existing evidence, identifying and developing theory and modelling the process and outcomes. Additionally, the criteria for reporting the development of complex interventions in healthcare (CReDECI) were followed.Results: The intervention is administered during a consultation by the nurse two to four weeks before the surgery procedure. The consultation includes three parts: a general part for all patients, a second part in which patients with an increased risk are identified, and a third part in which selected patients are informed about how to prepare themselves for the hospital admission to reduce their risk.Conclusions: Following the MRC guidelines, an extended, stepwise, multi-method procedure was used to develop the multi-component nursing intervention to prepare older patients for cardiac surgery, creating transparency in the assumed working mechanisms. Additionally, a detailed description of the intervention is provided.									6	1	0	0	0	1	6			1474-5151	1873-1953		WOS:000345335600003	24186065

In the Netherlands, a primary-care based preventive home visitation programme has been developed for potentially frail community-dwelling older people (aged >= 75 years), consisting of a comprehensive geriatric assessment during a home visit by a practice nurse followed by targeted interdisciplinary care and follow-up over time. A theory-based process evaluation was designed to examine (1) the extent to which the home visitation programme was implemented as planned and (2) the extent to which general practices successfully redesigned their care delivery.Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, the focus was on fidelity (quality of implementation), dose delivered (completeness), dose received (exposure and satisfaction), reach (participation rate), recruitment, and context. Twenty-four general practices participated, of which 13 implemented the home visitation programme and 11 delivered usual care to older people. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews with practice nurses (PNs), general practitioners (GPs), and older people; feedback meetings with PNs; structured registration forms filled-out by PNs; and narrative descriptions of the recruitment procedures and registration of inclusion and drop-outs by members of the research team.Results: Fidelity of implementation was acceptable, but time constraints and inadequate reach (i.e., the relatively healthy older people participated) negatively influenced complete delivery of protocol elements, such as interdisciplinary cooperation and follow-up of older people over time. The home visitation programme was judged positively by PNs, GPs, and older people. Useful tools were offered to general practices for organising proactive geriatric care.Conclusions: The home visitation programme did not have major shortcomings in itself, but the delivery offered room for improvement. General practices received useful tools to redesign their care delivery from reactive towards proactive care, but perceived barriers require attention to allow for sustainability of the home visitation programme over time.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1471-2296			WOS:000345245400001	25344322

Results of a Randomized Comparison Trial								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY				62	10			1962	1967		10.1111/jgs.13022				OCT 2014	2014	Residents of long-term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program (RACIP) is a quality improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on-site support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology nurse specialists (GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of hospitalization 1year before and after program implementation. The sample included 29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention group (rate ratio (RR)=0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.61-0.86, P<.001). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group (69% increase) (RR=0.67, 95% CI=0.56-0.82, P<.001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention and comparison groups (RR= 1.0, 95% CI=0.68-1.46, P=.99). The integration of GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.									24	0	0	0	3	1	25			0002-8614	1532-5415		WOS:000344386400022	25283552

Although this is a welcome prognosis, new issues are emerging that may complicate the ability to successfully age in this clinical population. HIV and aging independently are related to cognitive impairments, so there are concerns that those aging with HIV may be more at risk of such cognitive impairments. Moreover, highly active antiretroviral therapy itself can create metabolic disorders, such as prediabetes and/or frank type 2 diabetes, which have also been linked to poorer cognitive functioning. Thus, concerns increase that, as people age with HIV and develop comorbid metabolic disorders that may lead to type 2 diabetes, they will be at triple risk of developing cognitive impairments that can impair everyday functioning and reduce quality of life. This article explores these issues and provides implications for practice and research.									18	0	0	0	9	0	18			0888-0395	1945-2810		WOS:000341965200010	25099061

We report on the development and implementation of four such pathways within two National Health Service primary care trusts in England: (a) frail elderly care, (b) stroke care, (c) diabetic retinopathy screening and (d) intermediate care. The pathways were selected because each represents a different type of information and data couplings', in terms of task interdependency with some pathways/systems reflecting more complex coordinating patterns than others. Our aim here is identify and explain how health professionals and information specialists in two organisational National Health Service primary care trusts organisationally construct and use such systems and, in particular, the implications this has for issues of professional and managerial control and autonomy.

This type of long-term health care intervention involves contextual factors and human interactions. These underlying complex mechanisms can be usefully informed with field experts' knowledge, which are hard to make explicit. However, computer simulation has been suggested as one possible method of overcoming the difficulty of articulating such elicited qualitative views.Methods A simulation model of case management was designed using an agent-based methodology, based on the initial qualitative research material. Variables and rules of interaction were formulated into a simple conceptual framework. This model has been implemented and was used as a support for a structured discussion with experts in case management.Results The rigorous formulation provided by the agent-based methodology clarified the descriptions of the interventions and the problems encountered regarding:1 the diverse network topologies of health care actors in the project;2 the adaptation time required by the intervention;3 the communication between the health care actors;4 the institutional context;5 the organization of the care; and6 the role of the case manager and his or hers personal ability to interpret the informal demands of the frail older person.Conclusion The simulation model should be seen primarily as a tool for thinking and learning. A number of insights were gained as part of a valuable cognitive process.

Adult children and spouses are often the first to assume care giving responsibilities for older adults when declining function results in increased care needs. By introducing policies tailored to enabling family members to combine gainful employment with providing care for older relatives, the sustainability of the future care for older individuals in Norway is more explicitly placed on the family and informal caregivers than previously. Care recipients and informal caregivers are expected to take an active consumer role and participate in the care decision-making process. This paper aims to describe the informal caregivers' experiences of influencing decision-making at and after hospital discharge for home-bound older relatives.Methods: This paper reports findings from a follow-up study with an exploratory qualitative design. Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 19 informal caregivers of older individuals discharged from hospital in Norway. An inductive thematic content analysis was undertaken.Results: Informal caregivers take on comprehensive all-consuming roles as intermediaries between the care recipient and the health care services. In essence, the informal caregivers take the role of the active participant on behalf of their older relative. They describe extensive efforts struggling to establish dialogues with the "gatekeepers" of the health care services. Achieving the goal of the best possible care for the care recipient seem to depend on the informal caregivers having the resources to choose appropriate strategies for gaining influence over decisions.Conclusions: The care recipients' extensive frailty and increasing dependence on their families coupled with the complexity of health care services contribute to the perception of the informal caregivers' indispensable role as intermediaries. These findings accentuate the need to further discuss how frail older individuals and their informal caregivers can be supported and enabled to participate in decision-making regarding care arrangements that meet the care recipient's needs.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35				1472-6963		WOS:000339675800001	25078610

The interRAI CHESS scale has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in the overall population of persons receiving health care in community and institutional settings. This study examines the performance of CHESS as a predictor of mortality among persons with 11 different neurological conditions.Methods: Survival analyses were done with interRAI assessments linked to mortality data among persons in home care (n = 359,940), complex continuing care hospitals/units (n = 88,721), and nursing homes (n = 185,309) in seven Canadian provinces/territories.Results: CHESS was a significant predictor of mortality in all 3 care settings for the 11 neurological diagnostic groups considered after adjusting for age and sex. The distribution of CHESS scores varied between diagnostic groups and within diagnostic groups in different care settings.Conclusions: CHESS is a valid predictor of mortality in neurological populations in community and institutional care. It may prove useful for several clinical, administrative, policy-development, evaluation and research purposes. Because it is routinely gathered as part of normal clinical practice in jurisdictions (like Canada) that have implemented interRAI assessment instruments, CHESS can be derived without additional need for data collection.									42	1	0	0	6	0	43			1932-6203			WOS:000340947700056	24914546

The HELP is a complex intervention that has been shown to reduce rates of delirium and functional decline. However, modification of the program may be required to meet local circumstances and specialized populations. We selected three key elements based on our prior work and the concept of shared risk factors and modified the HELP to include only three shared risk factors (functional, nutritional, and cognitive status) that were targeted by three nursing protocols: early mobilization, oral and nutritional assistance, and orienting communication. These protocols were adapted, refined, and pilot-tested for feasibility and efficacy. We hope by reporting the rationale and protocols for the modified HELP, we will advance the field for others adapting evidence-based, complex nursing interventions.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0098-9134	1938-243X		WOS:000335951600003	24443887

(PiTStop) - a complex intervention to prevent delirium in care homes for older people: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial								TRIALS				15						47	10.1186/1745-6215-15-47				FEB 5 2014	2014	Background: Delirium (or acute confusion) is a serious illness common in older people, in which a person's thinking and perceptions may be affected. Reducing delirium is important because of the considerable distress it causes, and the poor outcomes associated with it, such as increased admissions to hospital, falls, mortality and costs to the National Health Service (NHS). Preventing delirium is possible using multicomponent interventions; successful interventions in hospitals have reduced it by one-third. However, there is little research to guide practice in care homes, where it is common because of the clustering of known risk factors (older age, frailty, and dementia). In previous work we developed a multicomponent intervention to prevent delirium in care homes, called Stop Delirium! The intervention was based upon evidence from the research literature relating to the prevention of delirium and on strategies to change professional practice. Before starting a large costly trial of Stop Delirium!, this pilot study will test and help improve the design and feasibility of the trial protocol.Methods/Design: We plan to conduct a cluster randomised pilot trial in 14 care homes (independent residential and nursing). Following recruitment of residents (over 60 years, consenting or with consultee agreement, able to communicate in English, and not in palliative care) participating homes will be randomised, stratified by size of home and proportion of residents with dementia. Stop Delirium! will be delivered to intervention homes over 16 months, with controls receiving usual care. The primary outcome measure will be the presence of delirium on any day during a one-month post-intervention period.We will collect data to determine 1) recruitment and attrition rates, 2) feasibility of various outcomes measurements, and 3) feasibility of capturing health resource use (resident diaries and by examining health records). We will estimate the between-cluster variation for the primary outcome, delirium occurrence.Discussion: This pilot study will refine methods for the definitive trial. The lessons learnt will also contribute to implementing National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) delirium guidelines, which recommend multicomponent interventions for delirium prevention.Trial registration: ISRCTN27972532.									6	1	0	0	2	0	7				1745-6215		WOS:000333468700001	24495514

The use of an assessment of vulnerability will be essential in the development of care pathways that are based on patient and population need rather than demand.MethodsAs an example of the health needs of a vulnerable population data are presented on an oral health needs assessment within nursing and residential homes in the North West of England.FindingsThese data serve to demonstrate the challenges of the disease burden within such a population but also the complexities of commissioning and delivering services to this group of patients.ConclusionsCare pathways designed to assist such patients should consider not only prevention and treatment modalities but also the means of implementing such therapies in varying settings and utilising the whole dental team.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0734-0664	1741-2358		WOS:000331109200001	24446973

It is an interpretive-descriptive study based on qualitative data from three focus groups (N = 23), representing a diverse population in central Pennsylvania. Study sites included a suburban senior center serving a primarily White, middle-class population; an urban senior center serving a frail, underserved, African American population; and a breast cancer support group. The most important factors affecting whether participants wished to receive life-sustaining medical treatment were prognosis, expected quality of life, burden to others, burden to oneself in terms of the medical condition and treatment, and effect on mental functioning and independence. Our findings contribute to the knowledge of the complex factors that influence how people make decisions about advance care planning and life-sustaining treatments. This understanding is critical if nurses are to translate the patient's goals, values, and preferences into an actionable medical plan.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0279-3695	1938-2413		WOS:000331868800012	24200911

They present with greater urgency and are more likely to be admitted to hospital or re-attend and utilize greater resources. They experience longer waits for care and are less likely to be satisfied with their experiences. Not only that, but older people suffer poorer health outcomes after ED attendance, with higher mortality rates and greater dependence in activities of daily living or rates of admission to nursing homes. Older people's assessment and management in the ED can be complex, time consuming, and require specialist skills. The interplay of multiple comorbidities and functional decline result in the complex state of frailty that can predispose to poor health outcomes and greater care needs. Older people with frailty may present to services in an atypical fashion requiring detailed, multidimensional, and increasingly multidisciplinary care to provide the correct diagnosis and management as well as appropriate placement for ongoing care or admission avoidance. Specific challenges such as delirium, functional decline, or carer strain need to be screened for and managed appropriately. Identifying patients with specific frailty syndromes can be critical to identifying those at highest risk of poor outcomes and most likely to benefit from further specialist interventions. Models of care are evolving that aim to deliver multidimensional assessment and management by multidisciplinary specialist care teams (comprehensive geriatric assessment). Increasingly, these models are demonstrating improved outcomes, including admission avoidance or reduced death and dependence. Delivering this in the ED is an evolving area of practice that adapts the principles of geriatric medicine for the urgent-care environment.									57	0	0	0	9	1	58			1178-1998			WOS:000345283900001	25473275

Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.									51	2	0	0	17	1	53			1099-8004	1552-4175		WOS:000324395900007	23086382

A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients.DesignAn explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial.MethodsThe barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and expectations regarding the U-CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires sent to all participating general practitioners (n = 32) and practice nurses (n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted.ResultsPractice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to provide structured care.ConclusionThis explanatory mixed-methods study showed that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U-CARE programme as feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care towards a proactive and preventive care approach.									22	0	0	0	3	0	22			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000324336500012	23461433

The intervention included early geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older people's own homes.Background Prior studies indicate that tailored/individualised care planning conducted by a case manager/coordinator often led to greater satisfaction with care planning among older people. However, there is no obvious evidence of any effects of continuum of care interventions on older people's views of quality of care.Design Randomised controlled study.Methods Items based on a validated questionnaire were used in face-to-face interviews to assess older people's views of quality of care at three, six and 12months after baseline.Results Older people receiving a comprehensive continuum of care intervention perceived higher quality of care on items about care planning (p0<bold>005</bold>), compared with those receiving the usual care. In addition, they had increased knowledge of whom to contact about care/service, after three and 12months (p<0<bold>03</bold>).Conclusions The study gives evidence of the advantages of a combination of components such as organising care-planning meetings in older people's own homes, case management and interprofessional teamwork.Relevance to clinical practice The results have implications for policymakers, managers and professionals in the area of health and social care for older people to meet individual needs of frail older people.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000323901600029	23808647

Advances in telehealth technologies have resulted in home-based devices for medication management and health monitoring of older adults. We examined older adults' perceptions of a telehealth medication dispensing device as part of a clinical trial involving home healthcare clients, nurse coordination and use of the medication dispensing device.Methods: Ninety-six frail older adult participants who used the medication dispensing device for 12 months completed a satisfaction survey related to perceived usefulness and reliability. Results were analyzed and grouped by themes in the following areas: Ease of Use, Reliability, Medication Management Assistance, Routine Task Performance and Acceptability.Results: Nearly all participants perceived the medication dispensing device as very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in the management of their medications. Eighty-four percent of participants expressed a desire to use the machine in the future.Conclusion: The technology-enhanced medication management device in this study is an acceptable tool for older adults to manage medication in collaboration with home care nurses. Improved usability and cost models for medication dispensers are areas for future research.									35	0	0	0	6	0	35			1753-8157	1753-8165		WOS:000321371400004	23323721

In the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated.Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers.Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design.Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands.Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (>= 70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded.Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions.Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes.Conclusions: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the protocol need special attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Development of a Proactive Care Program (U-CARE) to Preserve Physical Functioning of Frail Older People in Primary Care								JOURNAL OF NURSING SCHOLARSHIP				45	3			230	237		10.1111/jnu.12023				SEP 2013	2013	Purpose: Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication.Methods: The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention.Findings: Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses.Conclusions: Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice.Clinical Relevances: The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1527-6546	1547-5069		WOS:000323823800002	23530956

This study sought to prospectively profile acutely unwell NH residents in order to clarify some of the challenges of providing emergency care to this group. Over an 18-week period, we prospectively reviewed all NH residents presenting to the ED of an urban university teaching hospital. Relevant data were retrieved by direct physician review (as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in the ED), collateral history from NH staff and primary carers, and review of electronic records. There were 155 ED visits by 116 NH residents. Their mean age was 80.3 (+/- 9.6) years. High pre-morbid levels of dependency were reflected by a mean Barthel Index of 34.1 (+/- 20) and almost two-thirds had a pre-existing diagnosis of dementia. One-third of visits were during 'normal' working hours. Patients were reviewed by their regular NH doctor pre-transfer for 36% of visits. Using accepted international criteria, over half of the visits were deemed 'potentially preventable'. Unwell NH residents have complex medical needs. The decision to refer these patients to the ED is often made by 'out of hours' general practitioners and their initial care in the ED is directed by physicians with limited experience in geriatric medicine.

An observational cohort study on geriatric patient profile in an emergency department in the Netherlands								NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF MEDICINE				71	6			324	330						JUL-AUG 2013	2013	Background: Currently, Dutch emergency care systems focus on rapid emergency department (ED) patient management with short completion times, which may not meet specific geriatric care needs.Methods: Six-week observational study in patients aged >= 70 years, attending the ED of VU University Medical Center (VUmc, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) during weekday peak presentation times (10 AM - 10 PM).Results: During six weeks, a total of 183 patients aged >= 70 years attended the ED, of which 117 (63.9%) presented during weekday peak hours. One hundred patients with a median age of 81 (min-max; 70-97 years) were prospectively observed. The majority presented with fall-related complaints (30%), multiple comorbidities (>= 3 in 50.0%) and polymedication (>= 5 in 53.7%). Mean ED length of stay was 175.8 (range 20-399) minutes (n=98). Of the patients discharged to their usual residence prior to the ED visit (n=58), 36.2% returned to our ED within 30 days; one in five of these patients had initially presented with a fall.Conclusion: In this study, fall-related injuries were the most frequent presenting complaint during weekday peak presentation times in 70-plus patients. Of these, one in five discharged from the ED returned within 30 days. Our emergency care system may not adequately cover comprehensive ED geriatric assessment, or provide sufficient outpatient care after ED home discharge. We believe that EPs should be more aware of the complex problems encountered in acute geriatric patients and address follow-up care pathways such as geriatric outpatient services, more often in frail elderly patients discharged home.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			0300-2977			WOS:000323370700012	23956318

The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.Results:After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons.Discussion:Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.									47	0	0	0	5	0	47			0029-6562	1538-9847		WOS:000321847400008	23817284

Background Few studies have examined the interrelationships among caregivers' working conditions, care-giving dynamics and caregiver well-being. Design Cross-sectional, correlational study. Methods Data were collected by self-completed questionnaires from 176 primary family caregivers of patients with dementia in Taiwan from May 2005January 2006. Caregiver role strain and mental health were analysed by multiple regressions using a hierarchical method to enter independent variables and two- and three-way interaction terms after controlling for caregiver age and gender, employment status, and work flexibility and the simple effect of each independent variable. Results More preparedness was associated with less role strain for family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict. More care-giving demand was associated with poorer mental health only for caregivers with low work/care-giving conflict and with average and low preparedness, but not high preparedness. For family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict, more preparedness decreased role strain and maintained mental health even when care-giving demand was high. Conclusion These results provide a knowledge base for understanding complex family caregiver phenomena and serve as a guide for developing interventions. Future studies with longitudinal follow-ups are suggested to explore actual causal relationships.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000316810400006	22776026

Whilst there is a growing understanding of what supports IPW, there is a lack of evidence linking IPW to explicit outcomes for older people living in the community. This review aimed to identify the models of IPW that provide the strongest evidence base for practice with community dwelling older people. We searched electronic databases from 1 January 199031 March 2008. In December 2010 we updated the findings from relevant systematic reviews identified since 2008. We selected papers describing interventions that involved IPW for community dwelling older people and randomised controlled trials (RCT) reporting user-relevant outcomes. Included studies were classified by IPW models (Case Management, Collaboration and Integrated Team) and assessed for risk of bias. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence according to the type of care (interventions delivering acute, chronic, palliative and preventive care) identified within each model of IPW. We retrieved 3211 records and included 37 RCTs which were mapped onto the IPW models: Overall, there is weak evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for IPW, although well-integrated and shared care models improved processes of care and have the potential to reduce hospital or nursing/care home use. Study quality varied considerably and high quality evaluations as well as observational studies are needed to identify the key components of effective IPW in relation to user-defined outcomes. Differences in local contexts raise questions about the applicability of the findings and their implications for practice. We need more information on the outcomes of the process of IPW and evaluations of the effectiveness of different configurations of health and social care professionals for the care of community dwelling older people.									43	0	0	0	0	2	44			0966-0410	1365-2524		WOS:000314048500001	22891915

Each study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of different multi-component nurse-led health promotion and disease prevention (HPDP) interventions. Methods The nurse-led HPDP interventions were 6- or 12-month multi-component and evidence-based strategies targeting known risk factors for functional decline and frailty. Across the three studies, a common approach was used to measure the change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (SF-36) and the costs of use of health services (Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory) from baseline to the end of the intervention. Results The main lesson learned from the three studies is that nurse-led HPDP interventions for frail older home care clients provide greater improvements in HRQOL compared with usual home care. Such approaches are highly acceptable to this population and can be implemented using existing home care resources. Nurse-led HPDP interventions should include multiple home visits, multidimensional screening and assessment, multi-component evidence-based HPDP strategies, intensive case management, inter-professional collaboration, providers with geriatric training and experience, referral to and coordination of community services, and theory use. Conclusion The results of the three trials underscore the need to reinvest in nurse-led HPDP interventions in home care to optimize HRQOL and promote ageing in place in the target population of frail older adults. More studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of additional nurse-led HPDP interventions in other contexts and settings.									43	0	0	0	3	1	44			1356-1294	1365-2753		WOS:000314114400018	22029487

Despite calls for process evaluation as an essential component of clinical trials in the geriatric care field, studies assessing fidelity lag behind the number of effect studies. The threefold purpose of this study was (1) to systematically assess intervention fidelity of the hospital phase of the PReCaP in the first year of the intervention delivery; (2) to improve our understanding of the moderating factors and modifications affecting intervention fidelity; and (3) to explore the feasibility of the PReCaP fidelity assessment in view of the modifications.Methods: Based on the PReCaP description we developed a fidelity instrument incorporating nineteen (n=19) intervention components. A combination of data collection methods was utilized, i.e. data collection from patient records and individual Goal Attainment Scaling care plans, in-depth interviews with stakeholders, and non-participant observations. Descriptive analysis was performed to obtain levels of fidelity of each of the nineteen PReCaP components. Moderating factors were identified by using the Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity.Results: Ten of the nineteen intervention components were always or often delivered to the group of twenty elderly patients. Moderating factors, such as facilitating strategies and context were useful in explaining the non-or low-adherence of particular intervention components.Conclusions: Fidelity assessment was carried out to evaluate the adherence to the PReCaP in the Vlietland Ziekenhuis in the Netherlands. Given that the fidelity was assessed in the first year of PReCaP implementation it was commendable that ten of the nineteen intervention components were performed always or often. The adequate delivery of the intervention components strongly depended on various moderating factors. Since the intervention is still developing and undergoing continuous modifications, it has been concluded that the fidelity criteria should evolve with the modified intervention. Furthermore, repeated intervention fidelity assessments will be necessary to ensure a valid and reliable fidelity assessment of the PReCaP.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1472-6963			WOS:000314638400001	23351355

Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated "sub-acute" frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants (n = 62) required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home.									6	3	0	0	1	0	9			0714-9808	1710-1107		WOS:000320696900008	23721760

How caregivers perceive their need for services, and the factors that influence their decisions to use or not use services, remain poorly understood. This article reviews the literature on family caregiving and the complex interrelated factors that influence caregivers' choices regarding support services. It organizes these factors into four areas: (a) service characteristics, (b) personal predisposing factors that affect perceived need, (c) experiential coping and decision-making patterns, and (d) relational factors. It also examines the implications of this evidence for nursing assessments and interventions with frail older adults and their family caregivers.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			0098-9134	1938-243X		WOS:000314450600005	23413449

During transitions, residents frequently experience care that is delayed, unnecessary, not evidence-based, potentially unsafe, and fragmented. Furthermore, a high proportion of residents and their family caregivers report substantial unmet needs during transitions. This study is part of a program of research whose overall aim is to improve quality of care for frail older adults who reside in NHs. The purpose of this study is to identify successful transitions from multiple perspectives and to identify organizational and individual factors related to transition success, in order to inform improvements in care for frail elderly NH residents during transitions to and from acute care. Specific objectives are to:1. define successful and unsuccessful elements of transitions from multiple perspectives;2. develop and test a practical tool to assess transition success;3. assess transition processes in a discrete set of transfers in two study sites over a one year period;4. assess the influence of organizational factors in key practice locations, e.g., NHs, emergency medical services (EMS), and EDs, on transition success;and 5. identify opportunities for evidence-informed management and quality improvement decisions related to the management of NH - ED transitions.Methods/Design: This is a mixed-methods observational study incorporating an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) approach. It uses data from multiple levels (facility, care unit, individual) and sources (healthcare providers, residents, health records, and administrative databases).Discussion: Key to study success is operationalizing the IKT approach by using a partnership model in which the OPTIC governance structure provides for team decision-makers and researchers to participate equally in developing study goals, design, data collection, analysis and implications of findings. As preliminary and ongoing study findings are developed, their implications for practice and policy in study settings will be discussed by the research team and shared with study site administrators and staff. The study is designed to investigate the complexities of transitions and to enhance the potential for successful and sustained improvement of these transitions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1471-2318			WOS:000315579200001	23241360

They have more complex medical backgrounds and more significant care requirements. With an ever-ageing European population, the number of people requiring nursing home care will only increase. It is important then that we optimise the medical care of older people living in nursing homes.Methods: Formalized care standards are essential to optimal care but we feel that such guidelines are lacking. We decided to investigate this by means of a survey on nursing home care standards sent to the geriatric medicine societies around Europe.Results: Only five of 25 (20%) health services have a requirement for specific training in geriatric medicine for doctors in nursing homes, while only three of 25 (12%) countries have written medical care standards applicable to nursing home care provided by professional organizations. Four of 25 (16%) had a nursing home doctor society and one of these, The Netherlands, provided written medical care standards for nursing homes which were also adopted by the relevant general practitioner society.Discussion: The Europe-wide deficiency of documented care standards for nursing homes is alarming. It should be a prerequisite that physicians dealing with these complex patients have undertaken some level of specific training in geriatric medicine. It is important that geriatricians, old age psychiatrists and family doctors across European countries engage more formally on the development of appropriate models for both developing care standards and specifying appropriate training and support for doctors working in nursing homes.

This will lead to an increased need for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance personnel to understand and meet these patients' care needs. Using a caring science approach, we apply the patient's perspective, and the aim of this study is to identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the assessment category "general affected health condition". Thus, we have analyzed the characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state of "general affected health condition", as either illness or ill-health. This offers a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the concept of frailty ought to be included in "The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (ICD-10). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Within this three-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial, 390 community-dwelling patients aged 65 years or older with physician-diagnosed mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers were enrolled via 129 general practitioners in Middle Franconia, Germany. The intervention included general practitioners' training in dementia care and their recommendation of support groups and actively approaching caregiver counseling. Primary study end point was time to institutionalization over 2 years. In addition, long-term intervention effects were assessed over a time horizon of 4 years. Secondary end points included cognitive functioning, (instrumental) activities of daily living, burden of care-giving, and health-related quality of life after 2 years. Frailty models with strict intention-to-treat approach and mixed linear models were applied to account for cluster randomization. Health care costs were assessed from the societal perspective. Results: After 2 (4) years, 12% (24%) of the patients were institutionalized and another 21% (35%) died before institutionalization. No significant differences between study groups were observed with respect to time to institutionalization after 2 and 4 years (P 0.25 and 0.71, respectively). Secondary end points deteriorated, but differences were not significant between study groups. Almost 80% of the health care costs were due to informal care. Total annual costs amounted to more than (sic)47,000 per patient and did not differ between study arms. Conclusion: The intervention showed no effects on time to institutionalization and secondary outcomes.									24	0	0	0	7	0	24			1098-3015	1524-4733		WOS:000309109800011	22999135

Effective partnerships between primary and secondary care will be of benefit to these residents. We looked at 1954 admission episodes to our Trust from April 2006 to March 2009 inclusive. 3 nursing homes had the highest number of multiple admissions (>= 4). Four strategies to reduce hospital admissions were used at these nursing homes for 3 months. An alert was also sent to the geriatrician if one of the residents was admitted so that their discharge from hospital could be expedited. The project was then extended for another 4 months with 6 nursing homes. The results showed that geriatrician input into nursing homes had a significant impact on admissions from nursing homes (chi(2)(2) = 6.261, p < 0.05). The second part of the project also showed significant impact on admissions (chi(2)(2) = 12.552, p < 0.05). Furthermore, in both parts of the project the length of stay in hospital for the residents was reduced. Geriatricians working together with co-ordinated multidisciplinary teams are well placed to manage the care needs of frail, elderly care home residents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Despite efforts to improve, many nursing home residents receive poor care. By focusing on residents' relationships, life experiences, abilities, and preferences, person-centered care represents an innovation in nursing home care. Because person-centered care requires organization-wide change, implementation can be challenging.Purpose: The purpose of this research is to apply innovation implementation theory to understand factors and conditions that help or hinder the implementation of person-centered care in nursing homes.Methodology: Data come from the Person-Centered Care Program conducted by the Carolinas Center for Medical Excellence. Eight nursing homes participated in the Person-Centered Care Program for 1 year. A multiple-case-study design and pattern-matching logic were employed to examine organizational factors associated with implementation effectiveness. Data sources included semistructured key informant interviews, archival documents, surveys, and expert rankings of nursing homes' implementation effectiveness.Findings: On the basis of this research, we suggest that effective implementation of organization-wide change in nursing homes is associated with high-quality management communications about the change, organizational readiness for change, and favorable perceptions from direct care providers about the priority of the innovation to the organization. Notably, neither the amount of training nor the financial resources dedicated to person-centered care were associated with implementation effectiveness.Practice Implications: Effective implementation of person-centered care in nursing homes is most likely when management follows through with plans as advertised, when leadership teams have confidence in their ability to meet goals for change, and when change fosters smooth operations in the daily routines of direct care providers.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			0361-6274	1550-5030		WOS:000305081800007	22138738

Healthcare professionals frequently do not recognise delirium, indicating that education can play an important role in improving delirium care for hospitalised elderly. Previous studies have indicated that e-learning can provide an effective way of educating healthcare professionals and improving quality of care, though results are inconsistent.Methods and design: This stepped wedge cluster randomised trial will assess the effects of a complementary delirium e-learning course on the implementation of quality improvement initiative, which aims to enhance the recognition and management of delirium in elderly patients. The trial will be conducted in 18 Dutch hospitals and last 11 months. Measurements will be taken in all participating wards using monthly record reviews, in order to monitor delivered care. These measurements will include the percentage of elderly patients who were screened for the risk of developing delirium, use of the Delirium Observation Screening scale, use of nursing or medical interventions, and the percentage of elderly patients who were diagnosed with delirium. Data regarding the e-learning course will be gathered as well. These data will include user characteristics, information regarding use of the course, delirium knowledge before and after using the course, and the attitude and intentions of nurses concerning delirium care.Setting: The study will be conducted in internal medicine and surgical wards of eighteen hospitals that are at the beginning stages of implementing the Frail Elderly Project in the Netherlands.Discussion: Better recognition of elderly patients at risk for delirium and subsequent care is expected from the introduction of an e-learning course for nurses that is complementary to an existing quality improvement project. This trial has the potential to demonstrate that e-learning can be a vital part of the implementation process, especially for quality improvement projects aimed at complex health issues such as delirium. The study will contribute to a growing body of knowledge concerning e-learning and the effects it can have on knowledge as well as delivered care.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1748-5908			WOS:000302075800001	22385554	
J	Nakrem, Sigrid; Vinsnes, Anne Guttormsen; Seim, Arnfinn								Residents' experiences of interpersonal factors in nursing home care: A qualitative study								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES				48	11			1357	1366		10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.05.012				NOV 2011	2011	Background: With life expectancy lengthening, the number of those who will require care in a nursing home will increase dramatically in the next 20 years. Nursing home residents are frail older adults with complex needs, dependent on advanced nursing care. Long-term residents in nursing homes have long-term relationships with the nurses, which require a unique approach to the interpersonal aspects of nursing care. Understanding what is experienced as care quality, including quality of interpersonal processes, requires insight into the residents' perspectives for best value in care to be realized.Objective: Main objective was to describe the nursing home residents' experience with direct nursing care, related to the interpersonal aspects of quality of care.Design: A descriptive, exploratory design was used.Settings: Four public municipal nursing homes in Norway with long-term residents were purposely selected for the study.Participants: Fifteen mentally lucid residents were included. The inclusion criteria were aged 65 and over, being a resident of the nursing home for one month or longer, and physical and mental capacity to participate in the interview.Method: In-depth interviews with the residents were performed. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using meaning categorizing.Results: The residents emphasized the importance of nurses acknowledging their individual needs, which included need for general and specialized care, health promotion and prevention of complications, and prioritizing the individuals. The challenging balance between self-determination and dependency, the altered role from homeowner to resident, and feelings of indignity and depreciation of social status were key issues in which the residents perceived that their integrity was at risk in the patient-nurse interaction and care. Psychosocial well-being was a major issue, and the residents expressed an important role of the nursing staff helping them to balance the need for social contact and to be alone, and preserving a social network.Conclusions: Quality nursing care in nursing home implies a balanced, individual approach to medical, physical and psychosocial care, including interpersonal aspects of care. The interpersonal relationship between resident and nurse implies long-term commitment, reciprocal relationship on a personal level and interpersonal competence of the nurses to understand each resident's needs.

I Enjoy Caring for Her"								JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION				306	13			1468	1478		10.1001/jama.2011.1420				OCT 5 2011	2011	More than 1.5 million adults live in US nursing homes, and approximately 30% of individuals in the United States will die with a nursing home as their last place of residence. Physicians play a pivotal role in the rehabilitation, complex medical care, and end-of-life care of this frail and vulnerable population. The reasons for admission are multifactorial and a comprehensive care plan based on the Minimum Data Set guides the multidisciplinary nursing home team in the care of the patient and provides assessments of the quality of care provided. Using the cases of 2 patients with different experiences, we describe the physician's role in planning for admission, participating as a team member in the ongoing assessment and care in the nursing home, and guiding care at the end of life. The increasing population of older adults has also promoted community-based and residential alternatives to traditional nursing homes. The future of longterm care will include additional challenges and rich innovations in services and options for older adults.

Quality of Care Provided in a Special Needs Plan Using a Nurse Care Manager Model								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY				59	10			1810	1822		10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03599.x				OCT 2011	2011	OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate the quality of care provided in special needs plans (SNPs; Medicare Advantage plans that aim to provide specialized care for complex older adults) and specifically the nurse care management model in the community setting.DESIGN: We adapted 107 process-of-care quality measures across 12 conditions from the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders set to obtain a clinically detailed evaluation of the quality of care received by complex older enrollees in a dual eligible Evercare SNP. We abstracted 13 months of primary care medical records to delineate quality of care provided by physicians and whether there was value added from the nurse care manager model.SETTING: Dual eligible Evercare SNP located in central Florida.PARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred thirty-one vulnerable older enrollees in the SNP who had complex disease.RESULTS: Based on physician medical records alone, the 231 high-risk participants (mean age 77, 67% women) received recommended care for 53% of 5,569 evaluated clinical circumstances, ranging from 12% for end-of-life care to 78% for diabetes mellitus. In fewer than 40% of these clinical circumstances was recommended care provided for dementia, falls, and urinary incontinence. In a second analysis accounting for care provided by both the Evercare nurse and the physician, recommended care was provided to patients in 69% of the 5,684 evaluated clinical circumstances.CONCLUSION: Comprehensive quality measurement applied to vulnerable older adults enrolled in one mature SNP showed that the Evercare nurse model addresses important deficits in physician care for geriatric conditions. Such measurement should be applied to other SNP models and to compare SNP care with that for complex, older, fee-for-service Medicare cohorts.

S. EDs from 2005 to 2008.PARTICIPANTS: Individuals visiting U. S. EDs stratified according to nursing home residency.MEASUREMENTS: All ED visits by nursing home residents were identified. The demographic and clinical characteristics and ED resource utilization, length of stay, and outcomes of nursing home residents and nonresidents were compared.RESULTS: During 2005 to 2008, nursing home residents accounted for 9,104,735 of 475,077,828 U. S. ED visits (1.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-2.1%). The annualized number of ED visits by nursing home residents was 2,276,184. Most nursing home residents were older (mean age 76.7, 95% CI = 75.8-77.5), female (63.3%), and non-Hispanic white (74.8%). Nursing home residents were more likely to have been discharged from the hospital in the prior 7 days (adjusted odds ratio (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9), to present with fever (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5-2.4) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure <= 90 mmHg, aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5-2.2), and to receive diagnostic tests (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.6-2.2), imaging (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3-1.7), or procedures (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.4-1.7) in the ED. Almost half of nursing home residents visiting the ED were admitted to the hospital. Nursing home residents were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.6-2.0) and to die (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6-3.3).CONCLUSION: Nursing home residents account for more than 2.2 million ED visits annually in the United States. Nursing home residents have greater medical acuity and complexity. These observations highlight the national challenges of organizing and delivering ED care to nursing home residents in the United States.

Contextual factors influencing success or failure of emergency department interventions for cognitively impaired older people: a scoping and integrative review								JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING				67	7			1426	1448		10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05611.x				JUL 2011	2011	Aim. This paper is a report of a scoping review of research on cognitive impairment in older adults who visit Emergency Departments of acute care hospitals, followed by an integrative review that included a quality assessment to determine the effectiveness of interventions for this population.Background. Being old and cognitively impaired in the Emergency Department - a fast-paced intervention system -is a complex phenomenon that challenges many healthcare professionals. The rise in the incidence and prevalence of dementia will have a large impact on healthcare systems.Data sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, AgeLine, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2008, for qualitative or quantitative studies reporting extractable data on delirium or dementia in non-institutionalized older people (65+ years) in the Emergency Department.Review methods. Titles screened by a project researcher and checked against inclusion criteria by another researcher. Two reviewers completed independent data extraction and synthesis of included studies. Quality assessment occurred using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tools.Results. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for integrative review. Analysis of these studies indicates that the prevalence of cognitive impairment is high and improvements are needed. Contextual details and relevant features of an appropriate intervention are poorly explained.Conclusion. Although the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment is recognized, appropriate interventions and programmatic responses remain elusive. Quality improvements require more thorough examination of emergency department context to identify modifiable influencing factors that are transferable across settings.									12	0	0	0	1	1	13			0309-2402			WOS:000292779400003	21382076

To investigate how one aspect of anticipatory care is understood and delivered in practice. 'Anticipatory care' in this context can be understood as proactive care, which is oriented towards prevention of adverse events.Background. Scotland has identified the intention to move away from a preoccupation with acute care and invest in health improvement and anticipatory care. Community nurses are the key, yet little is known about how they understand and deliver anticipatory care.Methods. A qualitative case study design using individual in-depth interviews (n = 10), observation (n = 9) and focus groups (n = 5) was selected. Five focus group interviews were carried out with district nurses, practice nurses and health visitors. Subsequently, nine observation events took place, each focused on a single nurse/client encounter. Data were collected during 2008 and 2009 in one Community Health Partnership in Scotland.Findings. Two approaches to anticipatory care emerged; these were influenced by participants' roles and responsibilities. Approach 1 derives from Government policy agenda and is focused on protocol-focused management of long-term illness. Approach 2 is synonymous with long-standing nursing activity focused on holistic care of individual patients. Both approaches are proactive in nature.Conclusions. There is scope to develop a more conceptually complex model of anticipatory care, building on this initial exploration, within which all aims, roles, practices and methods of evaluation can be located and clearly visible. This offers the potential to enable practitioners to interpret and apply policy-otherwise change may be limited and result in service gaps.									8	0	0	0	0	1	9			0309-2402			WOS:000292779400014	21332574	
J	Dorner, Becky; Posthauer, Mary Ellen; Friedrich, Elizabeth K.; Robinson, Gretchen E.								Enteral Nutrition for Older Adults in Nursing Facilities								NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE				26	3			261	272		10.1177/0884533611405794				JUN 2011	2011	Older adults who reside in nursing facilities tend to be frail and to have multiple comorbidities, increased risk of unintended weight loss, and protein energy malnutrition. Approximately 5.8% of nursing facility residents in the United States receive enteral feedings. The prevalence is higher for residents with cognitive impairment, ranging from 18% to 34%. In cognitively impaired residents, the majority of tube feeding placements occur in the acute care setting and result in significant use of additional healthcare resources and high postinsertion mortality rates within 60 days of insertion. Nursing facilities must abide by state and federal regulations and undergo stringent survey evaluation while balancing complex decisions related to initial placement of feeding tubes. Informed choice, resident-centered care decisions, and the role of advance directives are essential in the decision-making process. In nursing facilities, it is often the registered dietitian who alerts the healthcare team to determine whether a feeding tube is appropriate. Once a tube is placed, healthcare practitioners must make careful decisions related to ordering, administering, and monitoring enteral nutrition (EN) delivery; adequacy of nutritional content; tolerance to feedings; monitoring for potential complications; and the possibility of return to oral feeding or, conversely, the decision to discontinue feedings. Further evidence-based research is needed to document effectiveness, along with research to support positive outcomes for residents in nursing facilities who receive EN. Optimal care requires careful coordination and an interdisciplinary approach across the continuum of care and between caregivers within the individual nursing facility.

Process evaluations aid the interpretation of outcome results by documenting and evaluating each process step in detail. Despite its importance, process evaluations are not embedded in all evaluations of complex interventions.Based on literature, we structured the process evaluation for trials on complex interventions into 3 main components: (1) the success rate of recruitment and quality of the study population, (2) the quality of execution of the complex intervention, and (3) the process of acquisition of the evaluation data.To clarify these process evaluation components and measures, we exemplified them with the preplanned process evaluation of a complex falls-prevention program for community-dwelling frail older fallers and their informal caregivers. The 3 process evaluation components are operationalized, results are presented, and implications discussed. This process evaluation identified several limitations of the intervention and effect study, and resulted in multiple recommendations for improvement of both the intervention as well as the trial.Thus, a good-quality process evaluation gives a detailed description of the most important components of a complex intervention, resulting in an in-depth insight in the actually performed intervention and effect analysis. This allows us to draw the appropriate conclusions on positive or negative trial results, and results in recommendations for implementation, or adjustment of the intervention or effect evaluation, respectively.

We aimed to design and pilot a palliative care and advance care plan (ACP) intervention. Patients had undergone emergency hospital admission and had severe dementia. The intervention consisted of a palliative care patient assessment which informed an ACP discussion with the carer, who was offered the opportunity to write an ACP for the person with dementia. Carer-patient dyads were randomized to 'usual care' or the intervention. Carer-related outcome measures included the Kessler Distress Scale, Decision Satisfaction Inventory, Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Euroqol-5D, measured at baseline, six weeks, six months and three months after bereavement. The Satisfaction with End of Life Care in Dementia Scale was completed if the patient died. The 32 patient participants were physically frail and in the advanced stages of dementia: 62% had pressure damage to the skin, all needed feeding assistance and 95% were in pain. Nearly 50% died during the six-month follow-up period. Carers were difficult to recruit during acute admission; 33 patients and carers entered the study (22 intervention arm; 11 control arm). Only seven carers made ACPs. The care planning discussion was well received, but few carers wrote an ACP, despite intensive support from an experienced nurse specialist. Advance care planning is, in theory, a necessary intervention for people with severe dementia; the reluctance of carers to write plans needs to be explored further.									73	0	0	0	10	1	74			0269-2163	1477-030X		WOS:000289408100001	21228087

New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is needed and the level of care that is provided.

Older adults who account for nearly 37% of all hospital discharges often need care and support of family members at the time of hospital discharge. This study examines decisions made by hospitalized older adults, families, and health care team members (HCTMs) about hospital discharge. The sample included older adults (n = 13, average age 84), family members (n = 12, average age 71), and HCTMs (n = 7, average age 47). Findings revealed the complexity of hospital discharge planning for older adults through five themes as follows: (a) home, (b) staying independent, (c) "advocating for them," (d) deciding what to tell, and (e) changing the plan.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1074-8407	1552-549X		WOS:000287587000004	21343622

Unravelling the differences between complexity and frailty in old age: findings from a constructivist grounded theory study								JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING				18	1			67	73		10.1111/j.1365-2850.2010.01630.x				FEB 2011	2011	Accessible summaryUK health policy is often concerned with meeting the needs of the increasing number of older people in society and within some of this policy the concepts 'frailty' and 'complexity' have been used interchangeably. The concepts are not seen as the same by registered nurses who work in an older people's mental health service.Frailty is generally described as a physical state leading to inevitable decline and death. There is an abundance of research into frailty, much of which has the ultimate aim of prevention of disability and reduction of health care needs. Some critics view the emphasis on frailty as an example of the way that some health staff turn old age into a problem. To date, there has been little research into complexity in either old age, in mental health, or from a nursing perspective.Nurses described complexity as a dynamic state from which there can be 'recovery' and movement back and forth.Understanding complexity is important if the needs of older people are to be met effectively. This study found that nurses share common perceptions of complexity but do not always find it easy to articulate these.AbstractUK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.									7	0	0	0	4	0	8			1351-0126	1365-2850		WOS:000286056000009	21214686

A close interaction between oncologists and geriatricians becomes necessary to (1) better evaluate the elders' health status, (2) determine their residual clinical/biological reserves, and (3) optimize the provided medical care. In fact, aggressive antineoplastic managements are often denied to older patients, possibly because of the common misconception suggesting older age and/or clinical complexity as absolute contraindications to advanced treatments.Methods: The primary aim of the presented project is to assess whether assigning a geriatrician to provide daily medical care to older cancer patients (aged 65 years and older) admitted to an oncology ward increases the number of patients eligible for a chemotherapeutic and/or surgical intervention. The project is articulated in 2 phases: (1) a retrospective phase based on analysis of data collected over the 2 years before the beginning of the study, and (2) a prospective 2-year intervention. Additional information about clinical conditions, biological parameters, adverse drug reactions, body composition, physical function, and 1-year health-related events will also be recorded.Outcomes: The combination of expertise from oncologists and geriatricians is likely to result in (1) an improved selection of candidates for interventions aimed at increasing disability-free life expectancy and/or overall survival, and (2) a more rational exclusion of patients at higher risk of toxicity or with poor prognosis. In this article, the development of an onco-geriatric unit aimed at the evaluation, management, and treatment of older women with gynecological cancer is also described.

Acute Care for the Elderly: A Literature Review								POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT				13	4			219	225		10.1089/pop.2009.0058				AUG 2010	2010	Traditionally, acute medical care has been insufficient to meet the complex care needs of frail older adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) units at improving hospitalization outcomes for adults older than 65 years of age. A review of the literature was performed, focusing on randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, reviews, and meta-analyses from 1990 to 2008. This review revealed ACE to be associated with positive global outcomes (eg, cost, length of stay, readmission rates, utilization, rehabilitation, cognition, function, patient/staff satisfaction). Furthermore, some studies may point to a decreased incidence of delirium and polypharmacy. Though larger studies with consistent operational definitions and replicative studies are needed, the literature presents compelling evidence that warrants further investigation of ACE as a valuable alternative paradigm of acute geriatric care.

Among their advantages are the inclusion of clinically heterogeneous populations, without exclusions typical in clinical trials; the ability to study extremely large study populations with power to examine differential outcomes across individual drugs, treatment effect modification, and the risk of uncommon outcomes. However, claims data by themselves are subject to many limitations, notably, in their lack of information on such clinical characteristics as functional status, behaviors, and symptoms, which are important both as outcomes and as covariates.Methods: We describe data from multiple sources including standardized, electronically recorded clinical and functional data from the Nursing Home (NH) Minimum Data Set; prescription drug data from Medicaid and Medicare claims; and facility data. We present the strengths and challenges of using merged data about the NH population to study prescription drug exposures and outcomes in the frail elderly, and suggest strategies to address methodological difficulties.Results: Merged data from NH sources can support unique study designs in CE research and provide great power. However, given the differing longitudinal structure, timing of observations, and other complex features of the underlying data sources, such studies pose many challenging design and analytic issues.Conclusions: Integrated data on the NH population have great potential for CE research among frail elderly persons, if methodological and measurement challenges can be adequately addressed.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			0025-7079	1537-1948		WOS:000278227800006	20473191

Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is important to implement strategies for including relatives in care.Data sources.The background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into nursing homes and psychological transitions.Discussion.The concepts of transition from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will support residents and their relatives during the admission phase.Implications for nursing.Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that occurs when an older person is admitted into care.Conclusion.Improving the psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a more positive experience.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			0309-2402			WOS:000276246800022	20423358	
J	Man, Elaine Siu Ling; Low, Lisa Pau Le								Nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients: a descriptive study of what nurses actually do?								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING				19	9-10			1387	1395		10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03026.x				MAY 2010	2010	Aims.This study aims to explore nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem.Background.Urinary tract infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition.Design.Qualitative.Methods.A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide.Results.When managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed the basis for deciding whether the patient's urinary condition should be managed by nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to improve nurses' existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified.Conclusion.Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem.Relevance to clinical practice.Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive 'basic urinary tract infection care' on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000276503500024	20500348

Laxative treatment is often chosen without regard for gut health.To investigate whether the addition of oat-bran to the common oral diet for 12 weeks is able to reduce constipation and laxative use and improve gut health. It is assumed that this will lead to improved plasma levels of vitamins B6, B12, folate, and of homocysteine in nursing home residents.A controlled, parallel intervention trial. 30 frail patients with multiple chronic diseases, aged 57-98 years, receiving laxative therapy were included. Patients were randomized into a fiber (n=15) and a control group (n=15). The intervention group received 5.2g/d oat-bran for 84 days mixed into the daily common meals. The control group received the ward's habitual diet. Food intake and laxative use were documented and blood samples (on day 01, day 42 and day 84) were collected. Vitamin B12 and folate were analyzed by radioimmunoassay, B6 and homocysteine by RP-HPLC with fluorescence detection, in addition to the routine lab test of albumin and CRP.In the fiber group, the intervention was well tolerated and laxative use decreased significantly (p < 0.001). In the control group, plasma B12 decreased faster (p < 0.05). In both groups, B6 and folate status remained unchanged. Plasma homocysteine decreased in both groups (p < 0.05). General mean energy intake was low (4861.4 kJ/d).Oat-bran helps to improve constipation management and B12 bioavailability in elderly, with multiple chronic diseases who live in nursing homes.									23	1	0	0	15	0	26			1279-7707			WOS:000276527000009	20191257

The evidence for improving balance is somewhat conflicting because few research studies identify which balance exercises are effective. The question of how TC achieves improvements in balance remains. To promote functional independence and improve quality of life in the later years of one's life, it is important to improve balance and prevent falls in older adults. TC poses challenges related to the complexity of the practice. By reviewing the current research literature on TC focusing on balance and falls in older adults, strategies may be developed to incorporate TC to improve balance and modify the known risk factors for falling. This article also discusses potential applications and limitations of the current research.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0744-6020	1542-538X		WOS:000275956200006	20335770

This article describes the content of and adherence with a nurse-led home visiting programme (Dutch Geriatric Intervention Programme; DGIP) for vulnerable older people. The randomised Dutch EASYcare Study showed positive patient endpoints for DGIP. Describing content and adherence is rarely performed, but highly important for understanding the results of trials.Method. DGIP is a complex multicomponent intervention tailored to the patients' needs. This process evaluation describes these components and patient characteristics and creates meaningful clusters of these specific components using hierarchical cluster analysis. Both patient/caregiver and physician adherence rates and possible predictors were investigated.Results. In line with the heterogeneity among the subjects, the individual treatment plans turned out to be highly tailored. Cluster analysis identified five clusters of intervention components. DGIP turned out to be largely unsuitable for one group of very vulnerable older participants in urgent need of more care. Overall, physician adherence was 75% and was better than patient adherence (51% complete/partial adherence). Adherence levels increased when both patients, caregivers and physicians received recommendations.Conclusions. The content of a multicomponent tailored home-visiting programme was very diverse, matching the heterogeneity among frail elderly subjects. Detailed process and cluster analysis helped to understand the content of the intervention, sharpen target criteria and identify possibilities to improve adherence.									7	0	0	0	1	1	7			0963-8288	1464-5165		WOS:000278064700007	19860600

J	Fjelltun, Aud-Mari Sohini; Henriksen, Nils; Norberg, Astrid; Gilje, Fredricka; Normann, Hans Ketil								Carers' and nurses' appraisals of needs of nursing home placement for frail older in Norway								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING				18	22			3079	3088		10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02663.x				NOV 2009	2009	Aims and objectives. The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement.Background. Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations.Design. This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods.Methods. The convenience sample (n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis.Results. Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'.Conclusions. Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues.Relevance to clinical practice. Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0962-1067	1365-2702		WOS:000270664600004	19374699

These conditions frequently coexist, and each carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with hypertension.Data sourcesA systematic review of the published and unpublished literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed.ConclusionsHypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication management accordingly.Implications for practiceThis article will assist the NP to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.									4	1	0	0	0	1	5			1041-2972	1745-7599		WOS:000267369400008	19594659

The authors propose that creating a nursing home medicine specialty, which recognizes the nursing home as a unique practice site, would go a long way toward remedying existing problems with care in skilled nursing facilities and would best serve the needs of the 1.6 million nursing home residents in the United States. Reviewing what is known about physician practice in nursing homes and hospitals, and taking a lead from the hospitalist movement, the specialty would be characterized in 3 dimensions: the degree of physicians' commitment, physicians' practice competencies, and the structure of the medical staff organization in which they practice. Challenges to the adoption of a nursing home specialist model include mainstream medicine's failure to recognize the nursing home as a legitimate medical practice, the need for the nursing home industry and policymakers to appreciate the links between physician practice and quality, and assurance of financial viability. Implications for quality of care, health policy, and research needs are discussed in this article.									73	0	0	0	9	0	73			0003-4819	1539-3704		WOS:000264468500007	19293074

Directors of geriatrics academic programs (DGAPs) at all 145 U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were asked this question as part of a winter 2007 on-line survey. The DGAPs were to indicate the types of patients who would most benefit from a geriatrician's services in three practice Situations: primary care, consultations, and care in the hospital. The survey response rate was 74.5%. There was high consensus among the DGAPs on the benefits of having a geriatrician care for the most complex and vulnerable older adults in primary care and hospital setting,,. There was slightly less consensus as to when geriatrics consultations are beneficial. The patient Subsets that were viewed as benefiting the most from, geriatric geriatrician care were aged 85 and older, frailty, sybdromes, severe functional impairment, and complexity. The results of this Survey suggest that, because of the predicted shortage of geriatricians, the DGAPs would target geriatricians to work with the most vulnerable older adults. These findings offer the beginning of a consensus statement as to the role of geriatricians in the continuum of American medical care.

This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence.Background. Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence.Methods. Forty-one female caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis.Findings. The main finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes.Conclusion and relevance to clinical practice. As the perception of violence is subjective, there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0962-1067			WOS:000255837100015	18482127

Minimal effect on energy intake by additional evening meal for frail elderly service flat residents - A pilot study								JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING				12	5			295	301		10.1007/BF02982658				MAY 2008	2008	Background: Nutritional problems are common in frail elderly individuals receiving municipal care. Objective: To evaluate if an additional evening meal could improve total daily food intake, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in frail elderly service flat (SF) residents. Design: Out of 122 residents in two SF complexes, 60 subjects agreed to participate, of which 49 subjects (median 84 (79-90) years, (25th-75th percentile)) completed the study. For six months 23 residents in one SF complex were served 530 kcal in addition to their regular meals, i.e. intervention group (I-group). Twenty-six residents in the other SF building were controls (C-group). Nutritional status, energy and nutrient intake, length of night time fast, cognitive function and HRQOL was assessed before and after the intervention. Results: At the start, the Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 27% as malnourished and 63% as at risk for malnutrition, with no difference between the groups. After six months the median body weight was unchanged in the 1-group, +0.6 (-1.7 - +1.6) kg (p=0.72) and the C-group -0.6 (-2.0 - +0.5) kg (p=0.15). Weight change ranged from -13% to +15%. The evening meal improved the protein and carbohydrate intake (p<0.01) but the energy intake increased by only 180 kcal/day (p=0.15). The night time fast decreased in the I-group from 15.0 (13.0-16.0) to 13.0 (12.0-14.0) hours (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in cognitive function or HRQOL between the groups. Conclusion: Nine out of ten frail elderly SF residents had nutritional problems. Serving an additional evening meal increased the protein and carbohydrate intake, but the meal had no significant effect on energy intake, body weight or HRQOL. The variation in outcome within each study group was large.									17	0	0	0	4	1	18			1279-7707	1760-4788		WOS:000256357100002	18443710

The design of a randomised controlled trial								BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH				8						71	10.1186/1472-6963-8-71				APR 2 2008	2008	Background: Early diagnosis of dementia benefits both patient and caregiver. Nevertheless, dementia in primary care is currently under-diagnosed. Some educational interventions developed to improve dementia diagnosis and management were successful in increasing the number of dementia diagnoses and in changing attitudes and knowledge of health care staff. However, none of these interventions focussed on collaboration between GPs and nurses in dementia care. We developed an EASY care-based Dementia Training Program ( DTP) aimed at stimulating collaboration in dementia primary care. We expect this program to increase the number of cognitive assessments and dementia diagnoses and to improve attitudes and knowledge of GPs and nurses.Methods: The DTP is a complex educational intervention that consists of two workshops, a coaching program, access to an internet forum, and a Computerized Clinical Decision Support System on dementia diagnostics. One hundred duos of GPs and nurses will be recruited, from which 2/3 will be allocated to the intervention group and 1/3 to the control group. The effects of implementation of the DTP will be studied in a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Primary outcomes will be the number of cognitive assessments and dementia diagnoses in a period of 9 months following workshop participation. Secondary outcomes are measured on GP and nurse level: adherence to national guidelines for dementia, attitude, confidence and knowledge regarding dementia diagnosis and management; on patient level: number of emergency calls, visits and consultations and patient satisfaction; and on caregiver level: informal caregiver burden and satisfaction. Data will be collected from GPs' electronic medical records, self-registration forms and questionnaires. Statistical analysis will be performed using the MANOVA-method. Also, exploratory analyses will be performed, in order to gain insight into barriers and facilitators for implementation and the possible causal relations between the rate of success of the intervention components and the outcomes.Discussion: We developed multifaceted dementia training programme. Novelties in this programme are the training in fixed collaborative duos and the inclusion of an individual coaching program. The intervention is designed according to international guidelines and educational standards. Exploratory analysis will reveal its successful elements. Selection bias and contamination may be threats to the reliability of future results of this trial. Nevertheless, the results of this trial may provide useful information for policy makers and developers of continuing medical education.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00459784.									44	0	0	0	8	2	45			1472-6963			WOS:000256396200001	18384675

Effect of Micronutrient Supplementation on Mood in Nursing Home Residents								GERONTOLOGY				54	5			292	299		10.1159/000131886				2008	2008	One third of older people in nursing and/or residential homes have significant symptoms of depression. In younger people, deficiencies in selenium, vitamin C and folate are associated with depression. This study examines the association between micronutrient status and mood before and after supplementation. The objective was to determine whether the administration of selenium, vitamin C and folate improved mood in frail elderly nursing home residents. Mood was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating scale (HAD), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Micronutrient supplementation was provided for 8 weeks in a double-blinded randomised controlled trial. Significant symptoms of depression (29%) and anxiety (24%) were found at baseline. 67% of patients had low serum concentrations of vitamin C, but no-one was below the reference range for selenium. Depression was significantly associated with selenium levels, but not with folate or vitamin C levels. No individual with a HAD depression score of >= 8, had selenium levels >1.2 mu M. In those patients with higher HAD depression scores, there was a significant reduction in the score and a significant increase in serum selenium levels after 8 weeks of micronutrient supplementation. Placebo group scores were unchanged. This small study concluded that depression was associated with low levels of selenium in frail older individuals. Following 8 weeks of micronutrient supplementation, there was a significant increase in selenium levels and improved symptoms of depression occurred in a subgroup. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost as distressing as the patients' themselves do.Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with older confused patients.Methodological design and justification: Data was collected from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with older confused patients.Ethics issues and approval: A Regional Board of Research Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been changed in order to ensure confidentiality.Results: The encounter with the confused patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool.Relevance to clinical practice: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0283-9318			WOS:000251206600013	18036015

Countries such as the USA, Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands have long running case management programmes in place for frail elderly people. The Department of Health in England has recently introduced a 'community matron' role to provide case management to patients with highly complex long-term conditions; a group that is predominantly comprised of elderly people. Department of Health policy documents do not define the day-to-day role of community matrons but instead describe the objectives and principles of case management for long-term conditions. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe case management from the perspective of patients and carers in order to develop a clearer understanding of how the model is being delivered for patients with long-term conditions. In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 72 patients and 52 carers who had experience of case management. Five categories of case management tasks emerged from the data: clinical care, co-ordination of care, education, advocacy and psychosocial support. Psychosocial support was emphasised by both patients and carers, and was viewed as equally important to clinical care. Patient and carer perceptions of case management appear to contrast with descriptions contained in Department of Health guidance, suggesting an 'implementation surplus' in relation to the policy. This particularly appears to be the case for psychosocial support activities, which are not described in official policy documents. The provision of significant psychosocial support by community matrons also appears to differentiate the model from most other case management programmes for frail elderly people described in the literature. The findings emphasise the importance of seeking patient and carer input when designing new case management programmes.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			0966-0410	1365-2524		WOS:000250958200001	17956403

A survey of residential aged care facilities in the Australian Capital Territory: Implications for mental health nursing								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING				16	5			327	337		10.1111/j.1447-0349.2007.00482.x				OCT 2007	2007	Residential aged care facilities are increasingly becoming locations wherein the most frail and older people with mental illness live out the remainder of their lives, yet it has become apparent in recent years that these institutions are fraught with a variety of social and clinical problems. One issue of concern has been the exodus of registered nurses (both general and psychiatric), who have been increasingly replaced by carers with little or no expertise in psychiatric illness or disorders of cognitive decline. This 'de-professionalizing' of aged care has important implications for the well-being of clients, particularity those with complex mental health problems. In this survey we sought to discover demographic information concerning those who provide front-line care to this population of aged Australians, and we sought also to ascertain how much education in caring for residents who suffer specifically from neurodegenerative disorders (the dementias) and mental illness was provided by the facilities to those who care for such older people. The lack of training in the areas of mental health and cognitive impairment raises a variety of issues that mental health nurses need to address. These issues cover clinical, professional, and social justice dimensions. We believe that mental health nurses are strategically and professionally placed to take a leadership role in raising the profile of aged care in this country and they need to act proactively to secure the well-being of this particularly vulnerable client group.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1445-8330	1447-0349		WOS:000208493300005	17845552	
J	Munikrishnappa, Devaraj								Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly - a geriatrician's perspective								AGING MALE				10	3			113	137		10.1080/13685530701419096				SEP 2007	2007	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality, of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.									5	0	0	0	1	1	6			1368-5538	1473-0790		WOS:000249831700001	17701657

Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what matters most in relation to their quality of life.									45	0	1	0	7	4	47			0283-9318	1471-6712		WOS:000245416600008	17428214

A systematic review of predictors and screening instruments to identify older hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING				16	1			46	57		10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01579.x				JAN 2007	2007	Aims and objectives. To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated.Background. Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on healthcare costs is also high.Results. Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described.Conclusion. These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population.Relevance to clinical practice. Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.									179	5	1	0	50	5	190			0962-1067			WOS:000242965000006	17181666

JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION				296	18			2245	2253		10.1001/jama.296.18.2245				NOV 8 2006	2006	Frailty in older adults is increasingly a recognized syndrome of decline, sometimes subtle, in function and health that may be amenable to available approaches to care. Frailty manifests the following core clinical features: loss of strength, weight loss, low levels of activity, poor endurance or fatigue, and slowed performance. The presence of 3 or more of these features is associated with adverse outcomes including falls, new or worsened function impairment, hospitalization, and death. In this article, we use the case of Mrs K to describe the challenges of recognizing frailty in clinical practice, common problems and symptoms that frail older adults experience, and approaches to these issues that clinicians may incorporate into their practices. We discuss the importance of advance care planning, provider-patient communication, and appropriate palliative care and hospice referral for frail older adults. Frailty is associated with symptomatic long-term disease, decline in function, and abbreviated survival. Therefore, when frailty is severe, delivery of palliative care focused on relief of discomfort and enhancement of quality of life is highly appropriate. The application of multidisciplinary, team-based palliative approaches and of up-to-date geriatrics knowledge is beneficial for treating these patients because of the complexity of their coexisting social, psychological, and medical needs.									62	0	0	0	16	0	63			0098-7484	1538-3598		WOS:000241827700025	17090771

In a large nonprofit nursing home, 6 full-time male physicians and I female nurse practitioner completed questionnaires that described the medical decision-making process for 52 nursing home residents for whom hospitalization was considered. The questionnaire covered the following topics: medical event description, the decision-making process, considerations in making treatment decisions, and the role of advance directives. Hospitalized residents had fewer treatments considered and fewer treatments chosen than those who were not hospitalized. Residents with fractures were the most commonly hospitalized residents, whereas residents in frailer conditions, with breathing problems, and for whom the physician considered quality of life to be most important were less likely to be hospitalized. The results of this study clarify the complexity of factors affecting the decision-making process and suggest a methodology that may assist in discerning those factors in the future.									19	0	0	0	4	0	19			0896-4289			WOS:000239401300004	16903616

Methods: A large sample of nursing homes was selected, based on willingness to participate, representation of both public and private institutions, and wide geographic representation. Two registered nurses assessed all residents using the RUG questionnaire. The information collected was then used to group residents into 44 RUGs, and facility-specific case-mix indices were calculated using the RUG-specific weights previously validated in Italy. Results: A total of 3981 residents from 93 nursing homes were assessed. Most residents were over 75 years old (87.4%) and women (68.6%). A large percentage was classified into RUGs within the following primary categories: reduced physical function (33.6%), impaired cognition (17.6%) and clinically complex (17.6%). The resulting nursing home case-mix indices ranged from 0.627 to 1.108 (mean 0.807 +/- 0.110). No significant association was found between type of facility, level of fees, or extent of staff in the nursing homes and their case-mix indices. Conclusions: RUG-III can provide information on types of nursing home residents and their care needs. This is useful for monitoring and evaluating long-term care services for the elderly, and allows for more effective planning and allocation of staffing and financial resources.									3	2	0	0	0	0	5			1594-0667	1720-8319		WOS:000237898000007	16702782

Several inpatient geriatric health services have proven effectiveness in frail persons. However, the wish to live independently and policies that promote independent living as an answer to population aging call for community intervention models for frail elderly people. Maybe models such as preventive home visits, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and intermediate care qualify, but their efficacy is controversial, especially in frail elderly persons living in the community. With the Dutch EASYcare Study Geriatric Intervention Programme ( DGIP) we developed a model to study effectiveness of problem based community intervention models in frail elderly people.Methods/Design: DGIP is a community intervention model for frail elderly persons where the GP refers elderly patients with a problem in cognition, mood, behaviour, mobility, and nutrition. A geriatric specialist nurse applies a guideline-based intervention with a limited number of follow up visits. The intervention starts with the application of the EASYcare instrument for geriatric screening. The EASYcare instrument assesses ( instrumental) activities of daily life, cognition, mood, and includes a goal setting item. During the intervention the nurse regularly consults the referring GP and a geriatrician. Effects on functional performance (Groningen Activity Restriction Scale), health related quality of life (MOS-20), and carer burden ( Zarit Burden Interview) are studied in an observer blinded randomised controlled trial. 151 participants were randomised over two treatment arms - DGIP and regular care - using pseudo cluster randomisation. We are currently performing the follow up visits. These visits are planned three and six months after inclusion. Process measures and cost measures will be recorded. Intention to treat analyses will focus on post intervention differences between treatment groups.Discussion: The design of a trial evaluating the effects of a community intervention model for frail elderly people was presented.

As a first step in developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer services than NHs.

Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility outcomes.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0148-4834			WOS:000189031100010	14974517	
J	Garg, AX; Papaioannou, A; Ferko, N; Campbell, G; Clarke, JA; Ray, JG				Garg, Amit X/G-3295-2011				Estimating the prevalence of renal insufficiency in seniors requiring long-term care								KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL				65	2			649	653		10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00412.x				FEB 2004	2004	Background. Renal function declines with age, but little is known about the extent of renal insufficiency among the institutionalized elderly. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a large sample of elderly adults living in long-term care facilities, and to compare two commonly used methods for estimating GFR.Methods. A total of 9931 residents aged 65 years and older participated in a retrospective cross-sectional study of 87 long-term care facilities in Ontario. GFR was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equations. The prevalence of low GFR, using the Cockcroft-Gault equation ( 30 mL/min), was compared with the MDRD equation (<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)).Results. A total of 17.0% (95% CI 15.6 to 18.5) of men and 14.4% (95% CI 13.6 to 15.3) of women had a serum creatinine concentration above the laboratory reported upper reference limit of normal. The prevalence of both elevated serum creatinine and low GFR were observed to increase with age (P < 0.0001). The Cockcroft-Gault equation produced a consistently lower estimate of GFR than did the MDRD equation, a discrepancy most pronounced in the oldest residents. Among all men, a low GFR was more prevalent using the Cockcroft-Gault (10.3%, 95% CI 9.2 to 11.5) than MDRD (3.5%, 95% CI 2.8 to 4.2) equation, with a similar difference also seen in women (23.3%, 95% CI 22.4 to 24.3 versus 4.0%, 95% CI 3.6 to 4.5, respectively). Of all residents whose Cockcroft-Gault estimated GFR was under 30 mL/min, 14.7% (95% CI 13.2 to 16.3) were found to have GFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) according to the MDRD equation.Conclusion. Age-associated renal impairment is common among elderly long-term care residents, but there exists a clear discrepancy between the Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD equations in predicting GFR. Consideration should be given to medication dose adjustment, based on a practical estimate of GFR. However clarification is needed about which method, if either, is most valid among the frail elderly. Complex patient and societal issues surrounding advanced care directives, treatments associated with renal insufficiency, and, if and when to initiate dialysis, require further attention.									134	1	2	0	58	1	139			0085-2538	1523-1755		WOS:000187919500032	14717937

Methods: Retrospective data were obtained from interviews and self-administered questionnaires of 56 persons who had been primary caregivers of older relatives in the last three months of their lives. Results: Results showed that informal caregivers of terminally ill older people living in the community provided a considerable amount of personal, household, and management care. Secondary informal caregivers and formal caregivers assisted resident primary caregivers less often than nonresident primary caregivers. Primary caregivers who felt less burdened, who gave personal care more intensively, and/or who were assisted by secondary caregivers, were more likely to provide informal end-of-life care at home until the time of death. Conclusions: Our study showed that informal care at the end of life of older people living in the community is complex, since the care required is considerable and highly varied, and involves assistance from secondary informal caregivers, formal home caregivers as well as institutional care. Burden of informal care is one of the most important factors associated with home death. More attention is needed to help ease the burden on informal caregivers, specifically with regard to resident caregivers and spouses. Since these resident caregivers were disadvantaged in several respects (i.e., health, income, assistance from other carers) compared to nonresident caregivers, interventions by formal caregivers should also be directed towards these persons, enabling them to bear the burden of end-of-life care.									37	0	0	0	3	0	37			0269-2163	1477-030X		WOS:000222788200009	15332425

We performed a cross-sectional study comprising 647 residents in 11 nursing homes in Sydney, Australia using the Harmful Behaviours Scale (HBS), Abbreviated Mental Test Scale and the Resident Classification Index. The Directors of Nursing completed a questionnaire that rated physical design, staff and resident characteristics and demographics were obtained from nursing home records. On regression analysis a greater number of design features for frail and residents with dementia in general, and increased security measures were associated with greater HBS total score and risk-taking and passive self-harm subscales. A residential environment in which the residents were more functionally dependent and more likely to be in a shared room, managerial policies less geared towards managing difficult behaviour and less staff availability and training were associated with the 'uncooperativeness' factor. There were no significant predictors of the other two factors. The relationship between nursing home environment and self-destructive behaviours and the environment is complex and there needs to be an individualized approach to placement.									20	0	0	0	4	1	20			1360-7863			WOS:000187415700004	14690865

The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy in identifying and describing older adults as frail.Background. Despite the dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults.Method. The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research.Conclusion. The review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the contribution of both individual and environmental factors.									204	2	0	0	41	8	211			0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000185195800013	12956670

Methods: Authors used retrospective chart review of symptoms, physician-level prescribing, and acute service use over 3 months for 2,487 physically frail older residents, including 1,8 36 with dementia, (mean age: 79.8 years) in 109 long-term care facilities, describing differences between uncomplicated dementia and three mutually exclusive subgroups of complicated dementia, including dementia with agitation-only dementia with depression only, and dementia with mixed agitation and depression. Results: Compared with the other subgroups, frail elderly patients with dementia complicated by mixed agitation and depression have the highest rate of hospitalization, the greatest number of medical diagnoses, and the greatest medical severity, and they receive the greatest number of psychiatric medications. Depression in dementia (either alone or mixed with agitation) was associated with greater prevalence of pain. Conclusions: Dementia complicated by mixed agitation and depression accounts for over one-third of complicated dementia and is associated with multiple psychiatric and medical needs, intensive pharmacological treatment, and use of high-cost services. Research should target this complex, high-risk group to develop appropriate diagnostic criteria and effective treatment interventions.									59	0	0	0	6	0	59			1064-7481			WOS:000181209900013	12611753

The relationship between physical activity and falls is complex: physical activity is a prerequisite to maintain neuromuscular functioning, necessary to keep balance and to react to a fall, but a higher level of physical activity also implies a greater exposure to environmental threats, possibly leading to a fall. Related to this greater exposure to threats, the use of a walking aid may protect against falls in those who have impaired mobility. In this cross-sectional study we investigated the relationship between daily physical activity and falls and the use of a walking aid in elderly subjects. Participants were 131 men and 563 women, aged 70 years and over (mean age and standard deviation: 82 6 years), living in homes for the elderly (n = 335) and apartment houses for elderly (n = 359). Data on baseline characteristics and falls in the previous year were obtained using a questionnaire. The level of daily physical activity in the previous year was obtained by means of a questionnaire regarding household and leisure activities. Subjects with a lower extremity fracture in the previous year were excluded from the analyses. Data were analysed using multiple logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, and residence. In the past year, 40% of the participants fell at least one time, and 19% of the participants fell two times or more. Since falls and recurrent falls were nonlinearly related to the level of daily physical activity, the physical activity score was grouped into quartiles: the highest quartile corresponding to the highest activity level. Odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for falls and recurrent falls for subjects in the highest quartile contrasted with those in the lowest quartile were 0.5 (0.3-0.9) and 0.3 (0.2-0.6), respectively. The risk of falls and recurrent falls was not lower for those with intermediate levels of daily physical activity. The use of a walking aid protected against falls in those with intermediate high activity levels (third quartile). it was suggested that the exposure to environmental hazards, due to some degree of physical activity may have been responsible for the nonlinear relationship between daily physical activity and falling. We conclude that a high activity level and the use of a walking aid may protect against falls.									67	1	0	0	16	0	68			0948-6704	1435-1269		WOS:000181614900005	12616404

Interviews were conducted with 11 older women (ten of whom are widows), nine of their family members, and six professional service providers. Maintaining the older woman's independence was identified as a major theme. While all decision participants identified it as an explicit or implicit decision-making goal, their meanings of independence were different. The older women's meanings were flexible, changing in response to changes in their physical condition and need for assistance. Adult children tended to identify their mothers as independent when they did not actually need assistance, or when they received help from other sources (e.g., home health care). Professional service providers were inclined to define independence narrowly, as avoiding nursing home placement. Minor themes associated with independence include responsibility, reciprocity, and the family's importance in maintaining independence. These themes help to clarify the complex dynamics that take place during care arrangement decisions and explain how care arrangement choices are made. (C) 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES				53	11			1407	1413		10.1176/appi.ps.53.11.1407				NOV 2002	2002	Psychiatric symptoms are common among individuals who live in nursing homes, with prevalence rates ranging from 51 percent to 94 percent. Accordingly, psychotropic, medications are widely prescribed in this setting and are the subject of considerable debate and regulation. Current regulations arose from public and governmental concerns that psychiatric medications were being prescribed inappropriately to frail patients. Concern has also been raised about the absence of evidence on which to base prescribing decisions. Nursing homes are slowly being recognized as complex health care settings that warrant considerable research attention. This article explores the origins of the regulation of the use of psychotropic drugs in nursing homes, reviews controlled trials of these drugs in nursing homes, examines the role of these agents in adverse drug events experienced by nursing home residents, and proposes policy and research areas that merit consideration.									9	0	0	0	1	1	10			1075-2730	1557-9700		WOS:000178948900012	12407268

Design and Methods: Canadian population-based, longitudinal study including community and institutional residents. From interviews and clinical examinations, 9 8 people (mean age = 86 years) were classified as demented, frail, or healthy at two points in time. Caregivers reported on the care they provided and their health outcomes. Results: Diagnostic and residential groups of care recipients differed significantly in their level of activity of daily living/instrumental activity of daily living disability (range = 0.2 problems for the healthy group, 10-12 in the dementia groups) and in the amount of assistance received; caregiver burden scores were higher for people with dementia in the community than for those in institutions (p < .001). However, these differences did not translate directly into contrasts in caregiver health. Caregivers of healthy elders reported fewer health problems than did caregivers for people with dementia or frailty, but the latter groups did not differ significantly. Death of the care recipient and admission to institutional care did not have a consistent impact on caregiver health. implications: The relationship between caregiver load and health outcomes is complex and dynamic; treatments that slow the progression of dementia will not necessarily relieve caregiver strain.									25	0	0	0	6	0	25			0016-9013	1758-5341		WOS:000178363300007	12351799

These measures are compared on the basis of six key criteria for the complex determination of inappropriate psychoactive drug use as a research variable. These six instruments/standards are examined also for their advantages and disadvantages as research tools. Based on this review and related literature, recommendations are made that future studies of inappropriate psychoactive drug use include expert clinician assessment, measures of target symptoms and functional status; physiological indicators-wherever possible, and drug and dosage classifications according to interdisciplinary consensus-based criteria.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			0002-8614			WOS:000173767600023	12028223

With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process.Aims of the paper. This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of research related to ethical practice.Conclusions. Recruitment of frail older people to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older people to research while protecting their right to refuse.									86	0	0	0	14	1	88			0309-2402			WOS:000172537600005	11737496

Although much has been written about how health professionals and family caregivers should relate to one another, we know very little about the relationships that develop between them. Using data from a qualitative study, this article illustrates that relationships between community nurses and family members caring for frail elders are complex. dynamic, and multifaceted. Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient. Each type is described, and implications for nursing practice and research are discussed.									90	0	0	0	5	2	91			0161-9268	1550-5014		WOS:000085537900008	10711807

Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level, The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care.

The prevalence was higher among women and among blacks. About one fourth of patients had 6 or more comorbid conditions; 26%, 22%, and 29% had concomitant diagnoses of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease, respectively. Seventy percent of patients were treated pharmacologically. Calcium channel blockers were the most common agents (2%), followed by diuretics (25%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (22%), and beta-blockers (8%). The relative use of these drugs changed according to the presence of other cardiovascular conditions. Adjusting for potential confounders, the relative odds of receiving antihypertensive therapy were significantly decreased for the oldest subjects (greater than or equal to 85 years old: odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.89) and those with marked impairment of physical (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.81) and cognitive (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.70) function.Conclusions: Among very old, frail hypertensive patients living in nursing homes, the pattern of treatment seems not to follow recommended guidelines; age, functional status, and comorbidity appear to be important determinants of treatment choice.									56	1	0	0	26	1	57			0003-9926			WOS:000077045600011	9827790

Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively with members of a multidisciplinary team.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0029-6465	1558-1357		WOS:000076118400012	9719696	
J	Castle, NG; Mor, V								Advance care planning in nursing homes: Pre- and post-Patient Self-Determination Act								HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH				33	1			101	124						APR 1998	1998	Objectives. (1) To identify resident and organizational factors associated with the use of advance care plans pre-and post-implementation of the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA), and (2) to identify changes (pre-and post-implementation of the PSDA) in the relationship between these factors and the use of advance care plans.Design. Complex, multistage cluster sampling.Setting. Ten states were selected for variation in geographic location, Medicaid reimbursement rate, and average staffing patterns. Participants were 4,215 nursing home residents in 268 facilities.Principal Findings. Seventeen resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders in 1990, and 12 resident and organizational factors were associated with their use in 1993. Five factors showed a significant change from 1990 to 1993: activities of daily living (ADL) scores, race, cognitive performance scale (CPS) scores, full-time equivalent (FTE) nurse aides per resident, and bed size. Ten resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of do-not-hospitalize (DNH) orders in 1990 and six resident and organizational factors were associated with DNH orders in 1993. Four factors showed a significant change from 1990 to 1993: legal guardian, FTE LPNs per resident, Medicaid census, and for-profit ownership. Five resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of living wills in 1990 and seven resident and organizational factors were associated with the use of living wills in 1993. Four factors showed a significant change from 1990 to 1993: ADL scores, race, length of stay, and for-profit ownership.Conclusion. The results indicate that the PSDA may have been successful in increasing the use of advance care plans and in changing the types of residents who use advance care plans. However, they also show that the use of advance care plans is associated with organizational characteristics, indicating that some types of facilities may be more willing and able to address the PSDA mandates.									25	0	0	0	10	1	26			0017-9124	1475-6773		WOS:000072969900008	9566180

A total of 313 frail older adults.Design.-Retrospective review of the medical record with 180 charts randomly assigned to 2 geriatricians, 2 geriatric nurse practitioners, or 1 geriatrician and 1 geriatric nurse practitioner and 133 charts randomly assigned to either a geriatrician or a geriatric nurse practitioner.Main Outcome Measures.-Interrater reliabilities for structured implicit judgments about process and outcomes for overall care and care for each of 8 tracer conditions (eg, arthritis).Results.-Outcome measures had higher interrater reliability than process measures. Five outcome measures achieved fair to good reliability (more than 0.40), while none of the process measures achieved reliabilities more than 0.40. Three factors contributed to poorer reliabilities for process measures: (1) an inability of reviewers to differentiate among cases with respect to the quality of management, (2) systematic bias from individual reviewers, and (3) systematic bias related to the professional training of the reviewer (ie, physician or nurse practitioner).Conclusions.-Peer assessments can play an important role in characterizing the quality of care for complex patients with multiple interrelated chronic conditions, but reliability can be poor. Strategies to achieve adequate reliability for these assessments should be applied. These strategies include emphasizing outcomes measurement, providing more structured assessments to identify true differences in patient management, adjusting systematic bias resulting from the individual reviewer and their professional background, and averaging scores from multiple reviewers. Future research on the reliability of peer assessments should focus on improving the ability of process measures to differentiate among cases with respect to the quality of management and on identifying additional sources of systematic bias for both process and outcome measures, Explicit recognition of factors influencing reliability will strengthen efforts to develop sound measures for quality assurance.									61	0	0	0	12	0	61			0098-7484	1538-3598		WOS:A1997YF40700037	9370502

Initially when presented with pairs of objects representing choices, choice making was validated through demonstration of an object preference. A more complex choice presentation format was then employed, involving pictures to represent choices. If the preference identified with objects was not demonstrated using pictures, a replication of the object format occurred to ensure changes in choice making using pictures was not due to a preference change. Five participants demonstrated choice-making skills using objects and two demonstrated choices using pictures. These results reflect the importance of assessing choice-making skills prior to presenting choice opportunities. Suggestions for future research focus on expanding the assessment protocol to include a wider array of choice-making skills and training staff to provide choices in a format commensurate with an individual's skill level.

The aim of this study was to compare preferences of a long-term care population with those of the general population, determine whether preferences vary by the age of the hypothetical (target) person depicted in the health-state case description, and derive weights for new symptom/problem complexes of particular relevance to frail, older individuals. A sample of 38 female and 12 male long-term care residents with an average age of 86 years was asked to rate health-state scenarios that combined the four health domains of the QWB. This sample rated quality of life 0.10 units lower on average (on a 0-1 scale) than did the general population sample from which the QWB preferences were originally developed. Ratings of the same health state for younger versus older target persons did not differ significantly (all p values > 0.05 for t statistics). Weights derived for 11 new symptom/problem complexes were: disturbed sleep (-0.252), sit-to-stand requires maximal effort (-0.259), lonely (-0.265), walking a short distance causes extreme fatigue (-0.273), agitated (-0.284), hallucinating (-0.355), incontinent (-0.359), unable to control one's behavior (-0.360), urinary catheter (-0.374), restrained in bed or chair (-0.374), and feeding tube through the nose or stomach (-0.402). These new weights increase the relevance of the QWB for cost-utility evaluations of health interventions for long-term care residents.									21	0	0	0	5	0	21			0272-989X			WOS:A1996UV24200010	8818124

J	DENNEHY, MA								HANDLE WITH CARE - CONSIDERATIONS AND APPROACHES TO NURSING THE FRAIL OLDER PERSON								TOPICS IN GERIATRIC REHABILITATION				11	2			44	54						DEC 1995	1995	As society ages, a challenge is presented to health care providers. The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0882-7524	1550-2414		WOS:A1995TF62200007		
J	EVANS, LK; YURKOW, J; SIEGLER, EL					Siegler, Eugenia/0000-0001-9449-5873			THE CARE PROGRAM - A NURSE-MANAGED COLLABORATIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE FUNCTION OF FRAIL OLDER-PEOPLE								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY				43	10			1155	1160						OCT 1995	1995	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frail older adults are especially vulnerable in a health system that is fragmented and fails to focus on preservation or restoration of function. The School of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, together with the School of Medicine and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, established the Collaborative Assessment and Rehabilitation for Elders (CARE) Program to meet the needs of this population. We used the British Day Hospital as a model because it provides a comprehensive approach to care and a bridge between acute, home-based, and institutional long-term care. We have designed our program to provide innovative, interdisciplinary care as well as to be reimbursable under current and future payment structures. This nurse-managed, collaborative practice seeks to maximize independent functioning, promote health, and enhance quality of life for chronically ill, frail older adults living in the community whose needs are left unmet by existing services. The program was certified as a Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) in December 1993 to maximize reimbursement of services through Medicare and other third party payers. With a Gerontological Nurse Practitioner as care manager, clients receive an intensive, individualized, time-limited program of nursing, rehabilitation, mental health, social, and medical services in one setting several days each week. Additional geriatric services, such as primary care, are available in the same location when needed.SETTING: The program is housed in renovated space devoted to the care of older people. The academic and clinical offices of the University of Pennsylvania's nursing and medical gerontologic and geriatric faculty are in the same building.PARTICIPANTS: We have targeted those persons older than age 65 who have complex health problems and are living at home. Individuals must need multiple services, including at least one rehabilitation therapy, and they must be unsuitable-for inpatient rehabilitation.DESCRIPTION OF THE POPULATION: In its first 8 months of operation, the program received 97 referrals and admitted 53 clients. Clients were, on average, 78 years of age. Over three-fourths (77%) were women and 58% were black. The average stay in the program was 6 weeks. FIM scores, which improved a mean of 2.4 points, were found to lack sensitivity to the functional improvements achieved by clients.CONCLUSION: Under existing Medicare and third party reimbursement policies, it is feasible to establish a nurse-managed comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation program designed to meet the needs of frail older persons. Preliminary data support the beneficial effects of the program as well as the economic feasibility of this approach.									23	0	0	0	4	0	23			0002-8614			WOS:A1995RY28500015	7560709

The nursing home provides an opportunity for highly effective drug use, but it also presents risks for polypharmacy and adverse events. Nursing homes are complex social institutions, in which physicians, nurses, consultant pharmacists, other health care professionals, aides, and administrators must interact to make decisions about drug use for patients who generally are frail and have numerous comorbid conditions. Federal regulations have recently been implemented to direct the ways in which specific drugs are to be used in this setting. The nursing home environment can present an ideal opportunity for comprehensive drug regimen review, an exercise too often neglected in the care of elderly patients in all clinical settings. Psychoactive medications, analgesics, and laxatives are examples of drugs that should receive such review. The possible underuse of drug therapies that may be beneficial to nursing home residents, including antidepressant, antihypertensive, and antithrombotic agents; calcium supplements; and vaccines, must be further quantified and must receive increased attention. Morbidity and functional incapacity can be substantially reduced by applying currently established principles of geriatric pharmacology in the nursing home setting, but enormous gaps still exist in the knowledge base necessary to guide this aspect of geriatric medical practice. Data on the efficacy, toxicity, and cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapeutic choices in nursing home patients are in short supply; considerably more clinical and epidemiologic research is needed to define the relations between the benefits and risks of drugs for this unique population.									133	0	0	0	66	0	133			0003-4819	1539-3704		WOS:A1995RL10400007	7598302

There are few studies that document the outcomes experienced by very old patients who undergo major surgery.Methods. This is a case series and 7-year follow-up of 116 consecutive patients who were aged 90 years or older and underwent major surgery at a large university-affiliated community hospital. We describe the functional status, short- and long-term mortality, and predictors of mortality in this group of frail elders.Results. The 116 nonagenarians in this study underwent 134 major operations. Sixty-three patients were admitted to the hospital from a nursing home. The most common surgical procedures were for hip fracture, lower extremity amputation, and abdominal problems. Nineteen patients died in the hospital following surgery, and 23 patients died within 30 days of operation. Follow-up at 7 years revealed that all but three patients had died. Survival was worse for patients admitted from nursing homes, those who were nonambulatory before surgery, and those with major or complete functional impairment.Conclusions. Major surgery in nonagenarians is associated with a 20% perioperative mortality. Functional status and ambulatory ability are maintained in most patients. Whether to operate on these frail elders is a complex decision.									35	0	0	0	16	1	36			0094-3509			WOS:A1995QG51200010	7852934

Dentists should be prepared to manage the oral health needs of elderly clients who are afflicted with complex medical, functional, and dental disabilities. Proper dental management requires a commitment to provide treatment of quality despite myriad obstacles. From the outset of evaluation, there must be recognition of the likelihood of compromised self-care and the development of proactive strategies to address dependence in oral care.

Using McKeehan & Coulton's systems model, this critique reviews the evolution of the structure and processes of discharge planning programmes. It explores three common assumptions: discharge planning programmes are cost-effective, allow for enhancement of patients' and families' quality of life, and ensure continuity of care between hospital and community. Funds are saved due to decreased lengths of initial hospital admissions and readmission rates. However, the cost of additional hospital and community resources is rarely considered. Little evidence supports the concept that discharge planning directly affects a patient's health status. Patients and families often do not perceive the same level of benefit from discharge planning as do health professionals. Several issues surrounding research methodologies used in the reviewed studies are identified. Of particular concern is the lack of qualitative research into patients' and families' experiences. The critique concludes with an exploration of ethical issues and challenges arising from increased emphasis on cost-effective discharge planning. These include patients' rights, provision of sufficient human, social and financial resources, improved hospital-community communications, and control over hospital-developed but community-implemented programmes.									26	0	0	0	0	1	26			0309-2402			WOS:A1994NB47100012	8014310

Delayed transfer may lead to poor outcomes. However, inappropriate transfer of the frail elderly may cause social and financial problems. We prospectively evaluated 221 consecutive ambulance transfers from community nursing homes to a VA emergency department. The objectives of the study were to describe the process and outcomes of transferred patients and to determine if alternative interventions were feasible. The results indicate that the problems of nearly half the study group could have been treated at the nursing home by a visiting physician with minimal medical equipment. Those admitted to the hospital (52%) were seriously ill, had prolonged lengths of stay (23.6 days), and had a high mortality rate (11%). Complex issues of physician reimbursement, proprietary nursing home budgeting, and day-to-day expediency appear to be involved in decisions to transport patients by ambulance to VA emergency departments.									65	0	0	0	31	0	65			0002-8614			WOS:A1991EX54800003	1991944
