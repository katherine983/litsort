The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation fidelity of the SPEC intervention and to identify moderating factors that influence the implementation fidelity. Methods: This study was a process evaluation based on an evidence-based framework for implementation fidelity using a mixed-methods design. Quantitative data from consultant logbooks, NH documentations, an information and communications technology (ICT) system, and a standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to December 2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics. Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary teams from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a semi-structured questionnaire and the focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Results: The SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and adherence to the SPEC program was strong in all aspects, such as content, coverage, frequency, and duration. Of the participating on-site coordinators, 60% reported that the SPEC model positively impacted needs assessment and the reporting system for resident care. The important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies, assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good implementation fidelity. The key factors of good implementation fidelity were tailored delivery of evidence-based interventions over process evaluation work, facilitating strategies, and ICT support. Larger implementation studies with a more user-friendly ICT system are recommended.

Impact of Social Frailty on Relocation of Older Adults	JOURNAL OF FRAILTY & AGING			English	Article; Early Access						Social frailty; relocation; social support; community; official language minority	HEALTH	Background: The relationship between frailty and variables such as housing are the least included in models of frailty and research on frailty or social frailty and relocation is negligible. The decision to relocate is complex and demanding for older adults with a loss of independence but little is known about what makes older adults relocate to congregated housing designated for older adults, let alone in combination with social frailty, and how they navigate this transition. Objectives: This mixed method descriptive study aims to understand the influence of social frailty for a population of French-speaking semi-independent older adults relocating to a housing continuum community. Design: Semi-structured individual interviews including sociodemographic data and the PRISMA-7 Frailty Scale were conducted with recently relocated older adults. Setting: A newly opened French-speaking housing continuum community in Eastern Canada that offers luxury apartments for independent older adults, two assisted living facilities for semi-independent older adults along with a long-term care facility. Participants: Twenty-nine older adults with a mean age of 85 years, mostly female, married or widowed and highly educated. Measurements Content analysis of the transcribed recorded interviews and descriptive statistical analyses to examine relationships between the frailty PRISMA-7 scale, answers to additional questions and the sociodemographic data. Results: There was not a significant difference in the scores for socialization before and after relocation nor between prior help and current help; however, there was a significant negative correlation between help and socialization before and after relocation. Three main themes included: imposed influences, push and pull factors and post relocation. Conclusions: The results indicate that several social factors contributed to relocation and that participants were experiencing social frailty. Participants were at the crossover point of being vulnerable to experiencing additional deficits which would potentially have led to higher frailty had they not relocated.

A New Approach to the Identification of Palliative Care Needs and Advanced Chronic Patients among Nursing Home Residents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						palliative care; chronic patient; nursing homes; palliative needs; elderly; residents; advanced chronicity; frailty; complexity; prognosis		Background: Proper planning of Palliative Care in nursing homes requires advanced knowledge of the care needs that residents show. The aim of the study was to evaluate Palliative Needs and other conditions such as fragility, complexity, and prognosis and also to suggest new indicators for the establishment of the resident's advanced chronic condition. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 149 nursing homes Complex Chronic residents evaluated by trained professionals. Palliative Care Needs, assessed by the NECPAL ICO-CCOMS (c) tool, and fragility, case and palliative complexity and prognosis were evaluate through a comprehensive assessment. Descriptive analyses and association measures were performed setting the statistical significance at 0.05. Results: More than 50% of the residents had positive Surprise Question and other Palliative Needs and were classified as Advanced Chronic Patients. Distress and/or Severe Adaptative Disorder was the most frequent need shown by the residents and significant differences in levels of frailty and other characteristics, were found between the Positive and the Negative Surprise Question Groups. Statistically significant correlations were also found between aspects of both groups. Conclusions: Nursing homes residents show Palliative Needs regardless of the response to the Surprise Question of the NECPAL tool. Other characteristics such as presence of an intermediate level of frailty are suggested as a new perspective to identify advanced chronic patients among nursing homes residents.

Research demonstrates that ADC staff have the capacity to leverage their culturally and socially congruent relationships with clients and caregivers, to deliver evidence-based interventions that improve health outcomes. Yet, they remain a largely overlooked neighborhood resource for older adults with complex health care needs. The National Adult Day Services Association (NADSA) created a multistakeholder work group to identify priority areas for research to enhance the quality of services offered in ADCs and the delivery of evidence-based practices to clients. This perspective piece, which presents the workgroup's findings in the form of key research priorities, is intended as practical guide for researchers seeking to align their research questions with the needs of ADCs and those they serve. In addition to identifying areas of further exploration, we discuss current studies being undertaken within the ADC setting.

J	Archibald, M; Blines, J				Archibald, Mandy; Blines, John			Metaphors in the Making: Illuminating the Process of Arts-Based Health Research Through a Case Exemplar Linking Arts-Based, Qualitative and Quantitative Research Data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS			English	Article						arts based methods; case study; focus groups; interpretive description; methods in qualitative inquiry; mixed methods; arts-based knowledge translation; arts-based research		Background: The potentials of arts-based health research are increasingly being realized as an approach to understanding and communicating the complexities of the human experience of health and illness. Despite this, arts-based health research often remains shrouded in obscurity, limiting its potential utility. Arts-based health research offers unique opportunities to integrate evidence of patients' lived experience with other forms of research evidence to improve understanding and knowledge translation, but transparent descriptions of this praxis are generally lacking. In response, this article offers methodological insight and guidance through an in-depth case exemplar of an arts-based health research process linking qualitative research with diverse evidence sources in the context of frailty research. Methods: Responding to research data generated within a Centre of Research Excellence in Frailty and Healthy Ageing, we adopted a researcher-as-practitioner stance to produce research-based artworks to integrate and communicate conflicting research findings. We structure this process according to Ecker's seven domains of qualitative inquiry, demonstrating parallels between the arts-based research and qualitative inquiry processes and offering opportunities for engaging with "evidence misalignments" resulting from incongruent evidence sources. Findings: Arts-based health research can enable meaningful reflection upon, integration, and communication of "evidence-misalignments" in research spanning the health and social sciences. Such misalignments are problematic when the lived experience of health and illness conflicts with other empirical evidence, including gold standard evidence guiding treatment decisions. These in turn, can function as plausible barriers to self management and to achievement of health outcomes. Interpretation: Through the researcher-as-practitioner lens, and with an orientation to production, this work engaged with a new means of materiality-one that extends beyond text and numerical representations-and whose meaning and connections may not be immediately apparent. These relationships change how the researchers-practitioner engages with, understands, explores, and represents concepts, enabling epistemological and ontological gains of benefit to the health and social sciences.

The Cardiac Care Bridge randomized trial in high-risk older cardiac patients: A mixed-methods process evaluation	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						cardiology; caregivers; frailty; nurses; midwives; nursing; process assessment; qualitative research; transitional care		Aim To evaluate healthcare professionals' performance and treatment fidelity in the Cardiac Care Bridge (CCB) nurse-coordinated transitional care intervention in older cardiac patients to understand and interpret the study results. Design A mixed-methods process evaluation based on the Medical Research Council Process Evaluation framework. Methods Quantitative data on intervention key elements were collected from 153 logbooks of all intervention patients. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 CCB professionals (cardiac nurses, community nurses and primary care physical therapists), from June 2017 until October 2018. Qualitative data-analysis is based on thematic analysis and integrated with quantitative key element outcomes. The analysis was blinded to trial outcomes. Fidelity was defined as the level of intervention adherence. Results The overall intervention fidelity was 67%, ranging from severely low fidelity in the consultation of in-hospital geriatric teams (17%) to maximum fidelity in the comprehensive geriatric assessment (100%). Main themes of influence in the intervention performance that emerged from the interviews are interdisciplinary collaboration, organizational preconditions, confidence in the programme, time management and patient characteristics. In addition to practical issues, the patient's frailty status and limited motivation were barriers to the intervention. Conclusion Although involved healthcare professionals expressed their confidence in the intervention, the fidelity rate was suboptimal. This could have influenced the non-significant effect of the CCB intervention on the primary composite outcome of readmission and mortality 6 months after randomization. Feasibility of intervention key elements should be reconsidered in relation to experienced barriers and the population. Impact In addition to insight in effectiveness, insight in intervention fidelity and performance is necessary to understand the mechanism of impact. This study demonstrates that the suboptimal fidelity was subject to a complex interplay of organizational, professionals' and patients' issues. The results support intervention redesign and inform future development of transitional care interventions in older cardiac patients.	[Verweij, Lotte; Jepma, Patricia; Peters, Ron J.

Due to its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in their own environment. Implications for practice: This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.

S.			Transitional care from skilled nursing facilities to home: study protocol for a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Transitional care; Skilled nursing facilities; Patient discharge; Caregivers; Aging; Frailty		Background Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. Methods The study will test the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden and distress. Discussion Study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications.

The hippocampus is a complex, heterogeneous structure closely relates to the cognitive impairment in elderly which is composed of 12 subregions. Atrophy of these subregions has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the changes in hippocampal subregions in older adults with cognitive frailty and the relationship between subregions and cognitive impairment as well as physical frailty. Methods Twenty-six older adults with cognitive frailty and 26 matched healthy controls were included in this study. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (Fuzhou version) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Chinese version (WMS-RC), while physical frailty was tested with the Chinese version of the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS) and grip strength. The volume of the hippocampal subregions was measured with structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Partial correlation analysis was carried out between the volumes of hippocampal subregions and MoCA scores, Wechsler's Memory Quotient and physical frailty indexes. Results A significant volume decrease was found in six hippocampal subregions, including the bilateral presubiculum, the left parasubiculum, molecular layer of the hippocampus proper (molecular layer of the HP), and hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA), and the right cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) area, in older adults with cognitive frailty, while the proportion of brain parenchyma and total number of white matter fibers were lower than those in the healthy controls. Positive correlations were found between Wechsler's Memory Quotient and the size of the left molecular layer of the HP and HATA and the right presubiculum. The sizes of the left presubiculum, molecular of the layer HP, and HATA and right CA1 and presubiculum were found to be positively correlated with MoCA score. The sizes of the left parasubiculum, molecular layer of the HP and HATA were found to be negatively correlated with the physical frailty index. Conclusion Significant volume decrease occurs in hippocampal subregions of older adults with cognitive frailty, and these changes are correlated with cognitive impairment and physical frailty. Therefore, the atrophy of hippocampal subregions could participate in the pathological progression of cognitive frailty.

However, attracting, recruiting and retaining staff is one of the biggest challenges facing this sector. There is evidence available that describes factors that influence staff decisions to join and/or remain in the care home workforce, for example, individual rewards (such as feeling valued at work or training opportunities), relationships with colleagues and residents, supportive management or working arrangements (including flexible hours). However, it is less clear how different strategies are informed by evidence to improve recruitment and retention. Care homes are heterogeneous in terms of their size, staffing levels and mix, staff age groups, geographical location and working conditions. What matters to different members of the care home workforce will vary across nurses and care workers of different ages and levels of qualification or experience. Recognising this diversity is key: understanding how to attract, recruit and retain staff needs to discriminate and offer solutions that address this diversity. This important area of practice does not lend itself to a 'one-approach-fits-all' solution. This commentary provides a brief overview of known workforce challenges for the care home sector and argues for studies that use empirical evidence to test different theories of what might work for different staff, how and why, and in different circumstances.

For older people, complex chronic health conditions and frailty can lead to a cascade of repeated hospitalisations and further decline. Existing solutions are fragmented and not person centred. The proposed Being Your Best programme integrates care across hospital and community settings to address symptoms of frailty. Methods and analysis A multicentre pragmatic mixed methods study aiming to recruit 80 community-dwelling patients aged >= 65 years recently discharged from hospital. Being Your Best is a codesigned 6-month programme that provides referral and linkage with existing services comprising four modules to prevent or mitigate symptoms of physical, nutritional, cognitive and social frailty. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of recruitment, acceptability of the intervention to participants and level of retention in the programme. Changes in frailty (Modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), functional ability (Barthel and Lawton), loneliness (University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-3 items) and nutrition (Malnutrition Screening Tool) will also be measured at 6 and 12 months. Ethics and dissemination The study has received approval from Monash Health Human Research Ethics Committee (RES-19-0000904L). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference and seminar presentations.

Nurses have to decide on care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.

We used a narrative approach to explore the role that narrative may have for people living with frailty. This has been less explored comparative to the experiences of those living with chronic illness. The frail older people told stories of their experiences that revealed three distinct shapes or typologies. These were either stable, unbalancing or overwhelmed, and related to how the person managed to adapt to increasing challenges and losses, and to reintegrate their sense of self into a cohesive narrative. Each is illustrated by an individual case story. Frailty is described as both biographically anticipated yet potentially biographically disruptive as older people may struggle to make sense of their circumstances without a clear single causative factor. Findings are discussed in relation to biographical disruption and reconstruction in chronic illness and the rhetoric around 'successful ageing'. We conclude by drawing attention to the complex individual and social factors that contribute to the experience of living with frailty in later life.

Transcending human frailties with technological enhancements and replacements: Transhumanist perspective in nursing and healthcare	NURSING INQUIRY			English	Article						artificial intelligence; caring in nursing; human frailties; nursing technologies; technological competency as caring in nursing; transcendence; TRETON	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; ROBOTS; MEDICINE; REALITY; IMPACT	As human beings age, they become weak, fragile, and feeble. It is a slowly progressing yet complex syndrome in which old age or some disabilities are not prerequisites; neither does loss of human parts lead to frailty among the physically fit older persons. This paper aims to describe the influences of transhumanist perspectives on human-technology enhancements and replacements in the transcendence of human frailties, including those of older persons, in which technology is projected to deliver solutions toward transcending these frailties. Through technologies including genetic screening and other technological manipulations, intelligent machines and augmented humans improve, maintain, and remedy human-linked susceptibilities. Furthermore, other technologies replace parts fabricated through inorganic-mechanical processes such as 3D-printing. Advancing technologies are reaching the summit of technological sophistication contributing to the transhumanist views of being human in a technological world. Technologies enhance the transcendence of human frailties as essential expressions of the symbiosis between human beings and technology in a transcendental world.

Design A qualitative descriptive study design was used. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. Results The participants described the use or non-use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a "legitimation process". This process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at which to start using it. During this process, each person weighs her or his "ageing self" and "perception of technology" then decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use. "Critical events" initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance. Conclusion The legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life. Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex decision-making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the device. Impact Older persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their independence.

We highlight the complex situation when an elderly woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system.MethodsA descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is explored in the discussion.ResultsThe latent content analysis of the daughter's story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women recovers quickly.ConclusionThe healthcare system should embrace the complexity in the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage "correctly" for later placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption of complexity.

Our aim is to examine whether the relationship between dysphagia and adverse health outcomes differs by frailty conditions among inpatients >= 50 years of age. Medical or surgical hospitalizations among patients >= 50 years of age in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample from 2014 through the first three quarters of 2015 were included. Adverse outcomes included length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, in-hospital mortality, discharge status, and medical complications. Dysphagia was determined by ICD-9-CM codes. Frailty was defined as (a) >= 1 condition in the10-item Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) frailty measure and a frailty index for the (b) ACG and (c) a 19-item Frailty Risk Score (FRS) categorized as non-frail, pre-frail, and frail. Weighted generalized linear models for complex survey designs using generalized estimating equations were performed. Of 6,230,114 unweighted hospitalizations, 4.0% had a dysphagia diagnosis. Dysphagia presented in 3.1% and 11.0% of non-frail and frail hospitalizations using the binary ACG (p < 0.001) and in 2.9%, 7.9%, and 16.0% of non-frail, pre-frail, and frail hospitalizations using the indexed FRS (p < 0.001). Dysphagia was associated with greater LOS, higher total costs, increased non-routine discharges, and more medical complications among both frail and non-frail patients using the three frailty definitions. Dysphagia was associated with adverse outcomes in both frail and non-frail medical or surgical hospitalizations. Dysphagia management is an important consideration for providers seeking to reduce risk in vulnerable populations.

The Current State of HIV and Aging: Findings Presented at the 10th International Workshop on HIV and Aging	AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES			English	Article						HIV; aging; comorbidities; multidisciplinary	OLDER-ADULTS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; SOCIAL-ISOLATION; UNITED-STATES; FRAILTY; LONELINESS; INFLAMMATION; MORTALITY; COAGULATION; INFECTION	With increasing effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, people with HIV (PWH) are living longer and the prevalence of older PWH continues to increase. Accordingly, PWH are experiencing an increased burden of age-related comorbidities. With this shifting demographics, clinicians and researchers face additional challenges in how to identify, address, and manage the complex intersections of HIV- and aging-related conditions. Established in 2009, the International Workshop on HIV and Aging brings together clinicians and researchers in cross-disciplinary fields along with community advocates and PWH to address the multidisciplinary nature of HIV and aging. This article summarizes plenary talks from the 10th Annual International Workshop on HIV and Aging, which took place in New York City on October 10 and 11, 2019. Presentation topics included the following: the burdens of HIV-associated comorbidities, aging phenotypes, community engagement, and loneliness; these issues are especially important for older PWH, considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss broad questions and potential directions for future research necessary to better understand the interaction between HIV and aging.

This study captured the service gap where these non-frail older patients might have no specific medical problem upon discharge but they might encounter residual health and social issues when returning home. Methods: Discharged community-dwelling non-frail older adults from an emergency medical ward were recruited and randomized into either intervention (n = 37) or control (n = 38) group. The intervention group received a 12-week complex interventions that included structured assessment, health education, goal empowerment, and care coordination supported by a health-social team. The control group received usual discharge care and monthly social call. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Secondary outcomes included activities of daily living (ADL), the presence of depressive symptoms, and the use of health services. The outcomes were measured at pre-intervention (T1) and at three months post-intervention (T2). The independent t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the group differences in HRQoL, ADL, and presence of depressive symptoms according to the normality of data. Results: Analysis showed that the intervention group experienced a statistically significantly improvement in the mental component scale of quality of life (p = .036), activities of daily living (p = .005), and presence of depressive symptoms (p = .035) at T2 compared with at T1. No significant differences were found in the control group. Conclusions: Supporting self-care is necessary to enable community-dwelling non-frail older adults to be independent to the fullest extent possible in the community. The promising results found in this pilot study suggested that the integration of the health-social partnership into transitional care practice is effective and can be sustained in the community. Future studies can draw on these findings and maximize the integrated care quality during the transition phase.

The chronicity care model deeply affects the quality of life and degree of dependence. Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyse the perceived quality of life and dependence degree in complex chronic patients within a chronicity care model in the Autonomous Communities of Cantabria and the Balearic Islands (Spain). Design: This was a multicentred, transversal, descriptive, and observational study on a cohort of 206 chronic patients included in a chronicity care program. Methods: Patients' sociodemographic variables, integral valuation, nurse follow-up records, nursing outcomes classification (NOC)/nursing interventions classification (NIC), nurse diagnoses, and hospitalization data were analysed. A descriptive analysis of all data was carried out. The bivariate analysis assessed the relation between covariables and the overall scoring in European Quality of Life Scale (EuroQuol-5D), Barthel, Braden, and Chronic Patient eXperience Assessment Instrument (IEXPAC in the Spanish abbreviation). A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted. Results: The mean age was 79.4 years (standard deviation (SD) = 9.12; range: 39-94). A percentage of 79.3% of the study population shows functional impairment in one or more activities of daily life. A percentage of 83.3% of patients showed a physical dependence. There is a significant relationship between the gender and kinship degree of the caregiver (chi(2) = 18.2; p = 0.001). An overall mean score of 55.38 points in EuroQuol-5D was obtained, along with a 36.87-point satisfaction with the care given in IEXPAC. The overall score correlated positively and significantly with Barthel, Braden, and IEXPAC. The dependence levels improved slightly in the observed patients, which was a very significant outcome in statistical terms (t = 2.08; p = 0.039). A percentage of 66% (R-2 = 0.66) of the score variability at the Barthel index could be predicted from Braden scale scoring. Conclusions: Dependence is not only affected by the related pathology, but also by the effect on mobility and daily-life activities, which cause a worse perception of the quality of life. The health-care model based on the case management nurse is having positive effects, especially on dependence and patients with ulcer issues.

We developed the Participation Enabling CAre in Nursing (PECAN) intervention, a complex intervention to enable nurses to promote participation in nursing home residents with joint contractures. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of the implementation strategy and to identify enablers and barriers for a successful implementation.MethodsThe implementation of PECAN was investigated in a 6-month pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial (c-RCT). As a key component of the implementation strategy, nominated nurses were trained as facilitators in a one-day workshop and supported by peer-mentoring (visit, telephone counselling). A mixed-methods approach was conducted in conjunction with the pilot trial and guided by a framework for process evaluations of c-RCTs. Data were collected using standardised questionnaires (nursing staff), documentation forms, problem-centred qualitative interviews (facilitators, therapists, social workers, relatives, peer-mentors), and a group discussion (facilitators). A set of predefined criteria on the nursing home level was examined. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using directed content analysis.ResultsSeven nursing homes (n =4 intervention groups, n =3 control groups) in two regions of Germany took part in the study. Facilitators responded well to the qualification measures (workshop participation: 14/14; workshop rating: "good"; peer-mentor visit participation: 10/14). The usage of peer-mentoring via telephone varied (one to seven contacts per nursing home). Our implementation strategy was not successful in connection with supplying the intervention to all the nurses. The clear commitment of the entire nursing home and the respect for the expertise of different healthcare professionals were emphasised as enablers, whereas a lack of impact on organisational conditions and routines and a lack of time and staff competence were mentioned as barriers.ConclusionThe PECAN intervention was delivered as planned to the facilitators but was unable to produce comprehensive changes in the nursing homes and subsequently for the residents. Strategies to systematically include the management and the nursing team from the beginning are needed to support the facilitators during implementation in the main trial.Trial registrationGerman clinical trials register, DRKS00010037.

While the recent FDA-mandated cardiovascular outcome trials offer a wealth of data to inform treatment discussions, they have also contributed to increasing complexity in treatment decisions, and in the guidelines that seek to assist in making these decisions. To assist physicians in avoiding treatment inertia, Primary Care Diabetes Europe has formulated a position statement that summarises our current understanding of the available T2DM treatment options in various patient populations. New data from recent outcomes trials is contextualised and summarised for the primary care physician. This consensus paper also proposes a unique and simple tool to stratify patients into 'very high' and 'high' cardiovascular risk categories and outlines treatment recommendations for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Special consideration is given to elderly/frail patients and those with obesity. A visual patient assessment tool is provided, and a comprehensive set of prescribing tips is presented for all available classes of glucose-lowering therapies. This position statement will complement the already available, often specialist-focused, T2DM treatment guidelines and provide greater direction in how the wealth of outcome trial data can be applied to everyday practice.

J	Aldridge, Z; Oliver, E; Gardener, H; Dening, KH				Aldridge, Zena; Oliver, Emily; Gardener, Hannah; Dening, Karen Harrison			Admiral Nursing-A Model of Specialist Dementia Care in Acute Hospitals	SAGE OPEN NURSING			English	Article						acute hospital; dementia; admiral nursing; specialist nursing	PEOPLE; PREVALENCE; COMORBIDITIES; FRAILTY; COHORT	Introduction: The rising prevalence of dementia has led to increased numbers of people with dementia being admitted to acute hospitals. This demand is set to continue due to an increasingly older population who are likely to have higher levels of dependency, dementia, and comorbidity. If admitted to the hospital, people with dementia are at higher risk of poor outcomes during and following a hospital admission. Yet, there remains a significant lack of specialist support within acute hospitals to support people with dementia, their families and hospital staff. Methods: Admiral Nurses are specialists that work with families affected by dementia and provide consultancy and support to health and social care colleagues to improve the delivery of evidenced based dementia care. Historically, Admiral Nurses have predominantly been based in community settings. In response to the increasing fragmentation of services across the dementia trajectory, the Admiral Nurse model is evolving and adapting to meet the complex needs of families impacted upon by dementia inclusive of acute hospital care. Results: The Admiral Nurse acute hospital model provides specialist interventions which improve staff confidence and competence and enables positive change by improving skills and knowledge in the provision of person-centred dementia care. The role has the capacity to address some of the barriers to delivering person centred dementia care in the acute hospital and contribute to improvements across the hospital both as a result of direct interventions or influencing the practice of others. Conclusion: Improving services for people with dementia and their families requires a whole system approach to enable care coordination and service integration, this must include acute hospital care. The increasing numbers of people with dementia in hospitals, and the detrimental effects of admission, make providing equitable, consistent, safe, quality care and support to people with dementia and their families a national priority requiring immediate investment. The inclusion of Admiral Nursing within acute hospital services supports service and quality improvement which positively impacts upon the experience and outcomes for families affected by dementia.

The modified Norton scale was used to assess PU risk, with a score of <= 20 indicating presence of risk. A research questionnaire was used to document prevention and treatment. Follow-up was performed after six months, during September 2017. The same research questionnaire was used to capture the current situation of the patients, including ulcer healing, frequency of amputation, and mortality rate. Results: Screening covered 464 patients: 303 hospitalised, 68 in community care, and 93 in primary care. A total of 110 patients-55 at risk of PU and 55 with PUs, the majority of which were category 2-4 PUs-were included in the study. At follow-up, 67% were treated in community care, 32% in primary care, and 1% in hospital. Mortality rate for patients with PUs was 44%. Of the remaining 31 patients, 17 had unhealed PUs, 10 had healed PUs, two had undergone amputation, and complete follow-up data was missing in the remaining two patients. Conclusion: These results reflect the complex situation of an aged and frail patient group, including a lack of preventive measures and follow-up routines in community and primary care.

It is therefore crucial to deploy strategies that promote continuous adjustment to these barriers so as to improve the benefits of integrating care. Measuring the implementation and effects of integrated care models are key component of these strategies. However, measuring integrated care also faces major challenges. This study aims to identify and characterise integrated care measurement challenges. Methods: A review of reviews on the measurement of integrated care identified 12 papers. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify and categorize measurement challenges. Document analysis was done on the measurement of an integrated care model for older adults in Quebec. Results: Eight categories of measurement challenges were identified. These challenges include difficulties in measuring structures, processes, and effects of models; conceptual ambiguity and heterogeneity of organisational forms; involving multiple actors in the measurement strategy; and including multiple data sources, amongst others. These challenges revealed and explained potential gaps in the measurement of integrated care for older adults in Quebec. For instance, the Quebec measurement strategy did not include effects indicators. Conclusion: Although the measurement of integrated care is a complex endeavour, there is a need for adequate measurement strategies that allow to appreciate important elements of integrate care. The findings of this study could be used as a reflexive tool in advancing research and practice of measuring integrated care.

Design: A phenomenological inquiry inspired by Reflective Lifeworld Research. Method: Semi-structured lifeworld interviews with 11 persons aged 80+ years were conducted following their discharge. The interviews lasted 35-83 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Both interviews and the analysis followed the epistemological and methodological principles of Reflective Lifeworld Research. Findings: We identified the essential meaning 'It means everything' and four constituents illuminating different aspects inherent in the complex phenomenon of caring responsibility; 'A life-constraining transition,' 'Trusting the children to fill the gaps and be the glue,' 'Tacit responsibility, agreement and acceptance' and 'Depending on the children and knowing they are burdened by you.' Conclusions: Caring responsibility is based on a trusting relationship and tacit agreements indicating an understanding of interdependence and acceptance of dependence on adult children. However, a paradox appears when older persons express a deep-rooted perception of autonomy and independence as they have difficulties with their growing dependency and feelings of being burdensome. Older persons try to balance the continuum of autonomy, their existential self-image and actual capability. The practical part of caring responsibility seems to dominate and strongly affect the parent-child relationship because the child needs to take care of practical issues related to healthcare management and instrumental activities of daily living, leaving less time for meaningful togetherness. Implications for practice: Older persons want their adult children to be involved and acknowledged when planning care and treatment because they often seem to serve as the 'glue' that makes it possible for the parent to remain in his/her own home.

J	Vatnoy, TK; Skinner, MS; Karlsen, TI; Dale, B				Vatnoy, Torunn Kitty; Sundlisaeter Skinner, Marianne; Karlsen, Tor-Ivar; Dale, Bjorg			Nursing competence in municipal in-patient acute care in Norway: a cross-sectional study	BMC NURSING			English	Article						Acute care; Advanced practice nursing; Municipal health services; Older adults; Primary health care; Survey	PATIENT SAFETY OUTCOMES; OLDER-PEOPLE; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; NURSES; FRAILTY; IMPACT	Background The primary health care services are becoming increasingly complex, which presents challenges for the municipal nursing services. In Norway, municipal in-patient acute care (MipAC) has been introduced in all municipalities, and the competence at the services has been questioned. Few studies have examined the nursing services in the units. This study aims to get an overview of the nursing competence in those units across geographical regions, and different groups of organisation and localisation. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted, and an ad hoc questionnaire was distributed to first-line leaders in all the MipAC units in Norway. Data were collected in the period between 6 March 2019 to 6 June 2019. Measures to get an overview of the nursing competence were ratio of registered nurses (RNs) in staff, count of shifts with only one RN on duty and count of RNs with master's degrees/specialisation. Descriptive comparative statistics were used. Results Of all 226 first-line leaders invited to participate, 207 (91.6%) responded to the questionnaire. Overall a considerable variance across the sample was revealed. The median ratio of RNs in staff was 56 (IQR = 40-70), the count of shifts with only one RN on duty median 28 (IQR = 5-49), and the count of RNs with a master's degree or specialisation median 3 (IQR = 0-5). The regions of Northern and Central Norway, MipACs located in nursing home and MipACs organised at long-term care units, showed significantly lower nursing competence in staff compared to the remaining institution and organisations. Conclusion This study generates knowledge that can inform planning, priorities and interventions that may be initiated at all organisational and political levels concerning the MipAC services. An overall conclusion is that advanced nursing competence is lacking. The study also highlights the most urgent direction for improvements regarding nursing competence in the services. It seemed to be MipACs in Northern and Central Norway, and those located at nursing homes organised together with long-term care units, that needed improvements the most.

Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.

Validation of the "Doorbell Test": A Novel Functional Test of Frailty and Clinical Status After Acute Decompensated Heart Failure	HEART LUNG AND CIRCULATION			English	Article						Acute Decompensated Heart Failure; Chronic Heart Failure; Functional test	6-MINUTE WALK; READMISSION; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; RISK; REHOSPITALIZATION; HOSPITALIZATIONS; PREVALENCE; DISCHARGE; SURVIVAL	Background Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) carries a high event rate following discharge. The complex interplay between age, frailty and decongestion may lend itself to a functional test. Methods In the doorbell test the patient simulates answering the doorbell. They are timed rising from a recumbent position, bending over twice and walking 10 metres, this time is added to the change in respiratory rate. We aimed to determine if the doorbell test was associated with post ADHF events (death or readmission). The test was performed at hospital discharge, with follow up at 30-days and 1-year. Results In 74 patients at 30-days there was a 14% event rate. At 1-year there were 40 (54%) events (9 deaths and 31 readmissions, 28 were cardiovascular of which 14 were [heart failure] HF). Amongst those who had an event at 30-days only doorbell test scores were different (58 [36,72] vs 32 [26,53] p < 0.05). One-year (1-year) events were associated with doorbell test scores (47 [29,62] vs 30 [26,42] p < 0.05), body weight (78 kg [68,94] vs 95 [76,105] (p < 0.05), creatinine (134 mmol/L [114, 173] vs 99 [82, 133] p < 0.01) and age (76 years [61,86] vs 67 [53, 73] p < 0.01). Heart failure readmissions were associated with doorbell test scores (56 [46,68] vs 30 [26,47] p < 0.001). Death was associated with body weight (74 kg [69,81] vs 88 [72,101] p < 0.05) and age (83 years [78,86] vs 69 [55,77] p < 0.01). After age stratification, the hazard ratio for heart failure readmission associated with a high doorbell test score was 11.08 (95%C.I. 2.01-61.17 p = 0.006), while the hazard ratio for 1-year cardiovascular readmission was 4.62 (95%C.I. 1.71-12.51 p = 0.003). There was no association with 1-year mortality. Conclusion The doorbell test represents a novel test of multiple domains of the ADHF pre-discharge state and demonstrates an association with 30-day and 1-year rehospitalisation.

Background Older people with aged natural dentition require preventive and curative oral health care. An intervention based on principles of situated learning was implemented to establish closer cooperation between dental and nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to improved oral hygiene in nursing home residents. Design An embedded multiple-case study combined with principles of realist evaluation unfolded in three phases: Formulation of initial programme theory, Testing and Refining the programme theory. The COREQ checklist is followed in reporting. Methods Observations, six group interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with dentists, dental practitioners, nursing home managers, care professionals and residents were conducted in three nursing homes (n = 41). Results Three main outcomes of a programme theory were identified, relating to (a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) interdisciplinary working, in the form of professional pride in performing sufficient oral care; (c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the creation of relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care professionals as well as nursing home management taking responsibility for structure, planning and knowledge sharing. Conclusion The situated learning perspective supported residents and care professionals' competencies in performing sufficient oral care. The shared oral care intervention supports an individual and multidisciplinary assessment of nursing home residents' ability to self-care concerning oral care. Contextual factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms influence the intervention's success. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the complexity within interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and unravelling the necessary properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health care are areas of improvement for care service in nursing homes.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the literature was conducted. CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase and Pubmed databases were searched for studies reporting TPC interventions for older adults, published between 2002 and 2019. The Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool was used for quality appraisal. Findings A total of six studies were included. Outcomes related to TPC interventions were grouped into three categories: healthcare system-related outcomes (rehospitalisation, length of stay [LOS] and emergency department [ED] visits), patient-related outcomes and family/carer important outcomes. Overall, TPC interventions were associated with lower readmission rates and LOS, improved quality of life and better decision-making concerning hospice care among families. Outcomes for ED visits were unclear. Research limitations/implications Positive outcomes related to healthcare services (including readmissions and LOS), patients (quality of life) and families (decision-making) were reported. However, the number of studies supporting the evidence were limited.

Most community-dwelling older adults (CDOAs) want to remain in their homes, particularly those experiencing functional decline. Politicians and academics repeatedly praise technological instruments for being the preferred solution for helping older adults with deteriorating health to remain at home. Objective: This study aimed to understand the perceptions of CDOAs and their informal caregivers (ICs) and professional caregivers (PCs) about technologies that can help keep older adults at home. Methods: This qualitative study used personal interviews, focus groups, and photo-elicitation interviews to better understand the perceptions of a convenience sample of 68 CDOAs, 21 ICs, and 32 PCs. Results: A fraction of CDOAs did not perceive technological instruments to be a very useful means of helping them remain at home. However, the ICs and PCs were more positive. The CDOAs preferred and were more willing to adopt technologies related to their mobility and safety and those that would help slow down their cognitive decline. The ICs preferred technological aids that assist in the activities of daily living as well as safety-related technologies for detecting falls and helping to locate disoriented older adults. The PCs preferred integrated communication and information systems to improve collaboration between all stakeholders, housing equipped with technologies to manage complex care, high-performance ancillary equipment to transfer people with reduced mobility, and surveillance systems to ensure safety at home. Conclusions: Although our study reports that CDOAs have limited interest in innovative technologies to help them remain at home, their technological skills will undoubtedly improve in the future, as will those of ICs and PCs. Technological tools will play an increasingly important role in home health care.

Frailty-a geriatric syndrome in which a patient is more vulnerable to stressors due to decreases in physical function and reserve-has been indicative of adverse postoperative outcomes. Many tools have been developed to measure frailty that incorporate a variety of factors including physical and cognitive function, comorbidities, self-reported measures of health, and clinical judgment. Most of these frailty assessment tools are able to identify a subset of patients at risk of adverse outcomes including postoperative complications, longer hospital length of stay, discharge to a higher level of care, and mortality. Frailty assessment before surgical interventions can also guide discussions among patients, their families, anesthesiologists, and surgeons to tailor operative plans for patients to mitigate this increased risk. Studies are ongoing to identify interventions in frail patients that can improve postoperative outcomes, but high-quality data in the form of randomized controlled trials are lacking at this time.

For information to be actionable and guide planning, there must be some population disaggregation based on differences in expected needs for care. Promising approaches to segmentation in primary care reflect both the breadth and severity of health states, the types and amounts of health care utilization that are expected, and the roles of the primary care provider. The purpose of this study was to assess population segmentation as a tool to create distinct patient groups for use in primary care performance reporting. Methods This cross-sectional study used administrative data (patient characteristics, physician and hospital billings, prescription medicines data, emergency department visits) to classify the population of British Columbia (BC), Canada into one of four population segments: low need, multiple morbidities, medically complex, and frail. Each segment was further classified using socioeconomic status (SES) as a proxy for patient vulnerability. Regression analyses were used to examine predictors of health care use, costs and selected measures of primary care attributes (access, continuity, coordination) by segment. Results Average annual health care costs increased from the low need ($ 1460) to frail segment ($10,798). Differences in primary care cost by segment only emerged when attributes of primary care were included in regression models: accessing primary care outside business hours and discontinuous primary care (>= 5 different GP's in a given year) were associated with higher health care costs across all segments and higher continuity of care was associated with lower costs in the frail segment (cost ratio = 0.61). Additionally, low SES was associated with higher costs across all segments, but the difference was largest in the medically complex group (cost ratio = 1.11). Conclusions Population segments based on expected need for care can support primary care measurement and reporting by identifying nuances which may be lost when all patients are grouped together. Our findings demonstrate that variables such as SES and use of regression analyses can further enhance the usefulness of segments for performance measurement and reporting.

Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65+ aged between 67 and 80 years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how to manage hypertension.

These patients are at increased risk for fractures and have inferior outcomes after treatment. Several studies have evaluated the incidence and outcome of PD patients after hip fractures. However, there are limited studies assessing the outcome of upper extremity fractures in these patients. In this study, we evaluated the outcome of PD patients that received surgical intervention for distal radial fractures (DRF). We hypothesize that these patients have an inferior outcome after surgery in comparison with non-PD patients. Methods Between May 2005 and May 2017, we retrospectively reviewed all of the patients with DRF and subsequently underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) at a level 1 trauma center. All of the surgeries were performed by fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons. The inclusion criteria include patients with a definitive diagnosis of PD, non-pathological DRF, and a minimum follow-up of 1 year or up until the time of treatment failure was noted. Each PD patient was matched for age and gender to 3 non-PD patients. The primary objective was to determine the failure rate after surgical fixation for DRF. The secondary outcomes include time to treatment failure, reoperation rate, readmission rate, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Results A total of 88 patients were included in this study (23 PD, 65 non-PD patients). All underwent ORIF and received standard postoperative follow-ups. The overall treatment failure rate in PD was 39.1% vs. 4.6% in the non-PD group (p < 0.05). The time to treatment failure were 9.11 +/- 3.86 weeks and 14.67 +/- 5.8 weeks for PD and non-PD, respectively (p < 0.05). PD patients had a significantly higher rate of failure when k-wires and ESF were used (p < 0.05%), while loss of reduction was the most common mode of failure in PD (44.4%). The length of hospital stay for PD was 5.3 +/- 4.69 days compared with 3.78 +/- 0.96 days for non-PD (p = 0.01). There were 3 PD patients readmitted within 30 days after surgery, and 1 patient had pneumonia after the surgery. Conclusion This study revealed that patients with PD have a high treatment failure rate despite surgical intervention for DRF. PD patients had a longer hospital stay and had a shorter time to treatment failure. In treating PD patients complicated with DRF, the surgeon must take into consideration the complex disease course of PD and the associated comorbidities such as osteoporosis, frail status, and frequent falls. Rehabilitation and disposition plans should be discussed in advance and longer hospital stays should be expected.

Although rehabilitation can address disability, the field is still emerging. Our aim was to identify similar disability experiences across complex chronic conditions and establish recommendations for future rehabilitation research and practice to advance healthy ageing with HIV. We conducted a consultation with 77 stakeholders from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland with expertise in the fields of rehabilitation and HIV, cancer, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who attended a one-day symposium. We used facilitated discussions to identify how rehabilitation issues in complex chronic disease translate to people ageing with HIV, and prioritised recommendations for future practice and research. Disability issues experienced across HIV and other complex chronic diseases included: (i) frailty, (ii) uncertainty and worrying about the future ageing with complex chronic disease, (iii) mental health, (iv) pain, and (v) stigma. We highlight six recommendations for clinical practice and research to advance healthy ageing with HIV. Opportunities for cross-collaboration exist with other more established areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation. Recommendations can be used to inform future HIV clinical practice and research in this emerging field.

Because polypharmacy is recognised as a possible major contributor to the pathogenesis of geriatric frailty, reducing inappropriate medication exposure is supposed to be a promising approach to improve health-related quality of life and prevent adverse outcomes. A major challenge for the process of deprescribing of inappropriate polypharmacy is to improve the communication between general practitioner (GPs), patient and family carer. This study investigates the effects of a complex intervention in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy living at home.MethodsThis is a cluster randomised controlled trial including 136 GPs and 676 patients. Patients with a positive clinical screening for frailty are eligible if they are aged 70years or older, receiving family or professional nursing care at home, and taking in five or more drugs per day. Exclusion criteria are higher grade of dementia and life expectancy of 6 months or less. The GPs of the intervention group receive an educational training promoting a deprescribing guideline and providing information on how to conduct a family conference focussing on prioritisation of treatment goals concerning drug therapy. During the 1-year intervention, GPs are expected to perform a total of three family conferences, each including a structured medication review with patients and their family carers. GPs of the control group will receive no training and will deliver care as usual. Geriatric assessment of all patients will be performed by study nurses during home visits at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is the hospitalisation rate during the observation period of 12months. Secondary outcomes are number and appropriateness of medications, mobility, weakness, cognition, depressive disorder, health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, weight, and costs of health care use.DiscussionThis study will provide evidence for a pragmatic co-operative and patient-centred educational intervention using family conferences to improve patient safety in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00015055 (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform [ICTRP]).

Its goal is to identify, document, and honor LST decisions of seriously ill veterans. Providers document veterans' goals and decisions using a standardized LST template and order set. Objective Evaluate the first 7 months of LSTDI implementation and identify predictors of LST template completion. Design Retrospective observational study of clinical and administrative data. We identified all completed LST templates, defined as completion of four required template fields. Templates also include four non-required fields. Results were stratified by risk of hospitalization or death as estimated by the Care Assessment Need (CAN) score. Subjects All veterans with VA utilization between July 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019. Main Measures Completed LST templates, goals and LST preferences, and predictors of documentation. Results LST templates were documented for 108,145 veterans, and 85% had one or more of the non-required fields completed in addition to the required fields. Approximately half documented a preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among those who documented specific goals, half wanted to improve or maintain function, independence, and quality of life while 28% had a goal of life prolongation irrespective of risk of hospitalization/death and 45% expressed a goal of comfort. Only 7% expressed a goal of being cured. Predictors of documentation included VA nursing home residence, older age, frailty, and comorbidity, while non-Caucasian race, rural residence, and receipt of care in a lower complexity medical center were predictive of no documentation. Conclusions LST decisions were documented for veterans at high risk of hospitalization or death. While few expressed a preference for cure, half desire, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Predictors of documentation were generally consistent with existing literature. Opportunities to reduce observed disparities exist by leveraging available VA resources and programs.

Engaging older adults in self-management talk in healthcare encounters: a systematic review protocol	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Aged; Frail elderly; Chronic illness and disease; Conversation analysis; Communication; Healthcare delivery; Self-management; Qualitative research; Protocol	SHARED DECISION-MAKING; PEOPLE; SPIDER; TOOLS; LIFE; PICO	Background Clinical practice guidelines for the management of complex chronic conditions in older adults encourage healthcare providers to engage patients in shared decision-making about self-management goals and actions. Yet, healthcare decision-making and communication for this population can pose significant challenges. As a result, healthcare professionals may struggle to help patients define and prioritise their values, goals, and preferences in ways that are clinically and personally meaningful, incorporating physical functioning and quality of life, when faced with numerous diagnostic and treatment alternatives. The aim of this systematic review is to locate and synthesise a body of fine-grained observational research on communication between professionals, older adults, and carers regarding self-management in audio/audio-visually recorded naturalistic interactions. Methods/design The paper describes a systematic review of the published conversation analytic and discourse analytic research, using an aggregative thematic approach and following the PRISMA-P guidelines. This review will include studies reporting on adult patients (female or male) aged >= 60 years whose consultations are conducted in English in any healthcare setting and stakeholders involved in their care, e.g. general practitioners, nurses, allied health professionals, and family carers. We will search nine electronic databases and the grey literature and two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts to identify potential studies. Discrepancies will be resolved via consultation with the review team. The methodological quality of the final set of included studies will be appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research and a detailed description of the characteristics of the included studies using a customised template. Discussion This is the first systematic review to date to locate and synthesise the conversation analytic research on how healthcare professionals raise and pursue talk about self-management with older adults in routine clinical interactions. Amalgamating these findings will enable the identification of effective and potentially trainable communication practices for engaging older adults in healthcare decision-making about the self-management goals and actions that enable the greatest possible health and quality of life in older adulthood.

Older adults with cardiovascular disease are frequently admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), where care is commensurate with high age-related cardiovascular disease risks but where the associated geriatric conditions (including multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and delirium, and frailty) may be inadvertently exacerbated and destabilized. The CICU environment of procedures, new medications, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, prolonged bed rest, malnourishment, and sleep is usually inherently disruptive to older patients regardless of the excellence of cardiovascular disease care. Given these fundamental and broad challenges of patient aging, CICU management priorities and associated decision-making are particularly complex and in need of enhancements. In this American Heart Association statement, we examine age-related risks and describe some of the distinctive dynamics pertinent to older adults and emerging opportunities to enhance CICU care. Relevant assessment tools are discussed, as well as the need for additional clinical research to best advance CICU care for the already dominating and still expanding population of older adults.

Risk Prediction for Adverse Outcomes for Frail Older Persons with Complex Healthcare and Social Care Needs Admitted to a Community Virtual Ward Model	CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference of Royal-College-of-Physicians-Ireland on Transforming Care for Older Persons	2019	Dublin, IRELAND	Royal Coll Physicians Ireland		community virtual ward; older persons; complex care; case management; risk prediction; health states	DEFICIT ACCUMULATION; CLINICAL STABILITY; ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA; AFTER-DISCHARGE; SELF-NEGLECT; PEOPLE; ADULTS; MORTALITY; FALLS	Purpose: Population ageing is challenging healthcare systems with limited resources, necessitating the development of new care models to address the needs of older, frail community-dwellers. Community Virtual Wards (CVW) reduce adverse events in these patients. We examined the effect of an established CVW on pre-defined health trajectories (between "stable", "deteriorating", and "unstable" states) and characteristics that increased the likelihood of adverse healthcare outcomes (hospitalization, institutionalization and death). Patients and Methods: We collected prospective data on frail patients admitted to a CVW in a single centre in Ireland. Relationships between risk scores, health states and adverse outcomes at 30, 60 and 90 days after admission were examined using multinomial regression analysis. Results: In total, 88 community-dwellers, mean (+/- SD) age of 82.8 +/- 6.4 years, were included. Most were severely frail on the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (mean 6.8/9 +/- 1.33). Reaching stability ("stable" state) within 30 days was a predictor for stability at 60 and 90 days and remaining at home. Stability was also associated with fewer care episodes (<2) (p=<0.001), a requirement for fewer healthcare professionals (HCP) (<7) (p<0.001) and lower risk of delirium (p<0.001). By contrast, being "unstable" at 60 days increased the numbers of HCP referrals (>7) and was predictive of more acute episodes (>2) and institutionalization or death (p<0.001). Predictors of adverse outcomes of either institutionalization or death included frailty status, function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risk and cognition. Conclusion: A CVW model can provide a framework for monitoring and case management to support older people to remain at home or identify those at risk of institutional care. The use of defined health states helped to stratify those at lower or higher risk in an already high-risk frail population. Level of frailty, function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risks and cognition were predictive of remaining at home and reaching a level of stability or instability/deterioration and institutional care.

Of them, 39% had >= 2 multimorbid conditions with >= 1 frailty measure, and 17% had >= 3 multimorbid conditions with >= 2 frailty measures. Prevalence differences in percentage points (pp) with 95% confidence intervals of those in high versus low occupational group with >= 2 multimorbid conditions and >= 1 frailty measure were largest in women age 30 years, 17 (14 to 20) pp and 55 years, 15 (13 to 17) pp and in men age 55 years, 15 (13 to 17) pp and 80 years, 14 (9 to 18) pp. In those with >= 3 multimorbid conditions and >= 2 frailty measures, prevalence differences were largest in women age 30 years, 8 (6 to 10) pp and 55 years, 10 (8 to 11) ppand in men age 55 years, 9 (8 to 11) pp and 80 years, 6 (95% CI 1 to 10) pp.ConclusionMultimorbidity with frailty is common, and social inequalities persist until age 80 years in women and throughout the lifespan in men. To manage complex multimorbidity, strategies for proportionate universalism in medical education, healthcare, public health prevention and promotion seem necessary.

Frailty in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Risk of Exacerbations and Hospitalizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE			English	Article						chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; frailty; weakness; handgrip strength	HAND GRIP STRENGTH; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; OLDER-ADULTS; COPD; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PREVALENCE; FREQUENCY; LESSONS	Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. While frailty is thought to be common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the relationship between frailty and COPD-related outcomes such as risk of acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) and hospitalizations is unclear. Purpose: To examine the association between physical frailty and risk of acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality in patients with COPD. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of data from a cohort of 280 participants was performed. Baseline frailty measures included exhaustion, weakness, low activity, slowness, and undernutrition. Outcome measures included AE-COPD, hospitalizations, and mortality over 2 years. Negative binomial regression and Cox proportional hazard modeling were used. Results: Sixty-two percent of the study population met criteria for pre-frail and 23% were frail. In adjusted analyses, the frailty syndrome was not associated with COPD exacerbations. However, among the individual components of the frailty syndrome, weakness measured by handgrip strength was associated with increased risk of COPD exacerbations (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.97). The frailty phenotype was not associated with all-cause hospitalizations but was associated with increased risk of non-COPD-related hospitalizations. Conclusion: This longitudinal cohort study shows that a high proportion of patients with COPD are pre-frail or frail. The frailty phenotype was associated with an increased risk of non-COPD hospitalizations but not with all-cause hospitalizations or COPD exacerbations. Among the individual frailty components, low handgrip strength was associated with increased risk of COPD exacerbations over a 2-year period. Measuring handgrip strength may identify COPD patients who could benefit from programs to reduce COPD exacerbations.

Design The revised guideline of Criteria for Reporting the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions in health care was followed. Methods The physical exercise programme was designed and validated by exercise specialists to be implemented by healthcare professionals. The physical exercise programme underwent three stages of development, piloting and evaluation. It includes a portfolio of exercises in different support materials (posters, e-book and website). A testing intervention was delivered to the target population. Results The Criteria for Reporting the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions in health care process has the potential to help practitioners in developing and planning complex interventions, such as an exercise programme. Its components can be adjusted to the context and to the characteristics of the target population. A study protocol and a pilot study will be developed to test the effectiveness of the physical exercise programme on delaying the functional decline of frail older adults.

Nonspecific symptoms, complex medical conditions, insufficient awareness of diagnostic criteria, and unnecessary urine studies all contribute to the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in PALTC residents. In 2017, the Infection Advisory Subcommittee at AMDA-The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine convened a workgroup comprised of experts in geriatrics and infectious diseases to review recent literature regarding UTIs in the PALTC population. The workgroup used evidence as well as their collective clinical expertise to develop this consensus statement with the goal of providing comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of UTIs in PALTC residents. The recommendations acknowledge limitations inherent to providing medical care for frail older adults, practicing within a resource limited setting, and prevention strategies tailored to PALTC populations. In addition, the consensus statement encourages integrating antibiotic stewardship principles into the policies and procedures used by PALTC nursing staff and by prescribing clinicians as they care for residents with a suspected UTI.

Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with decreased physiological reserve and an increased risk for suboptimal health outcomes. Area covered: This article reviews the current literature on frailty in lung transplantation, with an emphasis on frailty measures, prevalence and impact of frailty on morbidity and mortality prior to and following lung transplantation. Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane systematic review databases were searched to September 2019. The search included the MeSH terms 'frail elderly' or 'frailty' or 'sarcopenia' and 'lung disease' or 'lung transplantation'. Studies were included if: the population were undergoing evaluation for, listed for or received a lung transplant; frailty was prospectively assessed during lung transplant evaluation using systematically defined criteria; used human subjects and; published in English. The prevalence of frailty varied from 0% - 58%. The frailty phenotype and short physical performance battery were the most common measures. Frailty was associated with delisting and death pre-transplantation. Frailty was associated with an increased risk of early mortality post-lung transplantation. Expert opinion: Frailty is identified often in lung transplant candidates and is associated with adverse pre and post-transplantation outcomes. Further research is necessary to identify potential frailty interventions.

Objectives To investigate the associations of frailty status with oral cleaning habits and oral hygiene taking into account the effects of preventive oral health intervention among home care clients aged 75 or over. Methods Data were gathered by interviews and clinical oral examinations at baseline and after a 6-month follow-up. Frailty status was evaluated at baseline using the abbreviated comprehensive geriatric assessment (aCGA) scale, which consists of 15 questions from three different domains: cognitive status, functional status and depression. A total of 231 home care clients completed the aCGA at baseline and the interview and clinical oral examination both at baseline and after the follow-up. Results Using the aCGA classification with at least one score in the >= 2 domain, 62% of clients were classified as frail at baseline. They had poorer oral cleaning habits and hygiene, and they had lost more teeth than nonfrail participants. Multivariate analysis showed that being frail at baseline was statistically significantly associated with a lower frequency of toothbrushing and denture cleaning (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9 and OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.8) at baseline, but not after the follow-up. Membership in the intervention group was associated with better oral cleaning at the follow-up. However, among the frail participants, toothbrushing frequency was still significantly lower and oral hygiene poorer than among the nonfrail group. Conclusions Oral cleaning habits of frail elderly people were slightly improved as a result of external support, which had a positive effect on oral hygiene. Individual preventive actions in the context of oral health and hygiene should be integrated into the daily care plan of home care clients with the first signs of frailty.

The average age of the HF patient has increased substantially and many have a number of comorbidities. For the older HF patient, diligent planning of care has the potential to reduce hospitalization, improve quality of life and mortality; nevertheless, this vital component is often overlooked. Frailty, cachexia, sarcopenia, and cognitive impairment are all common in the older HF patient and require special care considerations. Many older HF patients live for many years with troublesome symptoms that could be better addressed through the incorporation of a palliative approach to care. Effective care plans can help patients maximize their health potential through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. However, current evidence remains scarce on what constitutes an optimal plan, therefore further studies are urgently needed. We review the care that could be implemented for the complex older HF patient with comorbidities.

These presentations are often complex and time consuming in the chaotic and potentially hazardous ED environment. The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention (GEDI) model was developed to optimise the care of frail older adults, especially RACF residents, in the ED. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the GEDI model on the primary outcomes of disposition (admission, discharge or death) and ED length of stay for residents of RACFs, presenting to an ED in regional Queensland, Australia. Methods GEDI is a nurse-led, physician-championed, innovative model delivered by advanced practice nurses with expertise in gerontology. This quasi-experimental pragmatic study compared outcomes for RACF residents who presented to a regional Queensland ED during three time periods: pre-GEDI, interim GEDI and post-GEDI implementation of the GEDI model. Outcomes included disposition, ED length of stay, ED re-presentation and mortality. Results A significant increase in the likelihood of discharge from ED (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.26) and reductions in ED length of stay (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.78) were evident for RACF residents following the implementation of the GEDI intervention. There were no differences in mortality, ED re-presentation or in-hospital length of stay between the three time periods. Conclusion There is a paucity of evidence to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in EDs designed to target older adults living in RACFs. The GEDI model was effective in reducing ED length of stay while increasing the likelihood of safe discharge for RACF residents.

J	Lilleheie, I; Debesay, J; Bye, A; Bergland, A				Lilleheie, Ingvild; Debesay, Jonas; Bye, Asta; Bergland, Astrid			Experiences of elderly patients regarding participation in their hospital discharge: a qualitative metasummary	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							OLDER PERSONS; USER PARTICIPATION; TRANSITIONAL CARE; DECISION-MAKING; HOME; PEOPLE; PERSPECTIVES; INVOLVEMENT; CAREGIVERS; READINESS	Background Ageing patients are discharged from the hospital 'quicker and sicker' than before, and hospital discharge is a critical step in patient care. Older patients form a particularly vulnerable group due to multimorbidity and frailty. Patient participation in healthcare is influenced by government policy and an important part of quality improvement of care. There is need for greater insights into the complexity of patient participation for older patients in discharge processes based on aggregated knowledge. Objective The aim of this study was to review reported evidence concerning the experiences of older patients aged 65 years and above regarding their participation in the hospital discharge process. Methods We conducted a qualitative metasummary. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsycINFO and SocINDEX were conducted. Data from 18 studies were included, based on specific selection criteria. All studies explored older patients' experience of participation during the discharge process in hospital, but varied when it came to type of discharge and diagnosis. The data were categorised into themes by using thematic analysis. Results Our analysis indicated that participation in the discharge process varied among elderly patients. Five themes were identified: (1) complexity of the patients state of health, (2) management and hospital routines, (3) the norm and preference of returning home, (4) challenges of mutual communication and asymmetric relationships and (5) the significance of networks. Conclusions Collaboration between different levels in the health systems and user-friendly information between staff, patient and families are crucial. The complexity of patient participation for this patient group should be recognised to enhance user involvement during discharge from hospital. Interventions or follow up studies of how healthcare professionals can improve their communication skills and address the tension between client-centred goals and organisational priorities are requested. Organisational structure may need to be restructured to ensure the participation of elderly patients.

Heart Failure Association/European Society of Cardiology position paper on frailty in patients with heart failure	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE			English	Article						Heart failure; Frailty; Aging; Instruments; Score	VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE; CARDIAC REHABILITATION; OLDER-ADULTS; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; PERFORMANCE; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; RISK; DISEASE	Heart failure (HF) and frailty are two distinct yet commonly associated conditions. The interplay between the two conditions is complex, due to overlaps in underlying mechanisms, symptoms and prognosis. The assessment of frailty in patients with HF is crucial, as it is associated with both unfavourable outcomes and reduced access and tolerance to treatments. However, to date a consensus definition of frailty in patients with HF remains lacking and the need for a validated assessment score, for identifying those HF patients with frailty, is high and timely. This position paper proposes a new definition of frailty for use by healthcare professionals in the setting of HF and creates a foundation for the design of a tailored and validated score for this common condition.

Prevalence and Impact of Functional and Psychosocial Problems in Hospitalized Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Hospitalized adults; assessment of health care needs; risk factor prevalence; adverse outcomes	ACUTE-CARE; GERIATRIC SYNDROMES; FUNDAMENTAL CARE; OLDER-PEOPLE; COMORBIDITY; IMPAIRMENT; FRAILTY; COSTS; SCALE	Objectives: Underpinning standards for delivering comprehensive care in hospital is the need to identify issues contributing to patient complexity and risk of harm. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of functional and psychosocial problems in hospitalized adults, to compare prevalence rates across age groups, and to assess their impact on discharge outcomes. Design, setting, and participants: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 4 hospitals in Australia during September 2015 to June 2016, recruiting patients aged 18 and over. Measures: Research nurses assessed patients at admission using the interRAI Acute Care instrument, which includes algorithms for diagnostic and risk screening and measuring problem severity. Length of stay and discharge outcome were recorded from medical records. Results: The median age of the study population (n = 910) was 66 (range 18-99 years), and 47.7% were female. Although 64.6% of patients aged >= 70 years had at least 1 classic geriatric syndrome (cognitive impairment, dependency in activities of daily living, history of falls, or incontinence), similar problems were prevalent in younger cohorts (34.6% in those aged <50 and 38.9% in those aged 50-69 years). Of 17 health issues assessed across multiple domains, only 26 patients (2.9%) had no problems. Independent of age, gender, and Comorbidity Index, having a greater number of problems was significantly associated with an adverse discharge outcome, odds ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29); for each additional problem, the length of stay increased by 6.7% (95% CI 4.3%-9.2%). Conclusions/Implications: The high prevalence of functional and psychosocial problems across the age range of patients indicates that universal screening and assessment is warranted for all adult patients to aid in care planning to meet patient needs both in acute care and post discharge.

This article provides an overview of literature related to hydration interventions and highlights gaps in knowledge. Sources of data: This paper draws on UK-focused literature from Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), CINAHL, Medline, Proquest Hospital Premium Collection, Cochrane Library and RCN databases on hydration interventions for older people living with multi-morbidity and dementia in care homes. Areas of agreement: Fluid intake is too low in care home residents, and no single hydration intervention is effective in addressing the complex problems that older residents present. Areas of controversy: There is a lack of consensus about how much fluid an older person should consume daily for optimum health. There is also lack of agreement about what interventions are effective in supporting individuals with complex physical and cognitive problems to achieve daily fluid intake targets. Growing points: To improve hydration care for residents, care home teams should be competent in the delivery of hydration care, and work closely with integrated multi-professional healthcare specialists to provide proactive case management. Areas timely for developing research: There is a need for understanding of what hydration practices and processes are effective for care home residents and including these in multi-component interventions.

This feasibility randomized controlled trial (fRCT) will test the proposed intervention and its implementation and determine methods for the design of a conclusive randomized controlled trial. Methods The fRCT, with embedded qualitative study, aims to recruit 60 participants. Moderately and severely frail older people will be identified using the electronic frailty index (eFI) and the intervention will be delivered by senior community nurses. The control participants will receive usual primary care for frailty. The study is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR; funding granted in May 2016, ref: ICA-CDRF-2016-02-018) and received NHS and University Research Ethics Committee approval in 2018. Discussion There is evidence that the delivery of complex interventions for community-dwelling older people can reduce care home and hospital admissions and falls, there is less evidence for the benefit of any specific type or intensity of intervention or the additional benefits of targeting the frail population. This trial will determine feasibility of the intervention, define recruitment and retention parameters and trial logistics, and decide outcome measures. Impact This study aims to address the limitations of current research by using a systematic method of frailty diagnosis and participant identification, trialling implementation of a person-centred intervention, and testing of feasibility parameters.

These conditions result in frequent hospital transfers which can lead to negative effects on residents' health status and are often avoidable. Reasons for emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions are complex. Prior research indicated factors influencing transfer decisions in view of nursing staff and general practitioners. The aim of this systematic review is to explore how family members experience and influence transfers from nursing home (NH) to hospital and how they are involved in the transfer decision.MethodsA systematic literature search was performed in Medline via PubMed, Ebsco Scopus and CINAHL in May 2018. Studies were eligible if they contained information a) about the decision to transfer NHR to hospital and b) the experiences or influence of family members. The review followed Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) approach for qualitative systematic reviews. Screening, selection and quality appraisal of studies were performed independently by two reviewers. Synthesis of qualitative data was conducted through meta-aggregation.ResultsAfter screening of n=2863 articles, in total n=10 qualitative studies were included in the review. Results indicate that family members of NHR experience decision-making before hospitalization differently. They mainly reported NH-related, hospital-related, and family/resident-related factors influencing the transfer decision. The involvement of family members in the decision-making process varies - from no involvement to insistence on a decision in favor of their personal preferences. However, hospital transfer decisions and other treatment decisions (e.g. advance care planning (ACP) discussions) were commonly discussed with physicians and nurses. Conflicts between family members and healthcare providers mostly arose around the interpretation of resident's best interest. In general, family members perceive discussions as challenging thus leading to emotional stress and discomfort.ConclusionThe influence of NHR family members concerning hospital transfer decisions varies. Family members are an important link for communication between resident and medical staff and for communication between NH and hospital. Interventions aiming to reduce hospitalization rates have to take these findings into account.

J	Hedman, K				Hedman, Karl			Strengths and support of older people affected by precarity in South Louisiana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING			English	Article						care of older people; Louisiana; precarity; strengths; support	EXPERIENCE; FRAILTY	BackgroundFew empirical studies have examined strengths and support of older people in circumstances of precarity. A better understanding of this problem has the potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery. PurposeTo investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana. MethodMore than 300hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for low-income older persons and two senior citizen centres. ResultsThe findings demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home-based healthcare services, (b) stress after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home-based services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships and activities, and (i) grocery store and cafe contacts. ConclusionHome-based services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services. Implications for practiceThis study adds to the literature about precarity among community-based older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home-based services are necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths and supportive resources of older people.

People living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) represent amongst the sickest and frailest cohort of the aged population, with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and complex comorbidities. Given the vulnerability of RACF residents and the demands on the system, there is a need to determine the extent that care is delivered in line with best practice ('appropriate care') in RACFs. There is also a recognition that systems should provide care that optimises quality of life (QoL), which includes support for physical and psychological well-being, independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and a caring external environment. The aims of Care Track Aged are to develop sets of indicators for appropriate care and processes of care for commonly managed conditions, and then assess the appropriateness of care delivered and QoL of residents in RACFs in Australia. Methods and analysis We will extract recommendations from clinical practice guidelines and, using expert review, convert these into sets of indicators for 15 common conditions and processes of care for people living in RACFs. We will recruit RACFs in three Australian states, and residents within these RACFs, using a stratified multistage sampling method. Experienced nurses, trained in the CateTtack Aged methods ('surveyors'), will review care records of recruited residents within a 1-month period in 2019 and 2020, and assess the care documented against the indicators of appropriate care. Surveyors will concurrently assess residents' QoL using validated questionnaires.

Traditional medicine and models of care may no longer meet complex patient needs. Older patients present with multifaceted issues while living longer with chronic health conditions. The changing environment requires a cross-disciplinary perspective. Changes in reimbursement are in the early stages of implementation and will be used to evaluate measurable outcomes. Preparing to care for this population can only occur with enough health professionals and expanded use of advance practice nurses. Health improvement is economically advantageous.

The aim of this study was to compare symptoms before death in LTC for those with cancer, dementia or chronic illness. Methods After-death prospective staff survey of resident deaths with random cluster sampling in 61 representative LTC facilities across New Zealand (3709 beds). Deaths (n = 286) were studied over 3 months in each facility. Standardised questionnaires - Symptom Management (SM-EOLD) and Comfort Assessment in End of life with Dementia (CAD-EOLD) - were administered to staff after the resident's death. Results Primary diagnoses at the time of death were dementia (49%), chronic illness (30%), cancer (17%), and dementia and cancer (4%). Residents with cancer had more community hospice involvement (30%) than those with chronic illness (12%) or dementia (5%). There was no difference in mean SM-EOLD in the last month of life by diagnosis (cancer 26.9 (8.6), dementia 26.5(8.2), chronic illness 26.9(8.6). Planned contrast analyses of individual items found people with dementia had more pain and those with cancer had less anxiety. There was no difference in mean CAD-EOLD scores in the week before death by diagnosis (total sample 33.7(SD 5.2), dementia 34.4(SD 5.2), chronic illness 33.0(SD 5.1), cancer 33.3(5.1)). Planned contrast analyses showed significantly more physical symptoms for those with dementia and chronic illness in the last month of life than those with cancer. Conclusions Overall, symptoms in the last week and month of life did not vary by diagnosis. However, sub-group planned contrast analyses found those with dementia and chronic illness experienced more physical distress during the last weeks and months of life than those with cancer. These results highlight the complex nature of LTC end of life care that requires an integrated gerontology/palliative care approach.

This systematic review explores service user, carer and provider perspectives on integrated care for OPF, and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation, to draw out implications for policy, practice and research. Methods Systematic review and narrative synthesis of qualitative studies identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index, hand-searching of reference lists and citation tracking of included studies, and review of experts' online profiles. Quality of included studies was appraised with The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for qualitative research. Results Eighteen studies were included in the synthesis. We identified four themes related to stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF: different preferences for integrated care among service users, system and service organisation components, relational aspects of care and support, and stakeholder perceptions of outcomes. Service users and carers highlighted continuity of care with a professional they could trust, whereas providers emphasised improved coordination of care between providers in different care sectors as key strategies for integrated care. We identified three themes related to factors facilitating and hindering implementation: perceptions of the integrated care intervention and target population, service organisational factors and system level factors influencing implementation. Different stakeholder groups perceived the complexity of care needs of this patient population, difficulties with system navigation and access, and limited service user and carer involvement in care decisions as key factors hindering implementation. Providers mainly also highlighted other organisational and system factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation of integrated care for OPF. Conclusions Similarities and differences in lay and professional stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation were evident. Findings highlight the importance of addressing organisational and system level components of integrated care and factors influencing implementation for OPF. Greater attention needs to be placed on collaboratively involving service users, carers and providers to improve the co-design and implementation of integrated care programmes for this patient population.

We assessed feasibility and accuracy of the eFI, including complexities in data extraction. The reference standard for comparison was Fried's frailty phenotype.ResultsThe mean (SD) age of participants was 80.2 (4.8) years, with 36 (60.0%) female (n=60). Frailty prevalence was 21.7% by Fried's frailty phenotype, and 35.0% by eFI (scores>0.21). When deriving the eFI, 85% of EHRs were perceived as easy or neutral difficulty to extract the required data from. Complexities in data extraction were present in EHRs of patients with multiple health problems and/or where the majority of data items were located other than on the patient's summary problem list.DiscussionThis study demonstrated that it is entirely feasible to extract an eFI from routinely collected Australian primary care data. We have outlined a process for extracting an eFI from EHRs without needing to modify existing infrastructure. Results from this study can inform the development of automated eFIs, including which data items to best access data from.

As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital. Methods: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role. Conclusions: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.

Subjects with OH were older, thinner, more commonly to have weakness, slowness, poorer physical function and higher levels of frailty. The prevalence of OH was substantially increased as higher levels of CFS (p for trend <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed significant association between OH and frailty (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.7), but the association attenuated after adjustment for physical function. (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7-2.6). Nevertheless, associations between OH and frailty remained significant among vulnerable subgroups like women, subjects having weakness, slowness, poor cognitive function, polypharmacy or any IADL limitation.ConclusionsOH in hospitalized older patients was associated with frailty and multiple complex care needs, especially in the vulnerable subgroups. Further study is needed to clarify the roles of OH in clinical practice.

This pilot study was created to determine feasibility and acceptability of a community-delivered posthospital multifactorial program. Method: This mixed-method study used randomized controlled design (quantitative component) and interviews (qualitative component). People aged >= 65 years, hospitalized for a fall, underwent assessment for quality of life and falls-related outcomes, followed by interviews, randomization into intervention (exercise, medication review, and education) or control group, and follow-up at 6 months. Results: Thirteen people commenced, with 10 people assessed at 6 months. Participants were complex with high degrees of frailty, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and falls risk. Interview data related to intervention, impacts on quality of life, and fall-related outcomes. Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest suitability of a multifactorial program for older people posthospital discharge following a fall. A social component would be a useful addition to falls prevention strategies, utilizing existing community nursing organizations.

The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. Design A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Results Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self-management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. Discussion The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team "works" is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live. Conclusion Severely frail older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and environmentally.

Background Existential loneliness (EL) is an unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older people, the experience of EL can be reduced. Design In this qualitative study, we used an exploratory and descriptive design. Methods The study was based on 22 narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were receiving long-term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis. Results Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the rear-view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract themselves. Conclusion Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person-centred care and create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherne	[Sjoberg, Marina] Malmo Univ, Fac Hlth & Soc, Dept Care Sci, Malmo, Sweden; [Sjoberg, Marina; Edberg, Anna-Karin; Beck, Ingela] Kristianstad Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Platform Collaborat Hlth, Kristianstad, Sweden; [Rasmussen, Birgit H.; Beck, Ingela] Lund Univ & Reg Skane, Inst Palliat Care, Lund, Sweden; [Rasmussen, Birgit H.] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Beck, Ingela] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Div Oncol, Dept Clin Sci Lund, Lund, Sweden	Sjoberg, M (corresponding author), Kristianstad Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Platform Collaborat Hlth, Kristianstad, Sweden.	marina.sjoberg@hkr.se		Edberg, Anna-Karin/0000-0003-0161-4795	Research Platform for Collaboration for Health at Kristianstad University [7/2014]; Crafoordska Stiftelsen [2013-0841]; Greta och Johan Kocks stiftelser [2014-231-401]; Vardal Foundation; Gyllenstiernska Krapperup Foundation	The Research Platform for Collaboration for Health at Kristianstad University, Grant/Award Number: 7/2014; Crafoordska Stiftelsen, Grant/Award Number: 2013-0841; Greta och Johan Kocks stiftelser, Grant/Award Number: 2014-231-401; Vardal Foundation; Gyllenstiernska Krapperup Foundation		42	8	8	2	7	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1748-3735	1748-3743		INT J OLDER PEOPLE N	Int.

A qualitative study of experiences from registered nurses and their leaders	JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE			English	Article						community health services; home care; frail elderly; multimorbidity; polypharmacy; functional decline; geriatric assessment; methods	COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT; NURSING DOCUMENTATION; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; PRESSURE ULCERS; DISCHARGE; BARRIERS; FACILITATORS; DISABILITY; MANAGEMENT	Aim: To identify experiences and opinions about the need for a structured follow-up and to identify potential benefits and barriers to the use of a checklist (Sub Acute Functional decline in the Older people [SAFE]) when caring for frail home-dwelling older people. Background: The complexity of older peoples' health situation requires more coordinated health care across health care levels and a better structured follow-up than is currently being offered, especially in the transitional phase between hospital discharge and primary care, but also in more stable phases at home. Design: This was a qualitative study using focus group interviews. Methods: Data were collected during six focus group interviews in three districts in a municipality. Nineteen registered nurses (RNs) and seventeen leaders responsible for the follow-up of frail home-dwelling older people participated. Participants were representatives of the RNs in homecare and their leaders. Results: Our results highlight that although most RNs and their leaders saw a number of significant benefits to conducting a structured assessment and follow-up of frail older people home care recipients, a number of barriers made this difficult to realize on a daily basis. Conclusion: There is no common perception that a structured follow-up of frail homed-welling older people in primary health care is an important and contributing factor to better quality of health care. Despite this, most RNs and leaders found that the use of a structured checklist such as SAFE was a benefit to achieving a structured follow-up of the frail older people. We identified several factors of importance to whether a structured follow-up with a checklist is conducted in home care.

Several clinical guidelines provide specific recommendations for management of these patientsbut little is known about their implementation in clinical practice.ObjectiveTo describe physician and community pharmacist perceptions and routine clinical practice in the management of elderly T2DM patients.MethodsCross-sectional study.ResultsA total of 993 physicians and 999 community pharmacists completed the questionnaire. More physicians than pharmacists agreed on the need to establish more flexible HbA1c targets for elderly (79.4% vs. 30.6%; p<0.001) and frail (92.6% vs. 31.4%; p<0.001) patients than for the general diabetic population. HbA1c targets<7.5% for elderly patients and<8.5% for frail patients (as recommended by the principle guidelines) were set by 38.9% and 28.7% of physicians, respectively. Furthermore, 62.8% of physicians stated they follow guideline recommendations but, based on their prescription decisions for hypothetical patients, less than 50% were aligned with them. In addition, 73.1% of physicians monitor treatment adherence, mainly by using dispensing control (59.1%). Specific nutritional approaches for elderly patients are provided by 62.9% of physicians and 56.0% of pharmacists, whilst 57.4% and 21.7%, respectively, deliver specific physical exercise programs.ConclusionsLow adherence to guideline recommendations (i.e. setting more stringent HbA1c targets or delaying treatment intensification) may lead to suboptimal glycaemic control in elderly patients. The standardization of processes, extensive monitoring of patient treatment adherence and providing advice regarding specific personal lifestyle habits may improve the management of elderly T2DM patients.

METHODS This longitudinal study with a 3-year follow-up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3-year period. CONCLUSIONS To prevent frailty, we suggest weight-loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower-limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. Implications for Nursing Practice The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.

Healthy Aging: American Geriatrics Society White Paper Executive Summary	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article						healthy aging; successful aging; health promotion; prevention		In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at . Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person-centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

Care decisions are complex because patients may have multiple comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Additionally, older adults often have vague symptomology, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and a reported delay of treatment. Although multiple clinical guidelines are available, the applicability of guidelines to the older population needs to be evaluated based on a holistic, individualized basis. Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes and priorities, incorporating risk-benefit assessment, quality of life, functional assessment, and frailty assessment when making treatment decisions.

The discussions needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not occur in the outpatient setting. Objective: We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. Setting/Participants: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. Measurements: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items about the intervention. Results: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers agreed or strongly agreed that "Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about what I really want." Conclusions: The POLST facilitation can be successfully delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes.

Integrated care seems to respond to this issue, with collaborative working and integration efforts of the care system components professionals and service providers aimed at improving efficiency, appropriateness and person centeredness of care. We conducted a narrative review to analyse the available evidences published on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated care models targeted on the management of such elderly patients. Methods: MEDLINE, Scopus and EBSCO were searched. We reported this narrative review according to the PRISMA Checklist. For studies to be included, they had to: (i) refer to integrated care models through implemented experimental or demonstration projects; (ii) focus on frail elderly 65 years old, with complex health and social needs, not disease-specific; (iii) evaluate effectiveness and/or cost and/or cost-effectiveness; (iv) report quantitative data (e.g. health outcomes, utilization outcomes, cost and cost-effectiveness). Results: Thirty articles were included, identifying 13 integrated care models. Common features were identified in case management, geriatric assessment and multidisciplinary team. Favourable impacts on healthcare facilities utilization rates, though with mixed results on costs, were found. The development of community-based and cost-effective integrated systems of care for the elderly is possible, thanks to the cooperation across care professionals and providers, to achieving a relevant impact on healthcare and efficient resource management. The elements of success or failure are not always unique and identifiable, but the potential clearly exists for these models to be successful and generalized on a large scale. Discussion: We found out a favourable impact of integrated care models/methods on health outcomes, care utilization and costs. The selected interventions are likely to be implemented at community level, focused on the patient management in terms of continuity of care. Thus, we propose a value-based framework for the evaluation of these services.

A Cross-Sectional Study	NUTRIENTS			English	Article						community-dwelling; older adults; oral health; edentulousness; complete denture; malnutrition; health-related quality of life (HRQoL)	MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS; NURSING-HOME RESIDENTS; OLDER-ADULTS; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; INTEGRATED CARE; RISK-FACTORS; FRAILTY; PREVALENCE; IMPACT	As the population ages, the risk of becoming malnourished increases. Research has shown that poor oral health can be a risk factor for malnutrition in institutionalized elderly. However, it remains unclear whether oral health problems, edentulousness and health-related quality of life also pose a risk for malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults. In this cross-sectional observational study, 1325 community-living elderly (75 years) were asked to complete questionnaires regarding nutritional status, oral status (edentulous, remaining teeth, or implant-supported overdentures), oral health problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, activities of daily living (ADL) and complexity of care needs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with nutritional status as dependent variable. Of the respondents, 51% (n = 521) were edentulous, 38.8% (n = 397) had remaining teeth and 10.2% (n = 104) had an implant-supported overdenture. Elderly with complex care needs were malnourished most frequently, followed by frail and robust elderly (10%, 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively). Malnourished elderly reported more frequent problems with chewing and speech when compared with well-nourished elderly (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analysis did not show an association between malnutrition and oral health problems and edentulousness, although HRQoL was associated with malnutrition (odds ratio (OR) 0.972, confidence interval (CI) 0.951-0.955). Based on the results of this cross-sectional study, it can be concluded that poor HRQoL is significantly associated with malnutrition; however, edentulousness and oral health problems are not.

Communicating end-of-life care goals and decision-making among a multidisciplinary geriatric inpatient rehabilitation team: A qualitative descriptive study	PALLIATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Communication; decision-making; end-of-life care; geriatric; older person; palliative care; rehabilitation	OLDER-PEOPLE; DEMENTIA; PATHWAY	Background: In geriatric inpatient rehabilitation settings, where the goal is to optimise function, providing end-of-life care can be challenging. Aim: The aim of this study is to explore how end-of-life care goals and decision-making are communicated in a geriatric inpatient rehabilitation setting. Design: The design is a qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured individual and group interviews. Setting/participants: This study was conducted in a 154-bed facility in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, providing geriatric inpatient rehabilitation for older patients; medical, nursing and allied health clinicians, who had cared for an inpatient who died, were recruited. Data collection: Participants were interviewed using a conversational approach, guided by an 'aide memoire'. Results: A total of 19 clinicians participated in this study, with 12 interviewed individually and the remaining 7 clinicians participating in group interviews. The typical patient was described as older, frail and with complex needs. Clinicians described the challenge of identifying patients who were deteriorating towards death, with some relying on others to inform them. How patient deterioration and decision-making was communicated among the team varied. Communication with the patient/family about dying was expected but did not always occur, nor was it always documented. Some clinicians relied on documentation, such as commencement of a dying care pathway to indicate when a patient was dying. Conclusion: Clinicians reported difficulties recognising patient deterioration towards death. Uncertainty and inconsistent communication among clinicians about patient deterioration negatively impacted team understanding, decision-making, and patient and family communication. Further education for all members of the multidisciplinary team focusing on how to recognise and communicate impending death will aid multidisciplinary teams to provide quality end-of-life care when required.

In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients >= 70 years of age were evaluated with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age was 76 (70-92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p 0.001) and GA group (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.

Frailty in a Post-Acute Care Population: A Scoping Review	PM&R			English	Review							HOSPITAL READMISSION; OLDER-ADULTS; RISK-FACTORS; DISCHARGE; OUTCOMES; REHABILITATION; PEOPLE; MULTIFACTORIAL; ASSOCIATION; IMPAIRMENT	Frailty is a complex and growing phenomenon facing health care providers throughout the continuum of care. Frailty is not well understood in post-acute care (PAC) settings. The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize current evidence of frailty impact on outcomes and frailty mitigation initiatives in PAC. Three major publication databases were searched from January 2000 to June 2017 that identified 18 articles specifically addressing frailty in PAC. Three themes were identified: scales used to measure frailty, factors that led to an adverse outcome or diagnosis of frailty, and interventions to address frailty in PAC. Scales used to measure frailty were dominated by physical factors and scarce on nutrition and social support. Functional decline, grip strength, gait speed, polypharmacy, and nutrition were identified in the studies as factors that identify frailty and are associated with poor outcomes. All these frailty characteristics compromise patients' ability to benefit from rehabilitation, which further establishes the importance of PAC providers to identify, prevent, and treat frailty. Intervention studies had mixed outcomes, suggesting a need for further development in this area. The findings of this scoping review highlight the need for a comprehensive multidimensional assessment of frailty risks in PAC.

Geriatric co-management has demonstrated potential to improve functional status, and reduce complications and length of stay, but evidence on the effectiveness in cardiology patients is lacking. This study aims to determine if geriatric co-management is superior to usual care in preventing functional decline, complications, mortality, readmission rates, reducing length of stay and improving quality of life in older patients admitted for acute heart disease or for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and to identify determinants of success for geriatric co-management in this population. Methods and analysis This prospective quasi-experimental before-and-after study will be performed on two cardiology units of the University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium in patients aged >= 75 years. In the precohort (n=227), usual care will be documented. A multitude of implementation strategies will be applied to allow for successful implementation of the model. Patients in the after cohort (n=227) will undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment within 24 hours of admission to stratify them into one of three groups based on their baseline risk for developing functional decline: low-risk patients receive proactive consultation, high-risk patients will be co-managed by the geriatric nurse to prevent complications and patients with acute geriatric problems will receive an additional medication review and co-management by the geriatrician. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee UZ Leuven/KU Leuven (S58296). Written voluntary (proxy-) informed consent will be obtained from all participants at the start of the study. Dissemination of results will be through articles in scientific and professional journals both in English and Dutch and by conference presentations.

AimTo survey the most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. MethodA retrospective descriptive survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. FindingsThe persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. ConclusionFrail older persons with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end-of-life care, should be prevented from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making house calls.

J	Henni, SH; Kirkevold, M; Antypas, K; Foss, C				Henni, Silje Havrevold; Kirkevold, Marit; Antypas, Konstantinos; Foss, Christina			The role of advanced geriatric nurses in Norway: A descriptive exploratory study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING			English	Article						advanced practice nursing; care of older adults; nurse practitioner; nurse roles; primary health care	QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; GLOBAL CHALLENGE; OLDER POPULATION; META-SYNTHESIS; CARE; PRACTITIONERS; IMPLEMENTATION; EXPERIENCES; RESIDENTS; STAFF	Background: Care of older adults in the community is becoming increasingly complex. However, nursing staff often has insufficient knowledge and skills to adequately address the needs of frail older adults. There is therefore a need for nurses with advanced qualifications. To meet this need, advanced geriatric nursing has been introduced in Norway. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses with their new role as advanced geriatric nurses in care of older adults and to determine what strategies the nurses considered important in the development of their new role. Design: This study applied a descriptive, exploratory design. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 nurses who had undergone an educational programme to become advanced geriatric nurses in Norway in 2016. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The participants described a complex and extensive nursing role, which they related to a new understanding of the patients, relatives and the system in which they worked. This new gaze had developed based on a combination of their new knowledge, their skills, experiences and professional interests. The opportunities to use their role depended on their workplace conditions. They related to contextual challenges at their workplace in different ways to optimise the use of their new gaze. Conclusions: Common for all participants was a broader and deeper understanding of the patient's health and life situation, which guided participants' actions. The key issue in developing the new role was developing effective strategies to foster role integration. Implications for Practice: Advanced geriatric nurses should collaborate with their managers to create a role that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills, as well as collaborate with colleagues to enhance understanding of utilisation of their role.

Design: Intervention study. Setting: Community-based older adult specific exercise clinic. Participants: Older adults (N=245) with complex care needs who were receiving government-funded aged care support. Interventions: Twenty-four weeks of twice weekly progressive resistance plus balance training carried out under the supervision of accredited exercise physiologists. Main Outcome Measures; The primary measure was the Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale. Secondary measures included the Short Physical Performance Battery; fall history gathered as part of the health history questionnaire; hierarchical timed balance tests; Geriatric Anxiety Index; Geriatric Depression Scale; Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, Loss of Weight scale; and EuroQoL-5 dimension 3 level. Results: At baseline, better physical performance (r=.54; P<.01) and quality of life (r=.52; P<.01) predicted better balance confidence. In contrast, at baseline, higher levels of frailty predicted worse balance confidence (r=.55; P<.01). Change in balance confidence after the exercise intervention was accompanied by improved physical performance (+12%) and reduced frailty (-11%). Baseline balance confidence was identified as the most consistent negative predictor of change scores across the intervention. Conclusions: This study shows that reduced physical performance and quality of life and increased frailty are predictive of worse balance confidence in older adults with aged care needs. However, when a targeted intervention of resistance and balance exercise is implemented that reduces frailty and improves physical performance, balance confidence will also improve. Given the influence of balance confidence on a raft of well-being determinants, including the capacity for positive physical and cognitive change, this study offers important insight to those looking to reduce falls in older adults.

DesignA two-armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow-ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. MethodInclusion criteria were the following: 65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self-reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. ResultsDuring the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. ConclusionsThe use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

Although it is associated with disability and multiple comorbidities, it can also be present in individuals who seem healthy. Frailty is multidimensional and its pathophysiology is complex. Early identification and intervention can potentially decrease or reverse frailty, especially in the early stages. Primary care physicians, community nurses and community social networks have important roles in the identification of pre-frail and frail elderly through the use of simple frailty screening tools and rapid geriatric assessments. Appropriate interventions that can be initiated in a primary care setting include a targeted medical review for reversible medical causes of frailty, medication appropriateness, nutritional advice and exercise prescription. With ongoing training and education, the multidisciplinary engagement and coordination of care of the elderly in the community can help to build resilience and combat frailty in our rapidly ageing society.

Background: A critical time for appropriate health decisions occurs during hospital discharge planning with nursing staff. However, little is known how the 89% of elderly living at home make decisions regarding their health care. Research into older adults' management of chronic conditions emerges as an important step to potentially encourage symptom monitoring, prevent missed care and detect deterioration. All should reduce the risk of hospital re-admission. Design: A mixed methods thematic literature review was undertaken. The structure followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews recommended by the EQUATOR network. Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus online databases were searched using keywords, inclusion and exclusion criteria. References drawn from relevant publications, identified by experts and published between 1995 and 2017 were also considered. Twenty-five qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies and reviews were critically appraised (CASP 2013) before inclusion in the review. Analysis of each study's findings was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (2006) steps to identify major themes and sub-themes. Results: Four main themes associated with health-related decision-making in the elderly were identified: "the importance of maintaining independence," "decision making style," "management of conditions at home" and "discharge planning." Conclusion: Health care decision preferences in the elderly emerged as highly complex and influenced by multiple factors. Development of a tool to assess these components has been recommended. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses play a vital role in exploring and understanding the influence that maintaining independence has with each patient. This understanding provides an initial step toward development of a tool to assist collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals involved in their care.

Recently, nine proactive primary-care programs aiming to prevent functional decline in older adults showed inconclusive effects. The aim of this study was to systematically unravel, compare, and synthesize the development and evaluation of nine primary-care programs within a controlled trial to further improve the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Study Design and Setting: A systematic overview of all written data on the nine proactive primary-care programs was conducted using a validated item list. The nine proactive primary-care programs involved 214 general practices throughout the Netherlands. Results: There was little or no focus on the (1) context surrounding the care program, (2) modeling of processes and outcomes, (3) intervention fidelity and adaptation, and (4) content and evaluation of training for interventionists. Conclusions: An in-depth analysis of the context, modeling of the processes and outcomes, measurement and reporting of intervention fidelity, and implementation of effective training for interventionists is needed to enhance the development and replication of future complex interventions.

Reference intervals are generally based on individuals without diagnosed diseases or use of medication, which often excludes elderly. The aim of the study was to assess levels of albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) in frail, moderately healthy and healthy elderly indivuduals. Methods: Blood samples were collected from individuals > 80 years old, nursing home residents, in the Elderly in Linkoping Screening Assessment and Nordic Reference Interval Project, a total of 569 individuals. They were divided into three cohorts: frail, moderately healthy and healthy, depending on cognitive and physical function. Albumin, ALT, AST, creatinine and gamma-GT were analyzed using routine methods. Results: Linear regression predicted factors for 34% of the variance in albumin were activities of daily living (ADL), gender, stroke and cancer. ADLs, gender and weight explained 15% of changes in ALT. For AST levels, ADLs, cancer and analgesics explained 5% of changes. Kidney disease, gender, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease explained 25% of the variation in creatinine levels and MMSE explained three per cent of gamma-GT variation. Conclusions: Because a group of people are at the same age, they should not be assessed the same way. To interpret results of laboratory tests in elderly is a complex task, where reference intervals are one part, but far from the only one, to take into consideration.

Background: A better understanding of the personal experience of frailty in the context of fluctuating ill-health has the potential to contribute to the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. Design: An ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a community matron service in a large city in the North of England. Methods: Up to six care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4-year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method. Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: Fluctuating ill-health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living. Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person-centred care . Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.

Aim: To collaboratively identify with emergency clinicians' improvement priorities for emergency department-based palliative care for older people. Design: This was one component of an experience-based co-design project, conducted using semi-structured interviews and feedback sessions. Setting/participants: In-depth interviews with 15 emergency clinicians (nurses and doctors) at a large teaching hospital emergency department in the United Kingdom exploring experiences of palliative care delivery for older people. A thematic analysis identified core challenges that were presented to 64 clinicians over five feedback sessions, validating interview findings, and identifying shared priorities for improving palliative care delivery. Results: Eight challenges emerged: patient age; access to information; communication with patients, family members, and clinicians; understanding of palliative care; role uncertainty; complex systems and processes; time constraints; and limited training and education. Through feedback sessions, clinicians selected four challenges as improvement priorities: time constraints; communication and information; systems and processes; and understanding of palliative care. As resulting improvement plans evolved, training and education replaced time constraints as a priority. Conclusion: Clinician priorities for improving emergency department-based palliative care were identified through collaborative, iterative processes. Though generally aware of older palliative patients' needs, clinicians struggled to provide high-quality care due to a range of complex factors. Further research should identify whether priorities are shared across other emergency departments, and develop, implement, and evaluate strategies developed by clinicians.

Genetic Variants and Hamstring Injury in Soccer: An Association and Validation Study	MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE			English	Article						ELITE; RISK; FOOTBALL; SCREENING; PREVENTION	RISK-FACTORS; PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; NITRIC-OXIDE; PLAYERS; POLYMORPHISMS; INTERLEUKIN-6; PATHWAY; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Purpose This study aimed to investigate the association of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with noncontact hamstring muscle injuries in elite soccer players and to create and validate a model to assess the risk of hamstring injury. Methods A total of 107 elite male outfield players were prospectively followed for six seasons. Players were genotyped for 37 SNP previously investigated in relation to musculoskeletal injuries. The association of SNP, previous injury, age, level of play, position, and anthropometric data with 129 hamstring injuries (413 observations) was investigated in the discovery phase (2010-2015), and a multivariable Cox frailty model was created using forward selection. The model's discriminative ability was tested in the validation phase (2015-2016, 31 injuries, 98 observations) using Harrell's C index. Results Five SNP were found to be significantly associated with hamstring injury in a multivariable model: matrix metalloproteinase 3 rs679620 (A vs G, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-2.81), tenascin C rs2104772 (A vs T, HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.17-2.32), interleukin 6 rs1800795 (GG vs GC + CC, HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.11-2.53), nitric oxide synthase 3 rs1799983 (G vs T, HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.01-1.79), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 rs11549465 (CC vs CT, HR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.00-4.29). Age also entered the model (24 vs <24 yr, HR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.29-3.42). The model showed acceptable discrimination in the discovery phase (C index = 0.74), but not in the validation phase (C index = 0.52). Conclusion Genetic variants appear to be involved in the etiology of hamstring injuries but were not found to have predictive value by themselves. Further research, increasing the number of genetic variants and including environmental factors in complex multifactorial risk models, is necessary.

Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training 2.0: A collaborative team-based approach to delivering care	JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE			English	Article						Collaboration; Geriatric team training; home care; interprofessional; medication management; older adults	MEDICATION REGIMEN COMPLEXITY; HEALTH	Interprofessional collaborative education and practice has become a cornerstone of optimal person-centered management in the current complex health care climate. This is especially important when working with older adults, many with multiple chronic conditions and challenging health care needs. This paper describes a feasibility study of the Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training 2.0 (GITT 2.0) program focused on providing interprofessional care to complex and frail older adults with multiple chronic conditions. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design facilitated program implementation and evaluation. Over three years (2013-2016), 65 graduate students from nursing, midwifery, social work, and pharmacy participated along with 25 preceptors. Participants were surveyed on their attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration pre and post-intervention and participated in focus groups. While attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration did not change quantitatively, focus groups revealed changes in language and enhanced perspectives of participants. Based on the evaluation data, the GITT 2.0 Toolkit was refined for use in interprofessional education and practice activities related to quality initiatives.

Identifying a Relationship Between Physical Frailty and Heart Failure Symptoms	JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING			English	Article						heart failure; physical frailty; symptoms	VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE; MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; DESTINATION THERAPY; GAIT SPEED; IMPAIRMENT; VALIDITY; DISEASE; CARE; TRANSPLANTATION	Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant symptom burden; however, our understanding of the relationship between symptoms and physical frailty in HF is limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. Methods: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. Results: The mean age of the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 +/- 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P < .001), 75% worse wake disturbances (P < .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. Conclusions: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.

Barriers and enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in heart failure with atrial fibrillation: patient and provider perspectives	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; caregiver; heart failure; medication adherence; stroke prevention; thromboprophylaxis	ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY; MEDICATION ADHERENCE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; SELF-CARE; RISK; OUTCOMES; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; FRAILTY; HEALTH	Aims & ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to elucidate the barriers and enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in individuals with chronic heart failure (CHF) with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) from the perspective of patients and providers. BackgroundCHF and AF commonly coexist and are associated with increased stroke risk and mortality. Oral anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke risk and improves outcomes. Yet, in approximately 30% of cases, anticoagulation is not commenced for a variety of reasons. DesignQualitative study using narrative inquiry. MethodsData from face-to-face individual interviews with patients and information retrieved from healthcare file note review documented the clinician perspective. This study is a synthesis of the two data sources, obtained during patient clinical assessments as part of the Atrial Fibrillation And Stroke Thromboprophylaxis in hEart failuRe (AFASTER) Study. ResultsPatient choice and preference were important factors in anticoagulation decisions, including treatment burden, unfavourable or intolerable side effects and patient refusal. Financial barriers included cost of travel, medication cost and reimbursement. Psychological factors included psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment and depression. Social barriers included homelessness and the absence of a caregiver or lack of caregiver assistance. Clinician reticence included fear of falls, frailty, age, fear of bleeding and the challenges of multimorbidity. Facilitators to successful prescription and adherence were caregiver support, reminders and routine, self-testing and the use of technology. ConclusionsMany barriers remain to high-risk individuals being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. There are a number of enabling factors that facilitate prescription and optimise treatment adherence. Nurses should challenge these treatment barriers and seek enabling factors to optimise therapy. Relevance to clinical practiceNurses can help patients and caregivers to understand complex anticoagulant risk-benefit information, and act as a patient advocate when making complex stroke prevention decisions.

J	Ljungbeck, B; Forss, KS				Ljungbeck, Birgitta; Forss, Katarina Sjogren			Advanced nurse practitioners in municipal healthcare as a way to meet the growing healthcare needs of the frail elderly: a qualitative interview study with managers, doctors and specialist nurses	BMC NURSING			English	Article						Advanced nurse practitioner; Content analysis; Doctors; Manager; Municipal healthcare; Qualitative research; Primary care; Specialist nurse	SATISFACTION; EXPERIENCES; FINLAND; ROLES	Background: The number of frail elderly people with complex nursing and medical care needs is increasing, and consequently, the healthcare burden. The implementation of Advanced Nurse Practitioners globally has been shown to make healthcare more effective and increase patient safety, continuity of care and access to care. In Sweden, research about Advanced Nurse Practitioners is limited. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the opinions of managers, doctors and nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare about the role of ANPs in municipal healthcare as a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of the frail elderly. Methods: Managers, doctors and specialist nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare adopted a qualitative, descriptive design through 12 semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using content analysis. Results: The participants expressed both opportunities as well as challenges with Advanced Nurse Practitioners in municipal healthcare. This role considered to satisfy frail elderly people's healthcare needs and making the healthcare more effective as the doctors would have more time for other patients. The challenges mainly consist of doubts from the managers whether the nurses would be motivated to pursue further education to become an Advanced Nurse Practitioner if the role becomes a reality. The doctors were unsure if the nurses would consider taking the responsibility the role would imply. Conclusions: Advanced Nurse Practitioner is considered to be a valuable resource not only for the frail elderly but also for the nurses in the municipal healthcare and for the doctors in primary care as they probably would make healthcare more effective. They might be a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of frail elderly, however there are also challenges to overcome before they can become a reality in a Swedish healthcare context. Consequently, this role deserves further investigation.

Our knowledge is limited regarding which needs for nursing interventions patients being cared for in their home have, and how they are met. We aimed at assessing aspects of health and function in a representative sample of the most vulnerable home-dwelling elderly, to identify their needs for nursing interventions and how these needs were met. Methods: In this observational study we included patients aged 75+ living in their own homes in Oslo, who received daily home care, had three or more chronic diagnoses, received daily medication, and had been hospitalized during the last year. Focused attention and cognitive processing speed were assessed with the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), handgrip strength was used as a measure of sarcopenia, mobility was assessed with the "Timed Up-and-Go" test, and independence in primary activities of daily living by the Barthel Index. Diagnoses and medication were collected from electronic medical records. For each diagnosis, medication and functional impairment, a consensus group defined which nursing service that the particular condition necessitated. We then assessed whether these needs were fulfilled for each participant. Results: Of 150 eligible patients, 83 were included (mean age 87 years, 25% men). They had on average 6 diagnoses and used 9 daily medications. Of the 83 patients, 61 (75%) had grip strength indicating sarcopenia, 27 (33%) impaired mobility, and 69 (83%) an impaired TMT-A score. Median amount of home nursing per week was 3.6 h (interquartile range 2.6 to 23.4). Fulfilment of pre-specified needs was >60% for skin and wound care in patients with skin diseases, observation of blood glucose in patients taking antidiabetic drugs, and in supporting food intake in patients with eating difficulties. Most other needs as defined by the consensus group were fulfilled in <10% of the patients. Conclusions: We identified a very frail group of home-dwelling patients. For this group, resources for home nursing should probably be used in a more flexible and pro-active way to aim for preserving functional status, minimize symptom burden, and prevent avoidable hospitalisations.

The clinical issues encountered by physicians when managing pain in patients dying with advanced dementia, and how these may impact on prescribing and treatment, are unknown. Aim: To explore physicians' experiences of pain management for patients nearing the end of life, the impact of these on prescribing and treatment approaches, and the methods employed to overcome these challenges. Design: Qualitative, semi-structured interview study exploring barriers to and facilitators of pain management, prescribing and treatment decisions, and training needs. Thematic analysis was used to elicit key themes. Setting/participants: A total of 23 physicians, responsible for treating patients with advanced dementia approaching the end of life, were recruited from primary care (n=9), psychiatry (n=7) and hospice care (n=7). Results: Six themes emerged: diagnosing pain, complex prescribing and treatment approaches, side effects and adverse events, route of administration, importance of sharing knowledge and training needs. Knowledge exchange was often practised through liaison with physicians from other specialities. Cross-speciality mentoring and the creation of knowledge networks were believed to improve pain management in this patient population. Conclusion: Pain management in end-stage dementia is complex, requiring cross-population of knowledge between palliative care specialists and non-specialists, in addition to collateral information provided by other health professionals and patients' families. Regular, cost- and time-effective mentoring and ongoing professional development are perceived to be essential in empowering physicians to meet clinical challenges in this area.

These patients tend to be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of stay (LOS). Aim: This series review provides a description of the patient complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb amputation for peripheral arterial disease. Method: Medical records coded for major amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed. Findings: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial morbidity and 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Major amputation continues to present challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding to surgery require further investigation.

Given the ageing population, the importance of providing appropriate, quality health care in the emergency department for this cohort is paramount. One possible solution, a nurse-led, physician-championed, emergency department gerontological intervention team, which provides frontload assessment, early collateral communication and appropriate discharge planning, has been developed. The aim of this Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention is to maximise the quality of care for this vulnerable cohort in a cost effective manner. Methods: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention research project consists of three interrelated studies within a program evaluation design. The research comprises of a structure, process and outcome framework to ascertain the overall utility of such a program. The first study is a pre-post comparison of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention in the emergency department, comparing the patient-level outcomes before and after service introduction using a quasi-experimental design with historical controls. The second study is a descriptive qualitative study of the structures and processes required for the operation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention and clinician and patient satisfaction with service models. The third study is an economic evaluation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention model of care. Discussion: There is a paucity of evidence in the literature to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in emergency departments designed to target frail older persons living in the community and residential aged care facilities. This is despite the high economic and patient morbidity and mortality experienced in these vulnerable cohorts. This research project will provide guidance related to the optimal structures and processes required to implement the model of care and the associated cost related outcomes.

Culturally linked risk factors and socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare disparities, and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy (HL) and HF are less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease management, or preventative health strategies. Objective: In this systematic review, we analyzed the literature studying older Latinos with HF and limited HL. Method: We searched the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. Inclusion criteria were research studies, Latinos, HF, and HL. Results: Eight quantitative studies were identified for final review. Inadequate HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL was associated with more HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL levels and higher medical complexity. Conclusions: Nurses and advanced practice nurses serve a pivotal role improving access and understanding of health information. Before conducting intervention research affecting clinical outcomes, it is essential to describe elderly Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. Barriers identified confirm the need to alter research protocols for older adults and ensure the availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older Latinos with HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients with limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be reliable predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, and develop, implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their health.

There is a gap between what research evidence shows is beneficial to caregivers and what is actually provided. Using an integrated knowledge translation approach, a stakeholder meeting was held among researchers, family caregivers, caregiver associations, clinicians, health care administrators, and policy makers. The objectives of the meeting were to review current research evidence and conduct multi-stakeholder dialogue on the potential gaps, facilitators, and barriers to the provision of caregiver supports. A two-day meeting was attended by 123 individuals. Three target populations of family caregivers were identified for discussion: caregivers of seniors with dementia, caregivers in end-of-life care, and caregivers of frail seniors with complex health needs. The results of this meeting can and are being used to inform the development of implementation research endeavours and policies targeted at providing evidence-informed caregiver supports.

Residents are increasingly older, frailer and have complex care needs on entry to residential aged care. Up to 63% of Australian residents of aged care facilities take nine or more medications regularly. Together, these factors place residents at high risk of adverse drug events. This paper reviews medication-related policies, practices and research in Australian residential aged care. Complex processes underpin prescribing, supply and administration of medications in aged care facilities. A broad range of policies and resources are available to assist health professionals, aged care facilities and residents to optiniise medication management. These include national guiding principles, a standardised national medication chart, clinical medication reviews and facility accreditation standards. Recent Australian interventions have improved medication use in residential aged care facilities. Generating evidence for prescribing and deprescribing that is specific to residential aged care, health workforce reform, medication-related quality indicators and inter-professional education in aged care are important steps toward optimising medication use in this setting.

Multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care: important considerations in treatment with anticoagulation drugs. Outcomes of the AFASTER study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING			English	Article						Chronic heart failure; atrial fibrillation; anticoagulation drugs; readmission to hospital; mortality; multi-morbidity; frailty; self-care	CHRONIC-HEART-FAILURE; CLINIC-BASED MANAGEMENT; ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; BLEEDING RISK; OLDER-ADULTS; GUIDELINES; STROKE; CONSULTATIONS; OUTPATIENTS; PREVENTION	Background: Chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are complex cardiogeriatric syndromes mediated by physical, psychological and social factors. Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these syndromes, particularly stroke. Purpose: This study sought to describe the clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors of adverse events. Methods: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding. Results: All-cause readmission to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. Self-reported self-care behaviour and not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Conclusion: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients and caregivers offers the potential to improve treatment knowledge, adherence and outcomes in this group of patients with complex care needs.

A community virtual ward model to support older persons with complex health care and social care needs	CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING			English	Article						community virtual ward; case management; integrated care; older persons' care; complex care	HIGH-RISK; CASE-MANAGEMENT; FRAILTY; READMISSION; PROGRAM; PEOPLE; FALLS	Background: Globally the older population is increasing rapidly. As a result there is an increase in frail older persons living within the community, with increased risks of a hospital admission and higher mortality and morbidity rates. Due to complexity of care, health care professionals face challenges in providing effective case management and avoiding unplanned admissions to hospital. A community virtual ward (CVW) model was developed to assist health care professionals to support older persons at home during periods of illness and/or functional decline. Methods: A quantitative observational study was conducted to examine if a CVW model of care reduced unplanned hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations in 54 patients over a 12-month period. The sign-rank test examined matched data on bed days, ED presentations, and unplanned hospital admissions pre-and post-CVW implementation. Other risk factors for admission to hospital were examined using the Mann-Whitney test preand post-CVW admission, including falls, living alone, and cognition. Correlations between hospital admission avoidances and unplanned hospital admissions and ED presentations were tested using Spearman's. test. Results: There was a reduction in ED presentations post-CVW admission (P<0.001), and median unscheduled admissions were reduced (P= 0.001). Those living alone had a lower number of ED presentations (median 0.5, interquartile range 0-1) prior to admission in comparison to those living with a caregiver, with no differences observed during admission to CVW. For those who experienced a fall during CVW admission, the odds ratio (OR) of requiring long-term care doubled for each extra fall (OR =2.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.52, P=0.025). Reduced cognition was associated with an increased risk of ED presentations (P= 0.292, P<0.05) but not associated with increased risks of unplanned hospital admissions (P= 0.09, P= 0.546). There were no significant correlations seen between admission avoidance and the number of unplanned hospital admissions or ED presentations. Conclusion: Through an integrated approach to care, a CVW model in the care of older persons can reduce ED presentations and unplanned hospital admissions.

J	Naughton, C; Hayes, N				Naughton, Corina; Hayes, Nicky			Deprescribing in older adults: a new concept for nurses in administering medicines and as prescribers of medicine	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Review							PEOPLE; CRITERIA	Deprescribing is a new and emerging theme in the care of older adults living with multimorbidities including frailty. Deprescribing requires a comprehensive review of risk and benefits of a medication in the context of the quality of remaining life and patient and family priorities and preferences. Nursing to date has not engaged with this issue, yet in their roles administering medicines and prescribing medicines they are a fundamental part of the pathway in deprescribing decisions and in supporting patients to make such decisions. In administering medicines, nurses are in a position to observe the degree of difficulty or burden experienced by patients due to polypharmacy or side effects of medicines. While as prescribers for adults with multimorbidities, active review of the risk and benefits of all medicines using evidence-based instruments is part of prescribing responsibility. This article is calling for a critical examination of nurses' roles in deprescribing and in supporting patients to make informed choices about their treatment. There is a need to articulate the role of nursing in this emerging area of medicines management and contribute to a multidisciplinary discourse on deprescribing. Equally professional standards and continuous professional development for nurses as prescribers and administrators of medicines needs to reflect the complexity of an older population. A deprescribing ethos challenges nurses to actively elicit patients' experiences of medicines burden, while nurse prescribers should recognise that appropriate deprescribing is as much a part of their role as appropriate prescribing.

While AT may extend independence in ageing, there are racial and ethnic disparities in late-life AT use, with lower rates reported among Hispanic older populations. The aim of this study was to identify barriers experienced by Hispanic community-living older adults for using AT. Sixty Hispanic older adults (70 years and older) with functional limitations participated in this study. A descriptive qualitative research design was used guided by the principles of the Human Activity Assistive Technology Model to gain in-depth understanding of participants' perspectives regarding barriers to using AT devices. Individual in-depth semi-structure interviews were conducted, using the Assistive Technology Devices Cards (ATDC) assessment as a prompt to facilitate participants' qualitative responses. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and rigorous thematic content analysis. Lack of AT awareness and information, cost of AT, limited coverage of AT by heath care plans, and perceived complexity of AT were the predominant barriers experienced by the participants. A multi-level approach is required for a better understanding of the barriers for using AT devices. The personal, contextual, and activity-based barriers found in this study can be used to develop culturally sensitive AT interventions to reduce existent disparities in independent living disabilities among older Hispanics.

Knowledge Gaps in Cardiovascular Care of Older Adults: A Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American Geriatrics Society: Executive Summary	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article							PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; GUIDELINES WRITING COMMITTEE; ANGIOGRAPHY-AND-INTERVENTIONS; EXPERT CONSENSUS STATEMENT; AORTIC-VALVE IMPLANTATION; FOR-VASCULAR-MEDICINE; TASK-FORCE; ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; THORACIC SURGEONS; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION	The incidence and prevalence of most cardiovascular disorders increase with age, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and major disability in adults aged 75 and older. Despite the effect of CVD on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in older adults, individuals aged 75 and older have been markedly underrepresented in most major cardiovascular trials, and virtually all trials have excluded older adults with complex comorbidities, significant physical or cognitive disabilities, frailty, or residence in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of older adults typical of those encountered in routine clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision-making, and recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these objectives, a detailed review was conducted of current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older adults. A pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision-making in older adults with CVD was found, as well as a paucity of data on the effect of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on outcomes that are particularly important to older adults, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large population-based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older adults representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to older adults in the study design. The results of these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines applicable to older adults and enhance person-centered care of older individuals with CVD in the United States and around the world.

J	Bail, K; Grealish, L				Bail, Kasia; Grealish, Laurie			'Failure to Maintain': A theoretical proposition for a new quality indicator of nurse care rationing for complex older people in hospital	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						Adverse events; Cross infection; Delirium; Dementia; Ethics; Geriatrics; Health care rationing; Hospital; Frail elderly; Resource allocation	URINARY-TRACT-INFECTIONS; ELDER-LIFE-PROGRAM; PATIENT OUTCOMES; PRESSURE ULCERS; OF-CARE; LEFT UNDONE; FUNCTIONAL DECLINE; WORK ENVIRONMENTS; STAFFING LEVELS; ADVERSE EVENTS	Complex older patients represent about half of all acute public hospital admissions in Australia. People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed. This paper offers a theoretical proposition of 'Failure to Maintain' as a conceptual framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of 'Failure to Maintain'. Hospital focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). 'Failure to Maintain' offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, this vulnerable population. Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide patient focussed care, and avoid 'Failing to Maintain'. The research field of acute geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.

The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. Background. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. Design. Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT). Methods. Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. Results. Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. Conclusions. Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.

J	Smith, MC; O'May, F; Tropea, S; Berg, J				Smith, Margaret Coulter; O'May, Fiona; Tropea, Savina; Berg, Jackie			Framing moving and handling as a complex healthcare intervention within the acute care of older people with osteoporosis: a qualitative study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						moving and handling patients; older people; osteoporosis; patient safety; qualitative research	HIP-FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; RISK; PREVENTION; MORTALITY; FRAILTY; NURSES; WOMEN; FALLS; STAFF	Aims and objectives. To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. Background. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched. Design. An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism. Methods. The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. Results. Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions. Conclusions. This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention.

Recently graduated nurses' experiences in municipal health care settings	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES			English	Article						Recently graduated nurses; municipal health care; virtues; professional pride; phenomenological hermeneutical	TRANSITION	BackgroundRecently graduated nurses are the future of the nursing profession and the municipal health care that will need nursing competency for an increasing number of frail elderly persons. This study is part of a larger project on newly graduated nurses where previous research indicated that building professional pride at their workplace could be important for remaining in the profession and in municipal health care. However, the recently graduated nurse's first job assignment in municipal health care can also be a critical period with cuts in their pride as nurses who may have an impact on nursing care for their patients. AimThe aim of this study is to illuminate recently graduated nurses' experiences with professional pride in municipal health and care services. MethodsA phenomenological hermeneutic approach was chosen to illuminate meaning. A purposive sample of eight recently graduated nurses working in nursing homes or home health care was chosen for this study with narrative interviews and diaries. FindingsThree themes were identified: doing the good thing and doing what is right; being recognized and confirmed; and finally thriving in a community of practice. An important source of pride is the relation to patients. Recently graduated nurses build their professional pride in an active and social process in a community of practice. The first cut in their professional pride seems to take place when they were not recognized and confirmed as professional persons. ConclusionRecently graduated nurses in municipal health care describe their professional pride as a complex phenomenon with relational, dynamic and collective dimensions. The cuts in their pride may hurt their identity and nursing care.

J	Nyborg, I; Kvigne, K; Danbolt, LJ; Kirkevold, M				Nyborg, Ingrid; Kvigne, Kari; Danbolt, Lars Johan; Kirkevold, Marit			Ambiguous participation in older hospitalized patients: gaining influence through active and passive approaches-a qualitative study	BMC NURSING			English	Article						Patient participation; Older patients; Family; Next of kin; Geriatrics; Hospital ward; Phenomenological hermeneutics	FRAIL ELDERLY-PATIENTS; DECISION-MAKING; HEALTH-CARE; INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCES; PREFERENCES; ADULTS; WARDS	Background: Patient participation is required by law in Norway and in several western countries. Current participation ideology is based on individualism, which may conflict with the older generation's commonly held values of solidarity and community. Hence, different values and ideologies may come in conflict when older patients receive treatment and rehabilitation in geriatric wards. Participation is a guiding principle in rehabilitation. Criteria for admission of older patients to geriatric wards are complex health problems, acute illness and/or acute physical and/or cognitive functional failure. The ideal is an active and engaged patient. The aim of the study was to describe the difficulties experienced by older patients on acute geriatric wards when involving themselves with their own treatment and care. Methods: In this qualitative study older patients were interviewed during hospitalization in geriatric wards and asked to tell about their experiences with participation. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. Results: The patients experienced difficulties in participating in decisions and care. They linked their difficulties to their own diminishing capabilities, and cited the ward's busy schedule as a reason for abstaining from participation. However, despite their reservations, they did participate in decisions in different ways. Their participatory practices appeared ambiguous and they employed various strategies to put themselves in a position of influence. The most important of these involved their relatives. The patients delegated to family the tasks of seeking, receiving and giving information to the nurses and the staff, and, to some extent, for the dialogues with hospital staff about their needs and plan of care. The family appeared to accept the responsibility willingly. Conclusions: The patients addressed their difficulties by authorizing family members to act and participate on their behalf. This underlines the family's important role in patient participation and the role that nurses and other staff must play in collaborating with the patient and their family to facilitate participation independently of the patients' performances of participation.

Mobile health ( mHealth) technologies have shown promise in supporting older persons to manage chronic conditions; however, there remains a dearth of evidence-informed guidance to develop such innovations. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to conduct a scoping review of current practices and recommendations for designing, implementing, and evaluating mHealth technologies to support the management of chronic conditions in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A 5-stage scoping review methodology was used to map the relevant literature published between January 2005 and March 2015 as follows: ( 1) identified the research question, ( 2) identified relevant studies, ( 3) selected relevant studies for review, ( 4) charted data from selected literature, and ( 5) summarized and reported results. Electronic searches were conducted in 5 databases. In addition, hand searches of reference lists and a key journal were completed. Inclusion criteria were research and nonresearch papers focused on mHealth technologies designed for use by community-living older adults with at least one chronic condition, or health care providers or informal caregivers providing care in the home and community setting. Two reviewers independently identified articles for review and extracted data. Results: We identified 42 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, described innovations focused on older adults with specific chronic conditions ( n= 17), chronic conditions in general ( n= 6), or older adults in general or those receiving homecare services ( n= 18). Most of the mHealth solutions described were designed for use by both patients and health care providers or health care providers only. Thematic categories identified included the following: ( 1) practices and considerations when designing mHealth technologies; ( 2) factors that support/ hinder feasibility, acceptability, and usability of mHealth technologies; and ( 3) approaches or methods for evaluating mHealth technologies. Conclusions: There is limited yet increasing use of mHealth technologies in home health care for older adults. A user-centered, collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to enhance feasibility, acceptability, and usability of mHealth innovations is imperative. Creating teams with the required pools of expertise and insight regarding needs is critical. The cyclical, iterative process of developing mHealth innovations needs to be viewed as a whole with supportive theoretical frameworks. Many barriers to implementation and sustainability have limited the number of successful, evidence-based mHealth solutions beyond the pilot or feasibility stage. The science of implementation of mHealth technologies in home-based care for older adults and self-management of chronic conditions are important areas for further research. Additionally, changing needs as cohorts and technologies advance are important considerations. Lessons learned from the data and important implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed to inform the future development of innovations.

J	Nilsson, A; Rasmussen, BH; Edvardsson, D				Nilsson, Anita; Rasmussen, Birgit H.; Edvardsson, David			A threat to our integrity - Meanings of providing nursing care for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES			English	Article						acute care; cognitive impairment; integrity; meaning; nursing; older people; personal-professional; phenomenological hermeneutical	MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS; ETHICAL CHALLENGES; JOB-SATISFACTION; NURSES; PEOPLE; WORK; DELIRIUM; PREVALENCE; CONSCIENCE; ATTITUDES	BackgroundOlder people with cognitive impairment represent a large group of patients in acute care settings. Research show that these acute care environments can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them. AimThis study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff. MethodA purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. FindingsCaring for older, acutely ill cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed. ConclusionThe comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' personal-professional integrity.

Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective. Objectives: To critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes. Methods: A review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose. Results: Five surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient. Conclusions: Historical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.

J	Morgan, B; Tarbi, E				Morgan, Brianna; Tarbi, Elise			THE ROLE OF THE ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSE IN GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY CARE	SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY NURSING			English	Article						older adult; geriatric oncology; gero-oncology nursing; advanced practice nurse	PATIENT-CENTERED CARE; PALLIATIVE CARE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; OLDER-ADULTS; CANCER CARE; DECISION-MAKING; SURVIVORSHIP; IMPACT; OUTCOMES; QUALITY	OBJECTIVES: To describe how the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) is uniquely suited to meet the needs of older adults throughout the continuum of cancer, to explore the progress that APNs have made in gero-oncology care, and make suggestions for future directions. DATA SOURCE: Google Scholar, PubMed, and CINAHL. Search terms included: "gero-oncology," "geriatric oncology," "Advanced Practice Nurse," "Nurse Practitioner," "older adult," "elderly," and "cancer." CONCLUSION: Over the last decade, APNs have made advances in caring for older adults with cancer by playing a role in prevention, screening, and diagnosis; through evidence-based gero-oncology care during cancer treatment; and in designing tailored survivorship care models. APNs must combat ageism in treatment choice for older adults, standardize comprehensive geriatric assessments, and focus on providing person-centered care, specifically during care transitions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: APNs are well-positioned to help understand the complex relationship between risk factors, geriatric syndromes, and frailty and translate research into practice. Palliative care must expand beyond specialty providers and shift toward APNs with a focus on early advanced care planning. Finally, APNs should continue to establish multidisciplinary survivorship models across care settings, with a focus on primary care.

Results from a competence measurement of nursing staff	BMC NURSING			English	Article							FOLLOW-UP; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS; HOME PATIENTS; OLDER-PEOPLE; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; DEMENTIA; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; NURSES	Background: Multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment leave many old patients in a frail condition with a high risk of adverse outcomes if proper health care is not provided. Knowledge about available competence is necessary to evaluate whether we are able to offer equitable and balanced health care to older persons with acute and/ or complex health care needs. This study investigates the sufficiency of nursing staff competence in Norwegian community elderly care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1016 nursing staff in nursing homes and home care services with the instrument "Nursing Older People - Competence Evaluation Tool". Statistical analyses were ANOVA and multiple regression. Results: We found that nursing staff have competence in all areas measured, but that the level of competence was insufficient in the areas nursing measures, advanced procedures, and nursing documentation. Nursing staff in nursing homes scored higher than staff in home care services, and older nursing staff scored lower than younger nursing staff. Conclusions: A reason for the relatively low influence of education and training on competence could be the diffuse roles that nursing staff have in community elderly care, implying that they have poor standards against which to judge their own competence. Clearer role descriptions for all groups of nursing staff are recommended as well as general competence development in geriatric nursing care.

Our emphasis was on validating an index of allostasis.Method: In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes.Results: Our results supported both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social support, optimism, and hope.Conclusion: Although these results are based on a small sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and physical resources and well-being.

The relationship between renal disease and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal dysfunction. Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller* or fallen or slip* or trip* or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency (chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal disease* or kidney disease* or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls were analyzed. Results: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between 1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce. Conclusions: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.

The aim of this study was to examine loneliness, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and health complaints in relation to health care consumption of in- and outpatient care among frail older people living at home. The study, with a cross-sectional design, comprised a sample of 153 respondents aged from 65years (mean age 81.5years) or older, who lived at home and were frail. Data was collected utilising structured interviews in the respondent's home assessing demographic data, loneliness, HRQoL and health complaints. Patient administrative registers were used to collect data on health care consumption. Loneliness was the dependent variable in the majority of the analyses and dichotomised. For group comparisons Students t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used. The results showed that 60% of the respondents had experienced loneliness during the previous year, at least occasionally. The study identified that lonely respondents had a lower HRQoL (p=0.022), with a higher total number of reported health complaints (p=0.001), and used more outpatient services including more acute visits at the emergency department, compared to not lonely respondents (p=0.026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a depressed mood was independently associated to total use of outpatient care (B=7.4, p<0.001). Therefore, it might not be loneliness, per se, that is the reason for seeking health care. However, reasons for using health care services are difficult to determine due to the complex situation for the frail older person. To avoid emergency department visits and to benefit the well-being of the frail older person, interventions targeting the complex health situation, including loneliness, are suggested.

Feasibility of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac surgery: A mixed-methods study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING			English	Article						Feasibility; frailty; older people; cardiac surgery; prevention; postoperative complications	COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTIONS; HIGH-RISK; CARE; PREVENTION; DELIRIUM; QUALITY; COMPLICATIONS; INSTRUMENTS; DEPRESSION	Background: Given the growing number of vulnerable, older cardiac surgery patients, the preadmission PREvention Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery patients (PREDOCS) programme was developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with the acceptability, compliance and delivery. Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings. Methods: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI). Results: Twenty-one females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients. Conclusions: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.

J	Kydd, A; Fleming, A				Kydd, Angela; Fleming, Anne			Ageism and age discrimination in health care: Fact or fiction? A narrative review of the literature	MATURITAS			English	Review						Ageism; Age discrimination; Health care; Old age; Person centred	PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION; OLDER-PEOPLE; ATTITUDES; INTERVENTIONS; TECHNOLOGY	Ageism and age discrimination are terms used in best practice statements and in the literature to define negative attitudes towards older people and towards people because of their age (whether old or young). However, 'old age' is a nebulous concept with definitions ranging from the over 50s to the over 85s. In seeking to explore ageism and age discrimination within health care, this paper discusses the concept of 'old' and discusses the findings of a narrative review of the literature on these two concepts. Results show that negative attitudes have been perceived by users of health care services, but the reasons are not clear. Such attitudes are usually reported in acute health care settings, where targets and quick turnover are encouraged. Thus people, usually those with complex needs, who require longer periods of recuperation and rehabilitation following an episode of ill health, are troublesome to staff working in a system geared up for early discharges. This type of service user is usually over the age of 85. Recommendations from this paper include the need for acute frailty units, with well trained staff, where frail older people can be comprehensively assessed, receive timely and targeted care, followed by a supported discharge.

The intervention included geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes. BackgroundImprovements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life satisfaction are not well explored. DesignRandomised controlled study. MethodsThe validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12months after the baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as well as six- to 12-month follow-ups. ResultsOlder persons who received the intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who received usual care, between 6 and 12month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. ConclusionsA comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Relevance to clinical practiceFrail older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.

Yet, a persistent lack of adequate oral care in long-term care (LTC) facilities exacerbates the burden of disease experienced by residents. The reasons for this are complex and create enormous challenges for care providers, clinicians, and administrators dedicated to comprehensive high quality care. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive program for daily mouth care for LTC. Design: A case study design using a participatory and qualitative approach examined how individual, organizational (workplace practices and culture), and system factors (standards and policy) influenced the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to improve the delivery of daily oral care in LTC. Setting and Participants: The research was undertaken in 3 LTC residences administered under the same health authority and included personal care providers, nurse managers, and directors of care. Intervention: A comprehensive program for care providers including, education, resources, and organizational guidelines, to improve the delivery of daily mouth care to LTC residents was created, rolled out, and refined over a 12-month period. Measurements: Data was collected through diary studies, targeted interviews, field notes, oral care activities records, site team meetings, and direct feedback from members of the care team. Results: The oral care intervention resulted in a heightened awareness, support and greater efficiency amongst care team. The presence of a "champion" was a key feature for sustaining processes. Management had a clear role to play to ensure support and accountability for the intervention. Conclusions: Optimizing oral care in long-term care can be achieved through an integrated approach that includes education, provision of resources, an oral care champion, support from managers and administrators, and appropriate organizational policy.

This study examines how older people cope with frailty within the context of a dedicated transition care programme and discusses implications for improving service delivery. Qualitative in-depth interviews were carried out during 2011 in the homes of 20 older people who had recently been discharged from a transition care programme operating in Adelaide, South Australia (average age 80years, 65% female). Thematic analysis identified three key themes: a new definition of recovery', complexities of control' and the disempowering system'. Despite describing many positive aspects of the programme, including meeting personal milestones and a renewed sense of independence, participants recognised that they were unlikely to regain their previous level of functioning. For some, this was exacerbated by lacking control over the transition care process while adapting to their new level of frailty. Overall, this research highlighted that benefits associated with transition care can be undermined by fragmentation in service delivery, loss of control and uncertainties around future support.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the reliability of the interRAI Long Term Care Facilities (interRAI LTCF) and the interRAI Home Care (interRAI HC), comprehensive and integrated assessment instruments with common core items, in Korea, an Asian county where comprehensive geriatric assessment is not widely used in long-term care. MethodsThe Korean version of the instruments was developed through field tests, as well as multiple iterations of translations, back-translations and expert reviews. For the reliability test, a random sample of 908 older people in 27 long-term care hospitals or nursing homes, or at home with home care, were assessed by regular staff, among which a subsample of 534 people were dually assessed. The Cronbach's alphas of seven major composite scales in the instruments were examined for internal consistency. Interrater reliability was tested using agreement, kappa coefficients and interclass correlation coefficients. ResultsThe internal consistencies of all key measures were adequate (Cronbach's alpha 0.75). The overall mean kappa statistics of the items in the interRAI LTCF and those in the interRAI HC were 0.78 and 0.89, respectively. All key common items in the interRAI LTCF and the interRAI HC had almost perfect (0.81) or substantial (0.610.80) interrater reliability. ConclusionsThe findings show the interRAI LTCF and the interRAI HC have adequate reliability for assessing the function and health of frail older adults across various long-term settings, which can promote continuity of care for the aged.

It is associated with dependence, disability, increased health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.

Methods: Qualitative research methods were used to investigate the perspectives of project leaders, project members and members of the steering committee responsible for the implementation of the programmes. Interviews were conducted in 2009 (n =10) and in 2012 (n=13) and a focus group was organised in 2012 (n=5). Main Findings: The interviews revealed that the implementation was influenced by the extent and quality of collaboration between organisations, adaptation to existing structures, future funding for the programmes and project leadership. A good relationship between participating organisations and professionals is required for successful implementation. A lack of clear project leadership and structural funding hampers the implementation of complex programmes in primary care settings. Implications for practice: The findings of this study are useful for organisations and professionals who are planning to implement complex programmes. Identifying barriers concerning institutional collaboration, adaptation to existing structures, leadership and continuation of financial support at an early stage of the implementation. process can support practitioners in overcoming them.

Protocol for the PREHAB study-Pre-operative Rehabilitation for reduction of Hospitalization After coronary Bypass and valvular surgery: a randomised controlled trial	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; 6-MINUTE WALK TEST; CARDIAC REHABILITATION; HIGH-INTENSITY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; HEART-FAILURE; EXERCISE INTENSITY; GRAFT-SURGERY; OLDER-ADULTS; GAIT SPEED	Introduction: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterised by reductions in muscle mass, strength, endurance and activity level. The frailty syndrome, prevalent in 25-50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, is associated with increased rates of mortality and major morbidity as well as function decline postoperatively. This trial will compare a preoperative, interdisciplinary exercise and health promotion intervention to current standard of care (StanC) for elective coronary artery bypass and valvular surgery patients for the purpose of determining if the intervention improves 3-month and 12-month clinical outcomes among a population of frail patients waiting for elective cardiac surgery. Methods and analysis: This is a multicentre, randomised, open end point, controlled trial using assessor blinding and intent-to-treat analysis. Two-hundred and forty-four elective cardiac surgical patients will be recruited and randomised to receive either StanC or StanC plus an 8-week exercise and education intervention at a certified medical fitness facility. Patients will attend two weekly sessions and aerobic exercise will be prescribed at 40-60% of heart rate reserve. Data collection will occur at baseline, 1-2 weeks preoperatively, and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcome of the trial will be the proportion of patients requiring a hospital length of stay greater than 7 days. Potential impact of study: The healthcare team is faced with an increasingly complex older adult patient population. As such, this trial aims to provide novel evidence supporting a health intervention to ensure that frail, older adult patients thrive after undergoing cardiac surgery. Ethics and dissemination: Trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national and international scientific meetings. The University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board has approved the study protocol V.1.3, dated 11 August 2014 (H2014:208).	[Stammers, Andrew N.; Kehler, D.

J	Shin, SY				Shin, So Young			Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis: An Integration of Theory of Symptom Management and Disablement Process Model	ASIAN NURSING RESEARCH			English	Review						arthritis; disabled persons; disease management; frail elderly; nursing theory	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; PREVALENCE	To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

Experience of Advanced Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Metasynthesis of Qualitative Research	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; advanced disease; ongoing needs; experience; qualitative; metasynthesis	OF-LIFE CARE; PALLIATIVE CARE; OLDER-ADULTS; COPD; END; NEEDS; MANAGEMENT; SYMPTOMS; PATIENT; BREATHLESSNESS	Context. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a life-limiting illness. Despite best available treatments, individuals continue to experience symptom burden and have high health care utilization. Objectives. To increase understanding of the experience and ongoing needs of individuals living with COPD. Methods. Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Sociological Abstracts were searched for articles published between January 1990 and June 2013. Metasynthesis of qualitative data followed the principles of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Metasyntheses are increasingly used to gain understandings of complex research questions through synthesizing data from individual qualitative studies. Descriptive and analytical themes were developed through thematic synthesis and expert panel discussion of extracted primary quotes, not the primary data themselves. Results. Twenty-two studies were included. Four hundred twenty-two free codes were condensed into seven descriptive themes: better understanding of condition, breathlessness, fatigue, frailty, anxiety, social isolation, and loss of hope and maintaining meaning. These seven themes were condensed further into three analytical themes that described the experience and ongoing needs of individuals with COPD: the need for better understanding of condition, sustained symptom burden, and the unrelenting psychological impact of living with COPD. Conclusion. Combining discrete qualitative studies provided a useful perspective of the experience of living with COPD over the past two decades. Further studies into the ongoing needs of individuals with COPD are unlikely to add to this well-established picture. Future research should focus on solutions through the development of interventions that address patients' ongoing needs. (C) 2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Development of a nursing intervention to prepare frail older patients for cardiac surgery (the PREDOCS programme), following phase one of the guidelines of the Medical Research Council	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING			English	Article						Frailty; older people; cardiac surgery; prevention; postoperative complications	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; EVALUATING COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; HIGH-RISK; CABG SURGERY; DELIRIUM; COMPLICATIONS; CHLORHEXIDINE; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION	Background: In older patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the timely identification and preparation of patients at risk for frequent postoperative hospital complications provide opportunities to reduce the risk of these complications. Aims: We developed an evidence-based, multi-component nursing intervention (Prevention of Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery Patients; the PREDOCS programme) for application in the preadmission period to improve patients' physical and psychosocial condition to reduce their risk of postoperative complications. This paper describes in detail the process used to design and develop this multi-component intervention. Methods: In a team of researchers, experts, cardiac surgeons, registered cardiac surgery nurses, and patients, the revised guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions of the Medical Research Council (MRC) were followed, including identifying existing evidence, identifying and developing theory and modelling the process and outcomes. Additionally, the criteria for reporting the development of complex interventions in healthcare (CReDECI) were followed. Results: The intervention is administered during a consultation by the nurse two to four weeks before the surgery procedure. The consultation includes three parts: a general part for all patients, a second part in which patients with an increased risk are identified, and a third part in which selected patients are informed about how to prepare themselves for the hospital admission to reduce their risk. Conclusions: Following the MRC guidelines, an extended, stepwise, multi-method procedure was used to develop the multi-component nursing intervention to prepare older patients for cardiac surgery, creating transparency in the assumed working mechanisms. Additionally, a detailed description of the intervention is provided.	[Ettema, Roelof G.

Do Gerontology Nurse Specialists Make a Difference in Hospitalization of Long-Term Care Residents? Results of a Randomized Comparison Trial	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article						homes for the aged; clinical nurse specialist; frail older adults; community outreach	POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS; OLDER-PEOPLE; AGED CARE; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; QUALITY; HOMES; POPULATION	Residents of long-term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program (RACIP) is a quality improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on-site support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology nurse specialists (GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of hospitalization 1year before and after program implementation. The sample included 29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention group (rate ratio (RR)=0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.61-0.86, P<.001). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group (69% increase) (RR=0.67, 95% CI=0.56-0.82, P<.001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention and comparison groups (RR= 1.0, 95% CI=0.68-1.46, P=.99). The integration of GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.

J	Bragstad, LK; Kirkevold, M; Foss, C				Bragstad, Line Kildal; Kirkevold, Marit; Foss, Christina			The indispensable intermediaries: a qualitative study of informal caregivers' struggle to achieve influence at and after hospital discharge	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Informal caregivers; Family; Consumer participation; Aged 80+; Informal help; Formal help; Home health care services	OLDER-PEOPLE; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; FORMAL SUPPORT; CARE; PARTICIPATION; EXPERIENCES; RELATIVES; TRANSITIONS; PERSPECTIVE; COMPANIONS	Background: The care policy and organization of the care sector is shifting to accommodate projected demographic changes and to ensure a sustainable model of health care provision in the future. Adult children and spouses are often the first to assume care giving responsibilities for older adults when declining function results in increased care needs. By introducing policies tailored to enabling family members to combine gainful employment with providing care for older relatives, the sustainability of the future care for older individuals in Norway is more explicitly placed on the family and informal caregivers than previously. Care recipients and informal caregivers are expected to take an active consumer role and participate in the care decision-making process. This paper aims to describe the informal caregivers' experiences of influencing decision-making at and after hospital discharge for home-bound older relatives. Methods: This paper reports findings from a follow-up study with an exploratory qualitative design. Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 19 informal caregivers of older individuals discharged from hospital in Norway. An inductive thematic content analysis was undertaken. Results: Informal caregivers take on comprehensive all-consuming roles as intermediaries between the care recipient and the health care services. In essence, the informal caregivers take the role of the active participant on behalf of their older relative. They describe extensive efforts struggling to establish dialogues with the "gatekeepers" of the health care services. Achieving the goal of the best possible care for the care recipient seem to depend on the informal caregivers having the resources to choose appropriate strategies for gaining influence over decisions. Conclusions: The care recipients' extensive frailty and increasing dependence on their families coupled with the complexity of health care services contribute to the perception of the informal caregivers' indispensable role as intermediaries. These findings accentuate the need to further discuss how frail older individuals and their informal caregivers can be supported and enabled to participate in decision-making regarding care arrangements that meet the care recipient's needs.

The Modified Hospital Elder Life Program Adapting a Complex Intervention for Feasibility and Scalability in a Surgical Setting	JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING			English	Article							SHARED RISK-FACTORS; GERIATRIC SYNDROMES; OLDER PATIENTS; INPATIENTS; EXERCISE; SURGERY; FRAILTY; ADULTS	The purpose of this article is to provide the rationale and methods for adapting the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP). The HELP is a complex intervention that has been shown to reduce rates of delirium and functional decline. However, modification of the program may be required to meet local circumstances and specialized populations. We selected three key elements based on our prior work and the concept of shared risk factors and modified the HELP to include only three shared risk factors (functional, nutritional, and cognitive status) that were targeted by three nursing protocols: early mobilization, oral and nutritional assistance, and orienting communication.

Nutritional status plays the mediating role of the functional status and comorbidity among older patients admitted to the Geriatric Evaluation and Management Unit: A Tobit model application	EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE			English	Article						Malnutrition; Functional status; Comorbidity; Geriatrics	INDEX; CHALLENGES; MORBIDITY; TAIWAN; FRAIL; PART	Health care for older people is featured by simultaneous management of the multiple comorbid complex conditions, including acute illnesses, underlying comorbid conditions, nutritional status, functional status and many others. The purpose of this study was to investigate nutritional status and its effect on the relationship between co-existing diseases and functional status among older patients admitted to the geriatric ward in Taiwan. A descriptive correlational design was used and data of 401 patients were retrospectively collected for analysis. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed for all patients, which included the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, the Barthel Index, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. The Tobit model was used to manage censoring data, and hierarchical logistic regressions were conducted to determine the relationships among nutrition status, functional status and comorbid conditions. A significant mediating effect of nutritional status on the relationship between multimorbidity and functional status was found. Although multimorbidity, nutritional status, and functional status are usually interlinked in geriatric care, results of this study showed that nutritional intervention may play a stronger role in improving functional status of older patients admitted for acute geriatric services. Further intervention study is needed to confirm the mediating role of nutritional status between comorbidity and functional status for older patients.

Screening for frailty in primary care: a systematic review of the psychometric properties of the frailty index in community-dwelling older people	BMC GERIATRICS			English	Article						Frailty; Systematic review; Psychometric properties; Primary care; Screening; Older patients	DEFICIT ACCUMULATION; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; HEALTH; ADULTS; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES; MORTALITY; CHINESE; IDENTIFICATION; INSTRUMENTS	Background: To better accommodate for the complex care needs of frail, older people, general practitioners must be capable of easily identifying frailty in daily clinical practice, for example, by using the frailty index (FI). To explore whether the FI is a valid and adequate screening instrument for primary care, we conducted a systematic review of its psychometric properties. Methods: We searched the Cochrane, PubMed and Embase databases and included original studies focusing on the criterion validity, construct validity and responsiveness of the FI when applied in community-dwelling older people. We evaluated the quality of the studies included using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. This systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA statement. Results: Of the twenty studies identified, eighteen reported on FIs derived from research data, one reported upon an FI derived from an administrative database of home-care clients, and one reported upon an FI derived from routine primary care data. In general, the FI showed good criterion and construct validity but lacked studies on responsiveness. When compared with studies that used data gathered for research purposes, there are indications that the FI mean score and range might be different in datasets using routine primary care data; however, this finding needs further investigation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the FI is a valid frailty screening instrument. However, further research using routine Electronic Medical Record data is necessary to investigate whether the psychometric properties of the FI are generalizable to a primary care setting and to facilitate its interpretation and implementation in daily clinical practice.

(PiTStop) - a complex intervention to prevent delirium in care homes for older people: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Pilot; Feasibility; RCT; Complex intervention; Older people; Delirium; Care home	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; NURSING-HOMES; VALIDATION	Background: Delirium (or acute confusion) is a serious illness common in older people, in which a person's thinking and perceptions may be affected. Reducing delirium is important because of the considerable distress it causes, and the poor outcomes associated with it, such as increased admissions to hospital, falls, mortality and costs to the National Health Service (NHS). Preventing delirium is possible using multicomponent interventions; successful interventions in hospitals have reduced it by one-third. However, there is little research to guide practice in care homes, where it is common because of the clustering of known risk factors (older age, frailty, and dementia). In previous work we developed a multicomponent intervention to prevent delirium in care homes, called Stop Delirium! The intervention was based upon evidence from the research literature relating to the prevention of delirium and on strategies to change professional practice. Before starting a large costly trial of Stop Delirium!, this pilot study will test and help improve the design and feasibility of the trial protocol. Methods/Design: We plan to conduct a cluster randomised pilot trial in 14 care homes (independent residential and nursing). Following recruitment of residents (over 60 years, consenting or with consultee agreement, able to communicate in English, and not in palliative care) participating homes will be randomised, stratified by size of home and proportion of residents with dementia. Stop Delirium! will be delivered to intervention homes over 16 months, with controls receiving usual care. The primary outcome measure will be the presence of delirium on any day during a one-month post-intervention period. We will collect data to determine 1) recruitment and attrition rates, 2) feasibility of various outcomes measurements, and 3) feasibility of capturing health resource use (resident diaries and by examining health records). We will estimate the between-cluster variation for the primary outcome, delirium occurrence. Discussion: This pilot study will refine methods for the definitive trial. The lessons learnt will also contribute to implementing National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) delirium guidelines, which recommend multicomponent interventions for delirium prevention.

SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Built environment; Neighborhood SES; Obesity; Aging	BODY-MASS INDEX; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; COMMUNITY DESIGN; WEIGHT-LOSS; URBAN FORM; HEALTH; ADULTS; WALKABILITY; WALKING	Neighborhood environment is consistently associated with obesity; changes to modifiable aspects of the neighborhood environment may curb the growth of obesity in the US and other developed nations. However, currently the majority of studies are cross-sectional and thus not appropriate for evaluating causality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a neighborhood-changing intervention on changes in obesity among older women. Over the past 30 years the Portland, Oregon metropolitan region has made significant investments in plans, regulatory structures, and public facilities to reduce sprawl and increase compact growth centers, transit-oriented development approaches, and green space. We used geocoded residential addresses to link data on land-use mix, public transit access, street connectivity, and access to green space from four time points between 1986 and 2004, with longitudinal data on body mass index (BMI) from a cohort of 2003 community-dwelling women aged 66 years and older. Height and weight were measured at clinic visits. Women self-reported demographics, health habits, and chronic conditions, and self-rated their health. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was assessed from census data. Neighborhood walkability and access to green space improved over the 18-year study period. On average there was a non-significant mean weight loss in the cohort between baseline (mean age 72.6 years) and the study's end (mean age 85.0 years). We observed no association between neighborhood built environment or change in built environment and BMI. Greater neighborhood socioeconomic status at baseline was independently associated with a healthier BMI at baseline, and protected against an age-related decline in BMI over time. BMI decreases with age reflect increased frailty, especially among older adults with complex morbidities. Future research should consider the influence of the neighborhood environment on additional relevant health outcomes and should include measures of the social environment in conjunction with built environment measures.

Because of the complex conditions associated with frailty, guidelines for frail older patients should be based on careful consideration of the characteristics of this population, balanced against the benefits and harms associated with treatment. In response to this need, the Diabetes Care Program of Nova Scotia (DCPNS) collaborated with the Palliative and Therapeutic Harmonization (PATH) program to develop and disseminate guidelines for the treatment of frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The DCPNS/PATH guidelines are unique in that they recommend the following: 1. Maintain HbA1c at or above 8% rather than below a specific level, in keeping with the conclusion that lower HbA1c levels are associated with increased hypoglycemic events without accruing meaningful benefit for frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The guideline supports a wide range of acceptable HbA1c targets so that treatment decisions can focus on whether to aim for HbA1c levels between 8% and 9% or within a higher range (ie,> 9% and < 12%) based on individual circumstances and symptoms. 2. Simplify treatment by administering basal insulin alone and avoiding administration of regular and rapid-acting insulin when feasible. This recommendation takes into account the variations in oral intake that are commonly associated with frailty. 3. Use neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin instead of long-acting insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine (Lantus) or insulin detemir (Levemir), as insulin analogues do not appear to provide clinically meaningful benefit but are significantly more costly. 4. With acceptance of more liberalized blood glucose targets, there is no need for routine blood glucose testing when oral hypoglycemic medications or well-established doses of basal insulin (used alone) are not routinely changed as a result of blood glucose testing. Although these recommendations may appear radical, they are based on careful review of research findings. Copyright (C) 2013 - American Medical Directors Association, Inc.

Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.

Exploring the expectations, needs and experiences of general practitioners and nurses towards a proactive and structured care programme for frail older patients: a mixed-methods study	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						frailty; practice nurses; general practitioner; older people; primary care	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS; HEALTH-CARE; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; RESEARCH AGENDA; MULTIMORBIDITY; PEOPLE; METAANALYSIS; CHALLENGES; DESIGN	Abstract Aim To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and practice nurses regarding the U-CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. Background Care for older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. Design An explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. Methods The barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and expectations regarding the U-CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires sent to all participating general practitioners (n = 32) and practice nurses (n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. Results Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to provide structured care. Conclusion This explanatory mixed-methods study showed that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U-CARE programme as feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care towards a proactive and preventive care approach.

Development of a Proactive Care Program (U-CARE) to Preserve Physical Functioning of Frail Older People in Primary Care	JOURNAL OF NURSING SCHOLARSHIP			English	Article						Frailty; comprehensive geriatric assessment; older people; primary care; nurse	COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; HEALTH-CARE; GERIATRIC SYNDROMES; CHRONIC ILLNESS; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; GUIDED CARE; ADULTS; INSTITUTE; DECLINE	Purpose: Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. Methods: The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. Findings: Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. Conclusions: Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice. Clinical Relevances: The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.

A nurse-led interdisciplinary primary care approach to prevent disability among community-dwelling frail older people: A large-scale process evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						Frail older people; Disability prevention; Interdisciplinary; Mixed-methods; Practice nurse; Process evaluation	REPORT SCREENING INSTRUMENTS; MEANINGFUL ACTIVITY; HOME; PROGRAM; IMPLEMENTATION; DEMENTIA; MANAGEMENT; TRIAL	Background: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated. Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design. Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands. Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (>= 70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded. Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions. Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. Conclusions: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the protocol need special attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Lower nutritional status and higher food insufficiency in frail older US adults	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						Frailty; Nutritional status; Food insufficiency	3RD NATIONAL-HEALTH; WOMENS HEALTH; VITAMIN-D; SERUM-ALBUMIN; CONSEQUENCES; ASSOCIATION; INSECURITY; OBESITY; MASS; MEN	Frailty is a state of decreased physical functioning and a significant complication of ageing. We examined frailty, energy and macronutrient intake, biomarkers of nutritional status and food insufficiency in US older adult (age >= 60 years) participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n 4731). Frailty was defined as meeting >= 2 and pre-frailty as meeting one of the following four-item criteria: (1) slow walking; (2) muscular weakness; (3) exhaustion and (4) low physical activity. Intake was assessed by 24 h dietary recall. Food insufficiency was self-reported as 'sometimes' or 'often' not having enough food to eat. Analyses were adjusted for sex, race, age, smoking, education, income, BMI, other co-morbid conditions and complex survey design. Prevalence of frailty was highest among people who were obese (20.8 %), followed by overweight (18.4 %), normal weight (16.1 %) and lowest among people who were underweight (13.8 %). Independent of BMI, daily energy intake was lowest in people who were frail, followed by pre-frail and highest in people who were not frail (6648 (SE 130), 6966 (SE 79) and 7280 (SE 84) kJ, respectively, P<0.01). Energy-adjusted macronutrient intakes were similar in people with and without frailty. Frail (adjusted OR (AOR) 4.7; 95% CI 1.7, 12.7) and pre-frail (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 0.8, 5.8) people were more likely to report being food insufficient than not frail people. Serum albumin, carotenoids and Se levels were lower in frail adults than not frail adults. Research is needed on targeted interventions to improve nutritional status and food insufficiency among frail older adults, while not necessarily increasing BMI.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination and technology. Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. Setting: Older adults having difficulty in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. Methods: All participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. Discussion: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.

Background Few studies have examined the interrelationships among caregivers' working conditions, care-giving dynamics and caregiver well-being. Design Cross-sectional, correlational study. Methods Data were collected by self-completed questionnaires from 176 primary family caregivers of patients with dementia in Taiwan from May 2005January 2006. Caregiver role strain and mental health were analysed by multiple regressions using a hierarchical method to enter independent variables and two- and three-way interaction terms after controlling for caregiver age and gender, employment status, and work flexibility and the simple effect of each independent variable. Results More preparedness was associated with less role strain for family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict. More care-giving demand was associated with poorer mental health only for caregivers with low work/care-giving conflict and with average and low preparedness, but not high preparedness. For family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict, more preparedness decreased role strain and maintained mental health even when care-giving demand was high. Conclusion These results provide a knowledge base for understanding complex family caregiver phenomena and serve as a guide for developing interventions. Future studies with longitudinal follow-ups are suggested to explore actual causal relationships.

Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated "sub-acute" frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants (n = 62) required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home.

During transitions, residents frequently experience care that is delayed, unnecessary, not evidence-based, potentially unsafe, and fragmented. Furthermore, a high proportion of residents and their family caregivers report substantial unmet needs during transitions. This study is part of a program of research whose overall aim is to improve quality of care for frail older adults who reside in NHs. The purpose of this study is to identify successful transitions from multiple perspectives and to identify organizational and individual factors related to transition success, in order to inform improvements in care for frail elderly NH residents during transitions to and from acute care. Specific objectives are to: 1. define successful and unsuccessful elements of transitions from multiple perspectives; 2. develop and test a practical tool to assess transition success; 3. assess transition processes in a discrete set of transfers in two study sites over a one year period; 4. assess the influence of organizational factors in key practice locations, e.g., NHs, emergency medical services (EMS), and EDs, on transition success; and 5. identify opportunities for evidence-informed management and quality improvement decisions related to the management of NH - ED transitions. Methods/Design: This is a mixed-methods observational study incorporating an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) approach. It uses data from multiple levels (facility, care unit, individual) and sources (healthcare providers, residents, health records, and administrative databases). Discussion: Key to study success is operationalizing the IKT approach by using a partnership model in which the OPTIC governance structure provides for team decision-makers and researchers to participate equally in developing study goals, design, data collection, analysis and implications of findings. As preliminary and ongoing study findings are developed, their implications for practice and policy in study settings will be discussed by the research team and shared with study site administrators and staff. The study is designed to investigate the complexities of transitions and to enhance the potential for successful and sustained improvement of these transitions.

Standards of medical care for nursing home residents in Europe	EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE			English	Article						Aged; Nursing homes; Care standards	OLDER-PEOPLE; PHYSICIAN	Objective: Nursing home inhabitants represent the most vulnerable and frail group of older people. They have more complex medical backgrounds and more significant care requirements. With an ever-ageing European population, the number of people requiring nursing home care will only increase. It is important then that we optimise the medical care of older people living in nursing homes. Methods: Formalized care standards are essential to optimal care but we feel that such guidelines are lacking. We decided to investigate this by means of a survey on nursing home care standards sent to the geriatric medicine societies around Europe. Results: Only five of 25 (20%) health services have a requirement for specific training in geriatric medicine for doctors in nursing homes, while only three of 25 (12%) countries have written medical care standards applicable to nursing home care provided by professional organizations. Four of 25 (16%) had a nursing home doctor society and one of these, The Netherlands, provided written medical care standards for nursing homes which were also adopted by the relevant general practitioner society. Discussion: The Europe-wide deficiency of documented care standards for nursing homes is alarming. It should be a prerequisite that physicians dealing with these complex patients have undertaken some level of specific training in geriatric medicine. It is important that geriatricians, old age psychiatrists and family doctors across European countries engage more formally on the development of appropriate models for both developing care standards and specifying appropriate training and support for doctors working in nursing homes.

This will lead to an increased need for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance personnel to understand and meet these patients' care needs. Using a caring science approach, we apply the patient's perspective, and the aim of this study is to identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the assessment category "general affected health condition". Thus, we have analyzed the characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state of "general affected health condition", as either illness or ill-health. This offers a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the concept of frailty ought to be included in "The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (ICD-10). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is designed to support holistic care planning and to transfer patient data across settings. Its usefulness in clinical decision making depends on the extent to which clinicians can rely on the patient data as accurate and meaningful indicators of patients functioning. But its multidimensional character implies challenges for clinimetric testing as some of the traditional analyses techniques cannot be unconditionally applied. The objective was to present an overview of methods to examine the reliability of the interRAI Acute Care. For each line of evidence, examples of hypotheses and research questions are listed.

DESIGN A systematic literature review sought studies from a variety of sources to compare survival and life expectancy of individuals with geriatric syndromes with those of the general population. SETTING Studies used reflected the general population. PARTICIPANTS Community-dwelling persons aged 65 and older. MEASUREMENTS Eight geriatric syndromes (multiple definitions) and survival. RESULTS Two thousand three hundred seventy-four publications were retrieved, and 509 publications of 123 studies were included. Seven geriatric syndromes (multiple comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, malnutrition, impaired homeostasis, and chronic inflammation) were associated with poor survival. In each case, the prevalence of a syndrome was negatively associated with mortality. Malnutrition and impaired homeostasis exerted twice the influence of factors such as multiple comorbidities and frailty. From age 65 to 74, only those who are very ill or frail (e.g., impaired homeostasis, low body mass index, or advanced dementia) have a higher risk of mortality than average older adults. In the old-old, particularly aged 90 and older, the added value of predicting survival beyond 1 year is minimal. CONCLUSION Geriatric syndrome information is helpful to understanding survival for younger old persons but provides little information about survival for the very old. Complex survival models add comparatively little benefit to more simply measured and calculated models. J Am Geriatr Soc 60:896-904, 2012.

J	Nakrem, S; Vinsnes, AG; Seim, A				Nakrem, Sigrid; Vinsnes, Anne Guttormsen; Seim, Arnfinn			Residents' experiences of interpersonal factors in nursing home care: A qualitative study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						Health care users' experiences; Long-term care; Patient-nurse interaction; Psychosocial well-being; Qualitative method; Quality of care	LONG-TERM-CARE; CENTERED CARE; OF-CARE; LIFE; ENVIRONMENTS; CONSUMERS; PROVIDERS; VIEWS	Background: With life expectancy lengthening, the number of those who will require care in a nursing home will increase dramatically in the next 20 years. Nursing home residents are frail older adults with complex needs, dependent on advanced nursing care. Long-term residents in nursing homes have long-term relationships with the nurses, which require a unique approach to the interpersonal aspects of nursing care. Understanding what is experienced as care quality, including quality of interpersonal processes, requires insight into the residents' perspectives for best value in care to be realized. Objective: Main objective was to describe the nursing home residents' experience with direct nursing care, related to the interpersonal aspects of quality of care. Design: A descriptive, exploratory design was used. Settings: Four public municipal nursing homes in Norway with long-term residents were purposely selected for the study. Participants: Fifteen mentally lucid residents were included. The inclusion criteria were aged 65 and over, being a resident of the nursing home for one month or longer, and physical and mental capacity to participate in the interview. Method: In-depth interviews with the residents were performed. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using meaning categorizing. Results: The residents emphasized the importance of nurses acknowledging their individual needs, which included need for general and specialized care, health promotion and prevention of complications, and prioritizing the individuals. The challenging balance between self-determination and dependency, the altered role from homeowner to resident, and feelings of indignity and depreciation of social status were key issues in which the residents perceived that their integrity was at risk in the patient-nurse interaction and care. Psychosocial well-being was a major issue, and the residents expressed an important role of the nursing staff helping them to balance the need for social contact and to be alone, and preserving a social network. Conclusions: Quality nursing care in nursing home implies a balanced, individual approach to medical, physical and psychosocial care, including interpersonal aspects of care. The interpersonal relationship between resident and nurse implies long-term commitment, reciprocal relationship on a personal level and interpersonal competence of the nurses to understand each resident's needs.

The Physician's Role in Patients' Nursing Home Care "She's a Very Courageous and Lovely Woman. I Enjoy Caring for Her"	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							ALL-INCLUSIVE CARE; LONG-TERM-CARE; PRESSURE ULCER SCALE; TRANSITIONAL CARE; OLDER AMERICANS; HOSPICE CARE; END; LIFE; RESIDENTS; SERVICES	More than 1.5 million adults live in US nursing homes, and approximately 30% of individuals in the United States will die with a nursing home as their last place of residence. Physicians play a pivotal role in the rehabilitation, complex medical care, and end-of-life care of this frail and vulnerable population. The reasons for admission are multifactorial and a comprehensive care plan based on the Minimum Data Set guides the multidisciplinary nursing home team in the care of the patient and provides assessments of the quality of care provided. Using the cases of 2 patients with different experiences, we describe the physician's role in planning for admission, participating as a team member in the ongoing assessment and care in the nursing home, and guiding care at the end of life. The increasing population of older adults has also promoted community-based and residential alternatives to traditional nursing homes. The future of longterm care will include additional challenges and rich innovations in services and options for older adults.

Contextual factors influencing success or failure of emergency department interventions for cognitively impaired older people: a scoping and integrative review	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Review						cognitively impaired; emergency department; frail older people; older adults; quality improvement	CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD; NURSES IMPROVING CARE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; MENTAL STATUS; HOSPITAL ADMISSION; REPEAT EMERGENCY; ADVERSE EVENTS; PATIENT SAFETY; SCREENING TOOL; ED PATIENTS	Aim. This paper is a report of a scoping review of research on cognitive impairment in older adults who visit Emergency Departments of acute care hospitals, followed by an integrative review that included a quality assessment to determine the effectiveness of interventions for this population. Background. Being old and cognitively impaired in the Emergency Department - a fast-paced intervention system -is a complex phenomenon that challenges many healthcare professionals. The rise in the incidence and prevalence of dementia will have a large impact on healthcare systems. Data sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, AgeLine, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2008, for qualitative or quantitative studies reporting extractable data on delirium or dementia in non-institutionalized older people (65+ years) in the Emergency Department. Review methods. Titles screened by a project researcher and checked against inclusion criteria by another researcher. Two reviewers completed independent data extraction and synthesis of included studies. Quality assessment occurred using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tools. Results. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for integrative review. Analysis of these studies indicates that the prevalence of cognitive impairment is high and improvements are needed. Contextual details and relevant features of an appropriate intervention are poorly explained. Conclusion. Although the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment is recognized, appropriate interventions and programmatic responses remain elusive. Quality improvements require more thorough examination of emergency department context to identify modifiable influencing factors that are transferable across settings.

New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is needed and the level of care that is provided.

J	McGeorge, SJ				McGeorge, S. J.			Unravelling the differences between complexity and frailty in old age: findings from a constructivist grounded theory study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						elderly care; geriatric psychiatry; mental health; nursing; qualitative methodology	ADULTS	Accessible summary UK health policy is often concerned with meeting the needs of the increasing number of older people in society and within some of this policy the concepts 'frailty' and 'complexity' have been used interchangeably. The concepts are not seen as the same by registered nurses who work in an older people's mental health service. Frailty is generally described as a physical state leading to inevitable decline and death. There is an abundance of research into frailty, much of which has the ultimate aim of prevention of disability and reduction of health care needs. Some critics view the emphasis on frailty as an example of the way that some health staff turn old age into a problem. To date, there has been little research into complexity in either old age, in mental health, or from a nursing perspective. Nurses described complexity as a dynamic state from which there can be 'recovery' and movement back and forth. Understanding complexity is important if the needs of older people are to be met effectively. This study found that nurses share common perceptions of complexity but do not always find it easy to articulate these. Abstract UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.

Optimising the care of primary breast cancer in older women-potential for a dedicated service	JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY			English	Review						Breast cancer; Older women; Cancer services; Multidisciplinary team	GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; STATEMENT; AGE; MANAGEMENT	The management of elderly patients with breast cancer is complex. Currently, most of their treatment guidelines have been adapted from studies conducted in younger patients. However, studies have shown that breast cancer in the elderly have distinctive biological characteristics from the young. Also, older patients have different needs from younger patients including increased frailty, decreased functional status, comorbidities, polypharmacy, cognition, psychosocial support and nutrition. These should be assessed appropriately to take into account their daily function and quality of life. A comprehensive geriatric assessment could help identify pre-treatment risk factors and could guide clinical decision making, improving morbidity and prognosis.

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						Hong Kong; nurses; nursing; older patients; qualitative; urinary tract infection	URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION; LONG-TERM; MANAGEMENT; RESISTANCE; ERA	Aims. This study aims to explore nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem. Background. Urinary tract infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition. Design. Qualitative. Methods. A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Results. When managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed the basis for deciding whether the patient's urinary condition should be managed by nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to improve nurses' existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified. Conclusion. Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem. Relevance to clinical practice. Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive 'basic urinary tract infection care' on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.

Perspective: Autonomic Care Systems for Hospitalized Patients	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article								With advancements of medical technology and improved diagnostic and treatment options, children with severe birth defects who would otherwise have no chance of surviving post birth survive to go home every day. The average lifespan in the United States has increased substantially over the last century. These successes and many other medical breakthroughs in managing complex illnesses, particularly in frail, elderly patients, have resulted in an increasing percentage of patients with comorbidities. This, coupled with a policy change by Medicare (i.e., Medicare will no longer reimburse hospitals for costs associated with treating preventable errors and injuries that a patient acquires while in the hospital), creates an enormous challenge to health care providers. To meet the challenge, the authors propose a new model of health care-the autonomic care system (ACS)-a concept derived from the intensive care unit and the autonomic computing initiative in the computer industry. Using wound care as an example, the authors examine the necessity, feasibility, design, and challenges related to ACS. Specifically, they discuss the role of the human operator, the potential combination of ACS and existing hospital information technology (e.g., electronic medical records and computerized provider order entry), and the costs associated with ACS. ACS may serve as a roadmap to revamp the health care system, bringing down the barriers among different specialties and improving the quality of care for each problem for all hospitalized patients.

The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement. Background. Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations. Design. This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. Methods. The convenience sample (n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results. Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. Conclusions. Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues. Relevance to clinical practice. Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.

These conditions frequently coexist, and each carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with hypertension. Data sources A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. Conclusions Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication management accordingly. Implications for practice This article will assist the NP to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.

This model was based on the adoption of smart home and intelligent assistive technologies. A technology research and development program was also established to promote independent living, improved quality of life and reduced unnecessary hospital admissions for the frail elderly, chronic illness sufferers and people with disabilities. The consortium joined the technology industry, care providers, government and researchers to a collaborative Research & Development program to assist people and their families. The first Phase has been completed and on-going streams of research have been established. These included the establishment of a demonstrator Smart Home in a residential retirement and aged care complex in a metropolitan setting in Queensland, Australia. This paper reports on the development of the model and outlines the project scope and experiences, the outcomes and learnings achieved, and details the planning considerations for future developments.

Objective: To evaluate if an additional evening meal could improve total daily food intake, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in frail elderly service flat (SF) residents. Design: Out of 122 residents in two SF complexes, 60 subjects agreed to participate, of which 49 subjects (median 84 (79-90) years, (25th-75th percentile)) completed the study. For six months 23 residents in one SF complex were served 530 kcal in addition to their regular meals, i.e. intervention group (I-group). Twenty-six residents in the other SF building were controls (C-group). Nutritional status, energy and nutrient intake, length of night time fast, cognitive function and HRQOL was assessed before and after the intervention. Results: At the start, the Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 27% as malnourished and 63% as at risk for malnutrition, with no difference between the groups. After six months the median body weight was unchanged in the 1-group, +0.6 (-1.7 - +1.6) kg (p=0.72) and the C-group -0.6 (-2.0 - +0.5) kg (p=0.15). Weight change ranged from -13% to +15%. The evening meal improved the protein and carbohydrate intake (p<0.01) but the energy intake increased by only 180 kcal/day (p=0.15). The night time fast decreased in the I-group from 15.0 (13.0-16.0) to 13.0 (12.0-14.0) hours (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in cognitive function or HRQOL between the groups. Conclusion: Nine out of ten frail elderly SF residents had nutritional problems. Serving an additional evening meal increased the protein and carbohydrate intake, but the meal had no significant effect on energy intake, body weight or HRQOL. The variation in outcome within each study group was large.	[Olin, A. Oedlund] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Nursing Dev, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Olin, A.

Who cares for older people with mental illness? A survey of residential aged care facilities in the Australian Capital Territory: Implications for mental health nursing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						dementia; mental health nursing; mental illness; residential aged care; social justice		Residential aged care facilities are increasingly becoming locations wherein the most frail and older people with mental illness live out the remainder of their lives, yet it has become apparent in recent years that these institutions are fraught with a variety of social and clinical problems. One issue of concern has been the exodus of registered nurses (both general and psychiatric), who have been increasingly replaced by carers with little or no expertise in psychiatric illness or disorders of cognitive decline. This 'de-professionalizing' of aged care has important implications for the well-being of clients, particularity those with complex mental health problems. In this survey we sought to discover demographic information concerning those who provide front-line care to this population of aged Australians, and we sought also to ascertain how much education in caring for residents who suffer specifically from neurodegenerative disorders (the dementias) and mental illness was provided by the facilities to those who care for such older people. The lack of training in the areas of mental health and cognitive impairment raises a variety of issues that mental health nurses need to address. These issues cover clinical, professional, and social justice dimensions. We believe that mental health nurses are strategically and professionally placed to take a leadership role in raising the profile of aged care in this country and they need to act proactively to secure the well-being of this particularly vulnerable client group.

In most cases survival and prognosis are significantly worse in rural and remote Australian populations who have less access to diagnostic and therapeutic services than metropolitan communities in this country. Research suggests that in general delays in diagnosis were a factor of misdiagnosis, the confounding effect of existing conditions and delayed or misleading investigation of symptoms. The aim of this study is to further explore the factors that impact on the speed of diagnosis in rural Western Australia with direct reference to General Practitioners (GPs) working in this setting. Methods: The methodology consisted of a structured discussion of specific cases. GPs based in two rural locations in Western Australia were asked to identify up to eight clinical cases for discussion. A diversity of cases was requested encompassing those with timely and delayed diagnosis of cancer. Focus groups were held with the practitioners to identify which factors under six headings delayed or facilitated the diagnosis in each case. A structured summary of the discussion was relayed to a wider group of GPs to seek additional views or comments on specific factors that impact on the speed of cancer diagnosis in rural and remote locations in Australia. Results: A number of factors affecting the speed of diagnosis were identified: the demographic shift towards a frailer and older population, presenting with multiple and complex diseases, increases the challenge to identify early cancer symptoms; seasonal and demanding work patterns leading to procrastination in presenting for medical care; unhelpful scheduling of specialist appointments; and the varying impact of informal networks and social relationships. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study we have generated a number of hypotheses that require formal evaluation: ( 1) GPs working within informal professional and social networks are better informed about their patients' health needs and have an advantage in making early diagnosis; ( 2) Despite the other differences in the population characteristics decentralising services would improve the prospect for timely diagnosis; and ( 3) Careful coordination of specialist appointments would improve the speed of diagnosis for rural patients.

Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what matters most in relation to their quality of life.

As a first step in developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer services than NHs. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Design: Cross-sectional and prospective study. Setting: Two municipal service flat complexes. Subjects: A total of 80 residents (median age 85.5 (79-90) y) with regular home care assistance participated. A subgroup of 35 residents took part in a re-examination 1 y later. Methods: Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Barthel Index and Health Index were used for the evaluation of nutritional, cognitive and ADL function and well-being, respectively. Results: In all, 30% of the frail and chronically ill service flat residents were assessed as malnourished and 59% were at risk of malnutrition. The malnourished residents had worse cognitive conditions (P < 0.001) and well-being (P < 0.05), lower functional ability (P < 0.01) and they had a greater need for daily assistance (P < 0.05) than the other residents. The median night fast period was 14.0 (12.5-15.0) h. Five subjects classified as malnourished at baseline had lost a median of -9.6 kg (range -11.0 to +7.3 kg) (P < 0.05) in body weight at the 1-y follow-up, which contrasted significantly from the weight stability in residents classified as at risk for malnutrition or well-nourished. Conclusion: Out of 10 residents, nine were assessed to have impending nutritional problems that related to impaired wellbeing, cognition, and functional ability. Malnourished residents had a significant weight loss over one year. Studies are needed to determine whether weight loss and nutrition-related dysfunction in service flat residents are preventable or treatable.

J	Markle-Reid, M; Browne, G				Markle-Reid, M; Browne, G			Conceptualizations of frailty in relation to older adults	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Review						frail; older people; models; theoretical; literature review; conceptual model; clinical; policy; research; nursing	ELDERLY PATIENTS; PHYSICAL FRAILTY; CASE-MANAGEMENT; FICSIT TRIALS; WEIGHT-LOSS; DISABILITY; CARE; COMMUNITY; MORTALITY; PEOPLE	Aim. The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy in identifying and describing older adults as frail. Background. Despite the dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. Method. The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. Conclusion. The review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the contribution of both individual and environmental factors.

Physicians and families face choices about whether to withhold antibiotics when patients are expected to die soon or when treatment may be burdensome. However, little information exists on what factors influence this complex decision-making process. Objective: To identify factors associated with decisions on whether to withhold curative antibiotic treatment in patients with dementia who have pneumonia. Methods: We performed an observational cohort study with 3-month monitoring for cure and death. Patients with pneumonia (N = 706) were enrolled in nursing home units for patients with dementia from all over the Netherlands (61 nursing homes). Characteristics of patients, physicians, and facilities were related to the outcome of withholding antibiotic treatment. Results: In 23% of the patients, antibiotic treatment was withheld. The other patients received antibiotics with palliative (8%) or curative (69%) intent. Compared with the patients who received antibiotics with curative intent, patients in whom antibiotic treatment was withheld had more severe dementia, had more severe pneumonia, had lower food and fluid intake, and were more often dehydrated. In addition, withholding antibiotics occurred more often in the summer and in patients with an initial episode of pneumonia. Characteristics of facilities and physicians were unrelated to the decision. However, considerable variation occurred in how patient age, aspiration, and history of pneumonia were related to decision making by individual physicians. Conclusions: In the Netherlands, antibiotic treatment is commonly withheld in pneumonia patients with severe dementia who are especially frail. Understanding the circumstances in which this occurs can illuminate the international discussion of appropriate dementia care.

The patient is assessed simultaneously by different disciplines to develop a holistic and practical plan of care. It is termed "arena assessment," borrowing from the pediatric literature on transdisciplinary assessment of children. The article explores the benefits and limitations of this approach for patients and families, as well as for professional learners. Case examples illustrate use of the model from community-based to institutional care.

With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. Aims of the paper. This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of research related to ethical practice. Conclusions. Recruitment of frail older people to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older people to research while protecting their right to refuse.

ADVANCES IN NURSING SCIENCE			English	Article						caregiving; eldercare; feminism; home care; relationships	PATIENT INTERACTIONS; NURSING-HOME; PHYSICIAN; WORKERS; REFORM; WOMEN	Increasing reliance on family care of elderly people at home calls for a critical analysis of the relationship between formal and informal caregivers. Although much has been written about how health professionals and family caregivers should relate to one another, we know very little about the relationships that develop between them. Using data from a qualitative study, this article illustrates that relationships between community nurses and family members caring for frail elders are complex. dynamic, and multifaceted. Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient. Each type is described, and implications for nursing practice and research are discussed.

Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively with members of a multidisciplinary team.

The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.

Home care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A major theme identified was ''Circles of Care.'' Grounded in rural culture. the circles assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.

J	JACKSON, MF				JACKSON, MF			DISCHARGE PLANNING - ISSUES AND CHALLENGES FOR GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING - A CRITIQUE OF THE LITERATURE	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article							GERIATRIC CONSULTATION TEAM; FRAIL ELDERLY PATIENTS; REHABILITATION UNIT; CONTROLLED TRIAL; CLINICAL-TRIAL; MEDICAL WARDS; CARE; STAY; HOSPITALIZATION; PLACEMENT	Families are rapidly becoming unpaid givers of complex care. Using McKeehan & Coulton's systems model, this critique reviews the evolution of the structure and processes of discharge planning programmes. It explores three common assumptions: discharge planning programmes are cost-effective, allow for enhancement of patients' and families' quality of life, and ensure continuity of care between hospital and community. Funds are saved due to decreased lengths of initial hospital admissions and readmission rates. However, the cost of additional hospital and community resources is rarely considered. Little evidence supports the concept that discharge planning directly affects a patient's health status. Patients and families often do not perceive the same level of benefit from discharge planning as do health professionals. Several issues surrounding research methodologies used in the reviewed studies are identified. Of particular concern is the lack of qualitative research into patients' and families' experiences. The critique concludes with an exploration of ethical issues and challenges arising from increased emphasis on cost-effective discharge planning. These include patients' rights, provision of sufficient human, social and financial resources, improved hospital-community communications, and control over hospital-developed but community-implemented programmes.
