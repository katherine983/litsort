1	Use Of Latent Class Analysis And K-Means Clustering To Identify Complex Patient Profiles.	2020	1	10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.29068			1	3	12	e2029068	This cohort study uses data clustering methods and clinical stakeholder assessment to identify clinical profiles in a population of medically complex patients. Key Points: Question: What distinct clinical profiles can be identified within a population of the most medically complex patients? Findings: In this cohort study of 104 869 individuals, data clustering methods were combined with clinical stakeholder assessment to define clinical profiles within the top 3% most medically complex adult patients in a large integrated care system: high acuity, older with cardiovascular complications, frail elderly, pain management, psychiatric illness, cancer treatment, and less engaged. These profiles had significantly different 1-year health care utilization and mortality, and each profile suggested different adjunctive care strategies. Meaning: The findings suggest that a single care model may not meet the needs of adults with high comorbidity and care utilization. Importance: Medically complex patients are a heterogeneous group that contribute to a substantial proportion of health care costs. Coordinated efforts to improve care and reduce costs for this patient population have had limited success to date. Objective: To define distinct patient clinical profiles among the most medically complex patients through clinical interpretation of analytically derived patient clusters. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed the most medically complex patients within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system, based on comorbidity score, prior emergency department admissions, and predicted likelihood of hospitalization, from July 18, 2018, to July 15, 2019. From a starting point of over 5000 clinical variables, we used both clinical judgment and analytic methods to reduce to the 97 most informative covariates. Patients were then grouped using 2 methods (latent class analysis, generalized low-rank models, with k-means clustering). Results were interpreted by a panel of clinical stakeholders to define clinically meaningful patient profiles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Complex patient profiles, 1-year health care utilization, and mortality outcomes by profile. Results: The analysis included 104 869 individuals representing 3.3% of the adult population (mean [SD] age, 70.7 [14.5] years; 52.4% women; 39% non-White race/ethnicity). Latent class analysis resulted in a 7-class solution. Stakeholders defined the following complex patient profiles (prevalence): high acuity (9.4%), older patients with cardiovascular complications (15.9%), frail elderly (12.5%), pain management (12.3%), psychiatric illness (12.0%), cancer treatment (7.6%), and less engaged (27%). Patients in these groups had significantly different 1-year mortality rates (ranging from 3.0% for psychiatric illness profile to 23.4% for frail elderly profile; risk ratio, 7.9 [95% CI, 7.1-8.8], P <.001). Repeating the analysis using k-means clustering resulted in qualitatively similar groupings. Each clinical profile suggested a distinct collaborative care strategy to optimize management. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that highly medically complex patient populations may be categorized into distinct patient profiles that are amenable to varying strategies for resource allocation and coordinated care interventions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=147544359&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	0	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	1	JAMA Network Open		1	grant,richard.w	grant	richard.w
2	Nurse Case Manager: Measurement Of Care Coordination Activities And Quality And Resource Use Outcomes When Caring For The Complex Patient With Hematologic Cancer.	2020	2	10.1188/20.CJON.65-74			2	24	1	65	BACKGROUND: The lack of coordination of care for complex patients in the hematology setting has prompted nurse case managers (NCMs) to coordinate that care. OBJECTIVES: This article aimed to identify the frequency of NCM care coordination activities and quality and resource use outcomes in the complex care of patients in the hematology setting. METHODS: NCM aggregate data from complex outpatients with hematologic cancer were retrieved from electronic health records at a comprehensive cancer center in the midwestern United States. Total volume of activities and outcomes were calculated as frequency and percentage. FINDINGS: Care coordination activities included communicating; monitoring, following up, and responding to change; and creating a proactive plan of care. Quality outcomes included improving continuity of care and change in health behavior, and resource use outcomes most documented were patient healthcare cost savings.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141312898&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	2	Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing	1	2	garnett,doris	garnett	doris
3	Management Of Depression And Referral Of Older People To Psychological Therapies: A Systematic Review Of Qualitative Studies.	2019	3	10.3399/bjgp19X701297	NLM30745355		3	69	680	e171	Background: Depressive symptoms are common in later life and increase both the risk of functional and cognitive decline and the use of healthcare services. Despite older people expressing preferences for talking therapies, they are less likely to be referred than younger adults, particularly when aged ≥80 years.Aim: To explore how healthcare professionals (HCPs) manage older people in relation to depression and referrals to psychological therapies.Design and Setting: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.Method: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Social Sciences Citation Index (inception-March 2018) were searched for studies exploring HCPs' views regarding management of late-life depression across all settings. Studies of older people's views or depression management across all ages were excluded.Results: In total, 27 studies, were included; these predominantly focused on the views of GPs and primary and community care nurses. Many HCPs felt that late-life depression was mainly attributable to social isolation and functional decline, but treatments appropriate for this were limited. Clinicians perceived depression to have associated stigma for older adults, which required time to negotiate. Limited time in consultations and the complexity of needs in later life meant physical health was often prioritised over mental health, particularly in people with frailty. Good management of late-life depression appeared to depend more on the skills and interest of individual GPs and nurses than on any structured approach.Conclusion: Mental ill health needs to be a more-prominent concern in the care of older adults, with greater provision of psychological services tailored to later life. This may facilitate future identification and management of depression.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=134963977&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	0	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	3	British Journal of General Practice		3	frost,rachael	frost	rachael
4	Skin Tears In The Aging Population: Remember The 5 Ws.	2018	4				4	19	1	15	Skin tears represent a relevant clinical consequence of age-associated skin vulnerability, and are extremely common among frail and older individuals. They are acute wounds with the potential to be closed by primary intention, however they are often mismanaged and misdiagnosed and transition to become chronic and complex wounds. Reported skin tear prevalence suggests they are a growing healthcare problem which have a profound impact on the health and wellbeing of affected individuals and a great financial burden to healthcare systems. With the aging global population, it can be assumed that the prevalence of skin tears will continue to increase proportionally with the aging population. In order to minimize the impact of skin tears clinicians must to be aware of what skin tears are, who is at risk, why and when they occur, and how to manage skin tears when they do occur. The purpose of this article is to assist clinicians with the prediction, prevention, assessment and management of skin tears among the aging population across healthcare sectors.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=130482565&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	4	EWMA Journal		4	vanzi,valentina	vanzi	valentina
5	Identifying A Relationship Between Physical Frailty And Heart Failure Symptoms.	2018	5	10.1097/JCN.0000000000000408			5	33	1	E1	Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant symptom burden; however, our understanding of the relationship between symptoms and physical frailty in HF is limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty in adults with HF. Methods: A sample of adults with symptomatic HF were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Physical symptoms were measured with the HF Somatic Perception Scale-Dyspnea subscale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory short form. Affective symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Brief Symptom Inventory-Anxiety scale. Physical frailty was assessed according to the Frailty Phenotype Criteria: shrinking, weakness, slowness, physical exhaustion, and low physical activity. Comparative statistics and generalized linear modeling were used to quantify associations between symptoms and physical frailty, controlling for Seattle HF Model projected 1-year survival. Results: The mean age of the sample (n = 49) was 57.4 T 9.7 years, 67% were male, 92% had New York Heart Association class III/IV HF, and 67% had nonischemic HF. Physically frail participants had more than twice the level of dyspnea (P < .001), 75% worse wake disturbances (P < .001), and 76% worse depressive symptoms (P = .003) compared with those who were not physically frail. There were no differences in pain or anxiety. Conclusions: Physically frail adults with HF have considerably worse dyspnea, wake disturbances, and depression. Targeting physical frailty may help identify and improve physical and affective symptoms in HF.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=126986437&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	4	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	5	Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing	1	5	denfeld,quin.e	denfeld	quin.e
6	"""I Didn'T Know He Was Dying""."	2016	6	10.1097/NJH.0000000000000215			6	18	1	74	Research is limited on end-of-life care decision-making for older adults with chronic conditions whose end-of-life trajectory is difficult to predict because of their complex and frail condition. Semistructured interviews were conducted with family members of 22 deceased older adults to explore their experiences with end-of-life decision-making with/for their loved ones. Participants did not identify a specific time they made an end-of-life care decision as they did not know the older adult was at the end of life, health care providers did not ask them to make a decision, or they had to make forced decisions, and subsequently they experienced regret about the end-of-life care their family member received. End-of-life care decisions were dependent on the awareness of approaching death by participants, their loved ones, and health care providers. Health care providers being aware of the possibility of approaching death and assisting family members to make decisions that would honor the older adult's preference by explaining possible care options and what each care options would mean to them are key to providing quality end-of-life care for these individuals.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=112468227&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	6	Journal of Hospice & Palliative Nursing	1	6	shigeko,(seiko).izumi	shigeko	(seiko).izumi
7	Fragility In The Elderly Participants Of Coexistence And Health Promotion Groups In The Aging.	2016	7	10.17784/mtprehabjournal.2016.14.353			7	14		1	INTRODUCTION: The frailty syndrome is a complex condition that permeates the life of the elderly, with the decrease of the homeostatic reserve of the organism and loss of resistance to the stressors, caused as results of many factors, but mainly by sarcopenia. Such syndrome makes the elderly vulnerable to illness and may lead to terminal stages of life if there is no adequate treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of the factors related to the frailty phenotype in the occurrence of this in participants of groups of coexistence and health promotion of the city of Santa Cruz/RN. METHOD: This is a descriptive, associative and transversal of quantitative approach study with 60 elderly. The socioeconomic condition and the fragility phenotype was evaluated. RESULTS: the mean age of the sample was 66.1 years (SD=5.08). Most of them (53.3%) are in the age group of 60-69 years, does not have a partner (63.4%) and are illiterate (58.3%). In the mentioned morbidity, 42 (70%) reported some morbidity and hypertension was more prevalent in the sample (53.3%), followed by diabetes (20%) and osteoporosis (18.3%). Four elderly were fragile, forty-nine were pre-fragile and seven were non-fragile. There was a significant correlation in unintentional loss of weight (0.017), exhaustion (<0.001) and slowness in gait (<0.001) in the occurrence of pre-frailty. CONCLUSION: the prevalence of pre-frailty indicators in the investigated groups indicates warning signs so that actions more strongly linked to the prevention of this aggravation become a priority in the planning of the undertaken interventions in groups. Participation in social groups has a protective effect in the prevention of frailty in the elderly.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=131616016&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	0	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	7	Manual Therapy, Posturology & Rehabilitation Journal		7	fagundes,de.lima.filho.bartolomeu	fagundes	de.lima.filho.bartolomeu
8	Frailty In Older Adults: An Evolutionary Concept Analysis.	2015	8	10.1891/1541-6577.29.1.66			8	29	1	66	The term frailty is often used to describe a subset of the older population with complex health issues. It is associated with dependence, disability, increased health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult's susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111386013&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	3	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	8	Research & Theory for Nursing Practice	1	8	tocchi,christine	tocchi	christine

Therefore, it is important to identify frail individuals. Theoretical Framework: The Vulnerability/Risk/ Human Response/Care Model. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a measure to identify frail older adults. Methods: Instrument development encompassed the following: delineation of content domains, item generation, content validity, quantitative content validity analysis, and psychometric analysis. Results: Findings indicated the following: (a) Frailty is a complex concept, (b) the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE) is composed of 10 items, (c) FIFE was able to predict depression, and (d) FIFE was able to differentiate differences in demographic profiles by social support environment. Conclusions: FIFE is a valid instrument. FIFE can be used to study the relationships among frailty determinants, provide standardized measurement, and develop and measure interventional studies.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=109793115&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	2	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	9	Journal of Nursing Measurement	1	8	tocchi,christine	tocchi	christine
10	Developing Advanced Nursing Skills For Frail Older People.	2014	10	10.7748/nop2014.04.26.4.20.e561	NLM24787943		10	26	4	20	Improving hospital care for frail older people requires expertise, leadership and resources as these patients have multiple complex needs. One innovative solution to providing the skilled care necessary is to train experienced nurses to become advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs). Such roles encompass activity previously undertaken by medical staff, together with leadership, teaching, research and service development. Skills specific to caring for older people, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, are also required. This article discusses the need for ANPs in this clinical area, a pilot that is under way in one acute trust to develop these roles, and the potential benefits and challenges that may accompany this development.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103936774&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	3	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	10	Nursing Older People	1	10	goldberg,sarah	goldberg	sarah
11	Why Intermediate Care Services Need To Be Refreshed.	2014	11	10.7748/nop2014.03.26.3.16.e570	NLM24673323		10	26	3	16	Intermediate care services are usually intended for frail, older people and those with complex needs. Their aims are to avoid unnecessary hospital admission, help people regain independence after a hospital stay and prevent premature admission to long-term care. Services are time limited and delivered in patients' own homes, community hospitals and sometimes nursing homes. But, as Louise Hunt reports, the second national audit of intermediate care, published late last year, found capacity in England is just half of what is needed. There is also significant variation between localities in capacity outside hospital and in the balance of bed-based, home-based and re-enablement services. Two case studies are presented of intermediate care services where nurses play an important role in achieving positive outcomes for patients and saving the health service money.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104060544&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	3	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	10	Nursing Older People	1	11	kilgore,cliff	kilgore	cliff
12	Nurse Care Coordination And Technology Effects On Health Status Of Frail Older Adults Via Enhanced Self-Management Of Medication.	2013	12	10.1097/NNR.0b013e318298aa55	NLM23817284		12	62	4	269	Background: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is challenging for many older adults. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination and technology. Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. Setting: Older adults having difficulty in self-managing medications (n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. Methods: All participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. Discussion: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107960283&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	5	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	12	Nursing Research	1	12	dorman,marek.karen	dorman	marek.karen

Management of dehydration in older people can be more complex than in younger adults because of the physical effects of ageing. As the population ages, nurses will increasingly care for older patients in every setting. This article provides an overview of the physiological changes that affect the ability of older people to maintain a normal fluid balance. Risk factors for dehydration are reviewed and strategies for the prevention, detection and management of dehydration are discussed.

These challenges include identifying the often complex diagnostic presentations both clinically and in a research context. This potent comorbidity can be conceived as double jeopardy in older adults, further diminishing their quality of life. Geriatric health care providers need to understand psychiatric comorbidity of this type for accurate diagnosis and early referral to specialists, and to coordinate interdisciplinary care. Researchers in the field also need to recognize potential multiple impacts of comorbidities with respect to assessment and treatment domains. This article describes the prevalence of late-life depression and anxiety disorders and reviews studies on this comorbidity in older adults. Risk factors and protective factors for anxiety and depression in later life are reviewed, and information is provided about comparative symptoms, the selection of assessment tools, and challenges to the provision of interdisciplinary, evidence-based care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105060825&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	17	Research in Gerontological Nursing	1	17	beattie,e	beattie	e
18	It'S Not Just About Heart Failure -- Voices Of Older People In Transition To Dependence And Death.	2010	18	10.1111/j.1365-2524.2009.00892.x			18	18	2	199	This paper explores the experiences of older people living with heart failure and their transitions from independence to dependence and for some death. New Zealand's ageing population is predicted to increase from 12% in 2001 to 25% by the year 2051, similar to the worldwide trend of ageing. A high proportion of these people will have one or more chronic illnesses. Associated with the increase in survival is a growing body of research examining the needs of the older person with heart failure and finding particular problems with end of life care. Older people face many challenges in living with their heart failure, in particular the transition to dependence. To study the transition a longitudinal qualitative study using General Inductive approach was used. Participants were interviewed every 3 months for a 12-month period during 2006-2008. A total of 79 interviews with 25 people were completed. Our findings showed that transition was not a simple linear process with the older person moving from one phase to another; instead their experiences illustrated the complexity of transitions they faced and what helped them to manage these. The older people in this study illustrated the importance of trust in health professionals and believed they would receive good care. Their fears revealed concerns about being a burden as they deteriorate and becoming more dependent. Understanding the complex issues related to transition to dependence can provide health professionals with a framework for assessment and approaches to providing the support required.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105306456&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	18	waterworth,s	waterworth	s
19	The Diversity And Complexity In Health Promotion And Empowerment Related To Older Hospital Patients -- Exploring Nurses' Reflections.	2010	19	10.1177/010740831003000103			19	30	1	9	Background: In the future, health care services will be challenged by an increasing number of older hospital patients. This prompts a need to focus on and implement a health promoting approach in older people's nursing. Aim: The aim of this exploratory study was to illuminate nurses' reflections about health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients. Method: The study had a qualitative descriptive design. The concepts of health, health promotion and empowerment were initially introduced to nurses before participating in multistage focus group interviews. Two groups of nurses participated in three focus group interviews that were conducted by a moderator and an assistant. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with qualitative content analysis. Findings: The nurses unfolded the theme «diversity and complexity marks health promotion and empowerment related to older hospital patients » as the latent content in the text. Two categories, «empowerment as balance of power - a twofold relation» and «focusing on the individual person», described the manifest content in the texts. The categories were further supported by sub-categories. Conclusion: The focus group interviews showed the ambiguity and complexity in the interpretation of the concepts -- health promotion and empowerment -- related to the older hospital patient. The findings also indicated that multistage focus group interviews may be a useful tool to develop nurses ' reflections about their clinical practice.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105028797&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:27:05	1	MHallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nurseauth_2021.06.23.xml	1	19	Nordic Journal of Nursing Research & Clinical Studies / Vård i Norden	1	19	berg,gv	berg	gv

22	Approach To Frailty In The Elderly In Primary Care And The Community.	2018	22	10.11622/smedj.2018052	29799055		22	59	5	240	Frailty is a distinct clinical syndrome wherein the individual has low reserves and is highly vulnerable to internal and external stressors. Although it is associated with disability and multiple comorbidities, it can also be present in individuals who seem healthy. Frailty is multidimensional and its pathophysiology is complex. Early identification and intervention can potentially decrease or reverse frailty, especially in the early stages. Primary care physicians, community nurses and community social networks have important roles in the identification of pre-frail and frail elderly through the use of simple frailty screening tools and rapid geriatric assessments. Appropriate interventions that can be initiated in a primary care setting include a targeted medical review for reversible medical causes of frailty, medication appropriateness, nutritional advice and exercise prescription. With ongoing training and education, the multidisciplinary engagement and coordination of care of the elderly in the community can help to build resilience and combat frailty in our rapidly ageing society.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	22	Singapore Medical Journal		22	chen,christine.yuanxin	Chen	Christine Yuanxin
23	Preoperative Evaluation Of The Frail Patient.	2020	23	10.1213/ANE.0000000000004735	32384339		23	130	6	1493	Perioperative management of older adults is a complex field that is heavily influenced by the clinical heterogeneity of older adults. Frailty-a geriatric syndrome in which a patient is more vulnerable to stressors due to decreases in physical function and reserve-has been indicative of adverse postoperative outcomes. Many tools have been developed to measure frailty that incorporate a variety of factors including physical and cognitive function, comorbidities, self-reported measures of health, and clinical judgment. Most of these frailty assessment tools are able to identify a subset of patients at risk of adverse outcomes including postoperative complications, longer hospital length of stay, discharge to a higher level of care, and mortality. Frailty assessment before surgical interventions can also guide discussions among patients, their families, anesthesiologists, and surgeons to tailor operative plans for patients to mitigate this increased risk. Studies are ongoing to identify interventions in frail patients that can improve postoperative outcomes, but high-quality data in the form of randomized controlled trials are lacking at this time.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	23	Anesthesia And Analgesia		23	nidadavolu,lolita.s	Nidadavolu	Lolita S
24	Frailty In Lung Transplantation: A Systematic Review.	2020	24	10.1080/17476348.2020.1702527	31815560		24	14	2	219	Introduction: Lung transplantation is an effective treatment for certain types of end-stage lung disease. Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with decreased physiological reserve and an increased risk for suboptimal health outcomes.Area covered: This article reviews the current literature on frailty in lung transplantation, with an emphasis on frailty measures, prevalence and impact of frailty on morbidity and mortality prior to and following lung transplantation. Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane systematic review databases were searched to September 2019. The search included the MeSH terms 'frail elderly' or 'frailty' or 'sarcopenia' and 'lung disease' or 'lung transplantation'. Studies were included if: the population were undergoing evaluation for, listed for or received a lung transplant; frailty was prospectively assessed during lung transplant evaluation using systematically defined criteria; used human subjects and; published in English. The prevalence of frailty varied from 0% - 58%. The frailty phenotype and short physical performance battery were the most common measures. Frailty was associated with delisting and death pre-transplantation. Frailty was associated with an increased risk of early mortality post-lung transplantation.Expert opinion: Frailty is identified often in lung transplant candidates and is associated with adverse pre and post-transplantation outcomes. Further research is necessary to identify potential frailty interventions.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	24	Expert Review Of Respiratory Medicine		24	montgomery,elyn	Montgomery	Elyn
25	Nursing Care Needs And Services Utilised By Home-Dwelling Elderly With Complex Health Problems: Observational Study.	2017	25	10.1186/s12913-017-2600-x	28899369		25	17	1	645	"BACKGROUND: In Norway, as in many Western countries, a shift from institutional care to home care is taking place. Our knowledge is limited regarding which needs for nursing interventions patients being cared for in their home have, and how they are met. We aimed at assessing aspects of health and function in a representative sample of the most vulnerable home-dwelling elderly, to identify their needs for nursing interventions and how these needs were met. METHODS: In this observational study we included patients aged 75+ living in their own homes in Oslo, who received daily home care, had three or more chronic diagnoses, received daily medication, and had been hospitalized during the last year. Focused attention and cognitive processing speed were assessed with the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), handgrip strength was used as a measure of sarcopenia, mobility was assessed with the ""Timed Up-and-Go"" test, and independence in primary activities of daily living by the Barthel Index. Diagnoses and medication were collected from electronic medical records. For each diagnosis, medication and functional impairment, a consensus group defined which nursing service that the particular condition necessitated. We then assessed whether these needs were fulfilled for each participant. RESULTS: Of 150 eligible patients, 83 were included (mean age 87 years, 25% men). They had on average 6 diagnoses and used 9 daily medications. Of the 83 patients, 61 (75%) had grip strength indicating sarcopenia, 27 (33%) impaired mobility, and 69 (83%) an impaired TMT-A score. Median amount of home nursing per week was 3.6 h (interquartile range 2.6 to 23.4). Fulfilment of pre-specified needs was >60% for skin and wound care in patients with skin diseases, observation of blood glucose in patients taking antidiabetic drugs, and in supporting food intake in patients with eating difficulties. Most other needs as defined by the consensus group were fulfilled in <10% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a very frail group of home-dwelling patients. For this group, resources for home nursing should probably be used in a more flexible and pro-active way to aim for preserving functional status, minimize symptom burden, and prevent avoidable hospitalisations."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	25	Bmc Health Services Research		25	næss,gro	Næss	Gro
26	Are Edentulousness, Oral Health Problems And Poor Health-Related Quality Of Life Associated With Malnutrition In Community-Dwelling Elderly (Aged 75 Years And Over)? A Cross-Sectional Study.	2018	26	10.3390/nu10121965	30545100		26	10	12	None	As the population ages, the risk of becoming malnourished increases. Research has shown that poor oral health can be a risk factor for malnutrition in institutionalized elderly. However, it remains unclear whether oral health problems, edentulousness and health-related quality of life also pose a risk for malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults. In this cross-sectional observational study, 1325 community-living elderly (≥75 years) were asked to complete questionnaires regarding nutritional status, oral status (edentulous, remaining teeth, or implant-supported overdentures), oral health problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, activities of daily living (ADL) and complexity of care needs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with nutritional status as dependent variable. Of the respondents, 51% (n = 521) were edentulous, 38.8% (n = 397) had remaining teeth and 10.2% (n = 104) had an implant-supported overdenture. Elderly with complex care needs were malnourished most frequently, followed by frail and robust elderly (10%, 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively). Malnourished elderly reported more frequent problems with chewing and speech when compared with well-nourished elderly (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analysis did not show an association between malnutrition and oral health problems and edentulousness, although HRQoL was associated with malnutrition (odds ratio (OR) 0.972, confidence interval (CI) 0.951⁻0.955). Based on the results of this cross-sectional study, it can be concluded that poor HRQoL is significantly associated with malnutrition; however, edentulousness and oral health problems are not.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	26	Nutrients		26	bakker,mieke.h	Bakker	Mieke H
27	Impact On Guidelines: The General Practitioner Point Of View.	2020	27	10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108091	32105769		27	166		108091	Primary care physicians are uniquely placed to offer holistic, patient-centred care to patients with T2DM. While the recent FDA-mandated cardiovascular outcome trials offer a wealth of data to inform treatment discussions, they have also contributed to increasing complexity in treatment decisions, and in the guidelines that seek to assist in making these decisions. To assist physicians in avoiding treatment inertia, Primary Care Diabetes Europe has formulated a position statement that summarises our current understanding of the available T2DM treatment options in various patient populations. New data from recent outcomes trials is contextualised and summarised for the primary care physician. This consensus paper also proposes a unique and simple tool to stratify patients into 'very high' and 'high' cardiovascular risk categories and outlines treatment recommendations for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Special consideration is given to elderly/frail patients and those with obesity. A visual patient assessment tool is provided, and a comprehensive set of prescribing tips is presented for all available classes of glucose-lowering therapies. This position statement will complement the already available, often specialist-focused, T2DM treatment guidelines and provide greater direction in how the wealth of outcome trial data can be applied to everyday practice.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	27	Diabetes Research And Clinical Practice		27	cos,x	Cos	X
28	Complicated Versus Complexity: When An Old Woman And Her Daughter Meet The Health Care System.	2020	28	10.1186/s12905-020-01092-5	33046068		28	20	1	230	"BACKGROUND: Detecting infection in frail elderly is a challenge due to lack of specific signs and symptoms. We highlight the complex situation when an elderly woman with urinary tract infection (UTI) and her daughter meet the highly qualified health care system. The aim was to describe and analyze the process when an elderly individual with an acute infection encounters the healthcare system. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective Single Case Study design with a qualitative approach was used. Data from interviews with the old women and her daughter, medical record data and different regulatory documents were gathered and analysed with a qualitative content analysis. In a second step, the results were interpreted with concepts from the complexity theory. Complexity theory has been used as a conceptual framework for analysis or a framework for interpretation. In this study we are using the theory for interpretation by comparing the results with the complexity theory, which is explored in the discussion. RESULTS: The latent content analysis of the daughter's story is interpreted as though she perceives the situation as causing a life crisis and a threat to her mother's entire existence. The old women herself does not take part in what is happening, though after returning to home she is trying to understand her behaviour and what has happened. The health care tries different diagnoses and treatment according to standardized care plans without success. When urinary tract infection is finally diagnosed and treated successfully, the old women recovers quickly. CONCLUSION: The healthcare system should embrace the complexity in the encounter with an elderly individual. However, we found that the immediate reaction from the healthcare system is to handle the patients' problem as complicated by complexity reduction. Shortcomings are that elderly patients with multiple disorders are difficult to evaluate and triage ""correctly"" for later placement in the appropriate continuum of care, although the findings of this case study also imply that with time the system instead took on an approach of absorption of complexity."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	28	Bmc Women'S Health		28	sund levander,märta	Sund Levander	Märta
29	Strategies To Promote Access To Medications During The Covid-19 Pandemic.	2020	29	10.31128/AJGP-04-20-5390	32738870		29	49	8	530	BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable and older people with chronic and complex conditions have self-isolated in their homes, potentially limiting opportunities for consultations to have medications prescribed and dispensed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe initiatives to ensure ongoing access to medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Cooperation between wholesalers and purchase limits in pharmacies have helped to ensure supply of essential medications. Therapeutic substitution by pharmacists is permitted for specific products authorised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Prescribers are permitted to issue digital image prescriptions, and implementation of electronic prescribing has been fast-tracked. Expanded continued dispensing arrangements introduced during the bushfire crises have been temporarily extended. Pharmacists are permitted to provide medication management reviews via telehealth. A Home Medicines Service has been introduced to facilitate delivery of medications to people who are vulnerable or elderly. Anticipatory prescribing and medication imprest systems are valuable for access to end-of-life medications within residential aged care.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	29	Australian Journal Of General Practice		29	bell,j.simon	Bell	J Simon
30	Experiences Of Elderly Patients Regarding Participation In Their Hospital Discharge: A Qualitative Metasummary.	2019	30	10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025789	31685492		30	9	11	e025789	BACKGROUND: Ageing patients are discharged from the hospital 'quicker and sicker' than before, and hospital discharge is a critical step in patient care. Older patients form a particularly vulnerable group due to multimorbidity and frailty. Patient participation in healthcare is influenced by government policy and an important part of quality improvement of care. There is need for greater insights into the complexity of patient participation for older patients in discharge processes based on aggregated knowledge. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review reported evidence concerning the experiences of older patients aged 65 years and above regarding their participation in the hospital discharge process. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative metasummary. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsycINFO and SocINDEX were conducted. Data from 18 studies were included, based on specific selection criteria. All studies explored older patients' experience of participation during the discharge process in hospital, but varied when it came to type of discharge and diagnosis. The data were categorised into themes by using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis indicated that participation in the discharge process varied among elderly patients. Five themes were identified: (1) complexity of the patients state of health, (2) management and hospital routines, (3) the norm and preference of returning home, (4) challenges of mutual communication and asymmetric relationships and (5) the significance of networks. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration between different levels in the health systems and user-friendly information between staff, patient and families are crucial. The complexity of patient participation for this patient group should be recognised to enhance user involvement during discharge from hospital. Interventions or follow-up studies of how healthcare professionals can improve their communication skills and address the tension between client-centred goals and organisational priorities are requested. Organisational structure may need to be restructured to ensure the participation of elderly patients.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	30	Bmj Open		30	lilleheie,ingvild	Lilleheie	Ingvild
31	Frailty In A Post-Acute Care Population: A Scoping Review.	2018	31	10.1016/j.pmrj.2018.03.009	29550407		31	10	11	1211	Frailty is a complex and growing phenomenon facing health care providers throughout the continuum of care. Frailty is not well understood in post-acute care (PAC) settings. The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize current evidence of frailty impact on outcomes and frailty mitigation initiatives in PAC. Three major publication databases were searched from January 2000 to June 2017 that identified 18 articles specifically addressing frailty in PAC. Three themes were identified: scales used to measure frailty, factors that led to an adverse outcome or diagnosis of frailty, and interventions to address frailty in PAC. Scales used to measure frailty were dominated by physical factors and scarce on nutrition and social support. Functional decline, grip strength, gait speed, polypharmacy, and nutrition were identified in the studies as factors that identify frailty and are associated with poor outcomes. All these frailty characteristics compromise patients' ability to benefit from rehabilitation, which further establishes the importance of PAC providers to identify, prevent, and treat frailty. Intervention studies had mixed outcomes, suggesting a need for further development in this area. The findings of this scoping review highlight the need for a comprehensive multidimensional assessment of frailty risks in PAC.

32	Healthy Aging: American Geriatrics Society White Paper Executive Summary.	2019	32	10.1111/jgs.15644	30382585		32	67	1	17	"In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a manuscript titled, ""Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our Discipline?"" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally competent, person-centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes.

33	Narratives Of Older Persons' Frailty And Physical Activity In Relation To Environmental Landscapes And Time.	2020	33	10.1111/opn.12298	31874119		33	15	2	e12298	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the environmental landscape on the physical activity of older persons experiencing frailty. BACKGROUND: This manuscript describes the second phase of an unpublished larger study in the northern province of Lampang, Thailand. Phase One revealed that 14% of 1,788 older persons surveyed were found to have experienced frailty according to Fried's frailty phenotypes, and low physical activity was associated with frailty. In the light of frailty, how older persons experience physical activity in their day-to-day living environments warrants in-depth exploration. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study guided by narrative inquiry. METHODS: In-depth interviews and observations were conducted with 13 older persons living with frailty. The method of analysis was thematic and performance analysis. RESULTS: Two broad themes relating to the environmental landscapes were as follows: (a) limiting environmental landscapes and (b) engaging environmental landscapes. These landscapes, which change across time, refer to physical and social spaces, and beliefs of older persons and their family that have either positive or negative impacts on physical activity of frail older persons. CONCLUSION: Complex interactions between physical and social spaces and beliefs of older persons and family influence the physical activity behaviours of older persons living with frailty. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study warrants education and policy aiming at creating optimal environmental landscapes to promote physical activity in frail older persons.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	33	thinuan,payom	Thinuan	Payom
34	A Mixed Methods Thematic Review: Health-Related Decision-Making By The Older Person.	2018	34	10.1111/jocn.14261	29322576		34	27	7-8	e1327	"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To undertake a mixed methods thematic literature review that explored how elderly adults approached decision-making in regard to their health care following discharge. BACKGROUND: A critical time for appropriate health decisions occurs during hospital discharge planning with nursing staff. However, little is known how the 89% of elderly living at home make decisions regarding their health care. Research into older adults' management of chronic conditions emerges as an important step to potentially encourage symptom monitoring, prevent missed care and detect deterioration. All should reduce the risk of hospital re-admission. DESIGN: A mixed methods thematic literature review was undertaken. The structure followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews recommended by the EQUATOR network. METHODS: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus online databases were searched using keywords, inclusion and exclusion criteria. References drawn from relevant publications, identified by experts and published between 1995 and 2017 were also considered. Twenty-five qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies and reviews were critically appraised (CASP 2013) before inclusion in the review. Analysis of each study's findings was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (2006) steps to identify major themes and sub-themes. RESULTS: Four main themes associated with health-related decision-making in the elderly were identified: ""the importance of maintaining independence,"" ""decision making style,"" ""management of conditions at home"" and ""discharge planning."" CONCLUSION: Health care decision preferences in the elderly emerged as highly complex and influenced by multiple factors. Development of a tool to assess these components has been recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses play a vital role in exploring and understanding the influence that maintaining independence has with each patient. This understanding provides an initial step toward development of a tool to assist collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals involved in their care."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	34	king,lindy	King	Lindy
35	Caretrack Aged: The Appropriateness Of Care Delivered To Australians Living In Residential Aged Care Facilities: A Study Protocol.	2019	36	10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030988	31243038		30	9	6	e030988	INTRODUCTION: The aged population is increasing rapidly across the world and this is expected to continue. People living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) represent amongst the sickest and frailest cohort of the aged population, with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and complex comorbidities. Given the vulnerability of RACF residents and the demands on the system, there is a need to determine the extent that care is delivered in line with best practice ('appropriate care') in RACFs. There is also a recognition that systems should provide care that optimises quality of life (QoL), which includes support for physical and psychological well-being, independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and a caring external environment. The aims of CareTrack Aged are to develop sets of indicators for appropriate care and processes of care for commonly managed conditions, and then assess the appropriateness of care delivered and QoL of residents in RACFs in Australia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will extract recommendations from clinical practice guidelines and, using expert review, convert these into sets of indicators for 15 common conditions and processes of care for people living in RACFs. We will recruit RACFs in three Australian states, and residents within these RACFs, using a stratified multistage sampling method. Experienced nurses, trained in the CareTrack Aged methods ('surveyors'), will review care records of recruited residents within a 1-month period in 2019 and 2020, and assess the care documented against the indicators of appropriate care. Surveyors will concurrently assess residents' QoL using validated questionnaires.

36	Factors Related To Frailty Among The Elderly In South Korea: A 3-Year Longitudinal Study.	2019	37	10.1111/2047-3095.12198	29316345		37	30	1	55	PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with frailty among the young-old elderly (YOE) and old-old elderly (OOE). METHODS: This longitudinal study with a 3-year follow-up included 486 participants who received home care services. FINDINGS: Precipitous weight loss and depression in the YOE and worsening of complex mobility and depression in the OOE were associated with worsened frailty over the 3-year period. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent frailty, we suggest weight-loss prevention programs for the YOE, lower-limb exercise programs for the OOE, and depression management programs for both groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The findings may be used by geriatric nurses in developing programs to prevent frailty in the OOE and YOE, and in administering nursing intervention programs at nursing home centers.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	37	International Journal Of Nursing Knowledge	1	37	park,jin-kyoung	Park	Jin-Kyoung
37	Improving Quality Of Care And Reducing Unnecessary Hospital Admissions: A Literature Review.	2016	38	10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.6.284	27270196		38	21	6	284, 288	As the UK population lives to older ages, with more complex health and social care needs, there comes a time when going to live in a care home might be essential for a frail, older person. Residents and their families expect high-quality care in return for the costs of their placements, but often find this is not the case ( Help the Aged, 2006 ). In order to improve quality in care homes, the Lincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust are piloting a care home support team. The new service aims to provide education and training to an unpredictable workforce, with the addition of regular ward rounds in care homes to ensure more proactive care for residents, in order to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and improve the quality of care offered. This article looks at the literature relating to education and training for staff in care homes to support this service. It also aims to use the reviewed articles to identify specific training and education needed to improve quality of care for residents and reduce avoidable hospital admissions.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	38	British Journal Of Community Nursing	1	38	means,tracy	Means	Tracy
38	Effectiveness Of Professional Oral Health Care Intervention On The Oral Health Of Residents With Dementia In Residential Aged Care Facilities: A Systematic Review Protocol.	2015	39	10.11124/jbisrir-2015-2330	26571287		39	13	10	110	"REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to critically appraise and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of professional oral health care intervention on the oral health of aged care residents with dementia.More specifically the objectives are to identify the efficacy of professional oral health care interventions on general oral health, the presence of plaque and the number of decayed or missing teeth. BACKGROUND: Dementia poses a significant challenge for health and social policy in Australia. The quality of life of individuals, their families and friends is impacted by dementia. Older people with dementia often have other health comorbidities resulting in the need for a higher level of care. From 2009 to 2010, 53% of permanent residents in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) had dementia on admission. Older Australians are retaining more of their natural teeth, therefore residents entering RACFs will have more of their natural teeth and require complex dental work than they did in previous generations. Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that more than half the residents in RACFs are now partially dentate with an average of 12 teeth each. Furthermore, coronal and root caries are significant problems, especially in older Australians who are cognitively impaired.Residents in aged care facilities frequently have poor oral health and hygiene with moderate to high levels of oral disease and overall dental neglect. This is reinforced by aged care staff who acknowledge that the demands of feeding, toileting and behavioral issues amongst residents often take precedence over oral health care regimens. Current literature shows that there is a general reluctance on the part of aged care staff to prioritize oral care due to limited knowledge as well as existing psychological barriers to working on another person's mouth. Although staff routinely deal with residents' urinary and faecal incontinence, deep psychological barriers exist when working on someone's mouth due to their own personal values of oral health or their views that residents should be looking after their own teeth or dentures. Furthermore, residents with behavioral issues associated with dementia frequently have their oral hygiene neglected as they may be resistant and violent towards receiving oral care from aged care staff. Studies have shown that residents with dementia will often refuse to open their mouth or partake in oral hygiene care by aged care staff. The aged care staff in return often do not pursue an oral care regimen for these ""difficult"" residents, perpetuating the cycle of oral neglect and resultant disease.Dental hygienists are qualified oral health professionals who are specifically trained to develop individualized oral health care plans and preventative programs to reduce oral health disease in the community. Residents with dementia in aged care facilities have the right to live their lives comfortably and free of oral discomfort or pain. A Victorian study conducted by Hopcraft et al. investigated the ability of a dental hygienist to undertake a dental examination/screening for residents in aged care facilities, to develop a preventative and periodontal treatment plan and to refer patients appropriately to a dentist. Results from this study demonstrated that there was an excellent agreement between the dentist and dental hygienist regarding the decision to refer residents to a dentist for treatment, demonstrating high sensitivity (99.6%) and high specificity (82.9%). Residents from 31 Victorian RACFs (n=510) were examined by a single experienced dental epidemiologist and one of four dental hygienists using a simple mouth mirror and probe. Hopcraft et al. concluded that hygienists should be utilized more widely in providing holistic oral health care to residents in aged care facilities.Recently, Lewis et al. discussed the need to develop models of care to improve access to dental care for frail and functionally dependent elderly people in aged care facilities, with the model of care involving dental hygienists/oral health therapists having merit.The concept of professional oral care involves an oral health professional such as a dental hygienist or oral health therapist supervising or assisting residents with their oral care. Oral care involves the mechanical removal of plaque and food debris using a toothbrush, interproximal brush and floss.In 2014, Morino et al. explored the efficacy of short term professional oral care from dental hygienists once a week after breakfast for one month. In this study, the dental hygienists did not perform dental scaling but brushed subjects' teeth using a toothbrush and interdental brush. Dental plaque scores decreased significantly (Fisher's two-tailed tests, p<0.05) in the professional oral health intervention group. Interestingly, the positive effects of this short term intervention were sustained for the following three months (Wilcoxon test, p<0.05).A pilot study in Arkansas was conducted by Amerine et al. and utilized the dental hygienist as the ""oral health champion"" in the residential aged care facility using the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) and Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) scores to measure oral health. The results from this study showed improvements in three measured areas (tongue health, denture status and oral cleanliness) in the dental hygiene champion group. These findings suggest that the presence of a dental hygiene champion in long term care facilities may positively impact the oral health of residents requiring assistance with their oral care. However, the authors noted further research in this concept is required.Van Der Putten GJ et al. explored the effectiveness of a supervised implementation of an oral health care guideline in care homes. In each ward of the care homes, a nurse who acted as the ward oral health care organiser (WOO) was appointed. The dental hygienist and an investigator would attend the RACFs every six weeks to support them. The dental hygienist would train the WOO, and the WOO would train the ward nurses and nurse assistants. Participants were allocated into an intervention or a control group. The intervention group received supervised oral care. Statistically significant differences in mean dental and denture plaque scores at six months in both groups occurred (student t-test, p < 0.0001). This research study implemented an intervention using the train-the-trainer approach and although improvements in dental and denture plaque scores were seen in the six-month period, the long-term effects of this intervention are unknown. Further studies exploring the long-term effects of staff training on oral health education are needed as well as ongoing staff training in aged care facilities.A systematic review on oral health and aspiration pneumonia conducted by Vander Maarel-Wierink et al. has suggested that, in the frail elderly, the best intervention to reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia is brushing of teeth after each meal, cleaning dentures once a day, and receiving professional oral health care once a week.The need to advocate for a new model of geriatric dentistry is critical. A holistic multi-disciplinary approach to health care for residents entering aged care homes is imperative to achieve better oral health and comfort for residents, especially with Australia's ageing dentate population. A dental examination and assessment on admission to a RACF should be conducted by a Registered Nurse (RN), followed by an oral health professional such as a dentist, dental hygienist or oral health therapist. Current practice in the majority of Australian government funded nursing homes is that the RN or the Assistant in Nursing (AIN) conduct the oral health assessment as part of the aged care funding instrument (ACFI). Ongoing oral health care supported by an oral health professional is important throughout the individual's residency and eventual palliation whilst in an aged care facility.No systematic reviews conducted on the impact of professional oral care on the oral health of elderly people living in residential aged care facilities could be located, despite extensive searching of Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Trials and Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source (DOSS) databases. A JBI systematic review was conducted in 2004, titled, ""Oral hygiene care for adults with dementia in residential aged care facilities""; however, this review examined the prevalence, incidence and increments of oral diseases; the use of assessment tools to evaluate oral health; preventative oral hygiene care strategies; and the provision of dental treatment and so had a different clinical focus. Twenty studies were included for analysis in the review conducted by Weening-Verbree et al, The studies in this review addressed oral health knowledge of aged care staff and mostly were conducted as an educational session delivered by dental hygienists or dentists.Overall, the current evidence available on interventions to improve oral health for residents living in aged care facilities is inadequate and should be explored further."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	39	Jbi Database Of Systematic Reviews And Implementation Reports		39	yi mohammadi,joanna.jin	Yi Mohammadi	Joanna Jin
39	Patterns Of Chronic Illness Among Older Patients Attending A University Hospital In Nigeria.	2020	40	10.4314/gmj.v54i1.7	32863412		40	54	1	42	BACKGROUND: The rising burden of chronic diseases has attracted the attention of public health researchers and policymakers worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To assess the demographic, morbidity and outcome patterns of chronic illness among the older patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred and eighty-eight (788) adults (60 years and over) hospitalized between 2010 and 2014 in the hospital. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: The age of the selected study population ranged from 60 to 99 years with a mean of 76.08(±10.42). More than half (53.0%) were between 60-69 years, with a subsequent decline. Male patients accounted for 64.0%, but females were more frequent among patients 80 years and older. The most common health conditions were heart diseases (22.5%), neoplasm (13.2%), cerebrovascular accident (12.4%), and gastrointestinal diseases (14.5%). The records showed that 14.9% were referred to other institution for various reasons (including further management, lack of space, industrial action by workers, discharged against medical advice or dead). CONCLUSION: Heart diseases were the major chronic illnesses among the older adults followed by neoplasm conditions, while musculoskeletal conditions were the least. It also found that there was a poor outcome of conditions among older adults in this setting. Therefore, efforts should be made towards the prevention and reduction of chronic illnesses, as well as improving the outcome of care.

40	Nutrition And Hydration In Older Adults In Critical Care.	2014	41	10.1016/j.ccell.2013.10.006	24484922		41	26	1	31	Nutrition and hydration are vital components of critical care nursing. However, meeting the nutrition and hydration needs of the critically ill older adult is often complex, because of preexisting risk factors (malnutrition, unintentional weight loss, frailty, and dehydration); as well as intensive care unit-related challenges (catabolism, eating and feeding, end-of-life care). This article highlights the challenges of managing nutrition and hydration in the critically ill older adult, reviews assessment principles, and offers strategies for optimizing nutrition and hydration.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	41	Critical Care Nursing Clinics Of North America	1	41	dimaria-ghalili,rose.ann	Dimaria-Ghalili	Rose Ann
41	Perceptions About Technologies That Help Community-Dwelling Older Adults Remain At Home: Qualitative Study.	2020	42	10.2196/17930	32496197		42	22	6	e17930	BACKGROUND: The population of Europe is aging rapidly. Most community-dwelling older adults (CDOAs) want to remain in their homes, particularly those experiencing functional decline. Politicians and academics repeatedly praise technological instruments for being the preferred solution for helping older adults with deteriorating health to remain at home. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the perceptions of CDOAs and their informal caregivers (ICs) and professional caregivers (PCs) about technologies that can help keep older adults at home. METHODS: This qualitative study used personal interviews, focus groups, and photo-elicitation interviews to better understand the perceptions of a convenience sample of 68 CDOAs, 21 ICs, and 32 PCs. RESULTS: A fraction of CDOAs did not perceive technological instruments to be a very useful means of helping them remain at home. However, the ICs and PCs were more positive. The CDOAs preferred and were more willing to adopt technologies related to their mobility and safety and those that would help slow down their cognitive decline. The ICs preferred technological aids that assist in the activities of daily living as well as safety-related technologies for detecting falls and helping to locate disoriented older adults. The PCs preferred integrated communication and information systems to improve collaboration between all stakeholders, housing equipped with technologies to manage complex care, high-performance ancillary equipment to transfer people with reduced mobility, and surveillance systems to ensure safety at home. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study reports that CDOAs have limited interest in innovative technologies to help them remain at home, their technological skills will undoubtedly improve in the future, as will those of ICs and PCs. Technological tools will play an increasingly important role in home health care.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	42	Journal Of Medical Internet Research		42	verloo,henk	Verloo	Henk
42	Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative: Early Implementation Results Of A National Veterans Affairs Program To Honor Veterans' Care Preferences.	2020	43	10.1007/s11606-020-05697-2	32096084		43	35	6	1803	BACKGROUND: On July 1, 2018, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) National Center for Ethics in Health Care implemented the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative (LSTDI). Its goal is to identify, document, and honor LST decisions of seriously ill veterans. Providers document veterans' goals and decisions using a standardized LST template and order set. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the first 7 months of LSTDI implementation and identify predictors of LST template completion. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of clinical and administrative data. We identified all completed LST templates, defined as completion of four required template fields. Templates also include four non-required fields. Results were stratified by risk of hospitalization or death as estimated by the Care Assessment Need (CAN) score. SUBJECTS: All veterans with VA utilization between July 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Completed LST templates, goals and LST preferences, and predictors of documentation. RESULTS: LST templates were documented for 108,145 veterans, and 85% had one or more of the non-required fields completed in addition to the required fields. Approximately half documented a preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among those who documented specific goals, half wanted to improve or maintain function, independence, and quality of life while 28% had a goal of life prolongation irrespective of risk of hospitalization/death and 45% expressed a goal of comfort. Only 7% expressed a goal of being cured. Predictors of documentation included VA nursing home residence, older age, frailty, and comorbidity, while non-Caucasian race, rural residence, and receipt of care in a lower complexity medical center were predictive of no documentation. CONCLUSIONS: LST decisions were documented for veterans at high risk of hospitalization or death. While few expressed a preference for cure, half desire, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Predictors of documentation were generally consistent with existing literature. Opportunities to reduce observed disparities exist by leveraging available VA resources and programs.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	43	Journal Of General Internal Medicine		43	levy,cari	Levy	Cari
43	The Obesity Paradox In Sepsis: A Theoretical Framework.	2020	44	10.1177/1099800420905889	32064902		44	22	2	287	Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome that occurs in response to a severe infection. In recent years, the understanding of the pathobiology of sepsis has been refined, with research describing an altered host response as the underlying cause. Survivors of sepsis often have long hospital stays and suffer from subsequent frailty and long-term health consequences. Predicting attributes of sepsis survivors remains challenging; however, an obesity paradox exists, wherein obese individuals survive sepsis at higher rates than their normal-weight counterparts. We present a model that describes the relationships between sepsis and obesity, focusing on inflammation as a shared pathway for dysregulation in obese and healthy-weight adults. Understanding the interaction of these complex variables is an important first step toward developing interventions and treatments to augment sepsis survival.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	44	Biological Research For Nursing	1	44	robinson,jamie	Robinson	Jamie
44	The Outcome For Surgical Fixation Of Distal Radial Fractures In Patients With Idiopathic Parkinson'S Disease: A Cohort Study.	2020	45	10.1186/s13018-020-01642-5	32238187		45	15	1	125	INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurologic disorder causing postural instability and unsteady gait. These patients are at increased risk for fractures and have inferior outcomes after treatment. Several studies have evaluated the incidence and outcome of PD patients after hip fractures. However, there are limited studies assessing the outcome of upper extremity fractures in these patients. In this study, we evaluated the outcome of PD patients that received surgical intervention for distal radial fractures (DRF). We hypothesize that these patients have an inferior outcome after surgery in comparison with non-PD patients. METHODS: Between May 2005 and May 2017, we retrospectively reviewed all of the patients with DRF and subsequently underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) at a level 1 trauma center. All of the surgeries were performed by fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons. The inclusion criteria include patients with a definitive diagnosis of PD, non-pathological DRF, and a minimum follow-up of 1 year or up until the time of treatment failure was noted. Each PD patient was matched for age and gender to 3 non-PD patients. The primary objective was to determine the failure rate after surgical fixation for DRF. The secondary outcomes include time to treatment failure, reoperation rate, readmission rate, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients were included in this study (23 PD, 65 non-PD patients). All underwent ORIF and received standard postoperative follow-ups. The overall treatment failure rate in PD was 39.1% vs. 4.6% in the non-PD group (p < 0.05). The time to treatment failure were 9.11 ± 3.86 weeks and 14.67 ± 5.8 weeks for PD and non-PD, respectively (p < 0.05). PD patients had a significantly higher rate of failure when k-wires and ESF were used (p < 0.05%), while loss of reduction was the most common mode of failure in PD (44.4%). The length of hospital stay for PD was 5.3 ± 4.69 days compared with 3.78 ± 0.96 days for non-PD (p = 0.01). There were 3 PD patients readmitted within 30 days after surgery, and 1 patient had pneumonia after the surgery. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that patients with PD have a high treatment failure rate despite surgical intervention for DRF. PD patients had a longer hospital stay and had a shorter time to treatment failure. In treating PD patients complicated with DRF, the surgeon must take into consideration the complex disease course of PD and the associated comorbidities such as osteoporosis, frail status, and frequent falls. Rehabilitation and disposition plans should be discussed in advance and longer hospital stays should be expected.

45	Development And Validation Of A Complex Intervention: A Physical Exercise Programme Aimed At Delaying The Functional Decline In Frail Older Adults.	2020	46	10.1002/nop2.388	31871711		46	7	1	274	AIM: To develop and validate a physical exercise programme aimed at delaying the functional decline in frail older adults. DESIGN: The revised guideline of Criteria for Reporting the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions in health care was followed. METHODS: The physical exercise programme was designed and validated by exercise specialists to be implemented by healthcare professionals. The physical exercise programme underwent three stages of development, piloting and evaluation. It includes a portfolio of exercises in different support materials (posters, e-book and website). A testing intervention was delivered to the target population. RESULTS: The Criteria for Reporting the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions in health care process has the potential to help practitioners in developing and planning complex interventions, such as an exercise programme. Its components can be adjusted to the context and to the characteristics of the target population. A study protocol and a pilot study will be developed to test the effectiveness of the physical exercise programme on delaying the functional decline of frail older adults.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	46	Nursing Open	1	46	santos-rocha,rita	Santos-Rocha	Rita
46	Polst Facilitation In Complex Care Management: A Feasibility Study.	2019	47	10.1177/1049909118797077	30153739		47	36	1	5	"BACKGROUND: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form is an advance care planning tool designed for seriously ill patients. The discussions needed for high-quality POLST decision-making are time intensive and often do not occur in the outpatient setting. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of POLST facilitation by nonphysicians using Respecting Choices Last Steps, a standardized, structured approach to facilitation of POLST conversations. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in a complex care management program in a Midwestern urban hospital. MEASUREMENTS: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability by determining the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and completed the study, by adherence to the Respecting Choices protocol, and by responses to qualitative and quantitative survey items about the intervention. RESULTS: We enrolled 18 (58.1%) of 31 eligible patients, with a mean age of 77.8 years (standard deviation: 6.95); 12 were African American. The POLST facilitation was delivered to all 18; 10 (55.6%) completed POLST forms. Direct observation of intervention delivery using a checklist found 85% of the required elements were performed by facilitators. We completed 6- to 8-week follow-up interviews in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%). We found 87.5% of decision makers agreed or strongly agreed that ""Talking about the (POLST) form helped me think about what I really want."" CONCLUSIONS: The POLST facilitation can be successfully delivered to frail older adults in a complex care management setting, with high fidelity to protocol. Further research is needed to demonstrate the effects of this approach on decision quality and other patient-reported outcomes."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	47	The American Journal Of Hospice & Palliative Care		47	torke,alexia.m	Torke	Alexia M

This is especially important when working with older adults, many with multiple chronic conditions and challenging health care needs. This paper describes a feasibility study of the Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training 2.0 (GITT 2.0) program focused on providing interprofessional care to complex and frail older adults with multiple chronic conditions. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design facilitated program implementation and evaluation. Over three years (2013-2016), 65 graduate students from nursing, midwifery, social work, and pharmacy participated along with 25 preceptors. Participants were surveyed on their attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration pre and post-intervention and participated in focus groups. While attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration did not change quantitatively, focus groups revealed changes in language and enhanced perspectives of participants. Based on the evaluation data, the GITT 2.0 Toolkit was refined for use in interprofessional education and practice activities related to quality initiatives.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	48	Journal Of Interprofessional Care	1	48	giuliante,maryanne.m	Giuliante	Maryanne M
48	Effectiveness Of A Health-Social Partnership Program For Discharged Non-Frail Older Adults: A Pilot Study.	2020	49	10.1186/s12877-020-01722-5	32912218		49	20	1	339	BACKGROUND: Previous studies supporting discharged patients are hospital-based which admission criteria tend to include mainly those with complex needs and/or specific disease conditions. This study captured the service gap where these non-frail older patients might have no specific medical problem upon discharge but they might encounter residual health and social issues when returning home. METHODS: Discharged community-dwelling non-frail older adults from an emergency medical ward were recruited and randomized into either intervention (n = 37) or control (n = 38) group. The intervention group received a 12-week complex interventions that included structured assessment, health education, goal empowerment, and care coordination supported by a health-social team. The control group received usual discharge care and monthly social call. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Secondary outcomes included activities of daily living (ADL), the presence of depressive symptoms, and the use of health services. The outcomes were measured at pre-intervention (T1) and at three months post-intervention (T2). The independent t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the group differences in HRQoL, ADL, and presence of depressive symptoms according to the normality of data. RESULTS: Analysis showed that the intervention group experienced a statistically significantly improvement in the mental component scale of quality of life (p = .036), activities of daily living (p = .005), and presence of depressive symptoms (p = .035) at T2 compared with at T1. No significant differences were found in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting self-care is necessary to enable community-dwelling non-frail older adults to be independent to the fullest extent possible in the community. The promising results found in this pilot study suggested that the integration of the health-social partnership into transitional care practice is effective and can be sustained in the community. Future studies can draw on these findings and maximize the integrated care quality during the transition phase.

ANALYSIS: Logistic regression models with age and occupational group were specified for each sex separately. RESULTS: Of 41 193 adults, 38 027 (55% female; 25-100 years old) were included. Of them, 39% had ≥2 multimorbid conditions with ≥1 frailty measure, and 17% had ≥3 multimorbid conditions with ≥2 frailty measures. Prevalence differences in percentage points (pp) with 95% confidence intervals of those in high versus low occupational group with ≥2 multimorbid conditions and ≥1 frailty measure were largest in women age 30 years, 17 (14 to 20) pp and 55 years, 15 (13 to 17) pp and in men age 55 years, 15 (13 to 17) pp and 80 years, 14 (9 to 18) pp. In those with ≥3 multimorbid conditions and ≥2 frailty measures, prevalence differences were largest in women age 30 years, 8 (6 to 10) pp and 55 years, 10 (8 to 11) ppand in men age 55 years, 9 (8 to 11) pp and 80 years, 6 (95% CI 1 to 10) pp. CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity with frailty is common, and social inequalities persist until age 80 years in women and throughout the lifespan in men. To manage complex multimorbidity, strategies for proportionate universalism in medical education, healthcare, public health prevention and promotion seem necessary.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	30	Bmj Open		50	vinjerui,kristin.hestmann	Vinjerui	Kristin Hestmann
50	Differences In Levels Of Albumin, Alt, Ast, Γ-Gt And Creatinine In Frail, Moderately Healthy And Healthy Elderly Individuals.	2018	51	10.1515/cclm-2017-0311	28988219		51	56	3	471	BACKGROUND: Reference intervals are widely used as decision tools, providing the physician with information about whether the analyte values indicate ongoing disease process. Reference intervals are generally based on individuals without diagnosed diseases or use of medication, which often excludes elderly. The aim of the study was to assess levels of albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) in frail, moderately healthy and healthy elderly indivuduals. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from individuals >80 years old, nursing home residents, in the Elderly in Linköping Screening Assessment and Nordic Reference Interval Project, a total of 569 individuals. They were divided into three cohorts: frail, moderately healthy and healthy, depending on cognitive and physical function. Albumin, ALT, AST, creatinine and γ-GT were analyzed using routine methods. RESULTS: Linear regression predicted factors for 34% of the variance in albumin were activities of daily living (ADL), gender, stroke and cancer. ADLs, gender and weight explained 15% of changes in ALT. For AST levels, ADLs, cancer and analgesics explained 5% of changes. Kidney disease, gender, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease explained 25% of the variation in creatinine levels and MMSE explained three per cent of γ-GT variation. CONCLUSIONS: Because a group of people are at the same age, they should not be assessed the same way. To interpret results of laboratory tests in elderly is a complex task, where reference intervals are one part, but far from the only one, to take into consideration.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	51	Clinical Chemistry And Laboratory Medicine		51	edvardsson,maria	Edvardsson	Maria
51	Implementation And Evaluation Of An Education Programme For Nursing Staff On Recognising, Reporting And Managing Resident-To-Resident Elder Mistreatment In Aged Care Facilities.	2019	52	10.1111/jan.13819	30109725		52	75	1	187	AIM: To implement an educational programme for nursing staff on recognising, reporting and managing resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in aged care facilities. BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an educational programme. DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). METHODS: This trial was undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be evaluated on an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: It is vital to manage and reduce resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and may improve comprehensive evidence-based care for older people residing in aged care facilities.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	52	ellis,julie.m	Ellis	Julie M
52	Caregivers' Experiences Of A Home Support Program After The Hospital Discharge Of An Older Family Member: A Qualitative Analysis.	2019	53	10.1186/s12913-019-4042-0	30971236		25	19	1	220	BACKGROUND: The ageing global population has seen increasing numbers of older people living with chronic health problems, declining function, and frailty. As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89 years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were 'The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.

54	A Home-Based Exercise Program Focused On Proprioception To Reduce Falls In Frail And Pre-Frail Community-Dwelling Older Adults.	2020	55	10.1016/j.gerinurse.2020.01.017	32199736		55	41	4	436	Frailty and falls are closely associated with each other as well as with disability, hospitalization, and death. Exercise can reduce these risks in both robust and frail older people. This before-after, non-randomized intervention study assessed a one-year proprioception training program with individual daily home exercises in 564 community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over, with different frailty phenotypes. After the exercise program, we observed a moderate reduction in the mean number of falls, fear of falls, body mass index and body fat percentage in frail and pre-frail participants. These results suggest that a home proprioception program may be a viable alternative to complex multicomponent exercise programs in settings where these are not feasible, since home proprioception can reach a larger population at a lower cost, and it affords clear benefits.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	55	Geriatric Nursing (New York, N.Y.)	1	55	pérez-ros,pilar	Pérez-Ros	Pilar
55	Service User, Carer And Provider Perspectives On Integrated Care For Older People With Frailty, And Factors Perceived To Facilitate And Hinder Implementation: A Systematic Review And Narrative Synthesis.	2019	56	10.1371/journal.pone.0216488	31083707		56	14	5	e0216488	INTRODUCTION: Older people with frailty (OPF) can experience reduced quality of care and adverse outcomes due to poorly coordinated and fragmented care, making this patient population a key target group for integrated care. This systematic review explores service user, carer and provider perspectives on integrated care for OPF, and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation, to draw out implications for policy, practice and research. METHODS: Systematic review and narrative synthesis of qualitative studies identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index, hand-searching of reference lists and citation tracking of included studies, and review of experts' online profiles. Quality of included studies was appraised with The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for qualitative research. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the synthesis. We identified four themes related to stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF: different preferences for integrated care among service users, system and service organisation components, relational aspects of care and support, and stakeholder perceptions of outcomes. Service users and carers highlighted continuity of care with a professional they could trust, whereas providers emphasised improved coordination of care between providers in different care sectors as key strategies for integrated care. We identified three themes related to factors facilitating and hindering implementation: perceptions of the integrated care intervention and target population, service organisational factors and system level factors influencing implementation. Different stakeholder groups perceived the complexity of care needs of this patient population, difficulties with system navigation and access, and limited service user and carer involvement in care decisions as key factors hindering implementation. Providers mainly also highlighted other organisational and system factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation of integrated care for OPF. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities and differences in lay and professional stakeholder perspectives on integrated care for OPF and factors perceived to facilitate and hinder implementation were evident. Findings highlight the importance of addressing organisational and system level components of integrated care and factors influencing implementation for OPF. Greater attention needs to be placed on collaboratively involving service users, carers and providers to improve the co-design and implementation of integrated care programmes for this patient population.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	56	Plos One		56	sadler,euan	Sadler	Euan
56	Medication Management Policy, Practice And Research In Australian Residential Aged Care: Current And Future Directions.	2017	57	10.1016/j.phrs.2016.12.011	27965033		57	116		20	Eight percent of Australians aged 65 years and over receive residential aged care each year. Residents are increasingly older, frailer and have complex care needs on entry to residential aged care. Up to 63% of Australian residents of aged care facilities take nine or more medications regularly. Together, these factors place residents at high risk of adverse drug events. This paper reviews medication-related policies, practices and research in Australian residential aged care. Complex processes underpin prescribing, supply and administration of medications in aged care facilities. A broad range of policies and resources are available to assist health professionals, aged care facilities and residents to optimise medication management. These include national guiding principles, a standardised national medication chart, clinical medication reviews and facility accreditation standards. Recent Australian interventions have improved medication use in residential aged care facilities. Generating evidence for prescribing and deprescribing that is specific to residential aged care, health workforce reform, medication-related quality indicators and inter-professional education in aged care are important steps toward optimising medication use in this setting.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	57	Pharmacological Research		57	sluggett,janet.k	Sluggett	Janet K
57	Geriatric Co-Management For Cardiology Patients In The Hospital (G-Coach): Study Protocol Of A Prospective Before-After Effectiveness-Implementation Study.	2018	58	10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023593	30344179		30	8	10	e023593	INTRODUCTION: Although the majority of older patients admitted to a cardiology unit present with at least one geriatric syndrome, guidelines on managing heart disease often do not consider the complex needs of frail older patients. Geriatric co-management has demonstrated potential to improve functional status, and reduce complications and length of stay, but evidence on the effectiveness in cardiology patients is lacking. This study aims to determine if geriatric co-management is superior to usual care in preventing functional decline, complications, mortality, readmission rates, reducing length of stay and improving quality of life in older patients admitted for acute heart disease or for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and to identify determinants of success for geriatric co-management in this population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective quasi-experimental before-and-after study will be performed on two cardiology units of the University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium in patients aged ≥75 years. In the precohort (n=227), usual care will be documented. A multitude of implementation strategies will be applied to allow for successful implementation of the model. Patients in the after cohort (n=227) will undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment within 24 hours of admission to stratify them into one of three groups based on their baseline risk for developing functional decline: low-risk patients receive proactive consultation, high-risk patients will be co-managed by the geriatric nurse to prevent complications and patients with acute geriatric problems will receive an additional medication review and co-management by the geriatrician. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee UZ Leuven/KU Leuven (S58296). Written voluntary (proxy-)informed consent will be obtained from all participants at the start of the study. Dissemination of results will be through articles in scientific and professional journals both in English and Dutch and by conference presentations.

58	Family Conferences And Shared Prioritisation To Improve Patient Safety In The Frail Elderly (Cofrail): Study Protocol Of A Cluster Randomised Intervention Trial In Primary Care.	2020	59	10.1186/s13063-020-4182-x	32197631		59	21	1	285	BACKGROUND: Frailty in elderly patients is associated with an increased risk of poor health outcomes, including falls, delirium, malnutrition, hospitalisation, and mortality. Because polypharmacy is recognised as a possible major contributor to the pathogenesis of geriatric frailty, reducing inappropriate medication exposure is supposed to be a promising approach to improve health-related quality of life and prevent adverse outcomes. A major challenge for the process of deprescribing of inappropriate polypharmacy is to improve the communication between general practitioner (GPs), patient and family carer. This study investigates the effects of a complex intervention in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy living at home. METHODS: This is a cluster randomised controlled trial including 136 GPs and 676 patients. Patients with a positive clinical screening for frailty are eligible if they are aged 70 years or older, receiving family or professional nursing care at home, and taking in five or more drugs per day. Exclusion criteria are higher grade of dementia and life expectancy of 6 months or less. The GPs of the intervention group receive an educational training promoting a deprescribing guideline and providing information on how to conduct a family conference focussing on prioritisation of treatment goals concerning drug therapy. During the 1-year intervention, GPs are expected to perform a total of three family conferences, each including a structured medication review with patients and their family carers. GPs of the control group will receive no training and will deliver care as usual. Geriatric assessment of all patients will be performed by study nurses during home visits at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is the hospitalisation rate during the observation period of 12 months. Secondary outcomes are number and appropriateness of medications, mobility, weakness, cognition, depressive disorder, health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, weight, and costs of health care use. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence for a pragmatic co-operative and patient-centred educational intervention using family conferences to improve patient safety in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy.

59	To Use Or Not To Use. A Literature Review Of Factors That Influence Family Caregivers' Use Of Support Services.	2013	60	10.3928/00989134-20121107-02	23413449		60	39	1	20	Many family caregivers of frail older adults postpone or decline accessible and affordable services such as respite, despite their acknowledgement of unmet needs for support and time away from the burdens and stress of caregiving. How caregivers perceive their need for services, and the factors that influence their decisions to use or not to use services, remain poorly understood. This article reviews the literature on family caregiving and the complex interrelated factors that influence caregivers' choices regarding support services. It organizes these factors into four areas: (a) service characteristics, (b) personal predisposing factors that affect perceived need, (c) experiential coping and decision-making patterns, and (d) relational factors. It also examines the implications of this evidence for nursing assessments and interventions with frail older adults and their family caregivers.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	60	Journal Of Gerontological Nursing	1	60	mast,merle.e	Mast	Merle E
60	Risk Prediction For Adverse Outcomes For Frail Older Persons With Complex Healthcare And Social Care Needs Admitted To A Community Virtual Ward Model.	2020	61	10.2147/CIA.S236895	32606633		61	15		915	"PURPOSE: Population ageing is challenging healthcare systems with limited resources, necessitating the development of new care models to address the needs of older, frail community-dwellers. Community Virtual Wards (CVW) reduce adverse events in these patients. We examined the effect of an established CVW on pre-defined health trajectories (between ""stable"", ""deteriorating"", and ""unstable"" states) and characteristics that increased the likelihood of adverse healthcare outcomes (hospitalization, institutionalization and death). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected prospective data on frail patients admitted to a CVW in a single centre in Ireland. Relationships between risk scores, health states and adverse outcomes at 30, 60 and 90 days after admission were examined using multinomial regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 88 community-dwellers, mean (±SD) age of 82.8 ±6.4 years, were included. Most were severely frail on the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (mean 6.8/9 ±1.33). Reaching stability (""stable"" state) within 30 days was a predictor for stability at 60 and 90 days and remaining at home. Stability was also associated with fewer care episodes (<2) (p=<0.001), a requirement for fewer healthcare professionals (HCP) (<7) (p<0.001) and lower risk of delirium (p<0.001). By contrast, being ""unstable"" at 60 days increased the numbers of HCP referrals (>7) and was predictive of more acute episodes (>2) and institutionalization or death (p<0.001). Predictors of adverse outcomes of either institutionalization or death included frailty status, function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risk and cognition. CONCLUSION: A CVW model can provide a framework for monitoring and case management to support older people to remain at home or identify those at risk of institutional care. The use of defined health states helped to stratify those at lower or higher risk in an already high-risk frail population. Level of frailty, function, mobility, nutrition, pressure ulcer risks and cognition were predictive of remaining at home and reaching a level of stability or instability/deterioration and institutional care."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	61	Clinical Interventions In Aging		61	lewis,clare	Lewis	Clare
61	From Clinical Reasoning To Ehealth Interventions; A Study On How Nurses Asses Care And Ehealth In Home Care.	2021	62	10.1016/j.nepr.2020.102925	33285403		62	50		102925	The assessment of care in homecare today is complex. Nurses have to decide on care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	62	Nurse Education In Practice	1	62	der cingel,margreet.van	der Cingel	Margreet van
62	Deconditioning In The Hospitalized Elderly.	2005	63		16121472		63	101	6	16	"Deconditioning is a complex process of physiological change following a period of inactivity, bedrest or sedentary lifestyle. It results in functional losses in such areas as mental status, degree of continence and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. It is frequently associated with hospitalization in the elderly. The most predictable effects of deconditioning are seen in the musculoskeletal system and include diminished muscle mass, decreases of muscle strength by two to five percent per day, muscle shortening, changes in periarticular and cartilaginous joint structure and marked loss of leg strength that seriously limit mobility. The decline in muscle mass and strength has been linked to falls, functional decline, increased frailty and immobility. The authors describe a three-pronged strategy to combat deconditioning that includes a model of care appropriate to the growing population of elderly clients, the creation of an ""elder-friendly"" hospital environment and an exercise program."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	63	The Canadian Nurse	1	63	gillis,angela	Gillis	Angela

Early warning tools can help identify deterioration, but currently they are less often used in care homes. The aim of this quality improvement project was to introduce an early warning tool, the Significant 7, to facilitate identification and management of deterioration in care home residents. The plan, do, study, act (PDSA) method was used, and process mapping informed a tailored intervention. Introducing the tool had positive outcomes for residents and care staff. There was a reduction in the incidence of pressure ulcers and falls, and care staff were more confident in recognising resident deterioration. Next steps include scaling up the project to further examine how this early warning tool can improve resident, staff and organisational outcomes, in order to explore the potential use of the tool by community nurses with older people living at home.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	38	British Journal Of Community Nursing	1	64	little,sarah	Little	Sarah
64	Deciding About The Use Of A Personal Safety Alerting Device-The Need For A Legitimation Process: A Qualitative Study.	2021	65	10.1111/jan.14566	33048381		52	77	1	331	"AIMS: To explore reasons, thoughts, motives, and influencing factors regarding the use or non-use of Personal Safety Alerting Devices (PSADs) in the daily lives of community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was used. METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons between February-August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. RESULTS: The participants described the use or non-use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a ""legitimation process"". This process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at which to start using it. During this process, each person weighs her or his ""ageing self"" and ""perception of technology"" then decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use. ""Critical events"" initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance. CONCLUSION: The legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life. Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one. It is a complex decision-making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual ageing, self-perception, and the meaning attributed to the device. IMPACT: Older persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use. Nurses can empower them in this process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their independence."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	65	thilo,friederike.j.s	Thilo	Friederike J S
65	Implementation Of A Complex Intervention To Improve Participation In Older People With Joint Contractures Living In Nursing Homes: A Process Evaluation Of A Cluster-Randomised Pilot Trial.	2020	66	10.1186/s12877-020-01655-z	32758147		49	20	1	270	"BACKGROUND: Joint contractures in frail older people are associated with serious restrictions in participation. We developed the Participation Enabling CAre in Nursing (PECAN) intervention, a complex intervention to enable nurses to promote participation in nursing home residents with joint contractures. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of the implementation strategy and to identify enablers and barriers for a successful implementation. METHODS: The implementation of PECAN was investigated in a 6-month pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial (c-RCT). As a key component of the implementation strategy, nominated nurses were trained as facilitators in a one-day workshop and supported by peer-mentoring (visit, telephone counselling). A mixed-methods approach was conducted in conjunction with the pilot trial and guided by a framework for process evaluations of c-RCTs. Data were collected using standardised questionnaires (nursing staff), documentation forms, problem-centred qualitative interviews (facilitators, therapists, social workers, relatives, peer-mentors), and a group discussion (facilitators). A set of predefined criteria on the nursing home level was examined. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Seven nursing homes (n = 4 intervention groups, n = 3 control groups) in two regions of Germany took part in the study. Facilitators responded well to the qualification measures (workshop participation: 14/14; workshop rating: ""good""; peer-mentor visit participation: 10/14). The usage of peer-mentoring via telephone varied (one to seven contacts per nursing home). Our implementation strategy was not successful in connection with supplying the intervention to all the nurses. The clear commitment of the entire nursing home and the respect for the expertise of different healthcare professionals were emphasised as enablers, whereas a lack of impact on organisational conditions and routines and a lack of time and staff competence were mentioned as barriers. CONCLUSION: The PECAN intervention was delivered as planned to the facilitators but was unable to produce comprehensive changes in the nursing homes and subsequently for the residents. Strategies to systematically include the management and the nursing team from the beginning are needed to support the facilitators during implementation in the main trial.

66	End Of Life Care For Long-Term Care Residents With Dementia, Chronic Illness And Cancer: Prospective Staff Survey.	2019	67	10.1186/s12877-019-1159-2	31117991		49	19	1	137	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality of end of life care in long-term care (LTC) for residents with different diagnostic trajectories. The aim of this study was to compare symptoms before death in LTC for those with cancer, dementia or chronic illness. METHODS: After-death prospective staff survey of resident deaths with random cluster sampling in 61 representative LTC facilities across New Zealand (3709 beds). Deaths (n = 286) were studied over 3 months in each facility. Standardised questionnaires - Symptom Management (SM-EOLD) and Comfort Assessment in End of life with Dementia (CAD-EOLD) - were administered to staff after the resident's death. RESULTS: Primary diagnoses at the time of death were dementia (49%), chronic illness (30%), cancer (17%), and dementia and cancer (4%). Residents with cancer had more community hospice involvement (30%) than those with chronic illness (12%) or dementia (5%). There was no difference in mean SM-EOLD in the last month of life by diagnosis (cancer 26.9 (8.6), dementia 26.5(8.2), chronic illness 26.9(8.6). Planned contrast analyses of individual items found people with dementia had more pain and those with cancer had less anxiety. There was no difference in mean CAD-EOLD scores in the week before death by diagnosis (total sample 33.7(SD 5.2), dementia 34.4(SD 5.2), chronic illness 33.0(SD 5.1), cancer 33.3(5.1)). Planned contrast analyses showed significantly more physical symptoms for those with dementia and chronic illness in the last month of life than those with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, symptoms in the last week and month of life did not vary by diagnosis. However, sub-group planned contrast analyses found those with dementia and chronic illness experienced more physical distress during the last weeks and months of life than those with cancer. These results highlight the complex nature of LTC end of life care that requires an integrated gerontology/palliative care approach.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	49	Bmc Geriatrics		67	boyd,michal	Boyd	Michal
67	Translating Evidence-Based Protocols Into The Home Healthcare Setting.	2017	68	10.1097/NHH.0000000000000486	28157776		68	35	2	105	Activity-limiting pain is common among older home care patients and pain management is complicated by the high prevalence of physical frailty and multimorbidity in the home care population. A comparative effectiveness study was undertaken at a large urban home care agency to examine an evidence-based pain self-management program delivered by physical therapists (PTs). This article focuses on PT training, methods implemented to reinforce content after training and to encourage uptake of the program with appropriate patients, and therapists' fidelity to the program. Seventeen physical therapy teams were included in the cluster randomized controlled trial, with 8 teams (155 PTs) assigned to a control and 9 teams (165 PTs) assigned to a treatment arm. Treatment therapists received interactive training over two sessions, with a follow-up session 6 months later. Additional support was provided via emails, e-learning materials including videos, and a therapist manual. Program fidelity was assessed by examining PT pain documentation in the agency's electronic health record. PT feedback on the program was obtained via semistructured surveys. There were no between-group differences in the number of PTs documenting program elements with the exception of instruction in the use of imagery, which was documented by a higher percentage of intervention therapists (p = 0.002). PTs felt comfortable teaching the program elements, but cited time as the biggest barrier to implementing the protocol. Possible explanations for study results suggesting limited adherence to the program protocol by intervention-group PTs include the top-down implementation strategy, competing organizational priorities, program complexity, competing patient priorities, and inadequate patient buy-in. Implications for the implementation of complex new programs in the home healthcare setting are discussed.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	68	Home Healthcare Now	1	68	beissner,katherine.l	Beissner	Katherine L
68	Barriers And Enablers To Adherence To Anticoagulation In Heart Failure With Atrial Fibrillation: Patient And Provider Perspectives.	2017	69	10.1111/jocn.13759	28178370		34	26	23-24	4325	AIMS & OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the barriers and enablers to adherence to anticoagulation in individuals with chronic heart failure (CHF) with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) from the perspective of patients and providers. BACKGROUND: CHF and AF commonly coexist and are associated with increased stroke risk and mortality. Oral anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke risk and improves outcomes. Yet, in approximately 30% of cases, anticoagulation is not commenced for a variety of reasons. DESIGN: Qualitative study using narrative inquiry. METHODS: Data from face-to-face individual interviews with patients and information retrieved from healthcare file note review documented the clinician perspective. This study is a synthesis of the two data sources, obtained during patient clinical assessments as part of the Atrial Fibrillation And Stroke Thromboprophylaxis in hEart failuRe (AFASTER) Study. RESULTS: Patient choice and preference were important factors in anticoagulation decisions, including treatment burden, unfavourable or intolerable side effects and patient refusal. Financial barriers included cost of travel, medication cost and reimbursement. Psychological factors included psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment and depression. Social barriers included homelessness and the absence of a caregiver or lack of caregiver assistance. Clinician reticence included fear of falls, frailty, age, fear of bleeding and the challenges of multimorbidity. Facilitators to successful prescription and adherence were caregiver support, reminders and routine, self-testing and the use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: Many barriers remain to high-risk individuals being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. There are a number of enabling factors that facilitate prescription and optimise treatment adherence. Nurses should challenge these treatment barriers and seek enabling factors to optimise therapy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses can help patients and caregivers to understand complex anticoagulant risk-benefit information, and act as a patient advocate when making complex stroke prevention decisions.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	69	ferguson,caleb	Ferguson	Caleb
69	Frailty: A Review Of The First Decade Of Research.	2013	70	10.1177/1099800412462866	23086382		44	15	4	422	Frailty is an emerging geriatric syndrome that refers to a state of increased vulnerability to adverse events including mortality, morbidity, disability, hospitalization, and nursing home admission. Despite its long conceptual and operational history in research and publications, frailty and mechanisms of frailty development are still poorly understood. In this review, we describe a number of conceptual models-reliability, allostatic load, and complexity-that have been put forward to explain the dynamic nature of frailty. We illustrate a consolidated pathophysiological model of frailty, taking into consideration the large and exponentially growing body of studies regarding predictors, indicators, and outcomes of frailty. The model addresses cellular (e.g., oxidative damage and telomere length) and systemic mechanisms (e.g., endocrinal, inflammatory, coagulatory, and metabolic deficiencies) of frailty, moderating or risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lifestyle, and comorbidities), and outcomes (morbidity, disability, and cognitive decline). Finally, we identify the weaknesses of traditional epidemiological approaches for studying complex phenomena related to frailty and propose areas for future methodological and physiological inquiry.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	44	Biological Research For Nursing	1	70	zaslavsky,oleg	Zaslavsky	Oleg
70	The Chaos Of Hospitalisation For Patients With Critical Limb Ischaemia Approaching Major Amputation.	2018	71	10.1111/jocn.14536	29776002		34	27	19-20	3530	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To illuminate the hospital experience for patients and families when major amputation has been advised for critical limb ischaemia (CLI). BACKGROUND: CLI creates significant burden to the health system and the family, particularly as the person with CLI approaches amputation. Major amputation is often offered as a late intervention for CLI in response to the marked deterioration of an ischaemic limb, and functional decline from reduced mobility, intractable pain, infection and/or toxaemia. While a wealth of clinical outcome data on CLI and amputation exists internationally, little is known about the patient/family-centred experience of hospitalisation to inform preservation of personhood and patient-centred care planning. DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative study using Heideggerian phenomenology. METHODS: Fourteen patients and 13 family carers provided a semistructured interview after advice for major amputation. Where amputation followed, a second interview (6 months postprocedure) was provided by eight patients and seven family carers. Forty-two semistructured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis followed. RESULTS: Hospitalisation for CLI, with or without amputation, created a sense of chaos, characterised by being fragile and needing more time for care (fragile body and fragile mind, nurse busyness and carer hypervigilance), being adrift within uncontrollable spaces (noise, unreliable space, precarious accommodation and unpredictable scheduling) and being confused by missed and mixed messages (multiple stakeholders, information overload and cultural/linguistic diversity). CONCLUSIONS: Patients and families need a range of strategies to assist mindful decision-making in preparation for amputation in what for them is a chaotic process occurring within a chaotic environment. Cognitive deficits increase the care complexity and burden of family advocacy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A coordinated, interprofessional response should improve systems for communication, family engagement, operation scheduling and discharge planning to support preparation, adjustment and allow a sense of safety to develop. Formal peer support for patients and caregivers should be actively facilitated.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	71	monaro,susan	Monaro	Susan
71	Developing A Holistic, Multidisciplinary Community Service For Frail Older People.	2018	72	10.7748/nop.2018.e1064	30358335		10	30	7	34	This article explores the development of an ambulatory community service that demonstrates multidisciplinary working to meet the diverse needs of frail older people and their carers. The service comprises advanced nurse practitioners, a pharmacist, a community navigator, consultants, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, a nurse, rehabilitation assistants, a healthcare assistant and an administrator. This multidisciplinary team (MDT) serves adults with complex medical and rehabilitation needs who are being discharged from hospital, staying in bedded rehabilitation units or living at home by offering assessments, investigations and rehabilitation, where appropriate closer to home. The aims of the service are to: keep people well, prevent unplanned hospital admissions, promote health and well-being, reduce the risk of falls, enable independent living and provide rehabilitation. Personalised care plans are developed with patients and their carers. Advanced nursing practice is demonstrated in assessment, investigation, diagnosis, management, referral and non-medical prescribing. Development of this MDT is required to support and promote integrated, evidence-based work. Such development leads to integrated care across communities, and bridges gaps between patients and carers, GPs, home, residential and hospital-based services, and the voluntary, statutory and non-statutory sectors.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	10	Nursing Older People	1	72	featherstone,amanda	Featherstone	Amanda
72	Diagnosis And Treatment Of Pneumonia In The Nursing Home.	1995	73	10.1097/00006205-199505000-00008	7617319		73	20	5	24, 27	Risk factors, diagnosis, ethical considerations, and treatment of pneumonia in a nursing home setting are summarized. Risk factors for pneumonia include age-associated changes, co-morbid conditions, declining general health, and iatrogenic factors. Diagnosis can be challenging in geriatric residents because of atypical presentations and complex underlying diseases. Key features of presentation include rhonchi and confusion. An increased respiratory rate can be a sensitive indicator for pneumonia. Ethical dilemmas include identifying a resident's wishes for treatment in the event of an acute illness and the decision on whether to relocate the resident to an acute care facility. Decisions are based on available resources, medical stability of the resident, unimpeded access to a hospital, and the resident's well-informed decision. The common etiologic pathogen(s) of nursing-home-acquired pneumonia reflect a mixture between community-acquired and hospital-acquired pathogens. Multiple pharmacologic interventions are available, as well as supportive measures including oxygen therapy and hydration. Preventive measures are utilized to decrease the incidence of further infection.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	73	The Nurse Practitioner	1	73	hecht,a	Hecht	A
73	Stakeholder Meeting: Integrated Knowledge Translation Approach To Address The Caregiver Support Gap.	2017	74	10.1017/S0714980816000660	28052780		74	36	1	108	Family caregivers are an integral and increasingly overburdened part of the health care system. There is a gap between what research evidence shows is beneficial to caregivers and what is actually provided. Using an integrated knowledge translation approach, a stakeholder meeting was held among researchers, family caregivers, caregiver associations, clinicians, health care administrators, and policy makers. The objectives of the meeting were to review current research evidence and conduct multi-stakeholder dialogue on the potential gaps, facilitators, and barriers to the provision of caregiver supports. A two-day meeting was attended by 123 individuals. Three target populations of family caregivers were identified for discussion: caregivers of seniors with dementia, caregivers in end-of-life care, and caregivers of frail seniors with complex health needs. The results of this meeting can and are being used to inform the development of implementation research endeavours and policies targeted at providing evidence-informed caregiver supports.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	74	Canadian Journal On Aging = La Revue Canadienne Du Vieillissement		74	holroyd-leduc,jayna.m	Holroyd-Leduc	Jayna M
74	Multi-Morbidity, Frailty And Self-Care: Important Considerations In Treatment With Anticoagulation Drugs. Outcomes Of The Afaster Study.	2017	69	10.1177/1474515116642604	27036952		75	16	2	113	BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are complex cardiogeriatric syndromes mediated by physical, psychological and social factors. Thromboprophylaxis is an important part of avoiding adverse events in these syndromes, particularly stroke. PURPOSE: This study sought to describe the clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with CHF and concomitant AF and to document the rate and type of thromboprophylaxis. We examined the practice patterns of the prescription of treatment and determined the predictors of adverse events. METHODS: Prospective consecutive participants with CHF and concomitant AF were enrolled during the period April to October 2013. Outcomes were assessed at 12 months, including all-cause readmission to hospital and mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and bleeding. RESULTS: All-cause readmission to hospital was frequent (68%) and the 12-month all-cause mortality was high (29%). The prescription of anticoagulant drugs at discharge was statistically significantly associated with a lower mortality at 12 months (23 vs. 40%; p=0.037; hazards ratio 0.506; 95% confidence interval 0.267-0.956), but was not associated with lower rates of readmission to hospital among patients with CHF and AF. Sixty-six per cent of participants were prescribed anticoagulant drugs on discharge from hospital. Self-reported self-care behaviour and 'not for cardiopulmonary resuscitation' were associated with not receiving anticoagulant drugs at discharge. Although statistical significance was not achieved, those patients who were assessed as frail or having greater comorbidity were less likely to receive anticoagulant drugs at discharge. CONCLUSION: This study highlights multi-morbidity, frailty and self-care to be important considerations in thromboprophylaxis. Shared decision-making with patients and caregivers offers the potential to improve treatment knowledge, adherence and outcomes in this group of patients with complex care needs.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	75	European Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing: Journal Of The Working Group On Cardiovascular Nursing Of The European Society Of Cardiology	1	69	ferguson,caleb	Ferguson	Caleb
75	Case Study: Realizing The Value Of Nurse Practitioners In Long-Term Care.	2017	76	10.12927/cjnl.2017.25450	29676989		76	30	4	39	Presently only about 9% of seniors over the age of 75 live in residential care facilities but the anticipated exponential growth of the senior population will put increasing pressure on the need for supportive, continuing care services in the years ahead (CIHI 2017a). They are on average 86 years of age with a diagnosis of dementia (67%) and some cognitive and/or functional impairment (98%) (CIHI 2017b). These compromised seniors are also more likely to use hospital services than others, and in many jurisdictions occupy acute care beds for extended periods because ongoing management of their complex conditions is often not possible within long-term care (LTC) homes. In addition, unnecessary and futile care at the end of life often leads to suffering for individuals and their families (Dobbins 2016), which might otherwise be avoided with the presence of institutionally based providers such as nurse practitioners (NPs). Christian and Barker (2009) identified NPs as a valuable resource to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations which often lead to complications and devastating results for seniors. Although evidence of the positive impact of NPs working in LTC facilities dates back to the 1970s, very few organizations have created and obtained funding support for these positions in LTC settings. This case study illustrates the impact of the NP role in a New Brunswick LTC facility; demonstrating the value of a model that includes an NP collaborating with physicians, nurses and allied health professionals. As shown in this case, the presence of an NP clearly impacted a reduction in emergency room visits and hospitalizations, events that more often than not accelerate further physical, mental and functional decline particularly among the frail elderly. Christian and Barker (2009) described the significant consequences of hospitalization for the elderly patient including irreversible decline in function, delirium and exposure to iatrogenic disease. Having an NP available within LTC affords the residents ongoing monitoring that allows for preemptive and proactive care. NPs providing oversight to the collaborative management of the care of LTC residents has the potential to not only realize cost-avoidance for the healthcare system but also enhance the quality of care for residents and their families.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	76	Nursing Leadership (Toronto, Ont.)	1	76	cole,m.suzanne	Cole	M Suzanne
76	Symptom Trajectory And Symptom Burden In Older People With Multimorbidity, Secondary Outcome From The Rct Age-Fit Study.	2016	77	10.1111/jan.13032	27222059		52	72	11	2773	AIM: The aim of this study was to follow the symptom trajectory of community-dwelling older people with multimorbidity and to explore the effect on symptom burden from an ambulatory geriatric care unit, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment. BACKGROUND: Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity suffer from a high symptom burden with a wide range of co-occurring symptoms often resulting to decreased health-related quality of life. There is a need to move from a single-disease model and address the complexity of older people living with multimorbidity. DESIGN: Secondary outcome data from the randomized controlled Ambulatory Geriatric Assessment Frailty Intervention Trial (AGe-FIT). METHODS: Symptom trajectory of 31 symptoms was assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data from 247 participants were assessments at baseline, 12 and 24 months, 2011-2013. Participants in the intervention group received care from an ambulatory geriatric care unit based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in addition to usual care. RESULTS: Symptom prevalence and symptom burden were high and stayed high over time. Pain was the symptom with the highest prevalence and burden. Over the 2-year period 68-81% of the participants reported pain. Other highly prevalent and persistent symptoms were dry mouth, lack of energy and numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, affecting 38-59% of participants. No differences were found between the intervention and control group regarding prevalence, burden or trajectory of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Older community-dwelling people with multimorbidity had a persistent high burden of symptoms. Receiving advanced interdisciplinary care at an ambulatory geriatric unit did not significantly reduce the prevalence or the burden of symptoms.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	77	eckerblad,jeanette	Eckerblad	Jeanette
77	A Structure, Process And Outcome Evaluation Of The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention Model Of Care: A Study Protocol.	2017	78	10.1186/s12877-017-0462-z	28330452		49	17	1	76	BACKGROUND: Emergency departments are chaotic environments in which complex, frail older persons living in the community and residential aged care facilities are sometimes subjected to prolonged emergency department lengths of stay, excessive tests and iatrogenic complications. Given the ageing population, the importance of providing appropriate, quality health care in the emergency department for this cohort is paramount. One possible solution, a nurse-led, physician-championed, emergency department gerontological intervention team, which provides frontload assessment, early collateral communication and appropriate discharge planning, has been developed. The aim of this Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention is to maximise the quality of care for this vulnerable cohort in a cost effective manner. METHODS: The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention research project consists of three interrelated studies within a program evaluation design. The research comprises of a structure, process and outcome framework to ascertain the overall utility of such a program. The first study is a pre-post comparison of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention in the emergency department, comparing the patient-level outcomes before and after service introduction using a quasi-experimental design with historical controls. The second study is a descriptive qualitative study of the structures and processes required for the operation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention and clinician and patient satisfaction with service models. The third study is an economic evaluation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention model of care. DISCUSSION: There is a paucity of evidence in the literature to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in emergency departments designed to target frail older persons living in the community and residential aged care facilities. This is despite the high economic and patient morbidity and mortality experienced in these vulnerable cohorts. This research project will provide guidance related to the optimal structures and processes required to implement the model of care and the associated cost related outcomes.

78	Engineering Improved Balance Confidence In Older Adults With Complex Health Care Needs: Learning From The Muscling Up Against Disability Study.	2018	79	10.1016/j.apmr.2018.03.004	29626427		79	99	8	1525	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of balance confidence with physical and cognitive markers of well-being in older adults receiving government-funded aged care services and whether progressive resistance plus balance training could positively influence change. DESIGN: Intervention study. SETTING: Community-based older adult-specific exercise clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (N=245) with complex care needs who were receiving government-funded aged care support. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-four weeks of twice weekly progressive resistance plus balance training carried out under the supervision of accredited exercise physiologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure was the Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale. Secondary measures included the Short Physical Performance Battery; fall history gathered as part of the health history questionnaire; hierarchical timed balance tests; Geriatric Anxiety Index; Geriatric Depression Scale; Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, Loss of Weight scale; and EuroQoL-5 dimension 3 level. RESULTS: At baseline, better physical performance (r=.54; P<.01) and quality of life (r=.52; P<.01) predicted better balance confidence. In contrast, at baseline, higher levels of frailty predicted worse balance confidence (r=-.55; P<.01). Change in balance confidence after the exercise intervention was accompanied by improved physical performance (+12%) and reduced frailty (-11%). Baseline balance confidence was identified as the most consistent negative predictor of change scores across the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that reduced physical performance and quality of life and increased frailty are predictive of worse balance confidence in older adults with aged care needs. However, when a targeted intervention of resistance and balance exercise is implemented that reduces frailty and improves physical performance, balance confidence will also improve. Given the influence of balance confidence on a raft of well-being determinants, including the capacity for positive physical and cognitive change, this study offers important insight to those looking to reduce falls in older adults.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	79	Archives Of Physical Medicine And Rehabilitation		79	hetherington,sharon	Hetherington	Sharon
79	Treatment Fidelity Of An Evidence-Based Nurse-Led Intervention In A Proactive Primary Care Program For Older People.	2016	80	10.1111/wvn.12151	26873373		80	13	1	75	BACKGROUND: In a large randomized trial, Utrecht PROactive Frailty Intervention Trial (U-PROFIT), we evaluated the effectiveness of an integrated program on the preservation of daily functioning in older people in primary care that consisted of a frailty identification tool and a multicomponent nurse-led care program. Examination of treatment fidelity is critical to successful translation of evidence-based interventions into practice. AIMS: To assess treatment delivery, dose and content of nursing care delivered within the nurse-led care program, and to explore if the delivery may have influenced the trial results. METHODS: A mixed-methods study was conducted. Type and dose of nursing care were collected during the trial. Shortly after the trial, a focus group with nurses was conducted to explore reasons for the observed differences between the type and dose of nursing care delivered. RESULTS: A total of 835 older persons were included in the nurse-led care program. The mean age was 75 years, 64% were female and 53.5% were living alone. The most frequent self-reported conditions were loneliness (60.8%) and cognitive problems (59.4%). One-third of the patients with a geriatric condition received an additional assessment (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination), and the majority of these patients received at least one nurse intervention (>85%). Most nursing care was delivered to patients at risk of falling and to those with urinary incontinence. Patients with nutrition problems seldom received nursing interventions. The nurses explained that differences in type and dose were influenced by the preference of the patient, the type of geriatric problem, and the time required to apply a nurse intervention. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: All intervention components were delivered; however, differences were observed in the type and dose of nursing care delivered across geriatric conditions. The findings better explain the treatment fidelity and suggest that there is room for improvement that may result in more beneficial patient outcomes.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	80	Worldviews On Evidence-Based Nursing	1	80	bleijenberg,nienke	Bleijenberg	Nienke
80	Implementing Care Programmes For Frail Older People: A Project Management Perspective.	2015	81	10.1016/j.healthpol.2014.09.008	25312901		81	119	1	9	OBJECTIVE: To examine the issues that influenced the implementation of programmes designed to identify and support frail older people in the community in the Netherlands. METHODS: Qualitative research methods were used to investigate the perspectives of project leaders, project members and members of the steering committee responsible for the implementation of the programmes. Interviews were conducted in 2009 (n = 10) and in 2012 (n = 13) and a focus group was organised in 2012 (n = 5). MAIN FINDINGS: The interviews revealed that the implementation was influenced by the extent and quality of collaboration between organisations, adaptation to existing structures, future funding for the programmes and project leadership. A good relationship between participating organisations and professionals is required for successful implementation. A lack of clear project leadership and structural funding hampers the implementation of complex programmes in primary care settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study are useful for organisations and professionals who are planning to implement complex programmes. Identifying barriers concerning institutional collaboration, adaptation to existing structures, leadership and continuation of financial support at an early stage of the implementation process can support practitioners in overcoming them.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	81	Health Policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)		81	bindels,jill	Bindels	Jill
81	"Validation Of The ""Doorbell Test"": A Novel Functional Test Of Frailty And Clinical Status After Acute Decompensated Heart Failure."	2020	82	10.1016/j.hlc.2019.08.010	31594721		82	29	7	1054	BACKGROUND: Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) carries a high event rate following discharge. The complex interplay between age, frailty and decongestion may lend itself to a functional test. METHODS: In the doorbell test the patient simulates answering the doorbell. They are timed rising from a recumbent position, bending over twice and walking 10 metres, this time is added to the change in respiratory rate. We aimed to determine if the doorbell test was associated with post ADHF events (death or readmission). The test was performed at hospital discharge, with follow up at 30-days and 1-year. RESULTS: In 74 patients at 30-days there was a 14% event rate. At 1-year there were 40 (54%) events (9 deaths and 31 readmissions, 28 were cardiovascular of which 14 were [heart failure] HF). Amongst those who had an event at 30-days only doorbell test scores were different (58 [36,72] vs 32 [26,53] p < 0.05). One-year (1-year) events were associated with doorbell test scores (47 [29,62] vs 30 [26,42] p < 0.05), body weight (78 kg [68,94] vs 95 [76,105] (p < 0.05), creatinine (134 mmol/L [114, 173] vs 99 [82, 133] p < 0.01) and age (76 years [61,86] vs 67 [53, 73] p < 0.01). Heart failure readmissions were associated with doorbell test scores (56 [46,68] vs 30 [26,47] p < 0.001). Death was associated with body weight (74 kg [69,81] vs 88 [72,101] p < 0.05) and age (83 years [78,86] vs 69 [55,77] p < 0.01). After age stratification, the hazard ratio for heart failure readmission associated with a high doorbell test score was 11.08 (95%C.I. 2.01-61.17 p = 0.006), while the hazard ratio for 1-year cardiovascular readmission was 4.62 (95%C.I. 1.71-12.51 p = 0.003). There was no association with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSION: The doorbell test represents a novel test of multiple domains of the ADHF pre-discharge state and demonstrates an association with 30-day and 1-year rehospitalisation.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	82	Heart, Lung & Circulation		82	gunton,james.e	Gunton	James E
82	Conceptualizations Of Frailty In Relation To Older Adults.	2003	83	10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02767.x	12956670		52	44	1	58	AIM: The aim of this article is to discuss the concept of frailty and its adequacy in identifying and describing older adults as frail. BACKGROUND: Despite the dramatic increase in use of the term 'frailty' over the past two decades, there is a lack of consensus in the literature about its meaning and use, and no clear conceptual guidelines for identifying and describing older adults as frail. Differences in theoretical perspectives will influence policy decisions regarding eligibility for, and allocation of, scarce health care resources among older adults. METHOD: The article presents a literature review and synthesis of definitions and conceptual models of frailty in relation to older adults. The first part of the paper is a summary of the synonyms, antonyms and definitions of the term frailty. The second part is a critical evaluation of conceptual models of frailty. Six conceptual models are analysed on the basis of four main categories of assumptions about: (1) the nature of scientific knowledge; (2) the level of analysis; (3) the ageing process; (4) the stability of frailty. The implications of these are discussed in relation to clinical practice, policy and research. CONCLUSION: The review gives guidelines for a new theoretical approach to the concept of frailty in older adults: (1) it must be a multidimensional concept that considers the complex interplay of physical, psychological, social and environmental factors; (2) the concept must not be age-related, suggesting a negative and stereotypical view of ageing; (3) the concept must take into account an individual's context and incorporate subjective perceptions; (4) the concept must take into account the contribution of both individual and environmental factors.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	83	markle-reid,maureen	Markle-Reid	Maureen

Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated ""sub-acute"" frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants (n = 62) required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home."		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	74	Canadian Journal On Aging = La Revue Canadienne Du Vieillissement		84	elbourne,heather.fillmore	Elbourne	Heather Fillmore
84	Knowledge Gaps In Cardiovascular Care Of Older Adults: A Scientific Statement From The American Heart Association, American College Of Cardiology, And American Geriatrics Society: Executive Summary.	2016	85	10.1111/jgs.14576	27673575		32	64	11	2185	The incidence and prevalence of most cardiovascular disorders increase with age, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and major disability in adults aged 75 and older. Despite the effect of CVD on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in older adults, individuals aged 75 and older have been markedly underrepresented in most major cardiovascular trials, and virtually all trials have excluded older adults with complex comorbidities, significant physical or cognitive disabilities, frailty, or residence in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of older adults typical of those encountered in routine clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision-making, and recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these objectives, a detailed review was conducted of current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older adults. A pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision-making in older adults with CVD was found, as well as a paucity of data on the effect of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on outcomes that are particularly important to older adults, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large population-based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older adults representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to older adults in the study design. The results of these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines applicable to older adults and enhance person-centered care of older individuals with CVD in the United States and around the world.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	32	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		85	rich,michael.w	Rich	Michael W
85	A Community Virtual Ward Model To Support Older Persons With Complex Health Care And Social Care Needs.	2017	86	10.2147/CIA.S130876	28721026		61	12		985	BACKGROUND: Globally the older population is increasing rapidly. As a result there is an increase in frail older persons living within the community, with increased risks of a hospital admission and higher mortality and morbidity rates. Due to complexity of care, health care professionals face challenges in providing effective case management and avoiding unplanned admissions to hospital. A community virtual ward (CVW) model was developed to assist health care professionals to support older persons at home during periods of illness and/or functional decline. METHODS: A quantitative observational study was conducted to examine if a CVW model of care reduced unplanned hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations in 54 patients over a 12-month period. The sign-rank test examined matched data on bed days, ED presentations, and unplanned hospital admissions pre- and post-CVW implementation. Other risk factors for admission to hospital were examined using the Mann-Whitney test pre-and post-CVW admission, including falls, living alone, and cognition. Correlations between hospital admission avoidances and unplanned hospital admissions and ED presentations were tested using Spearman's ρ test. RESULTS: There was a reduction in ED presentations post-CVW admission (P<0.001), and median unscheduled admissions were reduced (P=0.001). Those living alone had a lower number of ED presentations (median 0.5, interquartile range 0-1) prior to admission in comparison to those living with a caregiver, with no differences observed during admission to CVW. For those who experienced a fall during CVW admission, the odds ratio (OR) of requiring long-term care doubled for each extra fall (OR =2.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.52, P=0.025). Reduced cognition was associated with an increased risk of ED presentations (ρ=0.292, P<0.05) but not associated with increased risks of unplanned hospital admissions (ρ=0.09, P=0.546). There were no significant correlations seen between admission avoidance and the number of unplanned hospital admissions or ED presentations. CONCLUSION: Through an integrated approach to care, a CVW model in the care of older persons can reduce ED presentations and unplanned hospital admissions.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	61	Clinical Interventions In Aging		86	lewis,c	Lewis	C
86	Carers' And Nurses' Appraisals Of Needs Of Nursing Home Placement For Frail Older In Norway.	2009	87	10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02663.x	19374699		34	18	22	3079	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to explore carers' and nurses' appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement. BACKGROUND: Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations. DESIGN: This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. METHODS: The convenience sample (n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Various similarities and differences between nurses' and carers' appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: 'appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed', 'appraising the older people as able to continue living at home', 'being ambivalent about nursing home placement' and 'being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement'. CONCLUSIONS: Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	87	fjelltun,aud-mari.sohini	Fjelltun	Aud-Mari Sohini
87	Framing Moving And Handling As A Complex Healthcare Intervention Within The Acute Care Of Older People With Osteoporosis: A Qualitative Study.	2016	88	10.1111/jocn.13344	27550628		34	25	19-20	2906	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under-researched. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism. METHODS: The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. RESULTS: Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In-hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of 'Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention', with further categories 'healthcare practitioners' capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis' and 'the structural and organisational context for moving and handling' are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients' experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Increased focus on musculoskeletal conditions and moving and handling implications is required.		2021-07-02 01:27:51	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	88	smith,margaret.coulter	Smith	Margaret Coulter
88	Older Women, Intimate Partner Violence And Mental Health: A Consideration Of The Particular Issues For Health And Healthcare Practice.	2017	89	10.1111/jocn.13490	27487083		34	26	15-16	2177	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and well-being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. DESIGN: Meta-ethnographic synthesis of qualitative evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end of December 2015. RESULTS: The review identified that intimate partner violence exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well-being of those who experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service providers need to be aware of these. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: urses and healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of abuse and this includes older women.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	89	mcgarry,julie	McGarry	Julie
89	Does Change In The Neighborhood Environment Prevent Obesity In Older Women?	2014	90	10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.11.047	24565150		90	102		129	Neighborhood environment is consistently associated with obesity; changes to modifiable aspects of the neighborhood environment may curb the growth of obesity in the US and other developed nations. However, currently the majority of studies are cross-sectional and thus not appropriate for evaluating causality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a neighborhood-changing intervention on changes in obesity among older women. Over the past 30 years the Portland, Oregon metropolitan region has made significant investments in plans, regulatory structures, and public facilities to reduce sprawl and increase compact growth centers, transit-oriented development approaches, and green space. We used geocoded residential addresses to link data on land-use mix, public transit access, street connectivity, and access to green space from four time points between 1986 and 2004, with longitudinal data on body mass index (BMI) from a cohort of 2003 community-dwelling women aged 66 years and older. Height and weight were measured at clinic visits. Women self-reported demographics, health habits, and chronic conditions, and self-rated their health. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was assessed from census data. Neighborhood walkability and access to green space improved over the 18-year study period. On average there was a non-significant mean weight loss in the cohort between baseline (mean age 72.6 years) and the study's end (mean age 85.0 years). We observed no association between neighborhood built environment or change in built environment and BMI. Greater neighborhood socioeconomic status at baseline was independently associated with a healthier BMI at baseline, and protected against an age-related decline in BMI over time. BMI decreases with age reflect increased frailty, especially among older adults with complex morbidities. Future research should consider the influence of the neighborhood environment on additional relevant health outcomes and should include measures of the social environment in conjunction with built environment measures.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	90	Social Science & Medicine (1982)		90	michael,yvonne.l	Michael	Yvonne L
90	Uniplanar Versus Biplanar Monolateral External Fixator Knee Arthrodesis After End-Stage Failed Infected Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Comparative Study.	2020	91	10.1007/s00590-020-02633-2	32020375		91	30	5	815	BACKGROUND: External fixator knee arthrodesis is a salvage procedure used primarily in cases of end-stage infected total knee replacement (iTKR). Stable fixation combined with bone-end compression is essential to achieve knee fusion, but providing sufficient stability can be challenging in the presence of severe bone loss. Our hypothesis is that using an external fixation biplanar configuration would bring about a fusion rate superior to that of a monolateral frame. METHODS: This study compares outcomes of biplanar external fixator knee fusion due to non-revisable iTKR with those of a historical cohort control study with patients managed with a monoplanar configuration. Primary endpoints were fusion rate, time to achieve bone fusion and infection eradication rate. Limb-length discrepancy, pain level, patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 29 knee fusion cases were included. In the biplanar group, infection was eradicated in 100% of the patients and fusion was achieved in all cases within an average of 5.24 months. In comparison, in the monolateral group, infection was eradicated in 86% of the cases and fusion was achieved in 81% of the patients after a mean of 10.3 months (p < 0.05). In both groups, postoperative pain was mild and patients expressed a high degree of satisfaction once fusion was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, external fixation knee fusion is a useful limb-salvage procedure in end-stage cases of knee PJI. We conclude that a biplanar configuration can halve the time required to achieve solid bone fusion in such a complex scenario.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	91	European Journal Of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology: Orthopedie Traumatologie		91	corona,pablo.s	Corona	Pablo S

New intervention management grouping approaches are needed to deal with large, complex clinical intervention data sets. We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted hospitalizations among frail (n = 386) and non-frail (n = 1,364) elders. Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of care that is needed and the level of care that is provided.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	92	Research In Nursing & Health	1	92	monsen,karen.a	Monsen	Karen A
92	Older Adults' Satisfaction With A Medication Dispensing Device In Home Care.	2013	93	10.3109/17538157.2012.741084	23323721		93	38	3	211	INTRODUCTION: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions face the complex task of medication management involving multiple medications of varying doses at different times. Advances in telehealth technologies have resulted in home-based devices for medication management and health monitoring of older adults. We examined older adults' perceptions of a telehealth medication dispensing device as part of a clinical trial involving home healthcare clients, nurse coordination and use of the medication dispensing device. METHODS: Ninety-six frail older adult participants who used the medication dispensing device for 12 months completed a satisfaction survey related to perceived usefulness and reliability. Results were analyzed and grouped by themes in the following areas: Ease of Use, Reliability, Medication Management Assistance, Routine Task Performance and Acceptability. RESULTS: Nearly all participants perceived the medication dispensing device as very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in the management of their medications. Eighty-four percent of participants expressed a desire to use the machine in the future. CONCLUSION: The technology-enhanced medication management device in this study is an acceptable tool for older adults to manage medication in collaboration with home care nurses. Improved usability and cost models for medication dispensers are areas for future research.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	93	Informatics For Health & Social Care		93	reeder,blaine	Reeder	Blaine
93	Who Is Looking After Mom And Dad? Unregulated Workers In Canadian Long-Term Care Homes.	2015	94	10.1017/S0714980814000506	25525838		74	34	1	47	Older adults living in residential long-term care or nursing homes have increasingly complex needs, including more dementia than in the past, yet we know little about the unregulated workforce providing care. We surveyed 1,381 care aides in a representative sample of 30 urban nursing homes in the three Canadian Prairie provinces and report demographic, health and well-being, and work-related characteristics. Over 50 per cent of respondents were not born in Canada and did not speak English as their first language. They reported moderately high levels of burnout and a strong sense of their work's worth. Few respondents reported attending educational sessions. This direct caregiver workforce is poorly understood, has limited training or standards for minimum education, and training varies widely across provinces. Workplace characteristics affecting care aides reflect factors that precipitate burnout in allied health professions, with implications for quality of care, staff health, and staff retention.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	74	Canadian Journal On Aging = La Revue Canadienne Du Vieillissement		94	estabrooks,carole.a	Estabrooks	Carole A
94	Recognizing And Responding To Deterioration In Care Homes: A Scoping Review Protocol.	2021	95	10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00413	33230017		95	19	2	447	OBJECTIVE: To identify the available published primary research and any relevant policies, guidelines, or protocols regarding how care home staff recognize and respond to an acutely deteriorating resident. INTRODUCTION: Older people living in care homes have complex health care needs. Chronic illnesses, comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and physical dependency can contribute to unpredictable changes in their health status that can lead to residents becoming unwell and acutely deteriorating. Exploring how care home staff recognize and respond to acutely deteriorating health among residents is important to understand whether opportunities exist to minimize these unpredictable changes in health. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will consider studies that feature the recognition and response to acute deterioration in care home residents. This review will consider qualitative and quantitative primary research. Non-indexed and gray literature such as policies, deterioration tools, and reports from health policy organizations will also be included. METHODS: The searches will be conducted using bibliographic databases, university repositories, and non-indexed and gray literature, such as reports by health care and health policy organizations. The studies will be independently selected from the inclusion criteria by two researchers based on their title and abstract. In case of disagreement, a third researcher will be consulted. An adapted version of the JBI data extraction form will be used to extrapolate data from included studies. The results will be presented in tabular form, accompanied by a narrative summary related to the objectives of the scoping review.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	95	Jbi Evidence Synthesis		95	hodge,sevim.y	Hodge	Sevim Y
95	Psychological And Social Resources Relate To Biomarkers Of Allostasis In Newly Admitted Nursing Home Residents.	2016	96	10.1080/13607863.2015.1072796	26237175		96	20	1	88	OBJECTIVES: This paper presents preliminary baseline data from a prospective study of nursing home adaptation that attempts to capture the complexity of residents' adaptive resources by examining psychological, social, and biological variables from a longitudinal conceptual framework. Our emphasis was on validating an index of allostasis. METHOD: In a sample of 26 long-term care patients, we measured 6 hormone and protein biomarkers to capture the concept of allostasis as an index of physiological resilience, related to other baseline resources, including frailty, hope and optimism, social support, and mental health history, collected via interview with the resident and collaterals. We also examined the performance of self-report measures reflecting psychosocial and well-being constructs, given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in nursing homes. RESULTS: Our results supported both the psychometric stability of our self-report measures, and the preliminary validity of our index of allostasis. Each biomarker was associated with at least one other resilience resource, suggesting that our choice of biomarkers was appropriate. As a group, the biomarkers showed good correspondence with the majority of other resource variables, and our standardized summation score was also associated with physical, social, and psychological resilience resources, including those reflecting physical and mental health vulnerability as well as positive resources of social support, optimism, and hope. CONCLUSION: Although these results are based on a small sample, the effect sizes were large enough to confer some confidence in the value of pursuing further research relating biomarkers of allostasis to psychological and physical resources and well-being.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	96	Aging & Mental Health		96	meeks,suzanne	Meeks	Suzanne
96	Patient Outcomes Following Lower Leg Major Amputations For Peripheral Arterial Disease: A Series Review.	2017	71	10.1016/j.jvn.2016.10.003	28527727		97	35	2	49	INTRODUCTION: Despite improvements in revascularization, major amputation remains a significant part of the case-mix in vascular surgical units. These patients tend to be elderly with complex pathology, resulting in poor outcomes and longer lengths of stay (LOS). AIM: This series review provides a description of the patient complexities and outcomes in an Australian cohort undergoing major lower limb amputation for peripheral arterial disease. METHOD: Medical records coded for major amputation between July 2012 and June 2013 in an Australian government funded, tertiary hospital were retrospectively reviewed and descriptively analyzed. FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients had 29 major amputations including four conversions from below to above knee. Seventeen had multiple vascular procedures before amputation. The average LOS exceeded the national target, and there was substantial morbidity and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Major amputation continues to present challenges because of patient frailty and the high rate of complications. These issues need to be considered in a robust care planning framework that includes consideration of cognitive decline and other markers of frailty. Opportunities to optimize the physical condition of these patients and to reduce delays in proceeding to surgery require further investigation.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	97	Journal Of Vascular Nursing: Official Publication Of The Society For Peripheral Vascular Nursing	1	71	monaro,susan	Monaro	Susan
97	Developing And Piloting A Multifactorial Intervention To Address Participation And Quality Of Life In Nursing Home Residents With Joint Contractures (Jointconimprove): Study Protocol.	2015	98	10.3205/000217	26195926		98	13		Doc13	BACKGROUND: Joint contractures are common problems in frail older people in nursing homes. Irrespective of the exact extent of older individuals in geriatric care settings living with joint contractures, they appear to be a relevant problem. Also, the new emphasis on the syndrome of joint contractures, e. g. by the German statutory long term care insurance, led to an increase in assessment and documentation efforts and preventive interventions in clinical care. However, more attention should be paid to the actual situation of older individuals in nursing homes with prevalent joint contractures, particularly their experience of related activity limitations and participation restrictions. Thus, the aim of this study is 1) to develop a tailored intervention to improve functioning, and especially participation and quality of life in older residents with joint contractures in nursing homes and 2) to test the feasibility of the intervention accompanied by a rigorous process evaluation. METHODS: The complex intervention, which will be developed in this project follows the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework and integrates the perspectives of all potentially relevant user groups, from the affected individuals to clinicians and researchers. The development process will comprise a systematic literature review, reanalysis of existing data and the integration of the knowledge of the affected individuals and experts. The developed intervention including a comprehensive process evaluation will be pilot tested with residents with joint contractures in three nursing homes. DISCUSSION: The projected study will provide a tailored intervention to improve functioning, participation and quality of life in older residents with joint contractures in nursing homes. With this focus, the intervention will support patient relevant outcomes. The pilot study including process evaluation will offer a first opportunity to indicate the size of the intervention's effect and prepare further studies.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	98	German Medical Science: Gms E-Journal		98	müller,martin	Müller	Martin
98	Complexity In Caring For An Ageing Heart Failure Population: Concomitant Chronic Conditions And Age Related Impairments.	2004	99	10.1016/j.ejcnurse.2004.08.004	15572013		75	3	4	263	The complexity of caring for the ageing heart failure (HF) population is further complicated by concomitant chronic conditions (i.e., polypharmacy, depression), age related impairments (i.e., hearing, visual and cognitive impairments, impairments in activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and other issues (e.g., health illiteracy, lack of social support). This paper provides an overview of these risk factors, outlines how they individually and in interplay endanger favourable outcome by putting patients at risk for poor self-management. Moreover, suggestions are made on how these issues could be addressed and integrated in heart failure management by applying gerontological care principles in caring for the ageing heart failure population.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	75	European Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing: Journal Of The Working Group On Cardiovascular Nursing Of The European Society Of Cardiology	1	99	de geest,sabina	De Geest	Sabina
99	Quality Of Life In Nursing Homes: Perception Of Physically Frail Elderly Residents.	2007	100	10.1111/j.1471-6712.2007.00434.x	17428214		100	21	1	48	The purpose of this research was to disclose the characteristics of quality of life as perceived by physically frail but lucid elderly people living in nursing homes to increase the understanding of the phenomenon of quality of life in this setting. Eight elderly residents living in two nursing homes in Iceland were interviewed on two occasions. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to generate text for hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. Observation was also undertaken at both nursing homes to enhance the understanding of the residents' narration. The participants' concern in relation to quality of life emerges in the following main themes: (i) Securing the insecure body; (ii) Seeking solace; (iii) Preparing for departure; and (iv) Affirmation of self. The findings indicate that the phenomenon quality of life is manifold and complex, having many dimensions. The most important aspects of quality of life were for the residents to feel secure in the nursing home, have a place of their own where they could be alone with their thoughts, set their affairs in order and be prepared for death. Furthermore, it mattered to be recognized as an individual with his or her roots in their own respective family and doing meaningful things. These aspects of life in a nursing home contribute to living in a meaningful world in which humanity is preserved. It is important in caring for this particular group of residents in the nursing home to know what matters most in relation to their quality of life.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	100	Scandinavian Journal Of Caring Sciences	1	100	hjaltadóttir,ingibjörg	Hjaltadóttir	Ingibjörg
100	Disability Intervention Model For Older Adults With Arthritis: An Integration Of Theory Of Symptom Management And Disablement Process Model.	2014	101	10.1016/j.anr.2014.08.004	25529905		101	8	4	241	To evolve a management plan for rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to understand the patient's symptom experience and disablement process. This paper aims to introduce and critique two models as a conceptual foundation from which to construct a new model for arthritis care. A Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis includes three interrelated concepts of symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and symptom outcomes that correspond to the Theory of Symptom Management. These main concepts influence or are influenced by contextual factors that are situated within the domains of person, environment, and health/illness. It accepts the bidirectional, complex, dynamic interactions among all components within the model representing the comprehensive aspects of the disablement process and its interventions in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In spite of some limitations such as confusion or complexity within the model, the Disability Intervention Model for Older Adults with Arthritis has strengths in that it encompasses the majority of the concepts of the two models, attempts to compensate for the limitations of the two models, and aims to understand the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on a patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional health status, socioeconomic status, and well-being. Therefore, it can be utilized as a guiding theoretical framework for arthritis care and research to improve the functional status of older adults with rheumatoid arthritis.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	101	Asian Nursing Research	1	101	shin,so.young	Shin	So Young
101	Diabetes Management And Education In Older Adults: The Development Of A National Consensus Of Key Research Priorities.	2016	102	10.1016/j.jcjd.2015.08.010	26616558		102	40	1	31	OBJECTIVES: Diabetes in older adults is increasing in its prevalence and complexity. To date, little research has been done to inform current diabetes management, including education and support, in older adults in Canada. The objective of this interactive national workshop was to develop key research priorities for future research related to diabetes in older adults. METHODS: Workshop participants comprised interprofessional healthcare providers, decision makers and policy makers from across Canada. Approximately 30 individuals attended an interactive 2-day meeting that included expert presentations and group consensus building using an electronic meeting system as well as nominal group techniques. RESULTS: The results of the 2-day meeting found more than 50 ideas that were summarized into 5 overall themes, with 14 subquestions, reflecting areas such as 1) identifying relevant outcomes for patients, providers and decision makers; 2) diabetes prevention; 3) the impact of diabetes on older adults and informal caregivers; 4) risk assessment tools and 5) effective models of care across a variety of healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS: To date, this workshop is the first of its kind and follows suit with other international working groups and associations. The research priorities developed through consensus from this workshop set forward a research agenda for diabetes in older adults in Canada.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	102	Canadian Journal Of Diabetes		102	sherifali,diana	Sherifali	Diana
102	Integrated Client Care For Frail Older Adults In The Community: Preliminary Report On A System-Wide Approach.	2014	103	10.12927/hcq.2014.24022	25591612		103	17	3	61	The Toronto Central Community Care Access Centre is leading a collaborative local health integration network systemic change initiative to implement and evaluate a practical model of integrated care for older adults with complex needs. The approach is embedded in the community where older adults and their families live and is designed to first and foremost improve the quality of care while ultimately bending the cost curve. The model is leveraging and aligning existing system resources by bringing together sectors from across the health system to create ways of working that build capacity in the system to be more responsive to this population. Outcomes to date will be discussed and next steps described. The secondary goal was to understand the key elements of this integration that can be scaled locally and across the province.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	103	Healthcare Quarterly (Toronto, Ont.)		103	goldhar,jodeme	Goldhar	Jodeme
103	Improving Value Of Care For Older Adults With Advanced Medical Illness And Functional Decline: Cost Analyses Of A Home-Based Palliative Care Program.	2018	104	10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.08.015	30165123		104	56	6	928	CONTEXT: Identifying high-value health care delivery for patients with clinically complex and high-cost conditions is important for future reimbursement models. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the Medicare reimbursement savings of an established palliative care homebound program. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study involving 50 participants enrolled in a palliative care homebound program and 95 propensity-matched control patients at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between September 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. Total Medicare reimbursement was compared in the year before enrollment with the year after enrollment for participants and controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in demographic characteristics or prognostic indices between the two groups. Total Medicare reimbursement per program participant the year before program enrollment was $16,429 compared with $14,427 per control patient, resulting in $2004 higher charges per program patient. In 12 months after program enrollment, mean annual payment was $5783 per patient among participants and $22,031 per patient among the matched controls. In the second year, the intervention group had a decrease of $10,646 per patient; the control group had an increase of $7604 per patient. The difference between the participant group and control group was statistically significant (P < 0.001) and favored the palliative care homebound program enrollees by $18,251 (95% CI, $11,268-$25,234). CONCLUSION: The Mayo Clinic Palliative Care Homebound Program reduced annual Medicare expenditures by $18,251 per program participant compared with matched control patients. This supports the role of home-based palliative medicine in delivering high-value care to high-risk older adults.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	104	Journal Of Pain And Symptom Management	1	104	chen,christina.y	Chen	Christina Y
104	Older People'S Experiences Of Nurse-Patient Telephone Communication In The Primary Healthcare Setting.	2018	105	10.1111/jan.13449	28881437		52	74	2	373	AIM: To determine which aspects of primary nurse-patient telephone communication are viewed positively or negatively in terms of meeting the older persons' needs. BACKGROUND: Health professionals are increasingly being called on to develop different ways of working and increase their capacity to meet the needs of an ageing population. In some countries, telephone communication between primary nurses and patients in General Practice is already seen as a routine practice, but determining the value of this type of communication as a specific health service needs more understanding. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study as the aim was to explore the older person's experiences. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 older people from General Practices in New Zealand during 2014-2015. Thematic analysis was informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: The overarching theme was the difficulties older people face in making decisions about whether to contact a health professional by telephone and whether this should be the Primary nurse. Accounting for some of their symptoms as age related added to the uncertainty of decision-making. Importantly, some older people were not raising concerns e.g. emotional state. CONCLUSION: Decision-making by older people around treatment seeking is complex. Increasing the awareness of the nurse role in the General Practice is integral to creating a health system which will meet the needs of a growing older population. Primary care practices can review their systems to better inform older people how the nurse-telephone role as a specific health service works and what they can expect when using this service.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	105	waterworth,susan	Waterworth	Susan
105	Violence In Nursing Homes: Perceptions Of Female Caregivers.	2008	106	10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02196.x	18482127		34	17	12	1660	AIM: This study illuminates how female caregivers in nursing home perceive violence. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on prevalence and types of violence and injuries in various settings and among various professionals. There are, however, few studies that examine how caregivers perceive violence. METHODS: Forty-one female caregivers at nursing homes were asked to reflect on a vignette containing a situation where a female caregiver is exposed to violence from a male resident. The reflections were analysed by qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The main finding indicates that perceiving an action as violent is in the eye of the beholder. Caregivers perceive violence to be challenging, intentional, excusable, ordinary and contextual relative to their own experience and attitudes. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the perception of violence is subjective, there is a risk that violent incidents will be under-reported as well as over-reported. To avoid this, it is important to construct a well-defined operationalised definition of violence for research purposes. Our findings also indicate the need for individually structured and adjusted support for caregivers. To explore the complexity of violence, further research should focus on how caregivers and residents experience violence in a nursing home.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	106	isaksson,ulf	Isaksson	Ulf
106	Protocol For The Prehab Study-Pre-Operative Rehabilitation For Reduction Of Hospitalization After Coronary Bypass And Valvular Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial.	2015	107	10.1136/bmjopen-2014-007250	25753362		30	5	3	e007250	INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterised by reductions in muscle mass, strength, endurance and activity level. The frailty syndrome, prevalent in 25-50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, is associated with increased rates of mortality and major morbidity as well as function decline postoperatively. This trial will compare a preoperative, interdisciplinary exercise and health promotion intervention to current standard of care (StanC) for elective coronary artery bypass and valvular surgery patients for the purpose of determining if the intervention improves 3-month and 12-month clinical outcomes among a population of frail patients waiting for elective cardiac surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, randomised, open end point, controlled trial using assessor blinding and intent-to-treat analysis. Two-hundred and forty-four elective cardiac surgical patients will be recruited and randomised to receive either StanC or StanC plus an 8-week exercise and education intervention at a certified medical fitness facility. Patients will attend two weekly sessions and aerobic exercise will be prescribed at 40-60% of heart rate reserve. Data collection will occur at baseline, 1-2 weeks preoperatively, and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcome of the trial will be the proportion of patients requiring a hospital length of stay greater than 7 days. POTENTIAL IMPACT OF STUDY: The healthcare team is faced with an increasingly complex older adult patient population. As such, this trial aims to provide novel evidence supporting a health intervention to ensure that frail, older adult patients thrive after undergoing cardiac surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national and international scientific meetings. The University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board has approved the study protocol V.1.3, dated 11 August 2014 (H2014:208). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry and results database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies (NCT02219815).		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	30	Bmj Open		107	stammers,andrew.n	Stammers	Andrew N
107	Clinical Profile Of Acute Confusion In The Long-Term Care Setting.	2003	108	10.1177/1054773803012002003	12741667		108	12	2	145	Aspects of acute confusion (AC) including risk factors, behavior patterns, and outcomes are not well documented in long-term care (LTC) residents. The purpose of this prospective study was to describe the clinical profile of AC in LTC including risk factors, behavior patterns, etiologies, and 3-month outcomes. Seventy-four elderly LTC residents were assessed for AC, depression, and global cognitive impairment. Risk factors associated with AC included hearing deficits, depression, pulmonary disorders, and abnormal serum sodium or potassium levels. Behavior patterns of acutely confused residents included hyperactive (n = 9, 31%), hypoactive (n = 8, 28%), and mixed (n = 7, 24%). In the majority of the AC cases, the etiology was multIfactorial infections and dehydration were the most common causes. Residents with AC had very poor 3-month outcomes. Thirty-four percent (n = 10) of the residents with AC died within 3 months of the evaluation. This study highlights the complexity and serious nature of AC in this frail population.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	108	Clinical Nursing Research	1	108	cacchione,pamela.z	Cacchione	Pamela Z
108	Around-The-Clock Nursing Care For The Elderly In Japan.	1998	109	10.1111/j.1547-5069.1998.tb01233.x	9549939		109	30	1	37	PURPOSE: To describe the first phase of creating a Japanese model of community-based long-term care, called around-the-clock care (ACC), by operationally defining the components of ACC, identifying those eligible for the program, clarifying methods of planning and organization, and exploring outcomes. DESIGN: Exploratory evaluation for the population of frail elderly Japanese citizens living at home. A convenience sample of 44 patients receiving care from four visiting-nurse-service stations during 3 months in 1994 was used. METHODS: Needs assessments; record reviews of patient encounters; evaluations by patients, families, and visiting nurses; and reviews of administrative data. FINDINGS: Nurses perceived that ACC stabilized medical status, reduced the emotional and physical burden of treatment, and improved hygiene. It also reduced family caregiving burdens and the stress of family caregivers' employment responsibilities. The highest rating of ACC by patient and families was for those with the most complex physical needs. Skilled nursing at home permitted early identification and treatment of problems before they became crises or required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Early findings suggest 24-hour nurse-home helper teamwork may be an effective system of community-based long-term care and should be considered a key element of future Japanese health policy.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	109	Image--The Journal Of Nursing Scholarship	1	109	murashima,s	Murashima	S
109	Do Gerontology Nurse Specialists Make A Difference In Hospitalization Of Long-Term Care Residents? Results Of A Randomized Comparison Trial.	2014	67	10.1111/jgs.13022	25283552		32	62	10	1962	Residents of long-term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program (RACIP) is a quality improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on-site support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology nurse specialists (GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of hospitalization 1 year before and after program implementation. The sample included 29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention group (rate ratio (RR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61-0.86, P < .001). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group (69% increase) (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56-0.82, P < .001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention and comparison groups (RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.68-1.46, P = .99). The integration of GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	32	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		67	boyd,michal	Boyd	Michal
110	'Failure To Maintain': A Theoretical Proposition For A New Quality Indicator Of Nurse Care Rationing For Complex Older People In Hospital.	2016	111	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2016.08.001	27658271		111	63		146	Complex older patients represent about half of all acute public hospital admissions in Australia. People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed. This paper offers a theoretical proposition of 'Failure to Maintain' as a conceptual framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of 'Failure to Maintain'. Hospital focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). 'Failure to Maintain' offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, this vulnerable population. Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide patient focussed care, and avoid 'Failing to Maintain'. The research field of acute geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	111	International Journal Of Nursing Studies	1	111	bail,kasia	Bail	Kasia
111	Investigating The Contribution Of Community Nurses To Anticipatory Care: A Qualitative Exploratory Study.	2011	112	10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05589.x	21332574		52	67	7	1558	AIMS: To investigate how one aspect of anticipatory care is understood and delivered in practice. 'Anticipatory care' in this context can be understood as proactive care, which is oriented towards prevention of adverse events. BACKGROUND: Scotland has identified the intention to move away from a preoccupation with acute care and invest in health improvement and anticipatory care. Community nurses are the key, yet little is known about how they understand and deliver anticipatory care. METHODS: A qualitative case study design using individual in-depth interviews (n=10), observation (n=9) and focus groups (n=5) was selected. Five focus group interviews were carried out with district nurses, practice nurses and health visitors. Subsequently, nine observation events took place, each focused on a single nurse/client encounter. Data were collected during 2008 and 2009 in one Community Health Partnership in Scotland. FINDINGS: Two approaches to anticipatory care emerged; these were influenced by participants' roles and responsibilities. Approach 1 derives from Government policy agenda and is focused on protocol-focused management of long-term illness. Approach 2 is synonymous with long-standing nursing activity focused on holistic care of individual patients. Both approaches are proactive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: There is scope to develop a more conceptually complex model of anticipatory care, building on this initial exploration, within which all aims, roles, practices and methods of evaluation can be located and clearly visible. This offers the potential to enable practitioners to interpret and apply policy--otherwise change may be limited and result in service gaps.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	112	kennedy,catriona	Kennedy	Catriona
112	Recruitment Of Frail Older People To Research: Lessons Learnt Through Experience.	2001	113	10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.02029.x	11737496		52	36	5	643	BACKGROUND: With the emphasis on the need for clinical governance and evidence-based practice in the healthcare industry there is increasing pressure on researchers to provide tangible research evidence of the effectiveness of new treatments, interventions and services. Recruiting an adequate size of sample is an important factor in the success or otherwise of a study to answer the research question. Difficulty in the recruitment of older people to research is widely acknowledged. However, much can be achieved to maximize the success of this process. AIMS OF THE PAPER: This paper describes and explores our experience of recruiting frail, older people to research, with particular emphasis on ensuring quality in the process of research related to ethical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of frail older people to research can be a complex process in which the awareness and integrity of the researcher is key in upholding the principle of nonexploitation. It is important not to underestimate this difficulty and to ensure that the data collection period is sufficient to recruit adequate numbers. There is a need to continue to develop and refine recruitment skills and strategies to maximize the involvement of frail older people to research while protecting their right to refuse.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	113	harris,r	Harris	R

114	Nurses' Experiences Of Caring For Non-Catheterised Older Infirmed Patients: A Descriptive Study Of What Nurses Actually Do?	2010	115	10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03026.x	20500348		34	19	9-10	1387	AIMS: This study aims to explore nurses' experiences of caring for non-catheterised older infirmed patients who had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infection and strategies adopted to prevent and manage the problem. BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection is a complex and significant infection affecting frail older patients. Most literature focuses on prescribing treatment to treat the micro-organisms causing the infection, with less emphasis to understand nursing perspectives of caring for frail and highly dependent older patients suffering from this condition. DESIGN: Qualitative. METHODS: A qualitative research methodology was conducted in a hospital-based infirmary unit (composing of four wards) in Hong Kong. Fourteen nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. RESULTS: When managing recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients, nurses described the need to promptly recognise the urinary tract infection symptoms and to know the causes of the symptoms before administering any care. These formed the basis for deciding whether the patient's urinary condition should be managed by nurses themselves or be referred to the physician for medical treatment. Based on this initial judgement, subsequent non-invasive measures perceived by nurses to be effective were undertaken to manage the non-medically intervened problem. Ways to improve nurses' existing roles and work practices to better manage recurrent urinary tract infection of non-catheterised older patients were also identified. CONCLUSION: Nurses working in infirmary wards refocused on the value of providing basic nursing care to manage this emergent and overlooked clinical problem. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Asymptomatic urinary tract infection cases should continue to receive 'basic urinary tract infection care' on a daily basis, as ignoring these symptoms could bring on adverse consequences. Prior knowledge and experiences acquired by nurses who cared for previously infected patients can assist in the development of interventions, so comparison of different nursing measures is possible to determine which one is the most effective in managing this clinical issue.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	115	ling man,elaine.siu	Ling Man	Elaine Siu
115	A Threat To Our Integrity--Meanings Of Providing Nursing Care For Older Patients With Cognitive Impairment In Acute Care Settings.	2016	117	10.1111/scs.12220	25919338		100	30	1	48	BACKGROUND: Older people with cognitive impairment represent a large group of patients in acute care settings. Research show that these acute care environments can be unsafe and even unfriendly for frail older patients. Research and clinical experience show that being a nurse in acute/specialised medical facilities means to work in a high-speed, technologically complex and demanding environment. When caring for older patients with cognitive impairment, nurses' workload and responsibilities have been shown to increase. This is largely dependent on how easily it is to connect with and help patients understand what to do, and what is best for them. AIM: This study aimed to illuminate meanings of caring for older patients with cognitive impairment in acute care settings as experienced by nursing staff. METHOD: A purposeful sample of thirteen nurses experienced in caring for older people with cognitive impairment in acute care settings participated in the study. Narrative interviews were conducted during autumn 2012 and interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. FINDINGS: Caring for older, acutely ill cognitively impaired patients was found to be very complex. The meanings of caring for these older patients seemed to change depending on the nurses' perceptions of the patients and the gap between what they could do (real) and wanted to do (ideal) in providing care for them. The greater this gap was felt to be and the more care was perceived as meaningless, the more serious was the threat to nurses' personal-professional integrity which could be at risk, compromised or harmed. CONCLUSION: The comprehensive understanding indicates that being a nurse and having to care for older patients in acute care settings means providing nursing care in an environment that does not support possibilities to protect and develop nurses' personal-professional integrity.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	100	Scandinavian Journal Of Caring Sciences	1	117	nilsson,anita	Nilsson	Anita
116	The Indispensable Intermediaries: A Qualitative Study Of Informal Caregivers' Struggle To Achieve Influence At And After Hospital Discharge.	2014	118	10.1186/1472-6963-14-331	25078610		25	14		331	"BACKGROUND: The care policy and organization of the care sector is shifting to accommodate projected demographic changes and to ensure a sustainable model of health care provision in the future. Adult children and spouses are often the first to assume care giving responsibilities for older adults when declining function results in increased care needs. By introducing policies tailored to enabling family members to combine gainful employment with providing care for older relatives, the sustainability of the future care for older individuals in Norway is more explicitly placed on the family and informal caregivers than previously. Care recipients and informal caregivers are expected to take an active consumer role and participate in the care decision-making process. This paper aims to describe the informal caregivers' experiences of influencing decision-making at and after hospital discharge for home-bound older relatives. METHODS: This paper reports findings from a follow-up study with an exploratory qualitative design. Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 19 informal caregivers of older individuals discharged from hospital in Norway. An inductive thematic content analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Informal caregivers take on comprehensive all-consuming roles as intermediaries between the care recipient and the health care services. In essence, the informal caregivers take the role of the active participant on behalf of their older relative. They describe extensive efforts struggling to establish dialogues with the ""gatekeepers"" of the health care services. Achieving the goal of the best possible care for the care recipient seem to depend on the informal caregivers having the resources to choose appropriate strategies for gaining influence over decisions. CONCLUSIONS: The care recipients' extensive frailty and increasing dependence on their families coupled with the complexity of health care services contribute to the perception of the informal caregivers' indispensable role as intermediaries. These findings accentuate the need to further discuss how frail older individuals and their informal caregivers can be supported and enabled to participate in decision-making regarding care arrangements that meet the care recipient's needs."		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	25	Bmc Health Services Research		118	bragstad,line.kildal	Bragstad	Line Kildal
117	Direct And Indirect Effects Of Nutritional Status, Physical Function And Cognitive Function On Activities Of Daily Living In Japanese Older Adults Requiring Long-Term Care.	2014	119	10.1111/ggi.12169	24215649		119	14	4	799	AIM: To identify the direct and indirect effects of nutritional status, physical function, and cognitive function on activities of daily living in Japanese older adults requiring long-term care. METHODS: In total, 179 participants aged ≥ 65 years who were eligible for long-term care insurance (mean age 85.5 ± 7.8 years) were recruited for this study. Nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment, Short Form) and physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery) were examined. Activities of daily living, cognitive function and frailty were assessed using the Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Frailty Scale, respectively. Path analysis was used to determine relationships between these factors and the activities of daily living. RESULTS: For Japanese older adults requiring long-term care, pathways were modeled for nutritional status, physical function and the activities of daily living. The total effect of nutritional status was 0.516 (P<0.001). The indirect effect of nutritional status through physical function on the activities of daily living was 0.458 (P<0.001). Finally, no significant direct effect of nutritional status on activities of daily living was observed (b=0.058, P=0.258). CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified the complex pathway from nutritional status to the activities of daily living through physical function in aged Japanese people requiring long-term care. These findings suggest that maintaining good nutritional status and nutritional support might delay physical function decline, and prolong the activities of daily living.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	119	Geriatrics & Gerontology International		119	kamo,tomohiko	Kamo	Tomohiko
118	Being Your Best: Protocol For A Feasibility Study Of A Codesigned Approach To Reduce Symptoms Of Frailty In People Aged 65 Years Or More After Transition From Hospital.	2021	120	10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043223	33674372		30	11	3	e043223	INTRODUCTION: The population is ageing, with increasing health and supportive care needs. For older people, complex chronic health conditions and frailty can lead to a cascade of repeated hospitalisations and further decline. Existing solutions are fragmented and not person centred. The proposed Being Your Best programme integrates care across hospital and community settings to address symptoms of frailty. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre pragmatic mixed methods study aiming to recruit 80 community-dwelling patients aged ≥65 years recently discharged from hospital. Being Your Best is a codesigned 6-month programme that provides referral and linkage with existing services comprising four modules to prevent or mitigate symptoms of physical, nutritional, cognitive and social frailty. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of recruitment, acceptability of the intervention to participants and level of retention in the programme. Changes in frailty (Modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), functional ability (Barthel and Lawton), loneliness (University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-3 items) and nutrition (Malnutrition Screening Tool) will also be measured at 6 and 12 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from Monash Health Human Research Ethics Committee (RES-19-0000904L). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference and seminar presentations.

119	Prevalence And Characteristics Of Nursing Homes Residents Requiring Light-Care.	2005	121	10.1002/nur.20079	15884022		92	28	3	210	Rising nursing home (NH) costs and the poor quality of NH care make it important to recognize elders for whom NH care may be inappropriate. As a first step in developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer services than NHs.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	3	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	92	Research In Nursing & Health	1	121	grando,victoria.t	Grando	Victoria T
120	Medication-Taking By The Frail Elderly In Two Ethnic Groups.	1991	122	10.1111/j.1744-6198.1991.tb00891.x	1792177		122	26	4	19	A complex and dangerous area of medical intervention with the elderly population is drug therapy. Although drugs have contributed to the well-being of many older persons, some elderly individuals are at risk due to polypharmacy and age-related factors. The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the medication-taking behaviors of two ethnic groups of noninstitutionalized frail elderly individuals. The findings indicate that these individuals may be at risk for harm due to their medication-taking practices. Healthcare professionals must evaluate drug use by the elderly and be aware of the risks of drug misuse by this vulnerable group.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	122	Nursing Forum	1	122	lile,j.l	Lile	J L
121	Minimal Effect On Energy Intake By Additional Evening Meal For Frail Elderly Service Flat Residents--A Pilot Study.	2008	123	10.1007/BF02982658	18443710		123	12	5	295	BACKGROUND: Nutritional problems are common in frail elderly individuals receiving municipal care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if an additional evening meal could improve total daily food intake, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in frail elderly service flat (SF) residents. DESIGN: Out of 122 residents in two SF complexes, 60 subjects agreed to participate, of which 49 subjects (median 84 (79-90) years, (25th-75th percentile)) completed the study. For six months 23 residents in one SF complex were served 530 kcal in addition to their regular meals, i.e. intervention group (I-group). Twenty-six residents in the other SF building were controls (C-group). Nutritional status, energy and nutrient intake, length of night time fast, cognitive function and HRQOL was assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: At the start, the Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 27% as malnourished and 63% as at risk for malnutrition, with no difference between the groups. After six months the median body weight was unchanged in the I-group, +0.6 (-1.7-+1.6) kg (p=0.72) and the C-group -0.6 (-2.0-+0.5) kg (p=0.15). Weight change ranged from -13% to +15%. The evening meal improved the protein and carbohydrate intake (p<0.01) but the energy intake increased by only 180 kcal/day (p=0.15). The night time fast decreased in the I-group from 15.0 (13.0-16.0) to 13.0 (12.0-14.0) hours (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in cognitive function or HRQOL between the groups. CONCLUSION: Nine out of ten frail elderly SF residents had nutritional problems. Serving an additional evening meal increased the protein and carbohydrate intake, but the meal had no significant effect on energy intake, body weight or HRQOL. The variation in outcome within each study group was large.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	123	The Journal Of Nutrition, Health & Aging		123	odlund olin,a	Odlund Olin	A
122	Impact Of Social Frailty On Relocation Of Older Adults.	2021	124	10.14283/jfa.2021.3	34105710		124	10	3	254	BACKGROUND: The relationship between frailty and variables such as housing are the least included in models of frailty and research on frailty or social frailty and relocation is negligible. The decision to relocate is complex and demanding for older adults with a loss of independence but little is known about what makes older adults relocate to congregated housing designated for older adults, let alone in combination with social frailty, and how they navigate this transition. OBJECTIVES: This mixed method descriptive study aims to understand the influence of social frailty for a population of French-speaking semi-independent older adults relocating to a housing continuum community. DESIGN: Semi-structured individual interviews including sociodemographic data and the PRISMA-7 Frailty Scale were conducted with recently relocated older adults. SETTING: A newly opened French-speaking housing continuum community in Eastern Canada that offers luxury apartments for independent older adults, two assisted living facilities for semi-independent older adults along with a long-term care facility. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine older adults with a mean age of 85 years, mostly female, married or widowed and highly educated. MEASUREMENTS: Content analysis of the transcribed recorded interviews and descriptive statistical analyses to examine relationships between the frailty PRISMA-7 scale, answers to additional questions and the sociodemographic data. RESULTS: There was not a significant difference in the scores for socialization before and after relocation nor between prior help and current help; however, there was a significant negative correlation between help and socialization before and after relocation. Three main themes included: imposed influences, push and pull factors and post relocation. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that several social factors contributed to relocation and that participants were experiencing social frailty. Participants were at the crossover point of being vulnerable to experiencing additional deficits which would potentially have led to higher frailty had they not relocated.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	124	The Journal Of Frailty & Aging		124	dupuis-blanchard,s	Dupuis-Blanchard	S
123	A Critique Of Research Measures Used To Assess Inappropriate Psychoactive Drug Use In Older Adults.	2002	125	10.1046/j.1532-5415.2002.50072.x	12028223		32	50	2	374	An overview and critique of research measures of inappropriate psychoactive drug use in the treatment of frail older adults is presented. These measures are compared on the basis of six key criteria for the complex determination of inappropriate psychoactive drug use as a research variable. These six instruments/standards are examined also for their advantages and disadvantages as research tools. Based on this review and related literature, recommendations are made that future studies of inappropriate psychoactive drug use include expert clinician assessment, measures of target symptoms and functional status, physiological indicators wherever possible, and drug and dosage classifications according to interdisciplinary consensus-based criteria.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	32	Journal Of The American Geriatrics Society		125	talerico,karen.amann	Talerico	Karen Amann
124	The Complexities Of Documenting Clinical Information In Long-Term Care Settings In Australia.	2002	126	10.3928/0098-9134-20020501-05	12035829		60	28	5	8	"Clinical nursing documentation, written, verbal or supported by technology, is being affected by both the worldwide ""information explosion"" and budgetary constraints. In Australia, the necessity of documenting complex care needs and treatment plans in older adult care settings has become more imperative because funding levels and sources are frequently tied to these documents. As a consequence, the statutory requirements for documentation have become a significant driving force in shaping nursing practice. Although the value of quality documentation is or should be recognized, the seemingly vast amounts of time required inevitably distracts nurses from what they see as their primary purpose-the provision of direct patient care. Older adults who are frail are among the most complex clients requiring services in what is traditionally a poorly resourced sector. Under-funding frequently impacts on the staff skill mix, resulting in low levels of senior, highly qualified, and skilled staff. These factors impact the quality of the documentation and possibly the usage of the information itself. This article will provide an overview of the issues related to documentation of clinical information in older adult care settings with particular reference to some of the ""unique"" inefficiencies inherent in the Australian system."		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	60	Journal Of Gerontological Nursing	1	126	pelletier,dianne	Pelletier	Dianne
125	Transitional Care From Skilled Nursing Facilities To Home: Study Protocol For A Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial.	2021	127	10.1186/s13063-021-05068-0	33546737		59	22	1	120	BACKGROUND: Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. METHODS: The study will test the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden and distress. DISCUSSION: Study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03810534 .

126	Integrated Care For Older Adults During The Covid-19 Pandemic In Belgium: Lessons Learned The Hard Way.	2021	128	10.1111/opn.12366	33570259		33	16	3	e12366	The corona pandemic challenges countries worldwide in many different ways. Due to its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	128	deschacht,martha	Deschacht	Martha

129	Development Of A Proactive Care Program (U-Care) To Preserve Physical Functioning Of Frail Older People In Primary Care.	2013	80	10.1111/jnu.12023	23530956		131	45	3	230	PURPOSE: Care for older patients in primary care is currently reactive, fragmented, and time consuming. An innovative structured and proactive primary care program (U-CARE) has been developed to preserve physical functioning and enhance quality of life of frail older people. This study describes in detail the development process of the U-CARE program to allow its replication. METHODS: The framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used as a theoretical guide for the design of the U-CARE program. An extended stepwise multimethod procedure was used to develop U-CARE. A team of researchers, general practitioners, registered practice nurses, experts, and an independent panel of older persons was involved in the development process to increase its feasibility in clinical practice. A systematic review of the literature and of relevant guidelines, combined with clinical practice experience and expert opinion, was used for the development of the intervention. FINDINGS: Based on predefined potentially effective guiding components, the U-CARE program comprises three steps: a frailty assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment at home followed by a tailor-made care plan, and multiple follow-up visits. Evidence-based care plans were developed for 11 geriatric conditions. The feasibility in clinical practice was tested and approved by experienced registered practice nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Using the MRC Framework, a detailed description of the development process of the innovative U-CARE program is provided, which is often missing in reports of complex intervention trials. Based on our feasibility-pilot study, the general practitioners and the registered practice nurses indicated that the U-CARE intervention is feasible in clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCES: The U-CARE program consists of promising components and has the potential to improve the care of older patients.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	4	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	131	Journal Of Nursing Scholarship: An Official Publication Of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society Of Nursing	1	80	bleijenberg,nienke	Bleijenberg	Nienke
130	An Investigation Of The Components Of Best Nursing Practice In The Care Of Acutely Ill Hospitalized Older Patients With Coincidental Dementia: A Multi-Method Design.	1999	132	10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01194.x	10564412		52	30	5	1127	The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level. The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method research.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	132	tolson,d	Tolson	D
131	Discharge Of Frail Older People From Acute Hospitals Across Europe.	2002	133	10.12968/bjon.2002.11.2.9311	11823738		133	11	2	111	Over the last few years the number of elderly patients in acute hospitals throughout Europe has risen dramatically. The pressure on hospital beds leads to earlier discharge and the task of sending patients home from hospitals is becoming more complex. The provision of health and social services is organized in different ways all over Europe. Therefore, it would be of interest to know more about how different kinds of systems support the professional carers in their effort to satisfy the needs which older people and their significant others experience in the discharge process. A pilot study was set up mainly to provide information on what kinds of problems are inherent in a multicentre, interprofessional research project involving a large number of countries. The findings serve as an important knowledge base in a future project. Experiences from the pilot study and the benefits of it are presented.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	133	British Journal Of Nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)	1	133	bendz,m	Bendz	M

It is designed to support holistic care planning and to transfer patient data across settings. Its usefulness in clinical decision making depends on the extent to which clinicians can rely on the patient data as accurate and meaningful indicators of patients functioning. But its multidimensional character implies challenges for clinimetric testing as some of the traditional analyses techniques cannot be unconditionally applied. The objective was to present an overview of methods to examine the reliability of the interRAI Acute Care. For each line of evidence, examples of hypotheses and research questions are listed.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	2	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	134	Journal Of Evaluation In Clinical Practice		134	wellens,nathalie.i.h	Wellens	Nathalie I H
133	Age-Related Hearing Loss In The Dependent Elderly Population: A Model For Nursing Care.	1997	132	10.1111/j.1440-172x.1997.tb00106.x	9611533		135	3	4	224	Advancing nursing care through the implementation of evidence-based practice is a legitimate professional ideal. In reality there are many complex issues that need be addressed before such a goal can be achieved. This paper takes an intermediate step towards the realization of this aim in one aspect of continuing care nursing through the presentation of a procedural model. The presented model is designed to stimulate debate as to what could be, and arguably should be the role of the nurse in relation to meeting the auditory rehabilitative needs of dependent elderly patients. The model is based upon a published management model which outlines the auditory rehabilitative process within a psychosocial framework. The original model has been modified as a result of knowledge synthesis from a range of specialist disciplines including nursing. The Audiological Care Model for Nursing is intended to offer an accessible guide to this often neglected aspect of care.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	135	International Journal Of Nursing Practice	1	132	tolson,d	Tolson	D

The challenge of meeting this aspiration is even greater today amid resource constraints and the imperative of transferring more complex care out of hospitals and into primary care and community settings. The quality of care delivered to older people in particular has attracted much negative comment (Ombudsman, 2011), with the values of care and compassion appearing to have evaporated in some services.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	38	British Journal Of Community Nursing	1	136	while,alison	While	Alison
135	Medication Administration Hassles Reported By Family Caregivers Of Dependent Elderly Persons.	2000	137	10.1093/gerona/55.7.m412	10898259		137	55	7	M412	BACKGROUND: Even under the new long-term care mantra for increased home- and community-based care options, attention to and an understanding of the ways that family caregivers are managing complex care for dependent elderly persons, for example, with medication administration, have been slow to materialize. METHODS: Twenty-three family caregivers completed semistructured, face-to-face interviews to capture the shared and idiosyncratic experiences of individuals responsible for all aspects of medication administration regimens for elderly, dependent family members. Data analysis consisted of content analysis of the verbatim interview transcripts. This article reports an emerging typology of caregiver medication administration hassles derived from the interviews. RESULTS: Based on 122 separate accounts, three categories of medication administration hassles were identified. The categories (with the percentage of all accounts represented by the category) include (i) scheduling logistics (29.5%), (ii) administration procedures (31.9%), and (iii) safety issues (38.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers must continually reevaluate and simplify medication regimens for dependent elderly persons in the care of family members, and the family caregivers must be given adequate training and access to ongoing information support systems to help them perform safe and effective medication administration responsibilities.		2021-07-02 01:27:52	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexorcomplexity-allaging-_2021.06.24.txt	1	137	The Journals Of Gerontology.

137	Emergency Department Staff Priorities For Improving Palliative Care Provision For Older People: A Qualitative Study	2018	139	 10.1177/0269216317705789			139	32	2	417.0	Background: Emergency department–based palliative care services are increasing, but research to develop these services rarely includes input from emergency clinicians, jeopardizing the effectiveness of subsequent palliative care interventions. Aim: To collaboratively identify with emergency clinicians’ improvement priorities for emergency department–based palliative care for older people. Design: This was one component of an experience-based co-design project, conducted using semi-structured interviews and feedback sessions. Setting/participants: In-depth interviews with 15 emergency clinicians (nurses and doctors) at a large teaching hospital emergency department in the United Kingdom exploring experiences of palliative care delivery for older people. A thematic analysis identified core challenges that were presented to 64 clinicians over five feedback sessions, validating interview findings, and identifying shared priorities for improving palliative care delivery. Results: Eight challenges emerged: patient age; access to information; communication with patients, family members, and clinicians; understanding of palliative care; role uncertainty; complex systems and processes; time constraints; and limited training and education. Through feedback sessions, clinicians selected four challenges as improvement priorities: time constraints; communication and information; systems and processes; and understanding of palliative care. As resulting improvement plans evolved, “training and education” replaced “time constraints” as a priority. Conclusion: Clinician priorities for improving emergency department–based palliative care were identified through collaborative, iterative processes. Though generally aware of older palliative patients’ needs, clinicians struggled to provide high-quality care due to a range of complex factors. Further research should identify whether priorities are shared across other emergency departments, and develop, implement, and evaluate strategies developed by clinicians.

138	Older Women, Intimate Partner Violence And Mental Health: A Consideration Of The Particular Issues For Health And Healthcare Practice	2017	140	 10.1111/jocn.13490			140	26	15-16	2177.0	Aims and objectives: To explore qualitative evidence in older women with a history of intimate partner violence and their accounts and experiences of mental health. Background: Intimate partner violence significantly impacts the health and well‐being of women who experience it. However, women who experience intimate partner violence do not form a homogenous group and the effect on older women has not been adequately distinguished. While there is a growing body of evidence to address this deficit, studies to date have tended to concentrate on older women's experiences of intimate partner violence in totality and as such mental health issues have been subsumed as a part of the whole. Design: Meta‐ethnographic synthesis of qualitative evidence. Methods: A systematic search of PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, COCHRANE, Medline and PsycInfo, Sci was completed. The search included articles published up until the end of December 2015. Results: The review identified that intimate partner violence exerts a significant impact on the mental health of older women. Intimate partner violence for women in later life is inherently complex, especially where the boundaries of violence and vulnerability have been blurred historically both within the intimate partner violence discourse and through provision and practice. Conclusions: This study adds to the developing knowledge and understanding of intimate partner violence for older women as a part of the growing body of evidence of the impact of intimate partner violence on the health and well‐being of those who experience abuse more generally. When age and gender intersect with intimate partner violence, there are specific implications and health professionals and service providers need to be aware of these. Relevance to clinical practice: urses and healthcare professionals are professionally accountable for the effective management and support of women who have experienced abuse. It is therefore crucial that they are able to understand and identify the possible complexity of presentations of abuse and this includes older women.

139	‘Failure To Maintain’: A Theoretical Proposition For A New Quality Indicator Of Nurse Care Rationing For Complex Older People In Hospital	2016	141	 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2016.08.001			141	63		146.0	Complex older patients represent about half of all acute public hospital admissions in Australia. People with dementia are a classic example of complex older patients, and have been identified to have higher rates of hospital-acquired complications. Complications contribute to poorer patient outcomes, and increase length of stay and cost to hospitals. The care for older people with dementia is complex, and this has been attributed to: their cognitive response to being hospitalised; their limited ability to self-care; and lack of nursing engagement with the family caregiver. Registered nurses can offer simultaneous assessment and intervention to prevent or mitigate hospital-acquired complications. However, it is known that when demand for nursing care exceeds supply, care is prioritised according to acute medical need. Consequently some basic but essential nursing care activities such as patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition are implicitly rationed. This paper offers a theoretical proposition of ‘Failure to Maintain’ as a conceptual framework to indicate implicit care rationing by nurses. Care rationing contributes to functional and cognitive decline of complex older patients, which then contributes to higher rates of hospital acquired complications. Four key hospital acquired complications: pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and delirium are proposed as measurable indicators of ‘Failure to Maintain’. Hospital focus on throughput constrains nurses to privilege predictable, solvable and medically-related procedures and processes that will lead to efficient discharge over patient mobility, communication, skin care, hydration and nutrition. This privileging, also known as implicit rationing, is theoretically and physiologically associated with a rise in the incidence of complications such as pressure injuries, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and delirium. Complex older patients, including those with dementia, are at higher risk of the complications, therefore should have higher delivery of prophylactic intervention (ie have higher care needs). ‘Failure to Maintain’ offers a conceptual framework that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, this vulnerable population. Implicit rationing is occurring and it likely contributes to functional and cognitive decline in complex older patients and hospital-acquired complications. However, the lack of patient functional ability data at admission and discharge for hospitalised patients, and lack of usable ward and hospital level nurse staffing and workload data makes it difficult to monitor, understand and improve quality of care. Current research in the fields of acute geriatrics and nursing work environments show promise through enabling multidisciplinary team communication, and facilitating clinical autonomy to provide patient focussed care, and avoid ‘Failing to Maintain’. The research field of acute geriatrics can understand and act on the risk modification role of nurses, including controlling for nurse staffing and work environment variables in intervention studies. The research field of nurse sensitive outcomes should incorporate the different profile of complex older patients, by including age brackets and functional ability as variables in their studies. Clinically, nursing work environments can be designed to recognise the different profile of complex older patients by adapting practices to privilege mobility, hydration, nutrition, skin care and communication in the midst of acute care interventions.

140	Framing Moving And Handling As A Complex Healthcare Intervention Within The Acute Care Of Older People With Osteoporosis: A Qualitative Study	2016	142	 10.1111/jocn.13344			140	25	19-20	2906.0	Aims and objectives: To investigate healthcare staff's views and experiences of caring for older hospitalised adults (aged 60+) with osteoporosis focusing on moving and handling. Specific objectives were to explore the composition of manual handling risk assessments and interventions in osteoporosis. Background: Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease that reduces bone density and causes increased fracture risk. Incidence rises with age and osteoporotic fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major global health problem. In the UK older hospitalised adults are normally screened for falls risk but not necessarily for osteoporosis. As presentation of osteoporosis is normally silent until fractures are evident, it is frequently undiagnosed. Healthcare staff's knowledge of osteoporosis is often suboptimal and specific manual handling implications are under‐researched. Design: An exploratory qualitative content analysis research design informed by critical realism. Methods: The purposive sample comprised 26 nursing and allied health professionals. Semi‐structured interviews addressed topics including knowledge of osteoporosis, implications for acute care, moving and handling and clinical guidelines. Qualitative content data analysis was used. Results: Awareness of osteoporosis prevalence in older populations varies and implications for nursing are indistinct to nonspecialists. In‐hospital fractures potentially linked to suboptimal moving and handling seemed rare, but prospective studies are needed. Categories of ‘Understanding moving and handling as routine care or as a healthcare intervention’, with further categories ‘healthcare practitioners’ capacities and capabilities for dealing with people with osteoporosis’ and ‘the structural and organisational context for moving and handling’ are reported alongside safety, frailty and dependency dimensions. Conclusions: This study informs moving and handling in higher risk groups such as osteoporosis. Clinical knowledge/expertise is required when adapting generic manual handling guidelines to specific patients/contexts. Patients’ experiences of moving and handling have received limited attention. Relevance to clinical practice: Increased focus on musculoskeletal conditions and moving and handling implications is required.

141	Ageism And Age Discrimination In Health Care: Fact Or Fiction? A Narrative Review Of The Literature	2015	143	 10.1016/j.maturitas.2015.05.002			143	81	4	432.0	Ageism and age discrimination are terms used in best practice statements and in the literature to define negative attitudes towards older people and towards people because of their age (whether old or young). However, ‘old age’ is a nebulous concept with definitions ranging from the over 50s to the over 85s. In seeking to explore ageism and age discrimination within health care, this paper discusses the concept of ‘old’ and discusses the findings of a narrative review of the literature on these two concepts. Results show that negative attitudes have been perceived by users of health care services, but the reasons are not clear. Such attitudes are usually reported in acute health care settings, where targets and quick turnover are encouraged. Thus people, usually those with complex needs, who require longer periods of recuperation and rehabilitation following an episode of ill health, are troublesome to staff working in a system geared up for early discharges. This type of service user is usually over the age of 85. Recommendations from this paper include the need for acute frailty units, with well trained staff, where frail older people can be comprehensively assessed, receive timely and targeted care, followed by a supported discharge.

142	Do Gerontology Nurse Specialists Make A Difference In Hospitalization Of Long‐Term Care Residents? Results Of A Randomized Comparison Trial	2014	144	 10.1111/jgs.13022			144	62	10	1962.0	Residents of long‐term care facilities have highly complex care needs and quality of care is of international concern. Maintaining resident wellness through proactive assessment and early intervention is key to decreasing the need for acute hospitalization. The Residential Aged Care Integration Program (RACIP) is a quality improvement intervention to support residential aged care staff and includes on‐site support, education, clinical coaching, and care coordination provided by gerontology nurse specialists (GNSs) employed by a large district health board. The effect of the outreach program was evaluated through a randomized comparison of hospitalization 1 year before and after program implementation. The sample included 29 intervention facilities (1,425 residents) and 25 comparison facilities (1,128 residents) receiving usual care. Acute hospitalization rate unexpectedly increased for both groups after program implementation, although the rate of increase was significantly less for the intervention facilities. The hospitalization rate after the intervention increased 59% for the comparison group and 16% for the intervention group (rate ratio (RR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61–0.86, P &lt; .001). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower rate change for those admitted for medical reasons for the intervention group (13% increase) than the comparison group (69% increase) (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56–0.82, P &lt; .001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the RR for surgical admissions between the intervention and comparison groups (RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.68–1.46, P = .99). The integration of GNS expertise through the RACIP intervention may be one approach to support staff to provide optimal care and potentially improve resident health.

Therefore, it is important to identify frail individuals. Theoretical Framework: The Vulnerability/Risk/ Human Response/Care Model. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a measure to identify frail older adults. Methods: Instrument development encompassed the following: delineation of content domains, item generation, content validity, quantitative content validity analysis, and psychometric analysis. Results: Findings indicated die following: (a) Frailty is a complex concept, (b) the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE) is composed of 10 items, (c) FIFE was able to predict depression, and (d) FIFE was able to differentiate differences in demographic profiles by social support environment. Conclusions: FIFE is a valid instrument. FIFE can be used to study the relationships among frailty determinants, provide standardized measurement, and develop and measure interventional studies.

144	Older Adults' Satisfaction With A Medication Dispensing Device In Home Care	2013	146	 10.3109/17538157.2012.741084			146	38	3	211.0	Introduction: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions face the complex task of medication management involving multiple medications of varying doses at different times. Advances in telehealth technologies have resulted in home-based devices for medication management and health monitoring of older adults. We examined older adults’ perceptions of a telehealth medication dispensing device as part of a clinical trial involving home healthcare clients, nurse coordination and use of the medication dispensing device. Methods: Ninety-six frail older adult participants who used the medication dispensing device for 12 months completed a satisfaction survey related to perceived usefulness and reliability. Results were analyzed and grouped by themes in the following areas: Ease of Use, Reliability, Medication Management Assistance, Routine Task Performance and Acceptability . Results: Nearly all participants perceived the medication dispensing device as very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in the management of their medications. Eighty-four percent of participants expressed a desire to use the machine in the future. Conclusion: The technology-enhanced medication management device in this study is an acceptable tool for older adults to manage medication in collaboration with home care nurses. Improved usability and cost models for medication dispensers are areas for future research.

145	Nurse Care Coordination And Technology Effects On Health Status Of Frail Older Adults Via Enhanced Self-Management Of Medication: Randomized Clinical Trial To Test Efficacy	2013	147	 10.1097/NNR.0b013e318298aa55			12	62	4	269.0	Background: Self-management of complex medication regimens for chronic illness is challenging for many older adults. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health status outcomes of frail older adults receiving a home-based support program that emphasized self-management of medications using both care coordination and technology. Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal outcome measurement. Setting: Older adults having difficulty in self-managing medications ( n = 414) were recruited at discharge from three Medicare-certified home healthcare agencies in a Midwestern urban area. Methods: All participants received baseline pharmacy screens. The control group received no further intervention. A team of advanced practice nurses and registered nurses coordinated care for 12 months to two intervention groups who also received either an MD.2 medication-dispensing machine or a medplanner. Health status outcomes (the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental Status Examination, Physical Performance Test, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: After covariate and baseline health status adjustment, time x group interactions for the MD.2 and medplanner groups on health status outcomes were not significant. Time x group interactions were significant for the medplanner and control group comparisons. Discussion: Participants with care coordination had significantly better health status outcomes over time than those in the control group, but addition of the MD.2 machine to nurse care coordination did not result in better health status outcomes.

Failure to recognize the geriatric giants in frail older adults is resulting in the misclassification of this population. This study investigated “sub-acute” frail, older-adult in-patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Although identified as being no longer acutely ill, all participants ( n = 62) required active medical and/or nursing care. Frail older patients, often acutely ill, were being misclassified as sub-acute when the acuity of their illness went unrecognized which resulted in equally unrecognized disease presentations. The majority of participants wished to be cared for at or closer to home. The lack of post-acute-care service within our health care system and risk aversion on the part of hospital staff resulted in lengthy hospital stays and/or in patients being funneled into existing services (nursing homes) against their desire to go home.

147	The Association Between Geriatric Syndromes And Survival	2012	149	 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.03942.x			144	60	5	896.0	Objectives: To ascertain the effect on survival of eight common geriatric syndromes (multiple comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, sarcopenia, malnutrition, homeostenosis, and chronic inflammation), identified by an expert panel of academic geriatricians. Design: A systematic literature review sought studies from a variety of sources to compare survival and life expectancy of individuals with geriatric syndromes with those of the general population. Setting: Studies used reflected the general population. Participants: Community‐dwelling persons aged 65 and older. Measurements: Eight geriatric syndromes (multiple definitions) and survival. Results: Two thousand three hundred seventy‐four publications were retrieved, and 509 publications of 123 studies were included. Seven geriatric syndromes (multiple comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, malnutrition, impaired homeostasis, and chronic inflammation) were associated with poor survival. In each case, the prevalence of a syndrome was negatively associated with mortality. Malnutrition and impaired homeostasis exerted twice the influence of factors such as multiple comorbidities and frailty. From age 65 to 74, only those who are very ill or frail (e.g., impaired homeostasis, low body mass index, or advanced dementia) have a higher risk of mortality than average older adults. In the old‐old, particularly aged 90 and older, the added value of predicting survival beyond 1 year is minimal. Conclusion: Geriatric syndrome information is helpful to understanding survival for younger old persons but provides little information about survival for the very old. Complex survival models add comparatively little benefit to more simply measured and calculated models.

We evaluated 56 intervention groups derived using four data management approaches with a data set of 165,700 interventions from 14 home care agencies to determine which approaches and interventions predicted hospitalizations among frail ( n = 386) and non-frail ( n = 1,364) elders. Hospitalization predictors differed for frail and non-frail elders. Low frequencies in some intervention groups were positively associated with hospitalization outcomes, suggesting that there may be a mismatch between the level of core that is needed and the level of care that is provided.

149	Carers And Nurses Appraisals Of Needs Of Nursing Home Placement For Frail Older In Norway	2009	151	 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02663.x			140	18	22	3079.0	Aims and objectives: The aim of this paper was to explore carers’ and nurses’ appraisals concerning if and when nursing home placement for frail older people awaiting placement was needed and to illuminate ethical issues involved in decisions regarding nursing home placement. Background: Requesting nursing home placement can be a complicated decision for carers, causing feelings of failure, anxiety and guilt. After the necessity of nursing home care is determined, the names of the older people are put on waiting lists. While waiting, home health care provides support services. Even with this care, many of the older people and their carers face difficult life situations. Design: This is a descriptive and comparative cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. Methods: The convenience sample ( n = 36) comprised 11 carers of older people on a nursing home placement waiting list in Norway and 11 nurses caring for these older people. Every one willingly participated in interviews that were transcribed and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results: Various similarities and differences between nurses’ and carers’ appraisals were found. Complex ethical issues of justice, equality, autonomy, beneficence and justifiability in nursing were involved in decision making concerning nursing home placement. Four categories constructed were: ‘appraising nursing home to be the level of care needed’, ‘appraising the older people as able to continue living at home’, ‘being ambivalent about nursing home placement’ and ‘being sceptical about use of coercion regarding nursing home placement’. Conclusions: Not all of the older people awaiting nursing home placements could be placed in nursing homes when beds became available. The situations were complex and involved ethical issues. Relevance to clinical practice: Despite insufficient resources in home health care, providing appropriate support for older people and their carers means that nurses have to consider individual concerns in each situation, cooperate with carers, respect their appraisals of needs and argue for the timely nursing home placement of older people.

150	Promoting Urinary Continence With Older People: A Selective Literature Review	2009	152	 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2008.00158.x			152	4	1	58.0	As the population of older people increases so does the prevalence of urinary incontinence experienced. Despite its complex aetiology most of the contributing factors are reversible, when accurate assessment leads to the development of a person-centred continence care plan. This selective literature review highlights that a change in perspective among older people and healthcare professionals will enable a focus on bladder rehabilitation and proactive approaches to managing urinary incontinence, even in the very frail population. The need to design tools to facilitate such developments is discussed together with the need for greater focus on educational support that considers the wider context and the multiple factors that influence practice.

151	Prevalence And Characteristics Of Nursing Homes Residents Requiring Light-Care	2005	153	 10.1002/nur.20079			150	28	3	210.0	Rising nursing home (NH) costs and the poor quality of NH care make it important to recognize elders for whom NH care may be inappropriate. As a first step in developing a method to identify these elders, we examined the characteristics of NH residents requiring light-care and changes in their care level from NH admission to 12-months. Using data from the Missouri Minimal Data Set electronic database, we developed three care-level categories based on Resource Use Groups, Version III (RUG-III) and defined light-care NH residents as those requiring minimal assistance with late-loss ADLs (bed mobility, transfer, toilet use, or eating) and having no complex clinical problems. Approximately 16% of Missouri NH residents met the criteria for light-care. They had few functional problems with mobility, personal care, communication, or incontinence; approximately 33% had difficulty maintaining balance without assistance; and 50% of those admitted as light-care were still light-care at 12-months. Findings suggest that many NH residents classified as light-care by these criteria could be cared for in community settings offering fewer services than NHs.

152	A Critique Of Research Measures Used To Assess Inappropriate Psychoactive Drug Use In Older Adults	2002	154	 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2002.50072.x			144	50	2	374.0	Presents an overview and critique of research measures of inappropriate psychoactive drug use in the treatment of frail older adults. These measures were compared on the basis of 6 key criteria for the complex determination of inappropriate psychoactive drug use as a research variable. The criteria include (1) the presence of a suitable indication for drug therapy, (2) the effectiveness of the drug for the identified indication, (3) attention to dosage adjustments on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes in older adults, (4) appropriate duration of treatment, (5) unnecessary duplication, and (6) the risk of adverse consequences for older adults. These 6 instruments/standards were examined also for their advantages and disadvantages as research tools. Based on this review and related literature, recommendations are made that future studies of inappropriate psychoactive drug use include expert clinician assessment, measures of target symptoms and functional status, physiological indicators wherever possible, and drug and dosage classifications according to interdisciplinary consensus-based criteria.

153	Hdr Brachytherapy With Individual Epithetic Molds For Facial Skin Cancer: Techniques And First Clinical Experience.	2021	155	10.1111/ijd.15492			155	60	6	717	Background: Facial skin cancer lesions in close proximity to critical organs require further development of radiotherapeutic techniques for highly conformal treatment, especially when treating elderly frail patients. We report on our treatment technique and first clinical experience for patients with perinasal/periorbital skin cancer treated with individualized epithetic mold high‐dose‐rate brachytherapy (BRT). Methods: From January 2019, patients with complex shaped or unfavorably located skin cancer not eligible for surgery or external beam radiotherapy (RT) were screened for mold‐based BRT. Six patients were identified. Toxicity and clinical response were documented during therapy and posttreatment follow‐up. Results: Median patient age was 80 years (74–92 years). Median prescription dose was 42 Gy (range, 33–44 Gy) delivered in once‐daily fractions of 3 or 4 Gy. Two patients had treatment interruptions caused by acute conjunctivitis grade 2 and a nontreatment‐related cardiac event, respectively. At a median follow‐up of 335 days (96–628 days), no ≥ grade 2 late toxicity was documented with all patients showing complete clinical response. Conclusions: High‐dose‐rate BRT with individualized epithetic molds for perinasal/periorbital skin cancer is a well‐tolerated and safe treatment option for patients not eligible for primary surgery or definitive external beam RT because of comorbidities or tumor location.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=150186521&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	155	International Journal of Dermatology		155	diefenhardt,markus	diefenhardt	markus
154	Community Health Worker Interventions For Older Adults With Complex Health Needs: A Systematic Review.	2021	156	10.1111/jgs.17078			144	69	6	1670	Background/Objectives: The number of older adults with complex health needs is growing, and this population experiences disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Interventions led by community health workers (CHWs) can improve clinical outcomes in the general adult population with multimorbidity, but few studies have investigated CHW‐delivered interventions in older adults. Design: We systematically reviewed the impact of CHW interventions on health outcomes among older adults with complex health needs. We searched for English‐language articles from database inception through April 2020 using seven databases. PROSPERO protocol registration CRD42019118761. Setting: Any U.S. or international setting, including clinical and community‐based settings. Participants: Adults aged 60 years or older with complex health needs, defined in this review as multimorbidity, frailty, disability, or high‐utilization. Interventions: Interventions led by a CHW or similar role consistent with the American Public Health Association's definition of CHWs. Measurements: Pre‐defined health outcomes (chronic disease measures, general health measures, treatment adherence, quality of life, or functional measures) as well as qualitative findings. Results: Of 5671 unique records, nine studies met eligibility criteria, including four randomized controlled trials, three quasi‐experimental studies, and two qualitative studies. Target population and intervention characteristics were variable, and studies were generally of low‐to‐moderate methodological quality. Outcomes included mood, functional status and disability, social support, well‐being and quality of life, medication knowledge, and certain health conditions (e.g., falls, cognition). Results were mixed with several studies demonstrating significant effects on mood and function, including one high‐quality RCT, while others noted no significant intervention effects on outcomes. Conclusion: CHW‐led interventions may have benefit for older adults with complex health needs, but additional high‐quality studies are needed to definitively determine the effectiveness of CHW interventions in this population. Integration of CHWs into geriatric clinical settings may be a strategy to deliver evidence‐based interventions and improve clinical outcomes in complex older adults.

156	Exploring Elderly Patients' Experiences Of Recovery Following Complex Proximal Humerus Fracture: A Qualitative Study.	2021	158	10.1177/1359105319850883			158	26	6	880	This study explores the experiences and perceptions of recovery in elderly patients who had sustained a proximal humerus fracture. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 patients over the age of 65. Thematic analysis identified aspects of care that impacted upon patient experience and quality of life. Seven main patient-reported themes were identified, including pain, sleep, shoulder function, emotional state, social support, relationship with their professional and experience of healthcare institution. These themes offer insight into the experiences of adults receiving care for proximal humerus fracture and highlight that existing quantitative measures of quality of life do not measure domains that are important to patients.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=150066071&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	158	Journal of Health Psychology		158	sabharwal,sanjeeve	sabharwal	sanjeeve

Dear Editor, Psoriasis management in the rapidly expanding geriatric population can be complex owing to frailty, comorbidities, comedication and limited available data on treating older patients with psoriasis.1 Previous studies reported comparable disease severity in patients aged >= 65 years and patients aged < 65 years,2-4 although prescribed antipsoriatic therapies differed between age groups.2,3,5 This might be due to comorbidities and comedication, and/or disease perception or patient preferences.3,5 Unfortunately, little is known regarding these topics in older patients with psoriasis.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=149731295&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	159	British Journal of Dermatology		159	winden,mec	winden	mec
158	Transcending Human Frailties With Technological Enhancements And Replacements: Transhumanist Perspective In Nursing And Healthcare.	2021	160	10.1111/nin.12391			160	28	2	1	As human beings age, they become weak, fragile, and feeble. It is a slowly progressing yet complex syndrome in which old age or some disabilities are not prerequisites; neither does loss of human parts lead to frailty among the physically fit older persons. This paper aims to describe the influences of transhumanist perspectives on human‐technology enhancements and replacements in the transcendence of human frailties, including those of older persons, in which technology is projected to deliver solutions toward transcending these frailties. Through technologies including genetic screening and other technological manipulations, intelligent machines and augmented humans improve, maintain, and remedy human‐linked susceptibilities. Furthermore, other technologies replace parts fabricated through inorganic‐mechanical processes such as 3D‐printing. Advancing technologies are reaching the summit of technological sophistication contributing to the transhumanist views of being human in a technological world. Technologies enhance the transcendence of human frailties as essential expressions of the symbiosis between human beings and technology in a transcendental world.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=149937373&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	160	Nursing Inquiry	1	160	locsin,rozzano.c	locsin	rozzano.c
159	Frailty, Doesn’T That Mean Birdlike? Research Into Attitudes And Understanding Of Frailty In Undergraduate And Postgraduate Trainees.	2021	161	10.1093/ageing/afab030.124			161	50		i1	Introduction: Frailty is an increasingly recognised concept, with 25–50% of over 85’s estimated to be frail1,. Previous research considered medical students’ attitudes towards older people2, yet despite the correlation between frailty and increased age3, little is known about attitudes of healthcare professionals towards frailty. We researched attitudes towards, and understanding of, frailty in undergraduate and postgraduate trainees, with a view to guiding future educational interventions. Method: Approval was granted by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHCT) Research and Development department, Newcastle University’s Research Management Group and the HRA. 3 cohorts were recruited; 3rd year Newcastle University MBBS Students, 5th year Newcastle University MBBS Students and Foundation Year 2 and Core Medical Trainees working for NHCT (junior doctors). Data was collected during scheduled teaching at NHCT and individuals were invited to participate via email prior to this. Those not participating were still required to attend the teaching. Participants provided written consent. Within each cohort, small group discussions around frailty and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) were prompted using open questions (e.g. “what does frailty mean to you?”), during which participants anonymously submitted phrases to an online word-cloud generator. Discussions were audio recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions and word-clouds were analysed using Simple Content Analysis. The overarching themes within each cohort were identified and compared with other cohorts. Interpretations were reviewed by an independent researcher to enhance rigour. Results: Each cohort associated frailty with older age and weakness, and often used it as a byword for complexity. Frailty was described as an abstract construct composed of personal experiences rather than an objectively defined descriptor. All associated it with negative emotions. Cohorts differed in their approach, with 3rd year students primarily focussed on defining frailty, whereas junior doctors prioritised the clinical challenges it presented. Junior doctors demonstrated limited understanding of CGA whilst undergraduate students were almost universally ignorant of it. Conclusions: The lack of understanding around frailty and CGA is concerning given its high prevalence.The identification of negative emotions increases this concern. To challenge this, focussed educational interventions addressing understanding and attitudes ought to be developed for tomorrow’s doctors.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=149478846&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		161	hartley,s	hartley	s
160	Pre‐Operative Frailty Is Predictive Of Adverse Post‐Operative Outcomes In Colorectal Cancer Patients.	2021	162	10.1111/ans.16319			162	91	3	379	Background: An increasing number of elderly patients are presenting for elective surgery. Pre‐operative risk assessment in this population is inexact due to the complex interplay between age, comorbidity and functional status. Frailty assessment may provide a surrogate measure of a patient's physiological reserve and aid operative decision‐making. The aim of this study is to determine the association between pre‐operative frailty, as assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale, and post‐operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. Methods: A prospective analysis of 86 patients over the age of 65 undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery at a tertiary centre between October 2017 and October 2018 was performed. Frailty assessment was conducted pre‐operatively using the Edmonton Frail Scale. Primary outcomes included length of stay and post‐operative complication rates. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the influence of frailty on post‐operative outcomes including mortality, prolonged hospital admission, complication rates and quality of life. Results: Of 86 patients, 12 (14.0%) were identified as frail. Frailty was associated with a significantly increased median length of stay (20 days versus 6 days, incidence rate ratio 2.83, P < 0.01) and a significantly increased risk of major post‐operative complications (50.0% versus 6.7%, odds ratio 13.8, P < 0.01). Frailty was not associated with a significant reduction in quality of life scores at 30 and 90 days post‐operatively. Conclusion: Frailty is associated with adverse post‐operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. Frailty assessment is an important component of pre‐operative risk assessment and may identify targets for pre‐operative optimisation.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=149399715&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	162	ANZ Journal of Surgery		162	richards,simon.j.g	richards	simon.j.g
161	Perceptions, Practices And Educational Needs Of Community Nurses To Manage Frailty.	2021	163	10.12968/bjcn.2021.26.3.136			163	26	3	136	Early intervention on frailty can help prevent or delay functional decline and onset of dependency. Community nurses encounter patients with frailty routinely and have opportunities to influence frailty trajectories for individuals and their carers. This study aimed to understand nurses' perceptions of frailty in a community setting and their needs for education on its assessment and management. Using an exploratory qualitative design we conducted focus groups in one Health Board in Scotland. Thematic content analysis of data was facilitated by NVivo© software. A total of 18 nurses described the meaning of frailty as vulnerability, loss and complex comorbidity and identified processes of caring for people with frailty. They identified existing educational needs necessary to support their current efforts to build capability through existing adversities. Our study indicates that current practice is largely reactive, influenced by professional judgement and intuition, with little systematic frailty-specific screening and assessment.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=149315191&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	163	British Journal of Community Nursing	1	163	papadopoulou,constantina	papadopoulou	constantina
162	The Effect Of Orthostatic Hypotension Detected Pre‐Operatively On Post‐Operative Outcome.	2021	164	10.1111/jgs.16966			144	69	3	767	BACKGROUND: Exacerbation of or new onset orthostatic hypotension in perioperative patients can occur. There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery. The implications for post‐operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of post‐operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre‐operative orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: Supine and 1‐minute and 3‐minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post‐operative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20 mmHg or more and/or 10 mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within ~3 minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Whilst all patients included had a 1‐minute standing blood pressure assessment (N = 170), 3‐minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). Nevertheless, one‐quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre‐operative orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65 years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores. The COVID‐19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to surgery within the planned study timescale (N = 143/170; 84.1%). Nevertheless, patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital post‐operatively and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness and/or dizziness documented (un‐prompted) in their notes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with orthostatic hypotension. These risks are not confined to those with a pre‐existing dysautonomia diagnosis.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=149308084&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		164	hogan,alexandra.m	hogan	alexandra.m

164	Attracting, Recruiting And Retaining Nurses And Care Workers Working In Care Homes: The Need For A Nuanced Understanding Informed By Evidence And Theory.	2021	166	10.1093/ageing/afaa109			161	50	1	65	The care home sector relies on nurses and care workers to deliver care to residents living with frailty and complex needs. However, attracting, recruiting and retaining staff is one of the biggest challenges facing this sector. There is evidence available that describes factors that influence staff decisions to join and/or remain in the care home workforce, for example, individual rewards (such as feeling valued at work or training opportunities), relationships with colleagues and residents, supportive management or working arrangements (including flexible hours). However, it is less clear how different strategies are informed by evidence to improve recruitment and retention. Care homes are heterogeneous in terms of their size, staffing levels and mix, staff age groups, geographical location and working conditions. What matters to different members of the care home workforce will vary across nurses and care workers of different ages and levels of qualification or experience. Recognising this diversity is key: understanding how to attract, recruit and retain staff needs to discriminate and offer solutions that address this diversity. This important area of practice does not lend itself to a 'one-approach-fits-all' solution. This commentary provides a brief overview of known workforce challenges for the care home sector and argues for studies that use empirical evidence to test different theories of what might work for different staff, how and why, and in different circumstances.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=148188434&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	161	Age & Ageing		166	devi,reena	devi	reena
165	Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment In Older Adults With Cancer: Recommendations By The Italian Society Of Geriatrics And Gerontology (Sigg).	2021	167	10.1111/eci.13347			167	51	1	1	Introduction: Optimizing the approach to older adults with cancer is now a priority given the increasing frequency of new cancer diagnoses that are made in the older population. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) represents the gold‐standard for (1) defining prognosis and ability to withstand cancer treatments, (2) exploring the multiple aspects that define the complexity of frail older persons, and (3) designing person‐tailored interventions. Materials and methods: In this document, based on a comprehensive revision of the literature, the Italian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology proposes a CGA model (ONCOGER CGA) to be adopted by oncology centers for their routine approach to older patients with cancer. Results and discussion: A widespread use of this standardized CGA format will facilitate comparisons across institutions, promote studies based on a multidimensional patient assessment, and foster the inclusion of geriatric endpoints in oncological clinical trials. Furthermore, we predict that the use of a standardized CGA approach will increase the integration of geriatricians into oncology care teams with the final result of improving therapeutic choices and clinical outcomes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=147674413&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	167	European Journal of Clinical Investigation		167	fusco,domenico	fusco	domenico
166	Stories From People Living With Frailty.	2020	168	10.1017/S0144686X19000825			168	40	12	2732	We describe the findings of a qualitative longitudinal interview study of a group of initially community-dwelling frail older people, and their informal and formal carers. We used a narrative approach to explore the role that narrative may have for people living with frailty. This has been less explored comparative to the experiences of those living with chronic illness. The frail older people told stories of their experiences that revealed three distinct shapes or typologies. These were either stable, unbalancing or overwhelmed, and related to how the person managed to adapt to increasing challenges and losses, and to reintegrate their sense of self into a cohesive narrative. Each is illustrated by an individual case story. Frailty is described as both biographically anticipated yet potentially biographically disruptive as older people may struggle to make sense of their circumstances without a clear single causative factor. Findings are discussed in relation to biographical disruption and reconstruction in chronic illness and the rhetoric around 'successful ageing'. We conclude by drawing attention to the complex individual and social factors that contribute to the experience of living with frailty in later life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=146954319&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	168	Ageing & Society		168	lloyd,anna	lloyd	anna
167	Non‐Esterified Fatty Acids And Risks Of Frailty, Disability, And Mobility Limitation In Older Adults: The Cardiovascular Health Study.	2020	169	10.1111/jgs.16793			144	68	12	2890	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Non‐esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) play central roles in the relationship between adiposity and glucose metabolism, and they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, but few studies have assessed their effects on complex geriatric syndromes like frailty that cross multiple organ systems. We sought to determine the relationships between NEFAs and incident frailty, disability, and mobility limitation in a population‐based cohort of older persons. METHODS: We analyzed 4,710 Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants who underwent measurement of circulating total fasting NEFAs in 1992–1993 and were assessed for frailty in 1996–1997 and for disability and mobility limitation annually. We used ordinal logistic regression to model incident frailty, linear regression to model components of frailty, and Cox regression to model disability and mobility limitation in relation to baseline NEFAs. To ensure proportional hazards, we truncated follow‐up at 9 years for disability and 6.5 years for mobility limitation. RESULTS: A total of 42 participants became frail and 510 became pre‐frail over a 4‐year period, and we documented 1,720 cases of disability and 1,225 cases of mobility limitation during follow‐up. NEFAs were positively associated in a dose‐dependent manner with higher risks of incident frailty, disability, and mobility limitation. The adjusted odds ratios for frailty were 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.86; P =.04) across extreme tertiles and 1.17 (95% CI = 1.03–1.33; P =.01) per standard deviation increment. The corresponding hazard ratios for incident disability were 1.14 (95% CI = 1.01–1.30; P =.04) and 1.11 (95% CI = 1.06–1.17; P <.0001); those for incident mobility limitation were 1.23 (95% CI = 1.06–1.43; P =.006) and 1.15 (95% CI = 1.08–1.22; P <.0001). Results were largely consistent among both men and women. Among individual components of frailty, NEFAs were significantly associated with self‐reported exhaustion (β =.07; standard error =.03; P =.02). CONCLUSION: Circulating NEFAs are significantly associated with frailty, disability, and mobility limitation among older adults. These results highlight the broad spectrum of adverse health issues associated with NEFA in older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=147642149&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		169	ahiawodzi,peter	ahiawodzi	peter
168	The Association Of Frailty With Oral Cleaning Habits And Oral Hygiene Among Elderly Home Care Clients.	2020	170	10.1111/scs.12801			170	34	4	938	Background: Increasing numbers of frail elderly people living at home but dependent on supportive care will face complex oral health challenges. Objectives: To investigate the associations of frailty status with oral cleaning habits and oral hygiene taking into account the effects of preventive oral health intervention among home care clients aged 75 or over. Methods: Data were gathered by interviews and clinical oral examinations at baseline and after a 6‐month follow‐up. Frailty status was evaluated at baseline using the abbreviated comprehensive geriatric assessment (aCGA) scale, which consists of 15 questions from three different domains: cognitive status, functional status and depression. A total of 231 home care clients completed the aCGA at baseline and the interview and clinical oral examination both at baseline and after the follow‐up. Results: Using the aCGA classification with at least one score in the ≥2 domain, 62% of clients were classified as frail at baseline. They had poorer oral cleaning habits and hygiene, and they had lost more teeth than nonfrail participants. Multivariate analysis showed that being frail at baseline was statistically significantly associated with a lower frequency of toothbrushing and denture cleaning (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1–0.9 and OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1–0.8) at baseline, but not after the follow‐up. Membership in the intervention group was associated with better oral cleaning at the follow‐up. However, among the frail participants, toothbrushing frequency was still significantly lower and oral hygiene poorer than among the nonfrail group. Conclusions: Oral cleaning habits of frail elderly people were slightly improved as a result of external support, which had a positive effect on oral hygiene. Individual preventive actions in the context of oral health and hygiene should be integrated into the daily care plan of home care clients with the first signs of frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=147151989&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	170	tuuliainen,eveliina	tuuliainen	eveliina

This article discusses how a Florence Nightingale Foundation travel scholar used her scholarship to explore best practice in identifying frailty in acute and community settings in Scotland with the aim of developing services for people living with frailty locally and regionally in England. As the move to integrated care services develops in England, valuable insights from Scotland will assist in the proactive design of bespoke services around the needs of individuals in the community and, when acutely unwell, in the hospital setting.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=147159744&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	10	Nursing Older People	1	171	lewis,lucy	lewis	lucy
170	What Works In Managing Complex Conditions In Older People In Primary And Community Care? A State‐Of‐The‐Art Review.	2020	3	10.1111/hsc.13085			18	28	6	1915	The number of older people living with complex health conditions is increasing, with the majority of these managed in primary and community settings. Many models of care have been developed to support them, however, there is mixed evidence on their value and they include multiple overlapping components. We aimed to synthesise the evidence to learn what works for managing complex conditions in older people in primary and community care. We carried out a state‐of‐the‐art review of systematic reviews. We searched three databases (January 2009 to July 2019) for models of primary and community care for long‐term conditions, frailty, multimorbidity and complex neurological conditions common to older people such as dementia. We narratively synthesised review findings to summarise the evidence for each model type and identify components which influenced effectiveness. Out of 2,129 unique titles and abstracts, 178 full texts were reviewed and 54 systematic reviews were included. We found that the models of care were more likely to improve depressive symptoms and mental health outcomes than physical health or service use outcomes. Interventions including self‐management, patient education, assessment with follow‐up care procedures, and structured care processes or pathways had greater evidence of effectiveness. The level of healthcare service integration appeared to be more important than inclusion of specific professional types within a team. However, more experienced and qualified nurses were associated with better outcomes. These conclusions are limited by the overlap between reviews, reliance on vote counting within some included reviews and the quality of study reports. In conclusion, primary and community care interventions for complex conditions in older people should include: (a) clear intervention targets; (b) explicit theoretical underpinnings; and (c) elements of self‐management and patient education, structured collaboration between healthcare professionals and professional support. Further work needs to determine the optimal intensity, length, team composition and role of technology in interventions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=146218106&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	3	frost,rachael	frost	rachael
171	Changing Needs In Advanced Dementia.	2020	173	10.7748/nop.2020.e1204			10	32	4	14	This is the first article in a six-part series in Nursing Older People exploring the nursing care of people living with advanced dementia. This article discusses the changes that may occur as dementia progresses, from the perspective of the individual, their family and other carers. A person living with advanced dementia is likely to experience physical, cognitive and social changes that can be profound and debilitating. Healthcare needs intensify as new and co-existing issues result in increasing dependency on others for support with activities of daily living. These activities can include eating, drinking, mobility and personal care. Consequently, family carers may find their role has to develop and change to provide increasing support in response to these complex needs. These increasing needs can result in care transitions to hospitals or care homes. Careful and collaborative management of care is crucial to maintain quality of life for the person with dementia and family carers.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=148704046&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	10	Nursing Older People	1	173	brown,margaret	brown	margaret
172	New Horizons In The Use Of Routine Data For Ageing Research.	2020	174	10.1093/ageing/afaa018			161	49	5	716	The past three decades have seen a steady increase in the availability of routinely collected health and social care data and the processing power to analyse it. These developments represent a major opportunity for ageing research, especially with the integration of different datasets across traditional boundaries of health and social care, for prognostic research and novel evaluations of interventions with representative populations of older people. However, there are considerable challenges in using routine data at the level of coding, data analysis and in the application of findings to everyday care. New Horizons in applying routine data to investigate novel questions in ageing research require a collaborative approach between clinicians, data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and trial methodologists. This requires building capacity for the next generation of research leaders in this important area. There is a need to develop consensus code lists and standardised, validated algorithms for common conditions and outcomes that are relevant for older people to maximise the potential of routine data research in this group. Lastly, we must help drive the application of routine data to improve the care of older people, through the development of novel methods for evaluation of interventions using routine data infrastructure. We believe that harnessing routine data can help address knowledge gaps for older people living with multiple conditions and frailty, and design interventions and pathways of care to address the complex health issues we face in caring for older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=145303241&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		174	todd,oliver.m	todd	oliver.m
173	"Older Adults' Narratives Of Seeking Mental Health Treatment: Making Sense Of Mental Health Challenges And ""Muddling Through"" To Care."	2020	175	10.1177/1049732320919094			175	30	10	1517	Older adults who experience challenges related to mental health are unlikely to seek professional help. The voices of older adults who have navigated through mental health issues and systems of care to arrive at psychological treatment are less well understood. We conducted individual interviews with 15 adults aged 61 to 86 who sought psychological treatment. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using narrative methods. We identified several main storylines that describe the meaning-making and treatment-seeking journeys of older adults: resistance to being labeled with mental health problems (telling stories of resistance, defining mental health issues in mysterious and uncontrollable terms, and experiencing internal role conflict); muddling through the help-seeking process (manifestations of chaos and system-level barriers); and emotional reactions to psychological treatment (hope, fear, and mistrust). Findings add to the literature base in the area of narrative gerontology, and highlight the complex experiences that older adults face when seeking psychological treatment.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=144621573&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	175	Qualitative Health Research	1	175	reynolds,kristin	reynolds	kristin

175	New Horizons In Appetite And The Anorexia Of Ageing.	2020	177	10.1093/ageing/afaa014			161	49	4	526	Appetite drives essential oral nutritional intake. Its regulation is complex, influenced by physiology, hedonism (the reward of eating) and learning from external cues within a person's society and culture. Appetite loss is common in the older population and not always attributable to medical conditions or treatment. Although the physiological basis of the anorexia of ageing (loss of appetite due to the ageing process) has been established, the effect of ageing on hedonism and external cues, which may be equally important, is less well understood. The anorexia of ageing is associated with reductions in dietary diversity and oral intake, and increased risk of malnutrition, sarcopenia and frailty. Early identification of poor appetite could allow timely intervention before weight loss occurs. There is no standardised tool for assessing appetite in clinical settings at present but the 4-item Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) has the potential to be used in this way. This review, designed for clinicians, will discuss the regulation of appetite and the pathogenesis of the anorexia of ageing. It will describe the current evidence for interventions to manage the anorexia of ageing, which is limited, with little benefit reported from individual studies of education, physical activity and medication. There is some positive evidence for flavour enhancement, fortified food and oral nutritional supplements but mainly within single studies. Looking ahead, the aim is to develop multicomponent approaches to the treatment of the anorexia of ageing based on growing understanding of the role of physiological signalling, hedonism and external cues.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=144382919&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		177	cox,natalie.j	cox	natalie.j
176	Making Decisions About Long-Term Institutional Care Placement Among People With Dementia And Their Caregivers: Systematic Review Of Qualitative Studies.	2020	178	10.1093/geront/gnz046			178	60	4	e329	Background and Objectives People with dementia become increasingly dependent on others for care as cognition declines. Decision making about placement of people with dementia into long-term institutional care can be emotionally complex. The objective of this review is to describe experiences and perspectives of people with dementia and their family caregivers in making decisions about institutional care placement. Research Design and Methods MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched from inception to August 2018. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze results. Results We included 42 studies involving 123 people with dementia and 705 family caregivers from 12 countries. We identified five themes: ensuring safety (avoiding injury due to frailty, protecting against dangerous behaviors, preventing aggressive encounters), reaching breaking point (insufferable burden of caregiving, needs exceeding capabilities, intensifying family conflict, loneliness and isolation, straining under additional responsibilities, making extreme personal sacrifices), vulnerability in lacking support (ill-prepared for crisis, unable to access professional expertise, unpredictable prognostic trajectory, uncertainty navigating health care services, pressured by limited placement opportunities, high cost of placement, resenting loss of autonomy), avoiding guilt of abandonment (sharing accountability, mitigating against disagreement and stigma, reluctance to relinquish caregiving, seeking approval), and seeking reassurance and validation (preserving personhood and former identity, empowerment through engagement, assurance of care quality, acceptance from other care residents). Discussion and Implications People with dementia and family caregivers feel vulnerable, disempowered, and guilty in decision making about institutionalization. Person-centered communication and support strategies that foster confidence and reassurance are needed to assist people with dementia and caregivers to make decisions about placement into long-term institutional care settings.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=143334226&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	178	Gerontologist		178	teng,claris	teng	claris
177	Aidsimpact Special Issue – Broadening The Lens: Recommendations From Rehabilitation In Chronic Disease To Advance Healthy Ageing With Hiv.	2020	179	10.1080/09540121.2020.1739203			179	32		65	People living with HIV are ageing with a combination of physical, mental and social health challenges, known as disability. Although rehabilitation can address disability, the field is still emerging. Our aim was to identify similar disability experiences across complex chronic conditions and establish recommendations for future rehabilitation research and practice to advance healthy ageing with HIV. We conducted a consultation with 77 stakeholders from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland with expertise in the fields of rehabilitation and HIV, cancer, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who attended a one-day symposium. We used facilitated discussions to identify how rehabilitation issues in complex chronic disease translate to people ageing with HIV, and prioritised recommendations for future practice and research. Disability issues experienced across HIV and other complex chronic diseases included: (i) frailty, (ii) uncertainty and worrying about the future ageing with complex chronic disease, (iii) mental health, (iv) pain, and (v) stigma. We highlight six recommendations for clinical practice and research to advance healthy ageing with HIV. Opportunities for cross-collaboration exist with other more established areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation. Recommendations can be used to inform future HIV clinical practice and research in this emerging field.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=142849049&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	179	AIDS Care		179	o'brien,kelly.k	o'brien	kelly.k
178	Care Home Residents Who Die In Hospital: Exploring Factors, Processes And Experiences.	2020	180	10.1093/ageing/afz174			161	49	3	468	Background Care home residents are increasingly frail with complex health and social care needs. Their transfer to hospital at the end-of-life can be associated with unwanted interventions and distress. However, hospitals do enable provision of care that some residents wish to receive. We aimed to explore the factors that influence hospital admission of care home residents who then died in hospital. Methods This study combined in-depth case note review of care home residents dying in two Scottish teaching hospitals during a 6-month period and semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 26 care home staff and two relatives. Results During the 6-month period, 109 care home residents died in hospital. Most admissions occurred out-of-hours (69%) and most were due to a sudden event or acute change in clinical condition (72%). Length of stay in hospital before death was short, with 42% of deaths occurring within 3 days. Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP) regarding hospital admission was documented in 44%. Care home staff wanted to care for residents who were dying; however, uncertain trajectories of decline, acute events, challenges of ACP, relationship with family and lack of external support impeded this. Conclusions Managing acute changes on the background of uncertain trajectories is challenging in care homes. Enhanced support is required to improve and embed ACP in care homes and to provide rapid, 24 hours-a-day support to manage difficult symptoms and acute changes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=142948388&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		180	alcorn,gemma	alcorn	gemma
179	The Emergence And Utilisation Of Frailty In The United Kingdom: A Contemporary Biopolitical Practice.	2020	181	10.1017/S0144686X18001319			168	40	4	695	Frailty has recently emerged as a dominant concept against a backdrop of media and governmental narratives that frame the growing ageing population as an economic threat to the current configuration of health care in the United Kingdom (UK). Despite frailty's popularity amongst geriatricians and policy makers, the concept faces resistance from other health-care professionals and older people themselves. This paper draws on the Foucauldian idea of biopower; by suggesting that the contemporary emergence and utilisation of frailty represents a biopolitical practice a number or critical observations are made. First, despite biomedical experts acknowledging ambiguities in the definition of frailty, the concept is presented as a truth discourse. This is driven by the ability of frailty measurements to predict risk of costly adverse outcomes; the capability of frailty scores to enumerate complex needs; and the scientific legitimacy frailty affords to geriatric medicine. Consequently, frailty has become pervasive, knowable and measurable. Second, the routine delineation between frail and robust objectifies older people, and can be said to benefit those making the diagnosis over those being labelled frail, with the latter becoming disempowered. Last, studies show that frailty is associated with increasing wealth inequalities in the UK; however, experts' suggested management of frailty shifts the focus of responsibility away from ideologically driven structural inequalities towards the frail older person, attempting to encourage individuals to modify lifestyle choices. This neglects the association between lifestyle opportunities and socio-economic deprivation, and the impact of long-term poverty on health. These observations, set against the contemporary political climate of economic austerity, cuts to public services and rationalisation of health resources, bring the urgency of a critical consideration of frailty to the fore.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=142066950&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	168	Ageing & Society		181	tomkow,louise	tomkow	louise
180	"Chronic Disease Decision Making And ""What Matters Most""."	2020	182	10.1111/jgs.16371			144	68	3	474	"The increasing use of the question, ""What matters most to you?"" is a welcome development in the effort to provide patient‐centered care. However, it is difficult for clinicians to translate answers to this question into treatment plans for chronic conditions, including recognizing when to consider options other than clinical practice guideline (CPG)–directed therapy. Goal elicitation is most helpful when a patient has different treatment options with clearly identifiable trade‐offs. In the face of trade‐offs, goal elicitation helps patients to prioritize among potentially competing outcomes. While decision aids (DAs) focus on trade‐offs by delineating options and outcomes, the robust outcome data necessary to create DAs for older patients with multimorbidity are often lacking and even mild cognitive impairment makes the use of DAs difficult. The challenges for providing chronic disease care to older patients who are at risk for adverse events from CPG‐directed therapy because of multimorbidity and/or frailty are to organize the complexity of individual combinations of diseases, conditions, and syndromes into common sets of trade‐offs and to identify those goals or priorities that will directly inform a plan of care.

182	Meanings Of Care Convoys: The Structure, Function, And Adequacy Of Care Networks Among Frail, Community-Dwelling Older Adults.	2020	184	10.1177/1049732319861934			175	30	4	583	Researchers propose that the convoy of care model should be used to study care networks of frail, older individuals. Care convoys are defined as the evolving collection of individuals who may or may not have close personal connections to the recipient or to one another, but who provide care, including help with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), socio-emotional care, skilled health care, monitoring, and advocacy. This study reports on community-dwelling older adults' experiences of their care convoy, how care convoys change over time, and perceived (positive) outcomes. A qualitative analysis among 65 semi-structured interviews with frail, community-dwelling older adults demonstrates a great variety in the composition of care convoys. Participants were often actively involved in their care convoy and valued the social/relational aspect of care. Care and support covered a wide range of activities, with some activities being provided by specific types of caregivers. Participants expressed the adequacy of their care convoy in terms of satisfaction and sufficiency. Noteworthy, participants who were satisfied with their care convoy did not necessarily receive sufficient help. Policies and practice should recognize the relational aspect of care, the complex interplay between all actors, and the dynamic character of care convoys.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141561331&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	175	Qualitative Health Research	1	184	lambotte,deborah	lambotte	deborah
183	Medicine For Older People Liaison Service To Acute Surgery Reduces Length Of Stay Of Older People Living With Frailty.	2020	185	10.1093/ageing/afz183.32			161	49		i1	Background: Of people admitted to the acute surgical unit (ASU) only 23% of them are aged over 70. However the number of bed days they occupy are disproportionate to this; comprising 48% of the total bed days. The average number of bed days rises exponentially with age, with those aged under 70 averaging less than two days; those aged 80 averaging approximately 4.5 bed days and those aged over 90 approximately 7 bed days. This disparity was recognised and a Medicine for Older People (MOP) liaison team comprising consultant geriatrician and Advanced Clinical Practitioner in Frailty starting working with the acute surgical team in November 2018, initially providing support two days a week, increasing to 5 days in March 2019. Methods: The MOP liaison team meets with the acute surgical team each morning identifying and discussing relevant patients; those identified as living with frailty with associated complexity and uncertainty. This group of patients is then reviewed by the MOP liaison team utilising the principles of the comprehensive geriatric assessment to formulate a person-centred plan. Plans are discussed and coordinated with the surgical, nursing and therapy teams utilising a multi-disciplinary/ multi-professional approach. Results: Length of stay is the main outcome measure and readmissions are monitored. Data on admission length and readmissions was analysed from April 2018 and has continued following commencement of the liaison service. Primary results-Length of stay has reduced from 4.4 to 3.3 days on average for all over 70-year-olds admitted to the ASU team. Whilst admission rates have dropped across all age ranges the biggest reduction in readmissions is among the over 80-year-olds with an almost 50% reduction as opposed to a 33% reduction in the under 70 age group Conclusions: Proactively managing the admissions and discharges of patients with frailty allows them to receive the right care at the right time in their period of crisis and shortens their admissions by approximately 25%.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761300&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		185	everett,r	everett	r
184	The ‘Colchester Older Persons’ Evaluation For Surgery (Copes)’ Clinic: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Preoperative Management Of Frail, Older Patients.	2020	186	10.1093/ageing/afz183.09			161	49		i1	Introduction: In 2014-15, 2.5 million patients over 75 years old underwent surgery compared to 1.5 million in 2006-7. The population is aging with increasing numbers of comorbidities, and associated frailty. 1 The Royal College of Anaesthetists recommends that preoperative assessment for these complex older patients takes a “cross-specialty approach.”2 In Colchester the COPES clinic has been introduced in which selected high-risk patients are seen by a Consultant Anaesthetist and Consultant Geriatrician. This aims to medically optimise patients prior to surgery and to facilitate shared decision making. Methods: The new clinic was introduced in October 2018. The following data was collected from COPES clinic letters from October to February 2018-19 (n=46): • Patient/surgery characteristics: age, comorbidities, frailty score and any cognitive impairment • Interventions: changes to medication, specialty referral, intravenous iron, diabetes optimisation, other • Outcomes of surgery following the COPES clinic Patients were asked to complete feedback forms to evaluate the service. Results: 52% of patients had 4-6, and 28% had 7-9 comorbidities. The majority had Rockwood frailty scores of 4 or 5. 28% of patients had medications changed, 48% had specialty referrals, 17% received intravenous iron, 8.7% required diabetes optimisation and 28% of patients had investigations including echocardiograms, MRI and CT scans. 12/46 patients had surgery deemed unlikely to go ahead after shared decision making with patients in conjunction with the multidisciplinary team involved in their care. 2 patients died of their comorbidities after deciding not to proceed with surgery. 12/46 patients underwent surgery; 4 developed post-operative complications, none died and the mean length of stay was 3.38 days. The remaining 22/46 patients are awaiting surgery. Patient feedback questionnaires (n=10) were overwhelmingly positive. Everyone felt that they were treated with respect and that their fears were addressed and they were clear in the next steps in management. Conclusions: The introduction of the ‘COPES’ clinic has helped address frailty and multiple comorbidities by optimising patients’ medical conditions and allowing alternatives to surgery to be considered. Patients were very satisfied with the COPES clinic and felt it has prepared them for upcoming surgery.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761277&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		186	jiang,z	jiang	z
185	The Role Of A Virtual Clinic In Reducing Waiting Times For Out-Patient Follow-Up.	2020	187	10.1093/ageing/afz183.30			161	49		i1	Topic: Hospital admissions for older people are increasing with subsequent pressure on outpatient (OP) clinics. By early 2018, 350 patients were waiting up to 6 months for follow-up, with limited capacity in existing clinics. There were concerns regarding potential harm to patients from delayed review of significant results. Intervention: A working group considered options for managing the OP waiting list. We decided to pilot a fortnightly virtual clinic (VC) where cases were reviewed without the patient present. All patients awaiting results were listed for the VC rather than routine OP. Each VC had 50 patients listed. Patient’s GP received a clear action plan. Clinic rules were modified as issues were identified. Links with other specialities evolved reducing the number of missing results. Data was analysed for 50% of consultations between January 2018 and March 2019. Improvement: 311 VC appointments were reviewed: 207 in 2018 and 104 up to March 2019. Maximum 25 cases could be completed per clinic, additional sessions cleared initial backlog within 3 months. Completion time/case ranged from 2-15 minutes depending on complexity. Main reason for VC was test results: 82% in 2018, increasing to 93% in 2019. 61% in 2018, 80% in 2019 were discharged directly from VC. 20% required a 2nd VC for outstanding results. OP review post-VC fell from 16% in 2018 to just 2% in 2019. General OP requirements fell from 24hrs to 10 hours/week as a result of VCs, releasing consultants for other clinical areas. Discussion: VCs are an effective means of reviewing outstanding results fromrecent admissions and OP consultations. Routine listing of patients with outstanding investigations provides a safety net. Most results are normal and do not require follow-up. Repeat CXRs at 6 weeks continue to be requested for severely frail people who are unlikely to benefit.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761298&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		187	thomson,f	thomson	f
186	Care Home Liaison Role-Bridging The Gap Between Acute Hospitals And Care Homes.	2020	188	10.1093/ageing/afz185.02			161	49		i11	Introduction: There are over 400,000 people over 65 in UK care homes, three times the number than that in acute hospitals. They are amongst the frailest in our community, with average life expectancy of 15 months once in the home. Their needs are often complex and challenging, which when unmet, often result in unwanted and unnecessary hospital admissions. Imperial College Healthcare Trust (ICHT), along with funding from Health Education England (HEE), have introduced a care home liaison nurse. The aim is to bridge the boundaries, making a significant difference to cross organisation communication and support. Methods: The care home liaison nurse manages a frailty liaison service with the largest local nursing care home. This home has 140 residents with complex needs. The care home liaison nurse provides a point of contact for advice, guidance and support for individual patient pathways, she provides face to face assessment and treatment or verbal advice. In addition, the nurse supports discharge from the acute setting. This direct contact allows rapid access to specialist advice, and aims to build confidence both within the care home team and within the acute team, that the patients’ needs can be met in their own surroundings. Results: The preliminary data demonstrates a positive impact this role is having both to the acute trust and most importantly patient’s experience. Comparing ICHT data from April-May 2018 to April-May 2019 it showing that the number of avoidable admissions has decreased from 54.3% to 37.5%, length of stay when patients are admitted has decreased from 11.7 days to 6.5 days, and the number of patients with an advanced care plan has risen 14.9%. Feedback from nursing staff at the care centre as well as that from patients and families has been overwhelmingly positive. Conclusions: The role is still in the pilot phase. Given the already positive impact it is hoped that it will continue and expand into other care homes and extra sheltered accommodations.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761307&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		188	sendall,c	sendall	c
187	Improving Access To Outpatient Services For Older People Using A Clinical Microsystems Approach.	2020	189	10.1093/ageing/afz185.01			161	49		i11	Background: Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust provides services to more than 500,000 residents in the North-East of England across multiple sites. Local problem: Outpatient services for older people across Northumbria include specialist (eg falls) and generic clinics with differing referral routes, demands and waiting times. Referrals derive from primary care, emergency services and elsewhere; some are complex patients requiring a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Existing pathways led to variable waits for clinics, duplication and delays. Aim was to improve the timeliness, efficiency and access to appropriate assessment first time. Methods: We adopted a Clinical Microsystems approach (Sheffield Microsystems Coaching Academy) for improvement. Main components were team coaching, weekly “Big Room” meeting of involved staff to share understanding of current process, agree change ideas, and test these with multiple plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles. Impacts of each PDSA cycle were discussed in Big Room, leading to refinement of the pathway. Interventions: Results: PDSA interventions were tested over 6 months: 1. Development of a single triage system 2. CGA clinic for frail older patients. 3. Development of shared documentation for CGA. 4. Improved cycle and lead times for assessment Conclusions: Our quality improvement work supported the development and implementation of a new referral triage process with CGA assessment for complex frail patients. The change has reduced patient wait times, provided early intervention and reduced duplication. Work is ongoing to determine impact on patient satisfaction and time to discharge from clinic. The approach taken by this project could be applied elsewhere to improve outpatient referral processes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761306&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		189	tullo,e	tullo	e
188	Specialist Physiotherapist Leading In The Frailty Revolution In Ambulatory Emergency Care At The John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.	2020	190	10.1093/ageing/afz186.02			161	49		i14	Background: The Ambulatory Assessment Unit (AAU) at the John Radcliffe Hospital aims to provide excellent care for complex patients with varying range of medical presentations. It sees over 50% of the acute take in operational hours, with over 40% of AAU patients over the age of 70. Staff feedback consistently identified a suboptimal service provided to the frail group within this patient cohort. A dedicated physiotherapist specialising in older people living with frailty joined the team in October 2018 to address this. Aims: 1. Early identification of patients with frailty attending the unit 2. Improve staff understanding of frailty to enhance patient care 3. Assess patients to either enable a patient to return home safely or support ambulatory pathway 4. Refer to community services that can support the patient and enable them to live well after hospital attendance 5. Review the impact of the specialist physiotherapist’s role Methods: 1. Introduction of frailty identification as per frailty team guidance 2. Frailty questionnaire to ascertain baseline understanding and learning needs to develop staff training 3. Assess patients using a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment 4. Raise staff and patient awareness of community support services available within the community 5. Data collection to review interventions taken, bed days saved and re-attendance rates Results: • 129 new patients were seen in a 4-month period. • 85% returned home the same day; 64% had their ambulatory pathway supported with therapy intervention and 21% had an acute admission avoided directly due to therapy. 15% were admitted to an acute bed for safety • 60% of patients were referred to community services and 50% were signposted to a range of community and support services • The re-admission rates for therapy related reasons within 7 days and 30 days were 0% and 4% respectively. 38 bed days were saved with a calculated cost saving of £15,162 Future service delivery and conclusions: There is ongoing work to obtain patient experience data for those who had their admission avoided directly due to therapy intervention. A training programme on frailty for all members of the MDT is to be developed. A dedicated therapy service in an ambulatory setting has a role in ensuring that patients’ needs are met in the most appropriate place and enhances their quality of life after hospital attendance.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141761316&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		190	greensitt,b	greensitt	b
189	The Older Surgical Patient - To Operate Or Not? A State Of The Art Review.	2020	191	10.1111/anae.14910			191	75		e46	The increasing age and subsequent medical complexity of patients presenting for surgery grants the opportunity to examine the processes and delivery of peri-operative care. There is a need to redesign peri-operative pathways allowing room for shared decision making and personalised, evidence-based care. In times of financial constraint, this is no easy task. However, neglecting to transform services now may lead to challenges in the sustainability of the provision of peri-operative care in the long-term. Challenges in redesigning peri-operative care pathways include identification and optimisation of those at highest peri-operative risk to inform the difficult conversations surrounding the appropriateness of surgery. The moral burden of these conversations on patient and professionals alike is increasingly recognised and managing this issue requires innovative models of collaborative, multidisciplinary and interprofessional working. To operate or not can be a challenging question to answer with a number of different perspectives to consider; not least that of the patient.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141143000&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	191	Anaesthesia		191	santhirapala,r	santhirapala	r
190	The Seventh Age On Stage: Representation Of Older Adults And Aging In U.S. Broadway And Off-Broadway Theater.	2019	192	10.1080/03601277.2019.1685736			192	45	11	645	Older persons' involvement in theater often focuses on health, educational, and therapeutic benefits. Though less examined, artistic depictions of aging help bridge gerontological and humanities approaches to this topic. Qualitative textual script analysis was used to analyze the representation of older adults in six plays produced on and off Broadway, 1991–2017. Traditional character constructions of age and older adults emerged – frailty, fear, caregiving burden – with counternarratives of resilience, resistance, and self-reflexivity also present. Uncovered dyadic pairs (e.g. frailty/resistance) served as examples of the complexity of age portrayed on stage. From this dyadic tension present in the plays emerged a way to build upon and expand traditional, and often more limited, societal notions of aging.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=139742145&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	192	Educational Gerontology		192	weil,joyce	weil	joyce
191	The Holistic Assessment And Care Planning In Partnership Intervention Study (Happi): A Protocol For A Feasibility, Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.	2019	193	10.1111/jan.14106			193	75	11	3078	Aim: During an initial phase of this research, an e‐Delphi survey was conducted to gain consensus among stakeholders on the components of a nurse‐led assessment and care planning intervention for older people who live with frailty in primary care. This feasibility randomized controlled trial (fRCT) will test the proposed intervention and its implementation and determine methods for the design of a conclusive randomized controlled trial. Methods: The fRCT, with embedded qualitative study, aims to recruit 60 participants. Moderately and severely frail older people will be identified using the electronic frailty index (eFI) and the intervention will be delivered by senior community nurses. The control participants will receive usual primary care for frailty. The study is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR; funding granted in May 2016, ref: ICA‐CDRF‐2016‐02‐018) and received NHS and University Research Ethics Committee approval in 2018. Discussion: There is evidence that the delivery of complex interventions for community‐dwelling older people can reduce care home and hospital admissions and falls, there is less evidence for the benefit of any specific type or intensity of intervention or the additional benefits of targeting the frail population. This trial will determine feasibility of the intervention, define recruitment and retention parameters and trial logistics, and decide outcome measures. Impact: This study aims to address the limitations of current research by using a systematic method of frailty diagnosis and participant identification, trialling implementation of a person‐centred intervention, and testing of feasibility parameters.

192	138 The Role Of Health And Social Care Professional Teams In The Emergency Department: A Qualitative Study Of Key Stakeholders' Views.	2019	194	10.1093/ageing/afz102.27			161	48		iii1	Background Introducing Health and Social Care Professional (HSCP) teams to the emergency department (ED) has increasingly demonstrated benefits for ED patient and process outcomes. However, there is a dearth of research exploring the views of key ED stakeholders on the role of HSCP teams in care delivery the ED. This qualitative study investigated the perspectives of a wide range of ED stakeholders about HSCPs teams working in the ED. Methods A total of 65 participants including older adults who had recently attended the ED and their carers/relatives, ED doctors and nurses, HSCPs and pre-hospital staff participated in four World Café style focus groups and individual interviews across two Irish hospital sites. Written and audio-recorded data were transcribed and thematically analysed. Results Overall, participants expressed positive views on HSCPs working in teams in the ED, with benefits for patients, staff members and the hospital (Theme 1). Having an ED-based HSCP team was described as promoting effective and timely decision-making and a more integrated approach to patient care, particularly for frail older adults with complex needs (Theme 2). Barriers and enablers for effective implementation were identified at multiple levels (Theme 3) including the ED physical environment, (e.g. space and equipment), operational factors (e.g. working hours), and relations (e.g. patient-staff or staff-staff communication); factors at system level included availability of community resources and financial pressures. Conclusion Our study indicates overall acceptability of HSCPs working in teams in the ED and positive views on their contribution to enhance the quality care of older adults. However, a number of operational and relational factors need to be considered to ensure feasibility and effectiveness. This information is crucial to inform implementation.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138864941&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		194	cassarino,marica	cassarino	marica
193	329 An Integrated Care Approach To The Uses Of Social Prescribing In An Acutely Frail Older Adult Cohort.	2019	195	10.1093/ageing/afz102.69			161	48		iii1	Background Community Health Organisation Area 1 has the highest age dependency in Ireland (37.5 vs 34.5) and the highest proportion of its population engaged in unpaid care (4.7%)1. Social prescribing is a novel tool used by the Integrated Care Team for the Older Person in Sligo to address social determinants of health such as social isolation and to minimise the impact of carer burden. The study aim is to quantify social needs and carer burden in this acutely frail group and describe interventions to address this. Methods A descriptive study compiled from Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment of patient care profile and social prescribing from June to December 2018. Results 50% of patients studied did not have a supportive, able person living with them. 1 in 4 had no local support while 1 in 5 were supported only by neighbours or friends. 53% were not receipt of home help while 24% paid for private care or cleaning services. Carer burden was reported in half of cases with a 2.2 times increased risk with a patient co-morbidity of cognitive decline and a 1.8 times increased risk with a complex medical needs patient. Intervention increased community service usage such as the public health nurse from 70% to 86% and home help applications by 26%. Social prescribing increased day centre use from 18% to 46% and Meals on Wheels usage by 50%. Dementia specific social prescribing was made in 26% of those with cognitive difficulties. 33% received information for carers while 11% were informed of respite options. Conclusion In this acutely decompensated and vulnerable group social isolation and carer burden are a significant issue. Our study indicates the potential for the use of a social prescribing model to address this at an earlier point in frailty development at a primary care level.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138864983&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		195	mcloughlin,petra	mcloughlin	petra
194	253 An Overview Of The Current Status Of Specialist Geriatric Services In Ireland.	2019	196	10.1093/ageing/afz102.58			161	48		iii1	Background The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the National Clinical Programme for Older People conducted a national survey of Specialist Geriatric Services (SGS) in 2014. The survey was repeated in 2018-2019 period to collect data on the resources available for the care of older people attending hospitals and associated communities in Ireland. Methods Participants were geriatrician leads or proxies in each hospital in Ireland. Questions based on the 2014 survey were updated to include frailty and dementia-delirium specific questions. Data were collected between September 2018 and April 2019 using an electronic survey. Comments from open-ended questions were analysed using qualitative analysis methods. Results In total, 20 fully complete and 18 incomplete responses were received. Most complete responses were from model 3 or 4 hospitals (n= 14/20). Less than half (47%) reported having a dedicated specialist geriatric ward in their institution. Half (50%) reported currently developing an integrated plan for services for frail older people with complex care needs. Barriers to managing frailty that were identified included limited access to funding and staffing. 82% reported that their group/area/unit/department engaged in case-finding for frailty. The most commonly used frailty-specific screening tools were the CFS (n=9), VIP (n=6), FRAIL scale (n=4), and PRISMA-7 (n=3). A National Frailty Education Programme governance structure was operational in 9/20 sites. Half (50%) reported that their hospital has an integrated pathway for people with dementia and/or delirium, although (82%) stated that their hospital does not formally screen all older people for cognitive impairment in the ED/AMAU, and does not formally screen people at risk for delirium on wards on a daily basis (100%). Conclusion Limited staffing and resources were reported for many aspects of SGS in Ireland. Although frailty and dementia-delirium are recognised as priority areas, there is need for standardised assessment and screening approaches.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138864972&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		196	sezgin,duygu	sezgin	duygu
195	280 Acute Hospital Presentations Among Nursing Home Residents: A Retrospective Observational Analysis.	2019	197	10.1093/ageing/afz102.63			161	48		iii1	Background Nursing home residents are prone to acute illness due to their advancing age, underlying illnesses and immobility. The decision to refer a nursing home resident for acute hospital admission is a complex one, and there is no consensus among health care professionals about what constitutes an 'appropriate admission' to hospital from a nursing home. We aimed to explore patterns of acute nursing home patient presentations to the emergency department. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of emergency hospital admissions to a tertiary university teaching hospital. Emergency admissions through the emergency department were included. Elective admissions, outpatient admissions, or inter-hospital transfers were excluded. Cases were validated by scrutiny of the patient medical records, and where possible an assessment of the Rockwood clinical frailty scale (CFS) was carried out. Results There were 126 nursing home residents who presented to ED over a two month period for emergency assessments. 87.3% (n=115) presented via ambulance. Just over half had a GP referral letter (53.2%). 72.3% of patients who presented to ED were admitted. 25.2% of patients were re-referred to ED within 30 days of hospital discharge. All patients were classified as frail. 21.3% of patients had died at the 90 day follow up mark. 66% of those with a CFS 8 or 9 died, in comparison to 16% of those with a CFS or either 6 or 7. Conclusion We noted high numbers of patients from nursing homes attending our emergency department. A very high proportion were admitted, along with a high number of subsequent re-presentations. Death rates were higher in those with more advanced frailty status. We would suggest advanced care planning and strategies to improve the patient experience. This study highlights the requirement for improved advance care planning in the nursing home setting. This is however a complex issue. Early discussion about end of life preferences with patients and family is required.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138864977&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	161	Age & Ageing		197	waters,ruairí	waters	ruairí
196	274 From Clinical Care Programme To Frailty Pathway; A Multidisciplinary, Interagency Journey.	2019	198	10.1093/ageing/afz103.172			161	48		iii17	Background The National Clinical Programme for Older Persons was introduced in the Model 4 Adult teaching hospital in 2012 with the development of a Specialist Geriatric Ward, supported by an existing Day Hospital and access to post acute rehabilitation in the local model 3 hospital. The continuing growth of the population over 70 years in the catchment area and the increasing awareness of the complex needs of this group of patients required a new way of thinking and working. Methods Using Lean methodology the group restructured the focus of the care pathway for older persons using evidence based practice and data collection. Workstreams have been identified and iterative project charters established to guide and empower staff to design and evaluate the supports they provide. Key internal and external stakeholders were identified and invited to participate in the ongoing steering group and the voice of the customer was used to underpin targeted improvements. Results The hospital now has a structured framework for the delivery and evaluation of care provided to older persons attending our services. Overall governance is provided by a Frailty Steering Group with strong clinical leadership and is informed by agreed quality indicators and realtime data. Despite increases in numbers requiring admission, length of stay has decreased, readmission rates have remained stable and a greater proportion of our patients are accessing both offsite rehabilitation and home supports on discharge. Conclusion This is an ongoing project with medium and long term goals identified across all workstreams. The evidence and data gathered will inform service planning and resource allocation. A number of collaborative research proposals are now being considered from across acute hospital and Community Healthcare Organisation.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865159&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		198	casey,amanda	casey	amanda
197	156 Review Of Outcomes Of A Dedicated Geriatric Surgical Liaison Service.	2019	199	10.1093/ageing/afz103.91			161	48		iii17	Background In the United Kingdom, the 2010 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report 'An Age Old Problem' outlined significant shortcomings in the perioperative care of older people. Other than hip fractures, the care of older patients under surgical specialities is largely devoid of routine geriatrician input. In August 2018, we introduced daily geriatric reviews (GR) on the gastrointestinal surgical wards, aiming to improve length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Methods All acute general surgery admissions for patients ≥70 years were reviewed between September and October 2017 (pre-introduction) and 2018 (post-introduction), and outcomes compared. For 2018, comparisons were also made between those who had GR and those who didn't. Results There were 173 admissions in 2017, vs 190 in 2018. In both 2017 and 2018, median age was 80, median LOS was 4 days, and clinical frailty scale (CFS) 4. Twenty-two percent (38/173) of patients had a surgical procedure in 2017, vs 33% (63/190) in 2018. Inpatient mortality was 8% (13/173) in 2017 (median CFS 6), vs 6% (11/190) in 2018 (median CFS 6). In 2018, 21% (40/190) of patients had GR: median time to review 3 days. 54% (n=22) of the patients with GR underwent a surgical procedure, 37% (n=15) were admitted to ICU, and inpatient mortality was 5% (n=2), vs 28% (n=42), 4% (n=6) and 6% (n=9) respectively for those without GR. 30 day readmission for those with GR was 12.5% (n=5), vs 18.4% (n=28) for those not seen. Conclusion While more surgical procedures were performed in 2018 (post-introduction), overall LOS remained unchanged and improved mortality was observed compared to 2017. Geriatricians are seeing more post-operative and ICU patients, and despite presumed increased complexity, both mortality and readmission rates remain low. Screening for frailty and specific inclusion criteria may improve rates of GR.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865077&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		199	coary,roisin	coary	roisin
198	137 Does The Clinical Frailty Scale Predict Rehabilitation Potential In Older Patients?	2019	200	10.1093/ageing/afz103.82			161	48		iii17	Background The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is widely used to assess frailty in older adults and reflects functional independence. We examined its use as an outcome measure in an offsite rehabilitation unit for patients over 65 transferred from an acute hospital following medical/surgical admission. Methods Patients were given a CFS score by consensus opinion from the multidisciplinary team on admission and on completion of rehabilitation. We included data on diagnosis, length of stay and discharge destination Results Thirty patients, with a mean age of 80, completed rehabilitation over a four-month period. The most common diagnosis was fracture of hip or pelvis (53%). Median CFS was 6 on admission and 5 on discharge (range 3-8). Twenty-one (70%) patients saw an improvement in CFS of an average of one point on the scale irrespective of admission score. Of those that improved, 81% were discharged directly home with no need for increased support services, compared with 11% of those who did not improve. Mean length of stay was significantly less in those with mild/moderate frailty (CFS 5-6) at admission versus severe frailty (31 vs 53.8 days, p<0.01). Conclusion Frailty score improved in the majority of patients undergoing rehabilitation, regardless of admission score; CFS alone did not predict rehabilitation potential, emphasising the importance of offering rehabilitation to frail older adults – better judged by experienced clinical assessment. CFS is a broad 9-point tool that can miss small improvements in physical function based on other objective scores e.g. FIM+FAM. Severe frailty was associated with longer length of stay in rehabilitation, possibly reflecting more complex discharge planning as well as rehabilitation progress in this group.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865068&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		200	d'alton,maeve	d'alton	maeve
199	92 Medication Related Quality Of Life (Mrqol) In Ambulatory Older Adults With Polypharmacy And Multi-Morbidity – A Measurable Outcome?	2019	201	10.1093/ageing/afz103.54			161	48		iii17	Background With increasing numbers of older multi-morbid people being exposed to polypharmacy, research needs to focus on medication-related outcomes affecting quality-of-life (QoL). This study examines older-patients' medication-related QoL (MRQoL), its relationship to medication burden/complexity, frailty, health-related QoL (HRQoL) and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs. Methods A cross-sectional-study was conducted in older-patients attending out-patients and day-hospital services of a tertiary-teaching-hospital. Participants were aged ≥65 years, first-time attendees, taking ≥5 chronic-medications for ≥3 chronic-conditions and mini-mental state examination score ≥26/30. Demographic, medication, comorbidity, frailty status, PIMs(STOPP/STARTv.2 criteria), MRQoL (MRQoL-LS v1.0) HRQoL (Short-form-12; SF-12) and medication burden (Living with Medicines Questionnaire v.2; LMQv2) data were collected. Drg compliance was measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). Lower MRQoL-LS v1.0 scores indicate better MRQoL (range 0-84). Higher LMQv2 scores indicate higher medication burden (range from 60-300). A negative age-specific mean-difference score in SF-12 physical and mental health composite scale scores (SF12-PCS, SF12-MCS) indicates poorer health. Results Over 12 months, 234 patients (attending 78 clinics) were screened, 59 met inclusion criteria and 30 were recruited; 3 patients were subsequently identified as ineligible. Eighteen patients were female (66%), mean age was 79.4 years (SD±6.2), median number of daily medications was 10 (IQR 8-13), median number of comorbidities was 11 (IQR 9-14). Participants were generally drug-compliant, median MARS score of 9 (IQR 6.5-10). Patients' median MRQoL score was 14 (IQR 14-22.5); mean LMQ v2 score was 115.64 (SD± 25.18). Mean age specific mean-difference SF12-PCS and SF12-MCS scores were -22.61 (SD±11.7) and -22.1 (SD±17.5) respectively. There was no significant correlation between MRQoL and number of daily medications, number of comorbidities, LMQ, HRQoL, or PIMs(Pearson's 2-tailed test). Conclusion This study demonstrates that MRQoL-LS v.1 is not applicable to most patients attending geriatric ambulatory services. Furthermore, polypharmacy, multimorbidity, presence of PIMs poorer HRQoL do not correlate significantly with MRQoL.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865040&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		201	jennings,emma	jennings	emma
200	169 Examining The Associations Between Frailty, Obesity And Allostatic Load In The Irish Longitudinal Study On Ageing (Tilda).	2019	202	10.1093/ageing/afz103.101			161	48		iii17	Background Fried's frailty phenotype is defined by five criteria: exhaustion, unexplained weight loss, weakness, slowness and low physical activity. Frailty can also affect obese people. Little is known about how body mass index [BMI] or waist-hip ratio [WHR] are associated with frailty or pre-frailty in the face of confounding factors, including markers of allostatic load which are known to be involved in frailty biology. We cross-sectionally examined these associations in a population-based study. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of data collected at Wave 1 (2010) of TILDA was undertaken. Participants aged <50 and those who did not have measurements of their BMI, WHR, chronic disease status, HbA1c, CRP, sex and educational status were excluded. Two multivariate logistic regression models (one with BMI and another one with WHR as measure of obesity) were computed adjusting for these covariates, with frail/pre-frail versus non-frail as the outcome variable. Results 4,568 participants were included: 3,277 non-frail and 1,291 frail/pre-frail. The frail/pre-frail group had a mean BMI of 29.2 (versus 28.3) kg/m2 and a mean WHR of 0.912 (versus 0.899). In the adjusted regression model, BMI had a significant association with frailty/pre-frailty (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.001). However, in the model using WHR, the latter had a stronger association with frailty (OR 4.52, 95% CI: 1.60-12.72, p=0.004). In both models, age, education, chronic disease status, HbA1c and CRP had the expected associations with frailty/pre-frailty. Female sex was significantly associated with frailty/pre-frailty in the WHR model (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50, p=0.008). Conclusion While obesity is associated with frailty, the distribution of body fat may be more important as a marker of frailty. These physical traits should not be overlooked in the over 50 population. The association between frailty, obesity and markers of 'inflammaging' could be examined longitudinally to further understand their complex biology.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865087&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		202	mccarthy,kevin	mccarthy	kevin
201	210 Nursing Home Residents In Acute Hospital – A Targeted Anpc Program To Improve Care.	2019	203	10.1093/ageing/afz103.127			161	48		iii17	Background NHR are the frailest group of older people and require a gerontologically attuned approach to combat multiple challenges presented to the practitioner. The in-reach ANPc liaison service aims to confront such challenges, by providing comprehensive gerontological input to all nursing home residents admitted to hospital under all specialities medical, geriatric, and surgical. Methods This service commenced in September of 2018, working 9-5 Monday to Friday with limited leave cross-cover. All nursing home residents are reviewed by a Gerontology Advanced Nurse Practitioner candidate. Each patient received comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) with recommendations for care. All had follow up 2 weeks after discharge in telephone review clinic. Results 118 nursing home residents were admitted for acute care in the study period; 96/118 (82%) were reviewed by the ANPc. 16/118 (14%) were discharged prior to review and 6/118 (5%) died within 24 hours of admission. All other patients were reviewed within 72 hours. All assessed residents had >1 recommendation for intervention to enhance care following CGA: Interventions included 31% (30/96) undiagnosed delirium identified and management advice given. 21% (20/96) had recurrent falls work up and advice. 27% (26/96) had recommendations and changes to admission medications. 37% (36/96) referrals to other HSCP therapy disciplines for complete holistic care. 11% (11/ 96) had advanced care planning regarding future illnesses. 13% (13/96) had palliative care advice and referral to community palliative care. Follow up telephone review clinics have further resulted in reduced readmission rates through liaison with NH staff post-discharge. Conclusion The high complexity of this cohort of patients requires a timely, comprehensive gerontological approach in order to provide holistic care. They require a clearly defined approach to enhance care and minimise the need for unnecessary hospitalisations.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865114&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		203	noonan,claire	noonan	claire
202	121 Patients With Prolonged Lengths Of Stay. A Point Prevalence Study.	2019	204	10.1093/ageing/afz103.69			161	48		iii17	"Background A hospital's trolley count is often highlighted as a measure of its performance. However there is a more complex reality for each organisation in accessing suitable resources for often frail older patients to improve care and capacity. Coupled with this is the need for pathways that identify these patients early in their admission and access the appropriate specialist care.  In 2018, 65% of this hospital's bed days were occupied by those whose hospital stay was greater than 14 days. Nationally this was 57%. We undertook to review processes locally around the care of older acute patients. Methods On the 20th November 2018 we conducted a chart audit of 85 in-patients who had been in the acute setting for more than 14 days. A proforma was completed for each patient by a doctor and multi-disciplinary team member. Results The length of stay ranged from 15 – 527 days with the median being 41 days. The average age was 76 years. A history of falls/dementia/""acopia"" was recorded on admission in 57%. The mean time for referral to MDT was 5 days. Social history was only documented in 47% of cases. Ward transfers was a significant issue with 69% moving wards at least once and 9% moving three times or more. A care planning meeting had not been held in 49% of cases. Over 17% of charts audited were awaiting home care package hours whilst 20% were awaiting long term care. In 62% of cases there was no ongoing medical reason keeping them in hospital and 56% of this cohort could have been cared for elsewhere. Conclusion Deficits in clear communication and appropriate timely planning for patients resulted in significant delays in discharge. The findings of our research informed a decision to conduct a root and branch analysis of discharge planning utilising the Lean Six Sigma model."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138865055&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		204	short,eimear	short	eimear
203	Health Promotion For Mild Frailty Based On Behaviour Change: Perceptions Of Older People And Service Providers.	2019	205	10.1111/hsc.12781			18	27	5	1333	Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home‐based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well‐being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=138203873&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	205	avgerinou,christina	avgerinou	christina
204	Gender Differences In Psychosocial Determinants Of Self-Perceived Health Among Portuguese Older Adults In Nursing Homes.	2019	206	10.1080/13607863.2018.1471583			96	23	8	1049	Objectives: Self-perceived health declines with age, varies by gender and is a predictor of mortality, morbidity, physical and psychological functioning. However, gender differences in health and illness perception are complex and not yet fully understood. This study aimed to explore gender-related differences in psychosocial determinants of self-perceived health among older adults living in nursing homes. Method: Nationwide face-to-face survey of the Portuguese population aged 65 and over. A representative sample of nursing homes residents was obtained through a multistage cluster random sampling of nursing homes, stratified by main Portuguese administrative regions (NUTS II). Results: Overall, 1186 nursing homes residents voluntarily enrolled in this study (participation rate, 93%) and a total of 515 participants (70.1% women) were considered to have adequate cognitive functioning to answer all questionnaires. A significant association between self-rated health and gender was found: 90.6% of all women (95% CI: 85.7—93.9) and 82.3% of all men (95% CI: 72.9—88.9) rated their health as less than good (p = 0.023). Gender-stratified analyses showed differences in psychosocial determinants of self-perceived health. While symptoms of depression and loneliness feelings were the major psychosocial determinants of poor self-perceived health among women, age and subjective financial well-being were the only determinants among men. Conclusion: Factors associated with perceived health, as representative of healthy ageing, were identified by gender, leading to future avenues for fruitful investigation. The acknowledgement of interpersonal and socioeconomic factors that determine the experience of ageing at a national level is crucial to improve the health of elders.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=137584514&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	96	Aging & Mental Health		206	alarcão,violeta	alarcão	violeta
205	When Frail Older People Relocate In Very Old Age, Who Makes The Decision?	2019	207	10.1093/geroni/igz030			207	3	4	N.PAG	"Background and Objectives Older people are likely to transition to a new home closer to family who can provide assistance or to long-term residential care as their health declines and their care needs increase. A minority choose to move to ""age-friendly"" housing before the onset of disability, but the majority prefer to ""age in place"" and defer moving until health crises compel a transition. Older people living with dementia are likely to move into residential care, but not much is known about the role they play in decision making around these moves. This qualitative study addresses this gap in knowledge by examining how a rare cohort of ""older old"" people, most with some level of cognitive impairment, were involved in decisions surrounding assistance seeking and moving to a care home. Research Design and Methods Thematic analysis of qualitative interview data from Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) study participants aged 95 years and older, who had moved in later life, and their proxy informants (n = 26). Results Moves at such an old age were made due to a complexity of push and pull factors which had layered dynamics of decision making. In most cases (n = 22), decision making involved other people with varying degrees of decision ownership. Only four older people, who moved voluntarily, had full ownership of the decision to move. Many relatives reported being traumatized by events leading up to the move. Discussion and Implications ""Older old"" people are sometimes unable to make their own decisions about moving due to the urgency of health crisis and cognitive decline. There is a need to support relatives to discuss moving and housing options at timely junctures before health crises intervene in an effort to optimize older people's participation in decision making."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=141055321&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	207	Innovation in Aging		207	scheibl,fiona	scheibl	fiona
206	The Role Of The Registered Nurse In Supporting Frailty In Care Homes.	2019	208	10.12968/bjon.2019.28.13.833			208	28	13	833	People in nursing and residential homes are more likely to suffer frailty. Registered nurses are a crucial component of the care delivery service and can offer support to patients who have complex care needs and comorbidities and are at risk of unplanned admissions to secondary care. This article explores frailty and the role of the nurse in assessing for frailty. Three aspects of patient care—nutrition status, polypharmacy and exercise and cognitive function—are discussed as areas where nurses can target their interventions in order to support those considered as frail, aiming to reduce the impact of frailty and negative health outcomes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=137473497&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:53	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	208	British Journal of Nursing	1	208	craig,lynn	craig	lynn

Translating complex dynamical systems theory to humans, dynamical indicators of resilience in postural balance time series may sensitively discriminate levels of resilience.<bold>Methods: </bold>This study investigated 240 high-functioning older adults (mean age 83.9 ± 2.9 years, 59% male), of whom 94 hikers of the Nijmegen Four Days Marches. Participants stood upright on a force plate with eyes open and feet at shoulder width for 30 seconds. Center of pressure data were analyzed for dynamical indicators of resilience (variance and temporal autocorrelation). After 1 year, participants were compared on a modified Successful Aging Index.<bold>Results: </bold>Mediolateral center of pressure displacement of hikers exhibited significantly lower variance (2.2 vs 2.8 mm, p < .001) and temporal autocorrelation (0.59 vs 0.65, p = .006), compared with nonhikers. Multivariably adjusted, mediolateral variance was significantly associated with successful aging at baseline (b = -1.43, p = .003) and 1-year follow-up (b = -1.94, p < .001), while mediolateral temporal autocorrelation was not.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Two dynamical indicators of resilience (variance and temporal autocorrelation) calculated on time series of mediolateral center of pressure displacement differed between hikers and nonhikers within a group of high-functioning older adults. In the whole group, variance was independently associated with successful aging at baseline and after 1 year. Our results support the hypothesis that resilience of older persons may be estimated from time series of natural fluctuations of bodily functions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=137057282&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		210	gijzel,sanne.m.w	gijzel	sanne.m.w
209	Medication Appropriateness In Vulnerable Older Adults: Healthy Skepticism Of Appropriate Polypharmacy.	2019	182	10.1111/jgs.15798			144	67	6	1123	"Older adults are prescribed a growing number of medications. Polypharmacy, commonly considered the receipt of five or more medications, is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. There is a debate about the reason(s) why. On one side is the assertion that older persons are being prescribed too many medications, with the number of medications increasing the risk of adverse events. On the other side is the observation that polypharmacy is associated both with overprescribing of inappropriate medications and underprescribing of appropriate medications. This leads to the concept of ""inappropriate"" vs ""appropriate"" polypharmacy, with the latter resulting from the prescription of many correct medications to persons with multiple chronic conditions. Few studies have examined the health outcomes associated with adding and/or removing medications to address this debate directly. The criteria used to identify underutilized medications are based on results of randomized controlled trials that may not be generalizable to older adults. Several randomized controlled trials and many more observational studies provide evidence that these criteria overestimate medication benefits and underestimate harms. In addition, evidence suggests that the marginal effects of medications added to an already complex regimen differ from their effects when considered individually. Although in selected circumstances adding medications results in benefit to patients, patients with multimorbidity and frailty/disability have susceptibilities that can decrease the likelihood of medication benefit and increase the likelihood of harms. The identification of appropriate polypharmacy requires more robust criteria to evaluate the net effects of complex medication regimens."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=136931906&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		182	fried,terri.r	fried	terri.r
210	Frailty And Multimorbidity: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.	2019	212	10.1093/gerona/gly110			210	74	5	659	<bold>Background: </bold>Multimorbidity and frailty are complex syndromes characteristics of aging. We reviewed the literature and provided pooled estimations of any evidence regarding (a) the coexistence of frailty and multimorbidity and (b) their association.<bold>Methods: </bold>We searched PubMed and Web of Science for relevant articles up to September 2017. Pooled estimates were obtained through random effect models and Mantel-Haenszel weighting. Homogeneity (I2), risk of bias, and publication bias were assessed. PROSPERO registration: 57890.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 48 studies involving 78,122 participants were selected, and 25 studies were included in one or more meta-analyses. Forty-five studies were cross-sectional and 3 longitudinal, with the majority of them including community-dwelling participants (n = 35). Forty-three studies presented a moderate risk of bias and five a low risk. Most of the articles defined multimorbidity as having two or more diseases and frailty according to the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. In meta-analyses, the prevalence of multimorbidity in frail individual was 72% (95% confidence interval = 63%-81%; I2 = 91.3%), and the prevalence of frailty among multimorbid individuals was 16% (95% confidence interval = 12%-21%; I2 = 96.5%). Multimorbidity was associated with frailty in pooled analyses (odds ratio = 2.27; 95% confidence interval = 1.97-2.62; I2 = 47.7%). The three longitudinal studies suggest a bidirectional association between multimorbidity and frailty.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Frailty and multimorbidity are two related conditions in older adults. Most frail individuals are also multimorbid, but fewer multimorbid ones also present frailty. Our findings are not conclusive regarding the causal association between the two conditions. Further longitudinal and well-designed studies may help to untangle the relationship between frailty and multimorbidity.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=136019167&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		212	joint,action.advantage.wp4.group	joint	action.advantage.wp4.group
211	Frailty Is Inversely Related To Age At Menopause And Elevated In Women Who Have Had A Hysterectomy: An Analysis Of The Canadian Longitudinal Study On Aging.	2019	213	10.1093/gerona/gly092			210	74	5	675	<bold>Background: </bold>Frailty is a complex pathophysiological phenomenon that will impact a significant proportion of adults over the age of 65 and contributes to the risk of several adverse health outcomes. Although women have a disproportionately higher risk of frailty, the sex-specific factors related to this syndrome are not well described. Hence, we sought to examine the relationship of age at menopause, hysterectomy status, and hormone replacement therapy use with prevalent frailty in older women.<bold>Methods: </bold>We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) Baseline Comprehensive Cohort (n = 30,097, 45-85 years old). Frailty was operationalized using both the deficit accumulation (frailty index) and frailty phenotype (Fried) models. Postmenopausal women were categorized as follows: premature (30-39 years), early (40-45 years), normal (46-54 years), and late (55+ years) menopause, or hysterectomy. Associations were determined using multivariate analysis, adjusting for sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, social support, and hormone replacement therapy use.<bold>Results: </bold>Age at menopause was inversely related to frailty in older Canadian women. The frailty index decreased 1.2% of the mean (p < .001) with every year of menopause onset and was significantly higher for women in the premature (24%; p < .001) and early (7%; p < .01) menopause and hysterectomy (21%; p < .001) groups, compared to the normal menopause group. The odds for being classified as frail using Fried's criteria was higher for the premature menopause (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.72-2.27) and hysterectomy (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.25-2.02) groups.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Our study supports a role for age at menopause and hysterectomy in the risk of frailty in older women and warrants further investigation.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=136019169&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		213	verschoor,chris.p	verschoor	chris.p
212	Heterogeneous Health Profiles And Healthcare Utilization Of The Middle-Aged And Elderly With Multiple Health Insurance Schemes In China.	2019	214	10.1016/j.puhe.2019.01.011			214	170		61	China is facing an escalating demand of healthcare services from the middle-aged and elderly. Compared with the traditional view of health on symptoms and diseases, this study aimed to assess the heterogeneous health profiles of middle-aged and elderly Chinese by a person-centered approach. Furthermore, this study examined the effects of health profiles and associated factors on healthcare utilization within the context of China's multiple health insurance schemes. The study used the 2015 data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationwide population-based sample of people aged 45 years and older. Latent class analysis (LCA) was adopted to identify the heterogeneous health profiles. Two-part models were adopted to assess the effects of associated factors on healthcare utilization. Among 15,250 Chinese aged 45 years and older, six heterogeneous health profiles were identified and labeled as 'Quite Healthy', 'Relatively Healthy', 'Comprehensive Comorbidities', 'Functional Impairment', 'Severe Disability', and 'Relatively Frail'. The Relatively Frail profile was the heaviest healthcare user. The Severe Disability profile took the least use of outpatient services but had relatively high utilization of inpatient services and outpatient expenditure. The Comprehensive Comorbidities profile tended to have the smallest effect on the frequency of visits for both inpatient and outpatient services, but its effect on outpatient expenditure was high. After controlling for health profiles, the significant effects of different health insurance programs on healthcare utilization were discussed. Introducing health profiles by the person-centered approach of LCA has provided a holistic understanding of complex healthcare demands for middle-aged and elderly Chinese. It is valuable for policy makers to improve healthcare resource allocation targeted for the middle-aged and elderly. • Heterogeneous health profiles were assessed by a person-centered approach. • Six health profiles for middle-aged and elderly Chinese were identified. • How health profiles and other factors impact healthcare utilization was evaluated. • Significant effects of different health insurance were evaluated by controlling health profiles.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=136539198&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	214	Public Health (Elsevier)		214	ye,l	ye	l
213	Evidence‐Based Diabetes Care For Older People With Type 2 Diabetes: A Critical Review.	2019	215	10.1111/dme.13859			215	36	4	399	In our ageing society diabetes imposes a significant burden in terms of the numbers of people with the condition, diabetes‐related complications including disability, and health and social care expenditure. Older people with diabetes can represent some of the more complex and difficult challenges facing the clinician working in different settings, and the recognition that we have only a relatively small (but increasing) evidence base to guide us in diabetes management is a limitation of our current approaches. Nevertheless, in this review we attempt to explore what evidence there is to guide us in a comprehensive scheme of treatment for older adults, often in a high‐risk clinical state, in terms of glucose lowering, blood pressure and lipid management, frailty care and lifestyle interventions. We strive towards individualized care and make a call for action for more high‐quality research using different trial designs. What's new?: This review represents a modern, up‐to‐date account of published evidence that seeks to examine the significance of previous research relating to the management of diabetes in older people.The review also provides a diagrammatic view of the development of the complex illness scenarios seen in ageing people with diabetes, and provides the first detailed algorithm for developing individualized care programmes in this often vulnerable group.The evidence review takes us through glucose‐lowering trials involving older people, a discussion of important cardiovascular outcome and safety trials relevant to the elderly, in addition to a discussion of insulin therapy, lifestyle interventions and managing frailty.This review concludes with a call to action to promote new research in older adults with diabetes with the hope of optimizing clinical outcomes in the future.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=135187597&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	215	Diabetic Medicine		215	sinclair,a.j	sinclair	a.j
214	Systolic Blood Pressure And Cognitive Decline In Older Adults With Hypertension.	2019	216	10.1370/afm.2367			216	17	2	100	<bold>Purpose: </bold>Hypertension trials often exclude patients with complex health problems and lack generalizability. We aimed to determine if systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients undergoing antihypertensive treatment is associated with 1-year changes in cognitive/daily functioning or quality of life (QoL) in persons aged ≥75 years with or without complex health problems.<bold>Methods: </bold>We analyzed data from a population-based prospective cohort study (Integrated Systematic Care for Older Persons [ISCOPE]) with a 1-year follow-up. Stratified by SBP level in the year before baseline, we used mixed-effects linear regression models to evaluate the change from baseline to 1-year follow-up in outcome measures (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], Groningen Activity Restriction Scale [GARS], and EQ-5D-3L). We adjusted for age, sex, and baseline MMSE/GARS/EQ-5D-3L scores and stratified for complex health problems as a proxy for frailty.<bold>Results: </bold>Participant (n = 1,266) age averaged 82.4 (SD 5) years, and 874 (69%) were women. For participants undergoing antihypertensive therapy (1,057; 83.5%) and with SBP <130 mm Hg, crude cognitive decline was 0.90 points MMSE, whereas in those with SBP >150 mm Hg, it was 0.14 points MMSE (ie, 0.76-point less decline; P for trend = .013). Complex health problems modified the association of SBP with cognition; the association was seen in those with antihypertensive treatment (P for trend <.001), not in those without (P for trend = .13). Daily functioning/QoL did not differ across the strata of SBP or antihypertensive treatment.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Participants aged ≥75 years undergoing antihypertensive treatment, with SBP ≥130 mm Hg compared to <130 mm Hg, showed less cognitive decline after 1 year, without loss of daily functioning or QoL. This effect was strongest in participants with complex health problems. More studies should be conducted to determine if there is a causal relation and to understand the mechanism of the association observed.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=135317993&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	216	Annals of Family Medicine		216	streit,sven	streit	sven
215	The (Cost‐)Effectiveness Of Preventive, Integrated Care For Community‐Dwelling Frail Older People: A Systematic Review.	2019	217	10.1111/hsc.12571			18	27	1	1	Integrated care is increasingly promoted as an effective and cost‐effective way to organise care for community‐dwelling frail older people with complex problems but the question remains whether high expectations are justified. Our study aims to systematically review the empirical evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for community‐dwelling frail older people and close attention is paid to the elements and levels of integration of the interventions. We searched nine databases for eligible studies until May 2016 with a comparison group and reporting at least one outcome regarding effectiveness or cost‐effectiveness. We identified 2,998 unique records and, after exclusions, selected 46 studies on 29 interventions. We assessed the quality of the included studies with the Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk‐of‐bias tool. The interventions were described following Rainbow Model of Integrated Care framework by Valentijn. Our systematic review reveals that the majority of the reported outcomes in the studies on preventive, integrated care show no effects. In terms of health outcomes, effectiveness is demonstrated most often for seldom‐reported outcomes such as well‐being. Outcomes regarding informal caregivers and professionals are rarely considered and negligible. Most promising are the care process outcomes that did improve for preventive, integrated care interventions as compared to usual care. Healthcare utilisation was the most reported outcome but we found mixed results. Evidence for cost‐effectiveness is limited. High expectations should be tempered given this limited and fragmented evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for frail older people. Future research should focus on unravelling the heterogeneity of frailty and on exploring what outcomes among frail older people may realistically be expected.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=133318670&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	217	looman,wilhelmina.mijntje	looman	wilhelmina.mijntje
216	Putting Complex Older Persons First: How The Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services 2019 Payment Proposal Fails Older Americans.	2019	220	10.1111/jgs.15651			144	67	1	145	In July 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its proposed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rule for calendar year 2019 (MPFS2019). The proposal sets forth CMS‐recommended updates to Medicare payment policies, payment rates, and quality provisions for services provided in the next calendar year. From year to year, the rule also can serve as a vehicle for soliciting input on new payment proposals and changes to existing policies. Among the payment and quality proposals in the MPFS2019 proposal, CMS proposed extensive changes to Current Procedural Terminology codes that are the framework for documentation and payment for office‐based evaluation and management (E/M) services. The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) believes the proposed payment methodology changes for E/M services would have had a significant negative impact on care for older Americans. On September 10, 2018, the AGS submitted its comments on this proposal and other aspects of the rule, and the AGS also submitted a comment letter signed by 41 organizations from an AGS‐led multispecialty coalition. The coalition also worked collaboratively on outreach to Congress, which included visits to Capitol Hill and a coalition letter stressing our collective support for reducing the burden of documentation for clinicians and our opposition to the proposed changes in payment methodology. In all letters, we noted that the AGS and members of our coalition hoped to work collaboratively with CMS and other stakeholders to develop a refined approach that would achieve the best possible outcomes for patients, particularly frail older Americans with multiple chronic conditions. In releasing their final MPFS2019, CMS postponed the E/M coding collapse for at least two years, a decision that speaks to the hard work of the AGS, its members, and the multi‐specialty coalition, and which opens the door for further discussions about the future of payment for E/M services so critical to older people.

217	Tools For Deprescribing In Frail Older Persons And Those With Limited Life Expectancy: A Systematic Review.	2019	221	10.1111/jgs.15616			144	67	1	172	OBJECTIVES To summarize available tools that can assist clinicians in identifying and reducing or stopping (deprescribing) potentially inappropriate medications and that specifically consider frailty or limited life expectancy. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. SETTING We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL from inception to December 2017, along with grey literature. We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications. PARTICIPANTS Frail older persons and older persons with limited life expectancy. MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of tools. RESULTS: We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medication‐specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, step‐wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in very low‐quality studies). CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use.

218	Geriatric Assessment In Clinical Practice For Patients With Stage Iv Non‐Small‐Cell Lung Cancer: The Grup De Investigació I Divulgació Oncològica Experience.	2018	223	10.1111/ecc.12950			223	27	6	N.PAG	Therapeutic decision‐making for older patients with stage IV non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no identifiable activating mutation is complex. In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of geriatric assessment (GA) in identifying frail patients. Stage IV NSCLC patients ≥70 years of age were evaluated with GA and classified according to this evaluation into three different groups: fit, vulnerable and frail. Classifications based on GA, treatment decision, toxicity and overall survival were analysed. In total, 93 patients were included. Median age was 76 (70–92) years and 90% were men. Most patients had performance status (PS) 0 or 1 (82%), unrelated to their GA (p = 0.006). GA groups were associated with overall survival (p = 0.000), treatment decision (p = 0.0001), and toxicity (p = 0.0001). Chemotherapy was delivered to 100% of fit patients, to 48% of vulnerable patients, and to only 8% of frail patients (p = 0.000). Toxicity was higher in vulnerable patients than in fit individuals (p = 0.000). Multivariable analysis showed PS (p = 0.001), active treatment (p < 0.001) and GA group (p = 0.001) to be prognostic factors related to survival. Our results suggest that GA identified patients with poor natural prognosis.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=133260613&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	3	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	223	European Journal of Cancer Care	1	223	gironés,regina	gironés	regina
219	Spousal Caregivers' Experiences Of Participation In Everyday Life When Living In Shifting Contexts.	2018	224	10.1080/11038128.2017.1337810			224	25	6	457	Background: To promote health and well-being, and to meet the desires of the growing elderly population to age in place, elderly spousal caregivers need adequate support such as respite care services. More knowledge is needed about elderly spousal caregivers' experiences in relation to participation, which is an aspect of health that remains relatively unexplored for this group. Aim: To explore and describe how elderly spousal caregivers experience and discuss participation in everyday life when living in shifting contexts due to the use of respite care. Method: A grounded theory approach was used during data generation and analysis, which involved repeated focus group interviews with 12 spousal caregivers. Results: Complexity and ambiguity was understood to imbue participation in everyday life. Being in charge of everyday life was challenging for spousal caregivers, and created a need for personal time. Respite care and home care service gave them time, although when interacting with social contexts other issues arose that influenced their own recovery. Conclusions: A holistic 'situation centered' approach that focuses on the elderly couple's life story and needs might capture a wider perspective and enable adequate support that influences their health, well-being, and participation in everyday life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=134622354&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	224	Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy		224	riekkola,carabante.jenni	riekkola	carabante.jenni
220	An International Perspective On Chronic Multimorbidity: Approaching The Elephant In The Room.	2018	225	10.1093/gerona/glx178			210	73	10	1350	Multimorbidity is a common and burdensome condition that may affect quality of life, increase medical needs, and make people live more years of life with disability. Negative outcomes related to multimorbidity occur beyond what we would expect from the summed effect of single conditions, as chronic diseases interact with each other, mutually enhancing their negative effects, and eventually leading to new clinical phenotypes. Moreover, multimorbidity mirrors an accelerated global susceptibility and a loss of resilience, which are both hallmarks of aging. Due to the complexity of its assessment and definition, and the lack of clear evidence steering its management, multimorbidity represents one of the main current challenges for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The authors of this article recently reflected on these issues during two twin international symposia at the 2016 European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS) meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, and the 2016 Gerontological Society of America (GSA) meeting in New Orleans, USA. The present work summarizes the most relevant aspects related to multimorbidity, with the ultimate goal to identify knowledge gaps and suggest future directions to approach this condition.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=131785319&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		225	vetrano,davide.l	vetrano	davide.l

Main outcome activities of daily living, i.e. a change on modified Katz-15 scale between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes quality of life (visual analogue scale 0–10), psychological (mental well-being scale Short Form Health Survey (SF)-36) and social well-being (single item, SF-36), quality-adjusted life years (Euroqol-5dimensions-3level (EQ-5D-3L)), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness. Analysis intention-to-treat analysis, two-stage IPD and subgroup analysis based on patient and intervention characteristics. Results included were 8,678 participants: median age of 80.5 (interquartile range 75.3; 85.7) years; 5,496 (63.3%) women. On the modified Katz-15 scale, the pooled difference in change between the intervention and control group was −0.01 (95% confidence interval −0.10 to 0.08). No significant differences were found in the other patient outcomes or subgroup analyses. Compared to usual care, the probability of the intervention group to be cost-effective was less than 5%. Conclusion compared to usual care at 1-year follow-up, strategies for identification of frail older people in primary care combined with a proactive integrated care intervention are probably not (cost-) effective.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=131429241&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		227	blom,j.w	blom	j.w
223	Motor-Cognitive Effects Of A Computerized Game-Based Training Method In People With Dementia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	2018	228	10.1080/13607863.2017.1348472			96	22	9	1124	Objectives: To examine the effects of a computerized, game-based training on motor-cognitive performances, the transfer of training effects on untrained tasks, and the sustainability of training gains in people with dementia. Method: Ninety-nine individuals with a mean age of 82.9 (5.8) and dementia participated in a 10-week randomized controlled trial with three-month follow-up. The intervention group (IG) received a motor-cognitive training on (Physiomat®) including concurrent dual-tasks of balance control with cognitive demands (Physiomat®-Trail Making Tasks (PTMTs)). The control group (CG) performed non-specific, low-intensity exercises. Duration and accuracy at different complexity levels of trained and untrained PTMTs and the number of successfully performed tasks (PTMT score) were assessed. Results: Physiomat® training significantly improved the duration and accuracy at almost all complexity levels of trained (P ≤ 0.001-0.047, ηp2 = 0.065-0.589) and untrained PTMTs (P < 0.001-0.005, ηp2 = 0.073-0.459). Significant effects were also found for the PTMT score of trained (P < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.211) and untrained PTMTs (P < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.184). Training gains were partly sustained at follow-up. Conclusion: Physiomat® is feasible and has the potential to sustainably improve motor-cognitive performances in people with dementia.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=132729048&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	96	Aging & Mental Health		228	wiloth,stefanie	wiloth	stefanie
224	Appropriateness Of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Prescription And Its Associated Factors In Hospitalized Older People With Atrial Fibrillation.	2018	229	10.1111/bcp.13631			229	84	9	2010	Aims: Although oral anticoagulants (OACs) are effective in preventing stroke in older people with atrial fibrillation (AF), they are often underused in this particularly high‐risk population. The aim of the present study was to assess the appropriateness of OAC prescription and its associated factors in hospitalized patients aged 65 years or older. Methods: Data were obtained from the retrospective phase of Simulation‐based Technologies to Improve the Appropriate Use of Oral Anticoagulants in Hospitalized Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (SIM‐AF) study, held in 32 Italian internal medicine and geriatric wards. The appropriateness of OAC prescription was assessed, grouping patients in those who were and were not prescribed OACs at hospital discharge. Multivariable logistic regression was used to establish factors independently associated with the appropriateness of OAC prescription. Results: A total of 328 patients were included in the retrospective phase of the study. Of these, almost 44% (N = 143) were inappropriately prescribed OACs, being mainly underprescribed or prescribed an inappropriate antithrombotic drug (N = 88). Among the patients prescribed OACs (N = 221), errors in the prescribed doses were the most frequent cause of inappropriate use (N = 55). Factors associated with a higher degree of patient frailty were inversely associated with the appropriateness of OAC prescription. Conclusions: In hospitalized older patients with AF, there is still a high prevalence of inappropriate OAC prescribing. Characteristics usually related to frailty are associated with the inappropriate prescribing. These findings point to the need for targeted interventions designed for internists and geriatricians, aimed at improving the appropriate prescribing of OACs in this complex and high‐risk population.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=131218834&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	229	British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology		229	franchi,carlotta	franchi	carlotta
225	Failing To Meet The Needs Of Generations Of Care Home Residents With Diabetes: A Review Of The Literature And A Call For Action.	2018	215	10.1111/dme.13702			215	35	9	1144	Abstract: In residential care homes and aged‐care facilities globally, between one in three and one in four residents may have diabetes, an often complex highly co‐morbid illness that leads to frailty, dependency, disability and reduced life expectancy. Residents with diabetes also have a high risk of hypoglycaemia, avoidable hospital admissions, and represent one of the most difficult challenges to health professionals and care staff in optimizing their diabetes and medical care. This detailed review examines the literature relating to care home diabetes over the last 25 years to assess what has been achieved in characterizing residents with diabetes, and what we know about the various but limited intervention studies that have been carried out internationally. The guidance and guidelines that have been published to assist clinicians in planning effective and safe care for this rather vulnerable group of people with diabetes are also reviewed. The review presents the first diagrammatic representation of a likely physiological cascade depicting the mainly irreversible functional decline a resident with diabetes might experience, provides modern principles of care for each resident with diabetes, and identifies what priority recommendations are required to be implemented if diabetes care is to improve. The review concludes that action is required since diabetes care still remains fragmented, sub‐optimal, and in need of investment, otherwise care home residents with diabetes will continue to have their needs unfulfilled.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=131152737&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	215	Diabetic Medicine		215	sinclair,a.j	sinclair	a.j
226	Is Hospitalisation Necessary? A Survey Of Frail Older Persons With Cognitive Impairment Transferred From Nursing Homes To The Emergency Department.	2018	232	10.1111/scs.12559			170	32	3	1138	Background: Providing care for frail older persons is complex and demanding, and the transfer of older persons with cognitive impairment to the emergency department is associated with a high risk of them developing complications. Aim: To survey the most ill and frail older persons with cognitive impairment who were transferred from nursing homes to the emergency department, considering reasons for referral, symptoms and actions taken at the hospital. Method: A retrospective descriptive survey, conducting a review of 588 referral notes and medical records, analysed and presented with descriptive statistics and visualised with typical case narratives. Findings: The persons who were transferred to the emergency department were frail with complex symptomology. When reviewing the medical records in the light of criteria for avoidable hospitalisation, 75% of the patients could have been examined and treated at the nursing homes or in primary care. Conclusion: Frail older persons with cognitive impairment, who are in need of end‐of‐life care, should be prevented from unnecessary hospitalisation. The majority of these transfers to the emergency department can be avoided if there is better planning beforehand, more specially trained nurses in elderly care in the municipalities, and more physicians making house calls.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=131976747&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	3	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	232	björck,maria	björck	maria

228	The Relationship Between Frailty And Polypharmacy In Older People: A Systematic Review.	2018	234	10.1111/bcp.13590			229	84	7	1432	Aims: Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome resulting in decreased physiological reserves. Frailty and polypharmacy are common in older adults and the focus of extensive studies, although little is known about the impact they may have on each other. This is the first systematic review analysing the available evidence on the relationship between frailty and polypharmacy in older adults. Methods: Systematic review of quantitative studies. A comprehensive literature search for publications in English or Spanish was performed on MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database and PsycINFO in September 2017 without applying restrictions on the date of publication. Studies reporting any relationship between frailty and polypharmacy in older adults were considered. Results: A total of 25 publications were included, all of them observational studies. Evaluation of Fried's frailty criteria was the most common approach, followed by the Edmonton Frail Scale and FRAIL scale. Sixteen of 18 cross‐sectional analyses and five of seven longitudinal analyses demonstrated a significant association between an increased number of medications and frailty. The causal relationship is unclear and appears to be bidirectional. Our analysis of published data suggests that polypharmacy could be a major contributor to the development of frailty. Conclusions: A reduction of polypharmacy could be a cautious strategy to prevent and manage frailty. Further research is needed to confirm the possible benefits of reducing polypharmacy in the development, reversion or delay of frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=130228967&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	229	British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology		234	gutiérrez‐valencia,m	gutiérrez‐valencia	m
229	Interdisciplinary Home Visits For Individuals With Advanced Parkinson'S Disease And Related Disorders.	2018	235	10.1111/jgs.15337			144	66	6	1226	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisymptom, neurodegenerative disease affecting primarily older adults. With progression, many individuals become homebound and removed from coordinated, expert care, resulting in excess morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures in acute care settings and institutions. Home visit care models have achieved the triple aim of improving individual and population health while reducing costs in many frail, community‐dwelling geriatric cohorts. This study details a novel, interdisciplinary home visit program specifically designed for individuals with PD and related disorders and their family caregivers built upon best practice principles in the care of multimorbid older adults. At each quarterly home visit, a movement disorders–trained neurologist, social worker, and nurse work in parallel with the individual and caregiver to complete a history, physical, detailed medication reconciliation, psychosocial needs assessment, and home safety assessment. A comprehensive, person‐centered plan is agreed upon, referrals to community resources are made, standardized documentation is shared, and follow‐up communication is instituted. In the first 2 years, 272 visits were conducted with 85 individuals who represent one of the oldest, most disabled PD populations reported. Satisfaction with and retention in the program were high. This study represents the first translation of the success of interdisciplinary and home‐based geriatric care models to a population with a specific neurological disease. Preliminary evidence supports the need for such programs in vulnerable populations. Future studies will prospectively assess person‐centered outcomes, the effect of using telemedicine on sustainability, and cost effectiveness.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=130769841&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		235	fleisher,jori	fleisher	jori
230	The Relationships Between Depressive Symptoms, Functional Health Status, Physical Activity, And The Availability Of Recreational Facilities: A Rural-Urban Comparison In Middle-Aged And Older Chinese Adults.	2018	236	10.1007/s12529-018-9714-3			236	25	3	322	Purpose: This study drew upon the ecological system theory to demonstrate rural-urban differences in the relationships between the availability of recreational facilities, physical activity (PA), functional health status, and depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older Chinese adults.Methods: Nationally representative data (n = 5949) from the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2013) were examined using the multigroup structural equation modeling approach.Results: The results suggest that higher availability of recreational facilities in the urban communities was associated with higher levels of leisure time physical activity (LTPA), better functional capacity, and less occurrence of depressive symptoms among urban participants. In contrast, LTPA engagement among rural participants was low and had negligible mitigating effects on functional decline and depressive symptoms. The findings also show that functional health status mediated the association between total PA and depressive symptoms in both rural and urban participants. However, high levels of total PA were directly associated with elevated depressive symptoms, suggesting that the context of PA and related socioeconomic factors might explain this association after the non-LTPA components were included.Conclusions: The findings highlight how complex patterns of intrapersonal, behavioral, and environmental correlates influence depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. The context of PA should be considered when creating targeted strategies to prevent depressive symptoms. As an inactive lifestyle evolves with China’s rapid urbanization, joint efforts from public health and urban planning should be made to promote LTPA and develop active living communities for achieving optimal health in later life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=129628640&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	236	International Journal of Behavioral Medicine		236	deng,yazhuo	deng	yazhuo
231	The Use Of Case Management For Community‐Dwelling Older People: The Effects On Loneliness, Symptoms Of Depression And Life Satisfaction In A Randomised Controlled Trial.	2018	237	10.1111/scs.12520			170	32	2	889	Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community‐dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=130361902&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	237	taube,elin	taube	elin
232	Rational Suicide In Elderly Adults: A Clinician'S Perspective.	2018	238	10.1111/jgs.15263			144	66	5	998	Geriatricians are increasingly encountering older adults expressing suicidal wishes in the absence of overt mental illness. This is expected to grow as life expectancy increases. This article describes the case of an older adult who expressed the wish to end his life in the absence of a diagnosable mental illness. Although he had chronic medical illnesses, he was not terminally ill. The complex subject of rational suicide in elderly adults is approached from a clinician's perspective. Issues of ageism, gerontophobia, and changing perspectives on death are highlighted. The experience of being a Baby Boomer and its influence on rational suicide is reviewed. Finally, clinical topics such as aging, frailty, dependence on younger and healthier individuals, and the older adult's need for a sense of control are explored.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=129891484&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		238	balasubramaniam,meera	balasubramaniam	meera
233	Geriatric Oral And Maxillofacial Dysfunctions In The Context Of Geriatric Syndrome.	2018	239	10.1111/odi.12647			239	24	3	317	Objectives: To propose the application of the concept of geriatric syndrome for common geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions and to suggest the necessity of developing effective evaluation methods for oral and maxillofacial frailty. Design: The concepts of frailty and geriatric syndrome based on multi‐morbidity and polypharmacy were applied to five common geriatric oral medicinal dysfunctional problems: salivary gland hypofunction (dry mouth), chronic oral mucosal pain disorders (burning mouth symptoms), taste disorders (taste disturbances), swallowing disorders (dysphagia), and oral and maxillofacial movement disorders (oromandibular dyskinesia and dystonia). Results: Each of the dysfunctions is caused by various kinds of diseases and/or conditions and medications, thus the concept of geriatric syndrome could be applied. These dysfunctions, suggested as components of oral and maxillofacial geriatric syndrome, are associated and interacted with each other in a complexity of vicious cycle. The resulting functional impairments caused by this syndrome can cause oral and maxillofacial frailty. Conclusions: Geriatric oral and maxillofacial dysfunctions could be better appreciated in the context of geriatric syndrome. The development of effective methods for evaluating the severity of these dysfunctions and the resulting frailty is essential.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=128483337&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	239	Oral Diseases		239	nam,y	nam	y

235	Improving Patient Safety For Older People In Acute Admissions: Implementation Of The Frailsafe Checklist In 12 Hospitals Across The Uk.	2018	241	10.1093/ageing/afx194			161	47	2	311	Background: checklists are increasingly proposed as a means to enhance safety and quality of care. However, their use has been met with variable levels of success. The Frailsafe project focused on introducing a checklist with the aim to increase completion of key clinical assessments and to facilitate communication for the care of older patients in acute admissions. Objectives: to examine the use of the Frailsafe checklist, including potential to contribute to improved safety, quality and reliability of care. Methods: 110 qualitative interviews and group discussions with healthcare professionals and other specialties, 172 h of ethnographic observation in 12 UK hospitals and reporting of high-level process data (completion of checklist and relevant frailty assessments). Qualitative analysis followed a thematic and theory-driven approach. Results: through use of the checklist, hospital teams identified limitations in their existing assessments (e.g. absence of delirium protocols) and practices (e.g. unnecessary catheter use). This contributed to hospitals reporting just 24.0% of sampled patients as having received all clinical assessments across key domains for this population for the duration of the project (1,687/7,021 checklists as fully completed). Staff perceptions and experiences of using the checklist varied significantly, primarily driven by the extent to which the aims of this quality improvement project aligned with local service priorities and pre-existing team communications styles. Conclusions: the Frailsafe checklist highlighted limitations with frailty assessment in acute care and motivated teams to review routine practices. Further work is needed to understand whether and how checklists can be embedded in complex, multidisciplinary care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=128159192&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		241	papoutsi,chrysanthi	papoutsi	chrysanthi
236	Gender Differences In The Incidence And Determinants Of Components Of The Frailty Phenotype Among Older Adults: Findings From The Sabe Study.	2018	242	10.1177/0898264316671228			242	30	2	190	Objective: To analyze gender differences in incidence and determinants of the components of the frailty phenotype. Method: A total of 1,413 older adults were selected in 2006. To estimate the incidence of each frailty component, only individuals who did not exhibit a given component at baseline (independently of the presence of other components) were included in the study. The variables of interest were socioeconomic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric factors and physical performance. The incidence of each component in 2010 was the outcome. Results: Unintentional weight loss and slowness were more incident in men up to 74 years of age. The other frailty components were more incident in women at all age groups, except weakness. Besides age, the determinants of incidence of the components of frailty were different between genders. Discussion: Strategies for preventing or delaying the installation of frailty need to address gender differences, considering the greater complexity in the network determinants among women.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=127118166&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	242	Journal of Aging & Health		242	alexandre,tiago.da.s	alexandre	tiago.da.s
237	Multimorbidity: Will It Stand The Test Of Time?	2018	243	10.1093/ageing/afx159			161	47	1	6	The concept of multimorbidity has risen in popularity over the past few years. Its use has led to, or coincided with, an increased recognition that patients often have more than one health problem which should not be treated in isolation. The motivation for more holistic, person-centred care that lies behind multimorbidity is to be welcomed. The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence multimorbidity management guideline helpfully makes recommendations in key areas that are important in the care of patients with complicated medical problems. However, we question the sustainability of the term for the following four reasons: (i) it is doctor and researcher centred rather than patient centred, focusing upon the number of diagnoses rather than the patient's lived experience, (ii) it is not a positive term for patients and is at odds with the move towards promoting active and healthy ageing, (iii) its non-specific nature means it holds little value in daily clinical practice and (iv) most definitions apply to a large segment of the population making it of limited use for health care planners. We argue that the complementary concepts of complexity and frailty would fit better with the delivery of patient centred care for people with multiple co-existing health problems and would be more useful to clinicians, commissioners and researchers.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=127189162&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		243	ford,joanna.c	ford	joanna.c
238	Simple Method Of Screening For Frailty In Older Adults Using A Chronometer And Tape Measure In Clinic.	2018	244	10.1111/jgs.15204			144	66	1	157	Objectives: Detecting frailty in older adults scheduled for surgery is important to predict the occurrence of adverse outcomes, but because of its complexity, frailty screening is not commonly performed. The objective of the current study was to assess whether frailty can be screened for using automatically measured usual gait speed (UGS) and mid‐arm circumference (MAC) in the outpatient clinic. Design: Prospective, cross‐sectional study. Setting: Geriatric center of a tertiary hospital. Participants: Outpatients aged 65 and older (N = 113). Measurements: Frailty status was evaluated according to a multidimensional frailty score (MFS) using a comprehensive geriatric assessment, and participants were classified into 5 categories. UGS was evaluated by having participants walk through the clinic using an automated laser‐gated chronometer. MAC was recorded using a tape measure on a blood pressure cuff. Correlations between these two physical measurements and MFS were assessed. Results: The mean age of the 93 participants who successfully underwent UGS evaluation was 75.8 ± 4.7; 35 were male. In this population, the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2.2 ± 1.4, mean MFS was 4.1 ± 2.0, and 20 participants were considered to be at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Mean UGS was 0.75 ± 0.16 m/s, and mean MAC was 31.2 ± 1.9 cm); both physical parameters were correlated with MFS (UGS: standardized beta = −0.420, <italic>P</italic> < .001; MAC: standardized beta = −0.457, <italic>P</italic> < .001). Using UGS and MFS, the area under curve of receiver operating curve for determining which participants were at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes was 0.809 (<italic>P</italic> < .001). Conclusion: UGS and MAC are viable methods of clinically screening for frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=127501174&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		244	jung,hee‐won	jung	hee‐won
239	Self-Perceived Coping Resources Of Middle-Aged And Older Adults – Results Of A Large Population-Based Study.	2017	245	10.1080/13607863.2016.1220918			96	21	12	1303	Objectives:Psychosocial resources (personal resources, social resources, and other) are important for coping with aging and impairment. The aim of this study was to describe the resources of older adults and to compare subgroups with frailty, complex health care needs, and/or mental disorders. Method:At the third follow-up of the large population-based German ESTHER study, 3124 elderly persons (aged 55–85) were included. Psychosocial resources were assessed during a home visit by trained study doctors by using a list of 26 different items. Resources were described for the total group, separated by sex, and for the three subgroups of persons with frailty, complex health care needs, and mental disorders. Results:Family, self-efficacy, and financial security were the most frequently reported resources of older adults. Women and men showed significant differences in their self-perceived resources. Personal resources (self-efficacy, optimism, mastery), social resources, and financial security were reported significantly less frequently by frail persons, persons with complex health care needs, and mentally ill older adults compared to non-impaired participants. Apart from external support, patients who experienced complex health care needs reported resources less frequently compared to frail and mentally ill patients. Conclusion:Coping resources in older adults are associated with sex and impairment. Evaluation and support of personal resources of frail or mentally ill persons or individuals with complex health care needs should be integrated in the therapeutic process.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=125434435&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	96	Aging & Mental Health		245	boehlen,friederike.h	boehlen	friederike.h
240	New Horizons In Multimorbidity In Older Adults.	2017	246	10.1093/ageing/afx150			161	46	6	882	The concept of multimorbidity has attracted growing interest over recent years, and more latterly with the publication of specific guidelines on multimorbidity by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Increasingly it is recognised that this is of particular relevance to practitioners caring for older adults, where multimorbidity may be more complex due to the overlap of physical and mental health disorders, frailty and polypharmacy. The overlap of frailty and multimorbidity in particular is likely to be due to the widespread health deficit accumulation, leading in some cases to functional impairment. The NICE guidelines identify 'target groups' who may benefit from a tailored approach to care that takes their multimorbidity into account, and make a number of research recommendations. Management includes a proactive individualised assessment and care plan, which improves quality of life by reducing treatment burden, adverse events, and unplanned or uncoordinated care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=125888827&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		246	yarnall,alison.j	yarnall	alison.j
241	Concentration Of Potentially Preventable Spending Among High-Cost Medicare Subpopulations: An Observational Study.	2017	247	10.7326/M17-0767			247	167	8	N.PAG	"<bold>Background: </bold>Little is known about whether potentially preventable spending is concentrated among a subset of high-cost Medicare beneficiaries.<bold>Objective: </bold>To determine the proportion of total spending that is potentially preventable across distinct subpopulations of high-cost Medicare beneficiaries.<bold>Design: </bold>Beneficiaries in the highest 10% of total standardized individual spending were defined as ""high-cost"" patients, using a 20% sample of Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2012. The following 6 subpopulations were defined using a claims-based algorithm: nonelderly disabled, frail elderly, major complex chronic, minor complex chronic, simple chronic, and relatively healthy. Potentially preventable spending was calculated by summing costs for avoidable emergency department visits using the Billings algorithm plus inpatient and associated 30-day postacute costs for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs).

242	Big 'G' And Little 'G' Geriatrics Education For Physicians.	2017	248	10.1111/jgs.14996			144	65	10	2313	In the July 2016 issue of this journal, Dr. Mary Tinetti proposed that geriatric medicine abandon attempts to increase the numbers of board-certified geriatricians and change focus to the development of a 'small elite workforce.' What would be gained and what sacrificed by accepting this challenge? We agree that the best clinical use of a scarce resource, specialty trained geriatricians, is to care for frail, complex, severely ill elderly adults and to help design and study novel interventions in research, education, and care models to improve the care of all older adults, but for this to happen, all other providers must attain specific competency in the care of older adults. This article responds and discusses alternative pathways for teaching geriatrics care, training specialists, and geriatrics fellows.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=125690593&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		248	callahan,kathryn.e	callahan	kathryn.e
243	The Growing Challenge Of Major Trauma In Older People: A Role For Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment?	2017	249	10.1093/ageing/afx035			161	46	5	709	In this commentary article, we describe the impact that an ageing population is having on the nature of major trauma seen in emergency departments. The proportion of major trauma victims who are older people is rapidly increasing and a fall from standing is now the most common mechanism of injury in major trauma. Potential barriers to effective care of this patient group are highlighted, including: a lack of consensus regarding triage criteria; potentially misleading physiological parameters within triage criteria; non-linear patient presentations and diagnostic nihilism. We argue that the complex ongoing care and rehabilitation needs of older patients with major trauma may be best met through Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). Furthermore, the use of frailty screening tools may facilitate more informed early decisionmaking in relation to treatment interventions in older trauma victims. We call for geriatric medicine and emergency medicine departments to collaborate--equipping urgent care staff with the basic competencies necessary to initiate CGA should be a priority, and geriatricians have a key role to play in delivery of such educational interventions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=124842286&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		249	fisher,james.michael	fisher	james.michael
244	'There'S A Catch-22' - The Complexities Of Pain Management For People With Advanced Dementia Nearing The End Of Life: A Qualitative Exploration Of Physicians' Perspectives.	2017	250	10.1177/0269216316673549			139	31	8	734	Background: Pain management is a cornerstone of palliative care. The clinical issues encountered by physicians when managing pain in patients dying with advanced dementia, and how these may impact on prescribing and treatment, are unknown Aim: To explore physicians' experiences of pain management for patients nearing the end of life, the impact of these on prescribing and treatment approaches, and the methods employed to overcome these challenges Design: Qualitative, semi-structured interview study exploring barriers to and facilitators of pain management, prescribing and treatment decisions, and training needs. Thematic analysis was used to elicit key themes. Setting/participants: A total of 23 physicians, responsible for treating patients with advanced dementia approaching the end of life, were recruited from primary care (n = 9), psychiatry (n = 7) and hospice care (n = 7) Results: Six themes emerged: diagnosing pain, complex prescribing and treatment approaches, side effects and adverse events, route of administration, importance of sharing knowledge and training needs. Knowledge exchange was often practised through liaison with physicians from other specialities. Cross-speciality mentoring and the creation of knowledge networks were believed to improve pain management in this patient population Conclusion: Pain management in end-stage dementia is complex, requiring cross-population of knowledge between palliative care specialists and non-specialists, in addition to collateral information provided by other health professionals and patients' families. Regular, cost- and time-effective mentoring and ongoing professional development are perceived to be essential in empowering physicians to meet clinical challenges in this area.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=124589122&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	139	Palliative Medicine		250	de,witt.jansen.bannin	de	witt.jansen.bannin
245	Preventing Hospitalization With Veterans Affairs Home-Based Primary Care: Which Individuals Benefit Most?	2017	251	10.1111/jgs.14843			144	65	8	1676	Objectives To examine how medical complexity modifies the relationship between enrollment in Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) home-based primary care ( HBPC) and hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions ( ACSC) for veterans with diabetes mellitus and whether the effect of HBPC on hospitalizations varies according to clinical condition. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting VA and non- VA hospitals. Participants VA beneficiaries aged 67 and older with diabetes mellitus and enrolled in Medicare (N = 364,972). Measurements Instrumental variables regression models were used to estimate the effect of HBPC enrollment on hospitalization for ACSCs (defined according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators) overall and in subgroups stratified according to medical complexity. Models were also estimated for each ACSC to determine which conditions were most sensitive to HBPC. Distance from the veteran's residence to the nearest HBPC site was used as the instrumental variable. Results HBPC was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations (odds ratio ( OR) = 0.35 per person-month, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.30-0.42). For veterans in the highest quartile of medical complexity, HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.93), whereas for those in the lowest quartile, HBPC was associated with more ACSC hospitalizations ( OR = 33.2, 95% CI = 4.6-240.1). HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs. Conclusion HBPC enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations for a range of ACSCs in veterans with diabetes mellitus but only in the most medically complex individuals. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate targeting and suggests that the effect of HBPC is attributable to its comprehensive approach rather than condition-specific interventions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=124623509&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		251	edwards,samuel.t	edwards	samuel.t
246	Understanding The Challenges To Vascular Access In An Ageing Population.	2017	252	10.12968/bjon.2017.26.14.S15			208	26	14	S15	At the beginning of the 21st century, one in five of UK residents can expect to see their 100th birthday and one in four people are aged 60 years or older. The UK has an ageing population. With older age comes an increasing variety of comorbidities that have an impact not only on an individual’s quality of life but also on healthcare resources. Older people account for a rapidly rising cohort of individuals admitted to hospital, often with complex needs, and this can require achieving venous access. Venepuncture and cannulation are the most commonly performed invasive procedures in health care today. This article aims to increase awareness of vascular access challenges in older patients so the potential for complications relating to venepuncture, cannulation and infusion therapy can be minimised, thereby improving their overall quality of care. The article will look at the healthcare challenges facing the older population, and the importance of a holistic approach to assess their vascular access needs to deliver optimum care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=124317649&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	208	British Journal of Nursing	1	252	gabriel,janice	gabriel	janice
247	Dynamical Resilience Indicators In Time Series Of Self-Rated Health Correspond To Frailty Levels In Older Adults.	2017	210	10.1093/gerona/glx065			210	72	7	991	<bold>Background: </bold>We currently still lack valid methods to dynamically measure resilience for stressors before the appearance of adverse health outcomes that hamper well-being. Quantifying an older adult's resilience in an early stage would aid complex decision-making in health care. Translating complex dynamical systems theory to humans, we hypothesized that three dynamical indicators of resilience (variance, temporal autocorrelation, and cross-correlation) in time series of self-rated physical, mental, and social health were associated with frailty levels in older adults.<bold>Methods: </bold>We monitored self-rated physical, mental, and social health during 100 days using daily visual analogue scale questions in 22 institutionalized older adults (mean age 84.0, SD: 5.9 years). Frailty was determined by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) frailty index. The resilience indicators (variance, temporal autocorrelation, and cross-correlation) were calculated using multilevel models.<bold>Results: </bold>The self-rated health time series of frail elderly exhibited significantly elevated variance in the physical, mental, and social domain, as well as significantly stronger cross-correlations between all three domains, as compared to the nonfrail group (all P < 0.001). Temporal autocorrelation was not significantly associated with frailty.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We found supporting evidence for two out of three hypothesized resilience indicators to be related to frailty levels in older adults. By mirroring the dynamical resilience indicators to a frailty index, we delivered a first empirical base to validate and quantify the construct of systemic resilience in older adults in a dynamic way.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=123424048&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		210	gijzel,sanne.m.w	gijzel	sanne.m.w
248	Toward Optimal Decision Making Among Vulnerable Patients Referred For Cardiac Surgery: A Qualitative Analysis Of Patient And Provider Perspectives.	2017	254	10.1177/0272989X16675338			254	37	5	600	Objectives. Comprehension of risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options has been shown to be poor among patients referred for cardiac interventions. Patients’ values and preferences are rarely explicitly sought. An increasing proportion of frail and older patients are undergoing complex cardiac surgical procedures with increased risk of both mortality and prolonged institutional care. We sought input from patients and caregivers to determine the optimal approach to decision making in this vulnerable patient population. Methods. Focus groups were held with both providers and former patients. Three focus groups were convened for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), Valve, or CABG +Valve patients ≥ 70 y old (2-y post-op, ≤ 8-wk post-op, complicated post-op course) (n = 15). Three focus groups were convened for Intermediate Medical Care Unit (IMCU) nurses, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses, surgeons, anesthesiologists and cardiac intensivists (n = 20). We used a semi-structured interview format to ask questions surrounding the informed consent process. Transcribed audio data was analyzed to develop consistent and comprehensive themes. Results. We identified 5 main themes that influence the decision making process: educational barriers, educational facilitators, patient autonomy and perceived autonomy, patient and family expectations of care, and decision making advocates. All themes were influenced by time constraints experienced in the current consent process. Patient groups expressed a desire to receive information earlier in their care to allow time to identify personal values and preferences in developing plans for treatment. Both groups strongly supported a formal approach for shared decision making with a decisional coach to provide information and facilitate communication with the care team. Conclusions. Identifying the barriers and facilitators to patient and caretaker engagement in decision making is a key step in the development of a structured, patient-centered SDM approach. Intervention early in the decision process, the use of individualized decision aids that employ graphic risk presentations, and a dedicated decisional coach were identified by patients and providers as approaches with a high potential for success. The impact of such a formalized shared decision making process in cardiac surgery on decisional quality will need to be formally assessed. Given the trend toward older and frail patients referred for complex cardiac procedures, the need for an effective shared decision making process is compelling.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=123488326&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	254	Medical Decision Making		254	gainer,ryan.a	gainer	ryan.a
249	A Qualitative Study Of Older People’S Experience Of Living With Neurogenic Claudication To Inform The Development Of A Physiotherapy Intervention.	2017	255	10.1080/09638288.2016.1177611			255	39	10	1009	Purpose:The aim of this study was to explore older people’s experiences of living with neurogenic claudication (NC), their preferences for physiotherapy treatment provision and associated outcomes in order to inform an intervention to be tested in a clinical trial. Method:Patients with a diagnosis of NC and/or lumbar spinal stenosis were recruited through a UK NHS tertiary care center. Semi-structured interviews and self-report questionnaires were used to obtain data. A thematic analysis was conducted. Results:15 participants were recruited; half were classed as frail older adults. Pain and the threat of pain was a prominent feature of participants’ experience of NC. This led to a loss of engagement in meaningful activities and sense of self. Discourses of ageing influenced experiences as well as treatment preferences, particularly the acceptability of walking aids. A combination of one-to-one and group setting for treatment was preferred. Outcome preferences related to re-engagement in meaningful activities and pain reduction. Limitations relate to generalisability of the findings for NC patients not under physiotherapy treatment. Conclusion:We have obtained important findings about older people’s experiences of living with NC and preferences for physiotherapy treatment and outcomes. These will be incorporated into an evidence-based intervention and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.Implications for rehabilitationOlder people living with NC want to get back to meaningful activities and learn how to live with the threat of pain.Allied health professionals (AHPs) should be sensitive to the complex and ambiguous ways in which older people live with ageing and age-related decline.AHPs are in a position to support patients’ successful transition to the use of walking aids thereby reducing stigmatizing effects and increasing activity.AHPs should consider a mixture of one-to-one and group classes to enable rehabilitation for older NC patients.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=121839467&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	255	Disability & Rehabilitation		255	lyle,samantha	lyle	samantha
250	Biological Aging And The Future Of Geriatric Psychiatry.	2017	256	10.1093/gerona/glw241			210	72	3	343	Advances in understanding the biological bases of aging have intellectually revitalized the field of geriatric psychiatry and broadened its scope to include promoting successful aging and studying resilience factors in older adults. To describe the process by which this paradigm shift has occurred and illustrate its implications for treatment and research of late-life brain disorders, late-life depression is discussed as a prototype case. Prior phases of geriatric psychiatry research were focused on achieving depressive symptom relief, outlining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between older and younger adults, and identifying moderators of treatment response. Building on this work, current geriatric psychiatry researchers have begun to disentangle the etiologic complexity in late-life depression by focusing on the causative aging-related processes involved, identifying both neurobiological and behavioral intermediates, and finally delineating depression subtypes that are distinguishable by their underlying biology and the treatment approach required. In this review, we discuss several age-related processes that are critical to the development of late-life mood disorders, outline implications of these processes for the clinical evaluation and management of later-life psychiatric disorders, and finally put forth suggestions for better integrating aging and developmental processes into the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=121304393&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		256	rutherford,bret.r	rutherford	bret.r
251	Defining Aging Phenotypes And Related Outcomes: Clues To Recognize Frailty In Hospitalized Older Patients.	2017	257	10.1093/gerona/glw188			210	72	3	395	<bold>Background: </bold>Because frailty is a complex phenomenon associated with poor outcomes, the identification of patient profiles with different care needs might be of greater practical help than to look for a unifying definition. This study aimed at identifying aging phenotypes and their related outcomes in order to recognize frailty in hospitalized older patients.<bold>Methods: </bold>Patients aged 65 or older enrolled in internal medicine and geriatric wards participating in the REPOSI registry. Relationships among variables associated to sociodemographic, physical, cognitive, functional, and medical status were explored using a multiple correspondence analysis. The hierarchical cluster analysis was then performed to identify possible patient profiles. Multivariable logistic regression was used to verify the association between clusters and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and 3-month postdischarge mortality and rehospitalization).<bold>Results: </bold>2,841 patients were included in the statistical analyses. Four clusters were identified: the healthiest (I); those with multimorbidity (II); the functionally independent women with osteoporosis and arthritis (III); and the functionally dependent oldest old patients with cognitive impairment (IV). There was a significantly higher in-hospital mortality in Cluster II (odds ratio [OR] = 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-4.46) and Cluster IV (OR = 5.15, 95% CI = 2.58-10.26) and a higher 3-month mortality in Cluster II (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.13-2.44) and Cluster IV (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15-3.00) than in Cluster I.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Using alternative analytical techniques among hospitalized older patients, we could distinguish different frailty phenotypes, differently associated with adverse events. The identification of different patient profiles can help defining the best care strategy according to specific patient needs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=121304388&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		257	marcucci,maura	marcucci	maura

253	Janus At The Crossroads: Perspectives On Long-Term Care Trajectories For Older Women With Dementia In A Canadian Context.	2017	259	10.1093/geront/gnw158			178	57	1	68	Purpose of the Study: Janus, the two-faced, Roman god of beginnings and transitions, is used as a metaphor to explore our personal narratives and our quantitative research on the experiences of older women with dementia in long-term care (LTC). Two research questions are addressed: (a) How do our quantitative data map onto our mothers' experiences? (b) What lessons do our mothers' experiences offer for the care of older women with dementia? Design and Methods: Informed by a life-course perspective, we triangulate administrative data on 3,717 women with dementia receiving LTC in British Columbia, Canada, with personal narratives--the stories of our mothers who made the transition from home care into residential (nursing home) care. Results: Our quantitative data reveal that the home care to residential care transition is the most common LTC trajectory for women with dementia who are most likely to be widowed and living alone in suburban areas. On entry into residential care, they exhibit greater frailty in terms of activities of daily living, cognition, aggression, and incontinence. Our personal narrative data on our mothers reveals that the relatively straightforward pathways through LTC for women with dementia, are often considerably more complex in a real-world context. Attention is drawn to the public and private services, hospitalization patterns, and substantial communication gaps experienced by our moms and families. Implications: A life-course perspective, and qualitative and quantitative data facilitate understanding the care journeys--health and service trajectories of older women with dementia.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=120757814&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	178	Gerontologist		259	cloutier,denise.s	cloutier	denise.s
254	Use Of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy In Older Adults With Atrial Fibrillation After Acute Ischemic Stroke.	2017	260	10.1111/jgs.14688			144	65	2	241	Objectives To explore barriers to anticoagulation in older adults with atrial fibrillation ( AF) at high risk of stroke and to identify opportunities for interventions that might increase use of oral anticoagulants ( OACs). Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Two large community-based AF cohorts. Participants Individuals with ischemic stroke surviving hospitalization (N = 1,405, mean age 79). Measurements Using structured chart review, reasons for nonuse of OAC were identified, and 1-year poststroke survival was assessed. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of OAC nonuse. Results Median CHA2 DS2- VASc score was 5, yet 44% of participants were not prescribed an OAC at discharge. The most-frequent (nonmutually exclusive) physician reasons for not prescribing OAC included fall risk (26.7%), poor prognosis (19.3%), bleeding history (17.1%), participant or family refusal (14.9%), older age (11.0%), and dementia (9.4%). Older age (odds ratio ( OR) = 8.96, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 5.01-16.04 for aged ≥85 vs <65) and disability ( OR = 12.58, 95% CI = 5.82-27.21 for severe vs no deficit) were the most-important independent predictors of nonuse of OACs. By 1 year, 42.5% of those not receiving an OAC at discharge had died, versus 19.1% of those receiving an OAC ( P < .001), far higher than recurrent stroke rates. Conclusion Despite very high stroke risk, more than 40% of participants were not discharged with an OAC. Dominant reasons included fall risk, poor prognosis, older age, and dementia. These individuals' high 1-year mortality rate confirmed their high level of comorbidity. To improve anticoagulation decisions and outcomes in this population, future research should focus on strategies to mitigate fall risk, improve assessment of risks and benefits of anticoagulation in individuals with AF, and determine whether newer anticoagulants are safer in complex elderly and frail individuals.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=121289451&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		260	mcgrath,emer.r	mcgrath	emer.r
255	Cross-Cultural Adaptation Of The Professional Version Of The Readiness For Interprofessional Learning Scale (Ripls) In Japanese.	2017	261	10.1080/13561820.2016.1248814			231	31	1	85	Interprofessional education (IPE) for healthcare professionals is important in Japan because of its rapidly aging population and increasingly complex healthcare needs. However, no tools have been validated in the Japanese context to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitudes towards, or readiness for, IPE. The professional version of the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) with 23 items was selected for cross-cultural adaptation because it has been widely used internationally and a Japanese edition of the student version has already been developed. We followed a guideline for cross-cultural adaptation and subsequently conducted factor analysis with 368 responses from over 16 professions. Face and content validity was confirmed through the translation process. We obtained four factors with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha > 0.7). These results were similar to those of the original UK study, apart from one factor being divided into two different factors in this study. Studies are required to further confirm the rigor and generalisability of the results; however, the Japanese RIPLS can be used to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitudes towards IPE, which can eventually lead to a better IPE development for healthcare professionals in Japan.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=120327700&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	231	Journal of Interprofessional Care	1	261	oishi,ai	oishi	ai
256	Developing A Model Of Short-Term Integrated Palliative And Supportive Care For Frail Older People In Community Settings: Perspectives Of Older People, Carers And Other Key Stakeholders.	2016	262	10.1093/ageing/afw124			161	45	6	863	Background: understanding how best to provide palliative care for frail older people with non-malignant conditions is an international priority. We aimed to develop a community-based episodic model of short-term integrated palliative and supportive care (SIPS) based on the views of service users and other key stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Method: transparent expert consultations with health professionals, voluntary sector and carer representatives including a consensus survey; and focus groups with older people and carers were used to generate recommendations for the SIPS model. Discussions focused on three key components of the model: potential benefit of SIPS, timing of delivery and processes of integrated working between specialist palliative care and generalist practitioners. Content and descriptive analysis was employed and findings were integrated across the data sources. Findings: we conducted two expert consultations (n = 63), a consensus survey (n = 42) and three focus groups (n = 17). Potential benefits of SIPS included holistic assessment, opportunity for end of life discussion, symptom management and carer reassurance. Older people and carers advocated early access to SIPS, while other stakeholders proposed delivery based on complex symptom burden. A priority for integrated working was the assignment of a key worker to co-ordinate care, but the assignment criteria remain uncertain. Interpretation: key stakeholders agree that a model of SIPS for frail older people with non-malignant conditions has potential benefits within community settings, but differ in opinion on the optimal timing and indications for this service. Our findings highlight the importance of consulting all key stakeholders in model development prior to feasibility evaluation.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=119443354&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		262	bone,anna.e	bone	anna.e
257	Perspectives On The Etiology Of Violence In Later Life.	2016	264	10.1177/0886260515584338			264	31	18	3039	This article focuses on the development of a conceptual framework for explaining the etiology of violence in later life by various groups involved in the field of elder abuse. In this study, we explore this through eight focus groups with different professionals involved in the field of elder abuse and older persons themselves and in interviews with 35 experts in the field. Our findings show that dependency, vulnerability, power and control, social isolation, stress, and care burden play a central role in their explanations for the occurrence of violence in later life. The role of a history of violence in violence in later life is equivocal. The complexity and ambiguity of dependency and vulnerability, the notion of mutual dependency, and diverse attitudes and expectations toward them that arise with the aging process are distinct features of violence in later life that were found.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=118518656&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	264	Journal of Interpersonal Violence		264	mysyuk,yuliya	mysyuk	yuliya
258	Factors Associated With Transition From Community Settings To Hospital As Place Of Death For Adults Aged 75 And Older: A Population-Based Mortality Follow-Back Survey.	2016	262	10.1111/jgs.14442			144	64	11	2210	Objectives To identify factors associated with end-of-life (EoL) transition from usual place of care to the hospital as place of death for people aged 75 and older. Design Population-based mortality follow-back survey. Setting Deaths over 6 months in 2012 in two unitary authorities in England covering 800 square miles with more than 1 million residents. Participants A random sample of people aged 75 and older who died in a care home or hospital and all those who died at home or in a hospice unit (N = 882). Cases were identified from death registrations. The person who registered the death (a relative for 98.9%) completed the survey. Measurements The main outcome was EoL transition to the hospital as place of death versus no EoL transition to the hospital. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to examine factors (illness, demographic, environmental) related to EoL transition to the hospital. Results Four hundred forty-three (50.2%) individuals responded, describing the care of the people who died. Most died from nonmalignant conditions (76.3%) at a mean age of 87.4 ± 6.4. One hundred forty-six (32.3%) transitioned to the hospital and died there. Transition was more likely for individuals with respiratory disease than for those with cancer (prevalence ratio ( PR) = 2.07, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 1.42-3.01) and for people with severe breathlessness ( PR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.12-3.43). Transition was less likely if EoL preferences had been discussed with a healthcare professional ( PR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.42-0.88) and when there was a key healthcare professional ( PR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.95). Conclusion To reduce EoL transition to the hospital for older people, there needs to be improved management of breathlessness in the community and better access to a key healthcare professional skilled in coordinating care, communication, facilitating complex discussions, and in planning for future care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=119477466&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		262	bone,anna.e	bone	anna.e
259	Interprofessional Education In Aged-Care Facilities: Tensions And Opportunities Among Undergraduate Health Student Cohorts.	2016	268	10.1080/13561820.2016.1192995			231	30	5	627	This article examines the reflective discourses of medical, nursing, and paramedic students participating in interprofessional education (IPE) activities in the context of aged-care clinical placements. The intent of the research is to explore how students engage with their interprofessional colleagues in an IPE assessment and care planning activity and elucidate how students configure their role as learners within the context of a non-traditional aged-care training environment. Research participants included cohorts of volunteer medical (n = 61), nursing (n = 46), and paramedic (n = 20) students who were on clinical placements at two large teaching aged-care facilities in Tasmania, Australia, over a period of 18 months. A total of 39 facilitated focus group discussions were undertaken with cohorts of undergraduate student volunteers from three health professions between February 2013 and October 2014. Thematic analysis of focus group transcripts was assisted by NVIVO software and verified through secondary coding and member checking procedures. With an acceptable level of agreement across two independent coders, four themes were identified from student focus group transcripts that described the IPE relations and perceptions of the aged-care environment. Emergent themes included reinforcement of professional hierarchies, IPE in aged care perceived as mundane and extraneous, opportunities for reciprocal teaching and learning, and understanding interprofessional roles. While not all students can be engaged with IPE activities in aged care, our evidence suggests that within 1 week of clinical placements there is a possibility to develop reciprocal professional relations, affirm a positive identity within a collaborative healthcare team, and support the health of vulnerable older adults with complex care needs. These important clinical learnings support aged-care-based IPE as a potentially powerful context for undergraduate learning in the 21st Century.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=117672246&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	231	Journal of Interprofessional Care	1	268	annear,michael	annear	michael
260	Frailty: A Term With Many Meanings And A Growing Priority For Community Nurses.	2016	269	10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.8.385			163	21	8	385	The question of exactly what frailty is and what that may mean for patients is extremely complex. This is a very conceptual problem requiring a broad and long-term solution. It is not a disease or a condition that can be treated in isolation. Frailty is a collection of contributing factors that culminate in an individual being susceptible to poorer outcomes following health-care interventions and minor illness. The solution to such a complex problem lies in engaging and empowering staff to understand and champion frailty. Once better understood, it will be possible to educate and enable this workforce to recognise the signs of frailty, poor prognosis and patients requiring more specialised palliative care. Informing staff working within a health-care economy of this issue must be the first step in a shift towards managing patients with frailty more appropriately, and streaming their care towards the correct care pathways sooner. This article discusses what frailty is, what it may mean for patients, and attempts to expand on why the construct of frailty is a prevalent issue for community nurses. The link between frailty and mortality is discussed and how targeted appropriate advanced care planning may be used to address this demographic challenge.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=117150790&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	163	British Journal of Community Nursing	1	269	wallington,sophie.louise	wallington	sophie.louise
261	Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Of A Mental Health Service User With Safeguarding Needs.	2016	270	10.7748/nop.28.5.25.s25			10	28	5	25	This is the final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in different clinical settings. CGA is a holistic model that is used to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as any functional, social and environmental issues that might affect their care. When undertaken by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article explores the case of an older woman living in the community who was receiving support from a number of health and social care services and who had significant safeguarding needs. It highlights the complexity of caring for patients with physical and mental health conditions. CGA can link these conditions and needs together to allow a better understanding of their effects on the patient. The risks of significant transitions in care are also highlighted, along with recommendations for the provision of multidisciplinary care in community settings.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=115736727&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	10	Nursing Older People	1	270	north,chris	north	chris

263	Factors Related To Falls, Weight-Loss And Pressure Ulcers - More Insight In Risk Assessment Among Nursing Home Residents.	2016	272	10.1111/jocn.13154			267	25	7-8	940	Aims and objectives To describe how the included items in three different scales, Downton Fall Risk Index, the short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment and the Modified Norton Scale are associated to severe outcomes as falls, weight loss and pressure ulcers. Background Falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are common adverse events among nursing home residents and risk scoring are common preventive activities, mainly focusing on single risks. In Sweden the three scales are routinely used together with the purpose to improve the quality of prevention. Design Longitudinal quantitative study. Methods Descriptive analyses and Cox regression analyses. Results Only 4% scored no risk for any of these serious events. Longitudinal risk scoring showed significant impaired mean scores indicating increased risks. This confirms the complexity of this population's status of general condition. There were no statistical significant differences between residents categorised at risk or not regarding events. Physical activity increased falls, but decreased pressure ulcers. For weight loss, cognitive decline and the status of general health were most important. Conclusions Risk tendencies for falls, malnutrition and pressure ulcers are high in nursing homes, and when measure them at the same time the majority will have several of these risks. Items assessing mobility or items affecting mobility were of most importance. Care processes can always be improved and this study can add to the topic. Relevance to clinical practice A more comprehensive view is needed and prevention can not only be based on total scores. Mobility is an important factor for falls and pressure ulcers, both as a risk factor and a protective factor. This involves a challenge for care - to keep the inmates physical active and at the same time prevent falls.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=113877007&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	267	Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1	272	lannering,christina	lannering	christina
264	Treating Depression In Older Adults.	2016	273	10.7748/mhp.19.6.16.s19			273	19	6	16	As a treatment for depression, behavioural activation is as effective as cognitive behaviour therapy but less complex. Its simplicity and the absence of a cognitive component mean that it may be more suitable for older adults. However, existing reviews of the evidence are meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, which tend to exclude subjects who are medically frail, cognitively impaired or have comorbid mental health problems. Eleven studies were examined to determine whether behaviourally focused treatments are suitable for older adults, including members of these client groups. The evidence suggests that behavioural activation that is delivered by non-therapists who are trained in the intervention can reduce depressive symptoms in older adults with comorbid medical problems. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=113626617&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:54	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	273	Mental Health Practice	1	273	green,paul	green	paul

266	The Geriatric Icf Core Set Reflecting Health - Related Problems In Community-Living Older Adults Aged 75 Years And Older Without Dementia: Development And Validation.	2015	277	10.3109/09638288.2015.1024337			255	37	25	2337	Purpose: The aim of the present study was to develop a valid Geriatric ICF Core Set reflecting relevant health-related problems of community-living older adults without dementia.Methods: A Delphi study was performed in order to reach consensus (≥70% agreement) on second-level categories from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The Delphi panel comprised 41 older adults, medical and non-medical experts. Content validity of the set was tested in a cross-sectional study including 267 older adults identified as frail or having complex care needs.Results: Consensus was reached for 30 ICF categories in the Delphi study (fourteen Body functions, ten Activities and Participation and six Environmental Factors categories). Content validity of the set was high: the prevalence of all the problems was >10%, except ford530 Toileting. The most frequently reported problems wereb710 Mobility of joint functions(70%),b152 Emotional functions(65%) andb455 Exercise tolerance functions(62%). No categories had missing values.Conclusion: The final Geriatric ICF Core Set is a comprehensive and valid set of 29 ICF categories, reflecting the most relevant health-related problems among community-living older adults without dementia. This Core Set may contribute to optimal care provision and support of the older population.Implications for RehabilitationThe Geriatric ICF Core Set may provide a practical tool for gaining an understanding of the relevant health-related problems of community-living older adults without dementia.The Geriatric ICF Core Set may be used in primary care practice as an assessment tool in order to tailor care and support to the needs of older adults.The Geriatric ICF Core Set may be suitable for use in multidisciplinary teams in integrated care settings, since it is based on a broad range of problems in functioning.Professionals should pay special attention to health problems related to mobility and emotional functioning since these are the most prevalent problems in community-living older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=110643405&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	255	Disability & Rehabilitation		277	spoorenberg,sophie.l.w	spoorenberg	sophie.l.w
267	Cost-Effectiveness Of A Chronic Care Model For Frail Older Adults In Primary Care: Economic Evaluation Alongside A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized Trial.	2015	278	10.1111/jgs.13834			144	63	12	2494	Objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Geriatric Care Model ( GCM), an integrated care model for frail older adults based on the Chronic Care Model, with that of usual care. Design Economic evaluation alongside a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting Primary care (35 practices) in two regions in the Netherlands. Participants Community-dwelling older adults who were frail according to their primary care physicians and the Program on Research for Integrating Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy case-finding tool questionnaire (N = 1,147). Intervention The GCM consisted of the following components: a regularly scheduled in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment by a practice nurse followed by a customized care plan, management and training of practice nurses by a geriatric expert team, and coordination of care through community network meetings and multidisciplinary team consultations of individuals with complex care needs. Measurements Outcomes were measured every 6 months and included costs from a societal perspective, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Survey ( SF-12) physical ( PCS) and mental component summary ( MCS) scales), functional limitations (Katz activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), and quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D. Results Multilevel regression models adjusted for time and baseline confounders showed no significant differences in costs ($356, 95% confidence interval = −$488-1,134) and outcomes between intervention and usual care phases. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that, for the SF-12 PCS and MCS, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.76 if decision-makers are willing to pay $30,000 per point improvement on the SF-12 scales (range 0-100). For all other outcomes the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was low. Conclusion Because the GCM was not cost-effective compared to usual care after 24 months of follow-up, widespread implementation in its current form is not recommended.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=111888462&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		278	leeuwen,karen.m	leeuwen	karen.m

However, in the past decade, concerns have been raised about social work's sustainability and contributions in a changing health care sector. These changes come at a time when older patients are more complex and vulnerable than ever before. In this article, using a strengths-based approach, the authors examine the key contributions made by social workers working with older patients with hip fracture as they strive to achieve successful care transitions. Twenty-five interviews with health care professionals (HCPs) were conducted and then analyzed using an analytical coding framework. Although social workers are vital, they are often underused and overlooked in the care of hip fracture patients. The authors sketch the important contributions that social workers make to care transitions after hip fracture, specifically informational continuity; patient--HCP relational continuity; conflict resolution; mediation among family, patient, and HCP (for example, doctors and nurses); collaboration with family caregivers and community supports; and relocation counseling.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=110709666&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	279	Health & Social Work		279	sims-gould,joanie	sims-gould	joanie
269	Comparing The Characteristics Of People Living With And Without Hiv In Long-Term Care And Home Care In Ontario, Canada.	2015	280	10.1080/09540121.2015.1058893			179	27	10	1343	Population aging and successful drug therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) management mean that more people are living longer with HIV. As these individuals age, they become more at risk of developing other chronic health conditions which will have many implications for disease management and choice of care setting. As people living with HIV turn to home care and long-term care (LTC) settings for care, understanding the particular needs of this population is becoming increasingly important. This study sought to describe the sociodemographic, clinical, and social attributes of people living with HIV in the home care and institutional environments. This work involved secondary analysis of data collected from both the international Resident Assessment Instruments (interRAI) home care and minimum data set instruments in the Canadian province of Ontario. Descriptive analysis was used to describe key attributes of people living with and without HIV in LTC, complex continuing care, and home care settings. A comparison of differences between people living with HIV across the three environments was also done using Chi-square analysis. People living with HIV were often younger, male and unmarried than other populations in the care settings studied. Together with specific health needs associated with issues like mental health and social isolation, people living with HIV represent a population with complex and distinctive health needs. Finding ways to better understand the needs of this vulnerable population will help to develop strategies to provide better formal and informal care and improve the quality of life of this group. interRAI standardized assessment instruments may be important tools for meeting this challenge.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=110360469&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	179	AIDS Care		280	foebel,andrea.d	foebel	andrea.d
270	Rethinking Hospital-Associated Deconditioning: Proposed Paradigm Shift.	2015	281	10.2522/ptj.20140511			281	95	9	1307	Physical therapists often treat older adults with marked deficits in physical function secondary to an acute hospitalization. These deficits are often collectively defined as hospital-associated deconditioning (HAD). However, there is a paucity of evidence that objectively demonstrates the efficacy of physical therapy for older adults with HAD. Older adults with HAD represent a highly variable and complex population and thus may be difficult to study and develop effective interventions for using our current rehabilitation strategies. This perspective article outlines an innovative framework to operationalize and treat older adults with HAD. This framework may help therapists apply emerging exercise strategies to this population and facilitate additional research to support the total value of physical therapy for older adults in postacute care settings--with value measured not only by improvements in physical performance but perhaps also by reduced rates of disability development, rehospitalization, and institutionalization.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=109244715&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	281	Physical Therapy		281	falvey,jason.r	falvey	jason.r
271	Loneliness And Health Care Consumption Among Older People.	2015	237	10.1111/scs.12147			170	29	3	435	Few studies have investigated loneliness in relation to health care consumption among frail older people. The aim of this study was to examine loneliness, health-related quality of life ( HRQo L), and health complaints in relation to health care consumption of in- and outpatient care among frail older people living at home. The study, with a cross-sectional design, comprised a sample of 153 respondents aged from 65 years (mean age 81.5 years) or older, who lived at home and were frail. Data was collected utilising structured interviews in the respondent's home assessing demographic data, loneliness, HRQo L and health complaints. Patient administrative registers were used to collect data on health care consumption. Loneliness was the dependent variable in the majority of the analyses and dichotomised. For group comparisons Student′s t-test, Mann- Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used. The results showed that 60% of the respondents had experienced loneliness during the previous year, at least occasionally. The study identified that lonely respondents had a lower HRQo L (p = 0.022), with a higher total number of reported health complaints (p = 0.001), and used more outpatient services including more acute visits at the emergency department, compared to not lonely respondents (p = 0.026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a depressed mood was independently associated to total use of outpatient care ( B = 7.4, p < 0.001). Therefore, it might not be loneliness, per se, that is the reason for seeking health care. However, reasons for using health care services are difficult to determine due to the complex situation for the frail older person. To avoid emergency department visits and to benefit the well-being of the frail older person, interventions targeting the complex health situation, including loneliness, are suggested.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=108930351&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	3	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	237	taube,elin	taube	elin
272	Failing To Focus On Healthy Aging: A Frailty Of Our Discipline?	2015	32	10.1111/jgs.13512			144	63	7	1459	The academic geriatrics community has provided outstanding leadership in addressing frailty and complexity in older adults, but a minority of older adults are frail. Although resources to treat older adults are limited, and it is appropriate to focus clinical efforts on those with frailty and multimorbidity, there is also important expertise that can be brought to bear on the health of ALL older adults. A review of the literature suggests that attention to healthy or successful aging has failed to keep pace with the focus on frailty. By providing leadership to promote successful aging, the quality of life of older adults across the spectrum can be improved and transitions to frailty reduced. The template that leaders have established in understanding frailty-defining and operationalizing it, understanding outcomes, identifying pathophysiology-can be used as an approach to successful aging. Several community-based programs have been successful in promoting successful aging. These are potentially highly scalable and could have a substantial effect on the aging population, but their essential components need to be better understood. The geriatrics community is uniquely positioned to take on this role. This is a critical time to work together to make the lives of all older adults as healthy and fulfilling as possible.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=108426343&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		32	friedman,susan.m	Friedman	Susan M
273	Transforming Emergency Services For Frail Older People In Hospital.	2015	284	10.7748/nm.22.3.18.s29			284	22	3	18	Managers of emergency care, acute medicine and geriatric medicine care had a difficult few months over winter managing rising demand for emergency care, and the likelihood is that we will face similar demands in future winters unless we improve services and release capacity. The complexity of this demand is also changing with more frail older people presenting for emergency care. With this in mind, there is an urgent need to improve and streamline emergency services to meet the needs of this patient group. This article focuses on the principles that managers can employ to improve frailty services and the processes that can be adopted to develop effective frailty services in hospitals that deliver better outcomes for patients.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=102901173&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	284	Nursing Management - UK		284	thompson,deborah	thompson	deborah
274	Effects Of A Continuum Of Care Intervention On Frail Older Persons' Life Satisfaction: A Randomized Controlled Study.	2015	285	10.1111/jocn.12699			267	24	7-8	1079	Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to analyse effects of a comprehensive continuum of care (intervention group) on frail older persons' life satisfaction, as compared to those receiving usual care (control group). The intervention included geriatric assessment, case management, interprofessional collaboration, support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons' own homes. Background Improvements in older persons' subjective well-being have been shown in studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager. However, effects of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons' life satisfaction are not well explored. Design Randomised controlled study. Methods The validated LiSat-11 scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older persons' life satisfaction at baseline and at three, six and 12 months after the baseline. The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month, three- to six-month as well as six- to 12-month follow-ups. Results Older persons who received the intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who received usual care, between 6 and 12 month follow-ups, for satisfaction regarding functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Conclusions A comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a positive effect on frail older persons' satisfaction with functional capacity, psychological health and financial situation. Relevance to clinical practice Frail older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from the health care system. Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care interventions' impact on life satisfaction. As life satisfaction is an essential part of older persons' well-being, we propose that policy makers and managers promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=101678073&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	267	Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1	285	berglund,helene	berglund	helene
275	The Role Of Micrornas In Cellular Senescence And Age-Related Conditions Of Cartilage And Bone.	2015	286	10.3109/17453674.2014.957079			286	86	1	92	Background and purpose - We reviewed the current state of research on microRNAs in age-related diseases in cartilage and bone. Methods - PubMed searches were conducted using separate terms to retrieve articles on (1) the role of microRNAs on aging and tissue degeneration, (2) specific microRNAs that influence cellular and organism senescence, (3) microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions, and (4) the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of microRNAs in age-related musculoskeletal conditions. Results - An increasing number of studies have identified microRNAs associated with cellular aging and tissue degeneration. Specifically in regard to frailty, microRNAs have been found to influence the onset and course of age-related musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and posttraumatic arthritis. Both intracellular and extracellular microRNAs may be suitable to function as diagnostic biomarkers. In particular Interpretation - The research data currently available suggest that microRNAs play an important role in orchestrating age-related processes and conditions of the musculoskeletal system. Further research may help to improve our understanding of the complexity of these processes at the cellular and extracellular level. The option to develop microRNA biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents for the degenerating diseases of bone and cartilage appears to be promising.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=100576970&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	286	Acta Orthopaedica		286	weilner,sylvia	weilner	sylvia
276	Psychological Correlates Of Fear Of Falling In The Elderly.	2015	287	10.1080/03601277.2014.924272			192	41	1	69	Fear of falling (FOF) is widely found in the elderly population and, regardless of its complex nature as a multicomponent construct, its related psychological variables have been overlooked as primary research topics. This article aims to examine the relationship between FOF, falls self efficacy, anxiety, balance, and perceived control over falling in a sample of older adults. A total of 100 subjects aged 60+ were asked about the presence of FOF, falls history, health, and functional status; they also completed the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), the Perceived Control Over Falling Scale (PCOF), and the Performance-Oriented Assessment of Mobility and Balance (POMA-I). FOF was found to be associated with low falls self efficacy, low perceived control over falling, and reduced balance but not with anxiety. Conversely, a statistically significant association was found between GAI and FES, PCOF and POMA-I, and 47.1% of FOF was explained by two items from FES and GAI. FOF is influenced by variables that, though being commonly considered equivalent to FOF, do not fully explain it. A critical thought on the instruments used to evaluate FOF, is needed as well as additional studies to clarify the role of specific psychological variables.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=98308029&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	192	Educational Gerontology		287	ribeiro,oscar	ribeiro	oscar
277	Self-Rated Health: Patterns In The Journeys Of Patients With Multi-Morbidity And Frailty.	2014	288	10.1111/jep.12133			288	20	6	1010	Rationale, aims and objectives Self-rated health ( SRH) is a single measure predictor of hospital utilization and health outcomes in epidemiological studies. There have been few studies of SRH in patient journeys in clinical settings. Reduced resilience to stressors, reflected by SRH, exposes older people (complex systems) to the risk of hospitalization. It is proposed that SRH reflects rather than predicts deteriorations and hospital use; with low SRH autocorrelation in time series. The aim was to investigate SRH fluctuations in regular outbound telephone calls (average biweekly) to patients by Care Guides. Methods Descriptive case study using quantitative autoregressive techniques and qualitative case analysis on SRH time series. Fourteen participants were randomly selected from the Patient Journey Record System (PaJR) database. The PaJR database recorded 198 consecutively sampled older multi-morbid patients journeys in three primary care settings. Analysis consisted of triangulation of SRH (0 very poor - 6 excellent) patterns from three analyses: SRH graduations associations with service utilization; time series modelling (autocorrelation, and step ahead forecast); and qualitative categorization of deteriorations. Results Fourteen patients reported mean SRH 2.84 (poor-fair) in 818 calls over 13 ± 6.4 months of follow-up. In 24% calls, SRH was poor-fair and significantly associated with hospital use. SRH autocorrelation was low in 14 time series (−0.11 to 0.26) with little difference (χ2 = 6.46, P = 0.91) among them. Fluctuations between better and worse health were very common and poor health was associated with hospital use. It is not clear why some patients continued on a downward trajectory, whereas others who destabilized appeared to completely recover, and even improved over time. Conclusion SRH reflects an individual's complex health trajectory, but as a single measure does not predict when and how deteriorations will occur in this study. Individual patients appear to behave as complex adaptive systems. The dynamics of SRH and its influences in destabilizations warrant further research.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=100766175&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	288	Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice		288	martin,carmel.mary	martin	carmel.mary
278	Synthesizing Complex Data On Functional Decline In Older People Using Partial Least Squares ( Pls) Analysis.	2014	289	10.1111/jep.12213			288	20	6	1099	Rationale, aims and objectives Declining capacity to function safely and independently in the community is a manifestation of ageing. Multiple measures are used to define and predict functional decline. This paper explores the use of partial least squares ( PLS) analysis to understand the interaction between overtime measures of functional decline. Methods Comprehensive information was captured on individuals aged 65+ who presented at a large metropolitan Australian hospital Emergency Department ( ED) for a complaint, which did not result in a hospital admission. They were followed-up by telephone 1 and 3 months, post- ED discharge. Information was collected each time on home situations (living alone, using community services, using a gait aid and having a formal carer), recent falls, hospitalizations and instrumental activities of daily living ( IADLs). PLS analysis was applied to identify overtime relationships between measures. Results Valid information was provided by 147 individuals at all three time points. The eight individual IADL items clustered clearly around physical, mental or combined mental and physical IADLs. These clusters were strongly related to increased use of community supports, gait aid and carer, and living alone. The relationship was less convincingly for hospitalizations, and falls were not explained well. Conclusion PLS analysis offers a novel and comprehensive way of analysing complex health data, which allows sense to be made of relationships over a 3-month period. This analysis provides a better understanding of declining function over time, than could be provided by current health modelling methods.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=100766200&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	288	Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice		289	king,ellena.sophia.a	king	ellena.sophia.a
279	Self-Directed Community Services For Older Australians: A Stepped Capacity-Building Approach.	2014	290	10.1111/hsc.12111			18	22	6	598	Consumer-directed care (CDC) is increasingly widespread among aged care service options in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. However, the evidence base regarding the programmatic and contextual factors that affect the outcome of CDC interventions is surprisingly small. This paper reports on a self-directed care approach for older Australians with complex care needs. A multimethods longitudinal comparative cohort study was employed comprising 4 survey tools and 56 semi-structured interviews. Participation rates were around 20%. A total of 185 (98 in the intervention and 87 in the control group) older people and carers were recruited at baseline. Eleven months later, 109 participants (59 in the intervention and 50 in the control group) completed the repeat measure. Attrition rates were around 40%. Data collection occurred between July 2010 and April 2012. The data suggest that intervention group participants were likely to be more satisfied with the way they were treated (P = 0.013), their care options (P = 0.014), the 'say' they had in their care (P < 0.001), the information they received regarding their care (P = 0.012), what they were achieving in life (P = 0.031), that the services changed their view on what could be achieved in life (P = 0.020) and with their standard of living (P = 0.008). The evaluation suggests that while only a very small segment of older people is interested in a voucher or cash option, a substantially larger group would like to have greater say over and more direct access to their care, without, however, assuming administrative and financial responsibilities. The paper concludes that a stepped capacity-building approach to CDC may improve the acceptability of CDC to older people and generate synergies that improve older people's care outcomes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=102210244&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	290	ottmann,goetz	ottmann	goetz
280	A System-Wide Analysis Using A Senior-Friendly Hospital Framework Identifies Current Practices And Opportunities For Improvement In The Care Of Hospitalized Older Adults.	2014	291	10.1111/jgs.13097			144	62	11	2163	Older adults are vulnerable to hospital-associated complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, functional decline, and delirium, which can contribute to prolonged hospital stay, readmission, and nursing home placement. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated when the hospital's practices, services, and physical environment are not sufficiently mindful of the complex, multidimensional needs of frail individuals. Several frameworks have emerged to help hospitals examine how organization-wide processes can be customized to avoid these complications. This article describes the application of one such framework-the Senior- Friendly Hospital ( SFH) framework adopted in Ontario, Canada-which comprises five interrelated domains: organizational support, processes of care, emotional and behavioral environment, ethics in clinical care and research, and physical environment. This framework provided the blueprint for a self-assessment of all 155 adult hospitals across the province of Ontario. The system-wide analysis identified practice gaps and promising practices within each domain of the SFH framework. Taken together, these results informed 12 recommendations to support hospitals at all stages of development in becoming friendly to older adults. Priorities for system-wide action were identified, encouraging hospitals to implement or further develop their processes to better address hospital-acquired delirium and functional decline. These recommendations led to collaborative action across the province, including the development of an online toolkit and the identification of accountability indicators to support hospitals in quality improvement focusing on senior-friendly care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=99596721&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		291	wong,ken.s	wong	ken.s
281	Police On The Front Line Of Community Geriatric Health Care: Challenges And Opportunities.	2014	292	10.1111/jgs.13093			144	62	11	2191	As the population ages, police increasingly serve as first responders to incidents involving older adults in which aging-related health plays a critical role. The goals of this study were to assess police officers' knowledge of aging-related health, to identify challenges police experience in their encounters with older adults, and to describe their recommendations for how to address those challenges. This was a mixed-methods study of 141 San Francisco police officers recruited from mandatory police trainings between 2011 and 2013. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze 141 self-administered questionnaires, and principles of grounded theory were used to analyze open-ended questionnaire responses and 11 additional qualitative interviews. Eighty-nine percent of officers reported interacting with older adults at least monthly. Although 84% of police reported prior training in working with older adults, only 32% rated themselves as knowledgeable about aging-related health. Participants described themselves as first responders to medical and social emergencies involving older adults and identified several challenges, including identifying and responding to aging-related conditions and ensuring appropriate medical and social service handoffs. To address these challenges, officers recommended developing trainings focused on recognizing and responding to aging-related conditions and improving police knowledge of community resources for older adults. They also called for enhanced communication and collaboration between police and clinicians. These findings suggest that, because they assume a front-line role in responding to older adults with complex medical and social needs, many police may benefit from additional knowledge about aging-related health and community resources. Collaboration between police and healthcare providers presents an important opportunity to develop geriatrics training and interprofessional systems of care to support police work with a rapidly aging population.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=99596725&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		292	brown,rebecca.t	brown	rebecca.t
282	26 Improving Care For The Frail Older Patient In An Acute Hospital Setting.	2014	293	10.1093/ageing/afu124.26			161	43	suppl_2	ii6	Background: Frail older patients may have increased length of stay (LoS) and poorer outcomes when kept on traditional medical assessment units due to lack of comprehensive geriatric assessment at an early stage of their admission.Innovation: A clinical specialist nurse for older people (CNS) and an Elderly Short Stay Unit (ESSU) were introduced to support the work of the Frail Older Peoples' Advice and Liaison Service (FOPALS) operating in MAU. The CNS actively sought patients for FOPALS to review, liaising with family and community services, helping MAU with complex discharges and triaging patients to ESSU. With an anticipated LoS less than 4 days ESSU benefited from daily consultant geriatrician ward rounds, twice-daily MDT board rounds and increased therapy input. FOPALS then expanded to 7 day working.Evaluation: LoS for all elderly patients admitted to Queen's Hospital from March-May in 2011 and 2012, was 11 days and 11.25 days (respectively). Data was analysed on 730 patients from March-May 2013. 353 patients were assessed by FOPALS between March and mid April 2013. Pro-formas were completed (prospectively) for every patient. Following introduction of seven-day working, a further 377 patients were assessed between mid-April- May 2013. FOPALS reduced LoS for all elderly patients admitted to geriatric wards at Queen's Hospital from March-May 2013, to 9.25 days. LoS for those specifically assessed by FOPALS was 9 days. This reduced further to 8.1 days once seven-day working was introduced. Readmission rates within seven days reduced from 10.4% to 6.9% for all geriatric patients. Readmission rates within thirty days declined from 33 to 25%.Conclusions: ESSU along with a specialist nurse improved LoS, when used in conjunction with FOPALS, not only improving outcomes at the ‘front door’, but for all ward areas.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=98912043&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		293	mannan,i	mannan	i
283	Ace Impact: Evaluation Of An Integrated Geriatric Service.	2014	294	10.1093/ageing/afu124.29			161	43	suppl_2	ii7	Background: Unplanned admissions for older people can result in lengthy hospital stays. It has been recognised that many of these admissions are avoidable, often associated with adverse patient outcomes and potential resource misappropriation.There is a drive to seek novel processes to better assess and manage frail elderly people presenting to Emergency Departments (ED).Innovation: Within a busy London District General Hospital, an Acute Care of the Elderly (ACE) service was designed. Based in the ED Observation Ward this service provides an in-reach service to the ED, and liaison to the Acute Medical Unit.This is a consultant-led service, with support from a trust grade junior doctor and Band 6 nurse. At present this is a weekday in-hours resource. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is delivered to patients over the age of 80, with complex problems or frailty, but who do not require inpatient care. Therapies and social care support is provided through existing teams operating in the ED.Evaluation: Between January and October 2013, 662 patients have been assessed by the ACE team, in whom 459 inappropriate admissions were avoided. To receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment and appropriate treatment to facilitate discharge of these patients only needed to stay an extra 4.76 hours on average in hospital.Since the introduction of the ACE service the rate of admission in older people from ED Observation Ward has reduced 61.2% in 2012 to 35.1% this year, despite similar levels of activity. Comparing similarly aged patients and episode diagnosis coding, in excess of 4,200 bed days could be saved per year.Conclusions: The ACE service has provided clear benefits to patients and the trust by avoiding un-necessary hospital admission, while providing focused consultant-delivered care in a timely manner. Expansion to a seven-day service is imminent, with expected further benefits.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=98912011&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		294	bell,c	bell	c

However, computer simulation has been suggested as one possible method of overcoming the difficulty of articulating such elicited qualitative views. Methods A simulation model of case management was designed using an agent-based methodology, based on the initial qualitative research material. Variables and rules of interaction were formulated into a simple conceptual framework. This model has been implemented and was used as a support for a structured discussion with experts in case management. Results The rigorous formulation provided by the agent-based methodology clarified the descriptions of the interventions and the problems encountered regarding: the diverse network topologies of health care actors in the project;, the adaptation time required by the intervention;, the communication between the health care actors;, the institutional context;, the organization of the care; and, the role of the case manager and his or hers personal ability to interpret the informal demands of the frail older person., Conclusion The simulation model should be seen primarily as a tool for thinking and learning. A number of insights were gained as part of a valuable cognitive process. Computer simulation supporting field experts' elicitation can lead to better-informed decisions in the organization of complex health care interventions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=96937031&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	288	Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice		297	chiêm,jean‐christophe	chiêm	jean‐christophe
286	38 Heart Failure In The Older Person: Is There Still A Place For The Geriatrician?	2014	298	10.1093/ageing/afu036.38			161	43	suppl_1	i9	Background: The National Heart Failure UK Audit (2011/2012) recommends cardiology services should manage in-hospital heart failure, demonstrating better survival outcomes. However frail older peoples' needs were not reflected; cognitive impairment and multi-morbidity were excluded. Our objective was to survey our older patients' characteristics and management for acute heart failure admission.Sampling methods: We sampled forty-five patients admitted to the Older Persons' Unit with heart failure (January-March 2013) collecting data from case notes and discharge summaries, adapting the National Heart Failure Audit tool adding domains including cognition, non-cardiac co-morbidities and dependency.Results: Mean age 86yrs old, mean length of stay 22 days, 62% (28/45) had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Most lived alone 62% (28/45). 32% (14/44) scored less than 24/30 on mini-mental state examination. Non-cardiac diseases were common; dementia 22% (10/45), chest disease 22% (10/45), diabetes mellitus 24% (11/45), stroke 18% (8/45), chronic kidney disease 31% (14/45). Admission echocardiography performed in 67% (30/45), brain natriuretic peptide level in 71% (32/45). In patients with reduced ejection fraction, 85% (11/13) were discharged on a beta-blocker. Only 38% (5/13) were discharged on an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; of those who were not 50% (4/8) had significant hypotension, 38% (3/8) had significant acute kidney injury.Key conclusions: Cognitive impairment and co-morbidity burden was common. Not everyone received evidence-based medical therapy, mostly clinically justified. Without considering co-morbidity, frailty and medication intolerance, streamlining services to a specialist approach may be detrimental to the complex frail patient. The National Heart Failure Audit should incorporate these aspects to reflect older patients' needs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=96557265&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		298	simms,j	simms	j
287	61 Interface Geriatrics And New Ways Of Working: Avoiding Admissions By Implementing Early Specialist Assessment By Interface Geriatricians In The Emergency Department (Ed).	2014	299	10.1093/ageing/afu036.61			161	43	suppl_1	i14	Background: An initiative to transform health and social care across the Leeds Healthcare Economy has developed in response to recent demographic, political and economic challenges. Two Interface Geriatricians were appointed to perform various innovative roles across the boundaries of primary and secondary care and to improve patient experience by moving care closer to home.Innovation: Interface Geriatricians provide early Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) by consulting in ED for four sessions per week. We aim to reduce unnecessary admissions from the ED by accessing alternative pathways where appropriate e.g. Intermediate Care or early Geriatric outpatient review. Referral criteria include medically stable frail older people experiencing a change in physical or cognitive function and/or complex co-morbidities. Cases are identified by ED clinicians, the Geriatrician, or the Early Discharge Assessment Team (EDAT) – a team of senior nurses and therapists experienced in arranging complex discharges.Evaluation: During the first year of the service, 534 patients were assessed during 146 sessions• 58%of selected patients were discharged from ED – this compares favourably with previous discharge rates from ED for frail older people of 20-33%.• A further 12% of patients were suitable for discharge but were admitted due to delays accessing community services or investigations.• Only 27% of selected patients needed admission for medical reasons.• The readmission rate was similar to the departmental rate of 20%.• A small reduction in the time waiting to be seen in ED for patients of all ages was demonstrated.Conclusions: Our innovative, high quality service is avoiding unnecessary admissions with their associated risks and cost. Feedback from ED staff, EDAT and patients regarding our service has been extremely positive. We are developing strong relationships with the ED team and EDAT, extending our influence outside of our allocated sessions and championing the individualised care of frail older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=96557213&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		299	ismail,s	ismail	s
288	Multiple Myeloma In The Very Old: An Lasia Conference Report.	2014	300	10.1093/jnci/dju067			300	106	5	1	Multiple myeloma (MM) in patients aged greater than 80 years poses an increasingly common challenge for oncology providers. A multidisciplinary workshop was held in which MM-focused hematologists/oncologists, geriatricians, and associated health-care team members discussed the state of research for MM therapy, as well as themes from geriatric medicine that pertain directly to this patient population. A summary statement of our discussions is presented here, in which we highlight several topics. MM disproportionately affects senior adults, and demographic trends indicate that this trend will accelerate. Complex issues impact cancer in seniors, and although factors such as social environment, comorbidities, and frailty have been well characterized in nononcological geriatric medicine, these themes have been inadequately explored in cancers such as MM, despite their clear relevance to this field. Therapeutically, novel agents have improved survival for MM patients of all ages, but less so for seniors than younger patients for a variety of reasons. Lastly, both MM- and treatment-related symptoms and toxicities require special attention in senior adults. Existing research provides limited insight into how best to manage these often complex patients, who are often not reflected in typical clinical trial populations. We hence offer suggestions for clinical trials that address knowledge gaps in how to manage very old and/or frail patients with MM, given the complicated issues that often surround this patient population.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=96527237&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	300	JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute		300	tuchman,sascha.a	tuchman	sascha.a
289	The Place Of Standardisation In Home Care Practice: An Ethnographic Study.	2014	301	10.1111/jocn.12412			267	23	9-10	1411	Aims and objectives To explore the benefits and shortcomings of using standardised work methods in home care nursing. Background Health care is increasingly shaped by the use of standardised work methods. This trend is reflected in the use of management tools aimed at monitoring service quality and efficiency, as well as in the evidence-based movement that has led to a shift in focus from the practitioner to the knowledge found in guidelines and clinical protocols. This study addressed the impact of this development on home care services. Design This is an ethnographic study involving fieldwork in home care nursing in Iceland. Methods The study took place in one neighbourhood in an urban area in Iceland in 2010. Members of five of six home care nursing teams agreed to participate. Team leaders were observed during visits to older person's homes and at team and interdisciplinary meetings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the team leaders and 15 older persons. Results The results were presented as three themes: For it all to hang together, which referred to attempts on behalf of the team leaders to coordinate complex services and assistance for the benefit of each patient; Working with more advanced cases, which reflected the uptake of standardised methods to address health matters locally; and Being heard, which reflects the politics of using standardised methods. Conclusions Standardised work methods can be helpful and are welcomed by home care nurses as long as they can also use their own discretion and draw on other forms of knowledge when needed. Relevance to clinical practice This study brought out the importance of flexibility in home care practice. Standardised work methods are welcomed and seen as helpful as long as they can be used based on the discretion of the practitioner.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=95515156&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	267	Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1	301	björnsdóttir,kristín	björnsdóttir	kristín
290	Moving Into Senior Housing: Adapting The Old, Embracing The New.	2014	303				303	38	1	42	A move to a senior housing community resembles many of the physical stages of previous moves in the life of an older adult, with added social, cultural, and physical challenges and opportunities. Senior housing offers several levels of housing by which residents can have their care needs met, all of which represent social challenges and the potential for increased frailty and future moves. Forming relationships with fellow residents and staff, and continuing long-term social relationships outside the facility are essential to navigating a complex relocation in late life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=94912223&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	303	Generations		303	carroll,jocelyn	carroll	jocelyn
291	2013: That Was The Year That Was.	2014	305	10.1093/ageing/aft215			161	43	2	152	In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=94516163&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		305	woo,jean	woo	jean
292	Influence Of Frailty-Related Diagnoses, High-Risk Prescribing In Elderly Adults, And Primary Care Use On Readmissions In Fewer Than 30 Days For Veterans Aged 65 And Older.	2014	306	10.1111/jgs.12656			144	62	2	291	Objectives To determine the effect of two variables not previously studied in the readmissions literature (frailty-related diagnoses and high-risk medications in the elderly ( HRME)) and one understudied variable (volume of primary care visits in the prior year). Design Retrospective cohort study using data from a study designed to examine outcomes associated with inappropriate prescribing in elderly adults. Setting All Veterans Affairs ( VA) facilities with acute inpatient beds in fiscal year 2006 ( FY06). Participants All veterans aged 65 and older by October 1, 2005, who received VA care at least once per year between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, and were hospitalized at least once during FY06 on a medical or surgical unit. Measurements A generalized linear interactive risk prediction model included demographic and clinical characteristics (mental health and chronic medical conditions, frailty-related diagnoses, number of medications) in FY05; incident HRME in FY06 before index hospitalization or readmission; chronic HRME in FY05; and FY05 emergency department ( ED), hospital, geriatric, palliative, or primary care use. Facility-level variables were complexity, rural versus urban, and FY06 admission rate. Results The mean adjusted readmission rate was 18.3%. The new frailty-related diagnoses variable is a risk factor for readmission in addition to Charlson comorbidity score. Incident HRME use was associated with lower rates of readmission, as were higher numbers of primary care visits in the prior year. Conclusion Frailty-related diagnoses may help to target individuals at higher risk of readmission to receive more-intensive care transition services. HRME use does not help in this targeting. A higher number of face-to-face primary care visits in the prior year, unlike ED and hospital use, correlates with fewer readmissions and may be another avenue for targeting prevention strategies.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=94396668&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		306	pugh,jacqueline.a	pugh	jacqueline.a
293	Predicting Outcome After Hip Fracture: Using A Frailty Index To Integrate Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Results.	2014	307	10.1093/ageing/aft084			161	43	1	122	Introduction: hip fracture is expensive in terms of mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS) and consequences for independence. Poor outcome reflects the vulnerability of patients who typically sustain this injury, but the impact of different comorbidities and impairments is complex to understand. We consider this in a prospective cohort study designed to examine how a patients' frailty index (FI) predicts outcome.Methodology: consecutive patients with low trauma hip fracture were assessed, excluding only those unfit for surgery. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) findings were used to derive a FI for each patient, which was examined alongside other assessment and outcome data from our National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) submission for these individuals.Results: we describe 178 patients; mean age 81 years, 73.5% female. The mean FI was 0.34 (SD = 0.16), and logistic regression identified abbreviated mental test score and FI as the strongest predictors of poor outcome. When patients were stratified by FI, 56 (31.5%) were in the low-frailty group (FI ≤0.25), 58 (32.5%) in intermediate (FI >0.25–0.4), and 64 (36%) in the high-FI group (FI >0.4). All the patients in the low-FI group returned to their original residence within a mean of 21.6 days. The mean LOS for the intermediate group was 36.3 days compared with 67.8 days in the high-FI group (P < 0.01) while 30-day mortality was 3.4% for the intermediate group compared with 17.2% for the high-FI group (P < 0.001).Conclusions: individual CGA findings proved disappointing as outcome predictors, while FI turned out to be a better predictor of mortality, 30-day residence and length of inpatient stay.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=93063198&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		307	krishnan,manju	krishnan	manju
294	The Risk Of Adverse Outcomes In Hospitalized Older Patients In Relation To A Frailty Index Based On A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment.	2014	308	10.1093/ageing/aft156			161	43	1	127	Background: prognostication for frail older adults is complex, especially when they become seriously ill.Objectives: to test the measurement properties, especially the predictive validity, of a frailty index based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (FI-CGA) in an acute care setting in relation to the risk of death, length of stay and discharge destination.Design and setting: prospective cohort study. Inpatient medical units in a teaching, acute care hospital.Subjects: individuals on inpatient medical units in a hospital, n = 752, aged 75+ years, were evaluated on their first hospital day; to test reliability, a subsample (n = 231) was seen again on Day 3.Measurements: all frailty data collected routinely as part of a CGA were used to create the FI-CGA. Mortality data were reviewed from hospital records, claims data, Social Security Death Index and interviews with Discharge Managers.Results: thirty-day mortality was 93 (12.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 10–15%) of whom 52 died in hospital. The risk of dying increased with each 0.01 increment in the FI-CGA: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, (95% CI = 1.04–1.07). People who were discharged home had the lowest admitting mean FI-CGA = 0.38 (±standard deviation 0.11) compared with those who died, FI-CGA = 0.51 (±0.12) or were discharged to nursing home, FI-CGA = 0.49 (±0.11). Likewise, increasing FI-CGA values on admission were significantly associated with a longer length of hospital stay.Conclusions: frailty, measured by the FI-CGA, was independently associated with a higher risk of death and other adverse outcomes in older people admitted to an acute care hospital.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=93063210&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		308	evans,stephen.j	evans	stephen.j
295	Wading In The Water: A Case Study Approach To Engaging More Fully In The Patient Narrative.	2014	309	10.2190/IL.22.1.c			309	22	1	11	"Working in the patient narrative has become a familiar part of the common language used in the context of caring for patients. Working in the patient narrative encompasses sharing conversation that allows exploration of the entire patient experience as it relates to health and illness. However, the complexity of engaging in end-of-life conversations, standing steady with conflict, remaining present, maintaining neutrality, and actively listening remain challenging concepts in practice even though they are integral to effectively doing so. Literature review has identified and defined key elements of interactions that can lead to significant opportunities to ""wander more fully"" in the patient narrative. Two case studies reviewed therein demonstrate ways in which palliative care encounters and end-of-life discussions afford the interdisciplinary team members purposeful engagement with patients. One case discusses taking risks to delve more deeply into patient's fears related to dying. This exploration lays the foundation for assuring goals of care are aligned with individual patient values. The other case demonstrates the use of symbols to share dialog related to an individual's tasks of dying. When directed, intentional facilitation occurs, the patient's unique holistic needs and values are identified, and goals of care can be clarified. In conclusion, highlights of research and clinical applications provide advantageous practice implications."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=94450827&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	309	Illness, Crisis & Loss		309	tadel,patrice.m	tadel	patrice.m
296	Metabolic Syndrome And Disability: Findings From The Prospective Three-City Study.	2014	310	10.1093/gerona/glt101			210	69	1	79	Background. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a potentially reversible cause of disability in the elderly people. The published literature suggests that the MetS–disability association is likely to be complex, depending on co-existing risk factors and with possible variation for each of the specific MetS components. Further evidence is needed to understand the specific consequences of the MetS as a whole and as a function of its components. Methods. Prospective analyses included data from 6,141 participants (60.9% women) aged 65 and older from the Three-City cohort. Mixed logistic models were used to determine associations between MetS (National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and 7-year incident disability measured as social restriction, mobility limitations (Rosow and Breslau scale), and limitations in instrumental and basic activities of daily living. Results. MetS was associated with incident social restriction (odds ratio = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.14–2.09), limited mobility (odds ratio = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.21–1.90), and instrumental activities of daily living limitations (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.24–2.10) after adjustment for a range of potential sociodemographic, health behavior, and health status confounders at baseline. These associations were independent of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease and dementia. There was evidence of associations between MetS components: central obesity, high triglycerides, and elevated fasting glucose and incidence of limitations in mobility and instrumental activities of daily living. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the increased risk of mobility and instrumental activities of daily living limitations in the elderly people associated with MetS is over and above that associated with its components.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=92875596&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		310	carriere,isabelle	carriere	isabelle

298	Exploring The Expectations, Needs And Experiences Of General Practitioners And Nurses Towards A Proactive And Structured Care Programme For Frail Older Patients: A Mixed-Methods Study.	2013	80	10.1111/jan.12110			193	69	10	2262	Aim To report the expectations and experiences of general practitioners and practice nurses regarding the U- CARE programme, to gain a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators in providing proactive, structured care to frail older people and to determine whether implementation is feasible. Background Care for older patients with complex care needs in primary care is fragmented, reactive and time consuming. A structured, proactive care programme was developed to improve physical functioning and quality of life in frail older patients. Design An explanatory mixed-methods study nested in a cluster-randomized trial. Methods The barriers to and needs for the provision of structured, proactive care, and expectations regarding the U- CARE programme were assessed with pre-questionnaires sent to all participating general practitioners ( n = 32) and practice nurses ( n = 21) in October 2010. Postquestionnaires measured experiences with the programme after 5 months. Twelve months later, focus group meetings were conducted. Results Practice nurses and general practitioners reported that it was difficult to provide proactive and structured care to older patients with multi-morbidity, different cultural backgrounds and low socioeconomic status. Barriers were a lack of time and financial compensation. Most general practitioners and practice nurses indicated that the programme added value for the coordination of care and allowed them to provide structured care. Conclusion This explanatory mixed-methods study showed that general practitioners and practice nurses perceived the U- CARE programme as feasible in general practice. A transition was made from reactive, ad hoc care towards a proactive and preventive care approach.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=90210890&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	193	Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1	80	bleijenberg,nienke	Bleijenberg	Nienke
299	Self-Reported Aging-Related Fatigue: A Concept Description And Its Relevance To Physical Therapist Practice.	2013	314	10.2522/ptj.20130011			281	93	10	1403	"Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by older people, both with and without chronic disease. It is unpleasant and distressing and can affect functioning and quality of life. Fatigue also may inhibit an older person from participating optimally in a physical therapy program aimed at rehabilitation or the promotion of better health. However, confusion surrounds the concept of self-reported aging-related fatigue, not only because of the complexity of the problem itself but also because of lack of clarity of definition and the use of the term ""fatigue"" to describe a range of different concepts. This article aims to provide clarification of the concept in the context of physical therapist clinical practice. The intention is to increase awareness of the issue among physical therapists, promoting their assessment and consideration of the problem when planning health interventions involving functioning, physical activity, and exercise for older people."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=90533177&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:55	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	281	Physical Therapy		314	egerton,thorlene	egerton	thorlene
300	Three Very Old Men'S Experiences Of Mobility Device Use Over Time.	2013	316	10.3109/11038128.2013.779321			224	20	5	397	Aim: The aim of this study was to explore experiences of mobility device (MD) use among very old single-living Swedish men. Methods: A multiple case study of three men, involving quantitative and qualitative data, was used in an embedded mixed methods design and presented in three narrative stories. To capture differences and similarities in the use of MDs a cross-case analysis was conducted. Results: The findings show that the devices were important for retaining independence in everyday life and for participation in social activities. Use of MDs impacted on everyday activities by enabling, restricting, or changing the performance. Planning and careful thinking were new strategies developed for managing everyday life. The devices were purchased, received from relatives, or prescribed by professionals at a time point when there was a need. The function and form of the devices and a supportive environment were considered important for optimal use. Conclusions: These narrative stories nurture our understanding of complex and multifaceted aspects impacting on MD use in everyday life for very old men. To support active ageing, occupational therapists and other health professionals need to seek information on personal needs and expectations, in order to understand individual perspectives on MD use.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=90016572&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	224	Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy		316	kylberg,marianne	kylberg	marianne
301	An Innovative Continuing Nursing Education Program Targeting Key Geriatric Conditions For Hospitalized Older People In China.	2013	317	10.1080/03601277.2012.704233			192	39	8	585	A lack of knowledge in registered nurses about geriatric conditions is one of the major factors that contribute to these conditions being overlooked in hospitalized older people. In China, an innovative geriatric continuing nursing education program aimed at developing registered nurses' understanding of the complex care needs of hospitalized older people with common geriatric conditions was conducted and evaluated. The program consisted of didactic sessions focused on evidence-based practice and unfolding case studies designed to simulate the care trajectory of an older person with a hip fracture and key geriatric conditions. Findings from the program evaluations revealed a significant increase in favorable attitudes towards older people and increased knowledge concerning common geriatric conditions. The satisfaction rate ranked by program participants was 90%. The study, therefore, drew the conclusion that effective geriatric continuing nursing education should target participants' learning needs, support evidence-based practice, and engage participants in active learning.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=87786422&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	192	Educational Gerontology		317	xiao,lilydongxia	xiao	lilydongxia
302	Lower Nutritional Status And Higher Food Insufficiency In Frail Older Us Adults.	2013	318	10.1017/S000711451200459X			318	110	1	172	Frailty is a state of decreased physical functioning and a significant complication of ageing. We examined frailty, energy and macronutrient intake, biomarkers of nutritional status and food insufficiency in US older adult (age ≥ 60 years) participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n 4731). Frailty was defined as meeting ≥ 2 and pre-frailty as meeting one of the following four-item criteria: (1) slow walking; (2) muscular weakness; (3) exhaustion and (4) low physical activity. Intake was assessed by 24 h dietary recall. Food insufficiency was self-reported as ‘sometimes’ or ‘often’ not having enough food to eat. Analyses were adjusted for sex, race, age, smoking, education, income, BMI, other co-morbid conditions and complex survey design. Prevalence of frailty was highest among people who were obese (20·8 %), followed by overweight (18·4 %), normal weight (16·1 %) and lowest among people who were underweight (13·8 %). Independent of BMI, daily energy intake was lowest in people who were frail, followed by pre-frail and highest in people who were not frail (6648 (se 130), 6966 (se 79) and 7280 (se 84) kJ, respectively, P< 0·01). Energy-adjusted macronutrient intakes were similar in people with and without frailty. Frail (adjusted OR (AOR) 4·7; 95 % CI 1·7, 12·7) and pre-frail (AOR 2·1; 95 % CI 0·8, 5·8) people were more likely to report being food insufficient than not frail people. Serum albumin, carotenoids and Se levels were lower in frail adults than not frail adults. Research is needed on targeted interventions to improve nutritional status and food insufficiency among frail older adults, while not necessarily increasing BMI.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=88058075&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	318	British Journal of Nutrition		318	smit,ellen	smit	ellen
303	Challenges In End-Of-Life Care Management For Low-Income Frail Elders: A Case Study Of The Wisconsin Family Care Program.	2013	320	10.1177/0164027512446939			320	35	4	393	The need for well-coordinated care at the end of life is an important priority for meeting the needs of the growing number of low-income frail elders who are advancing in age. Partially integrated (Medicaid only) models of managed long-term care (MMLTC) are viewed as one promising and financially viable approach to enhance care coordination, yet we know little about the challenges that care managers face in managing the end-of-life care needs of poor elders. A case study design was used to explore challenges encountered in the provision of end-of-life care management for low-income elders enrolled in an innovative partially integrated model of long-term care, in Wisconsin, the Milwaukee County Family Care program. Data were collected via in-depth interviews with county administrators (n = 4) and selected lead supervisors or care managers (n = 7) and two focus groups with care management team members (n = 17). We identified five major themes representing essential challenges: (1) complexity of care and high level of support needs; (2) communication constraints in advance care planning; (3) family conflicts in end-of-life decision making for elders; (4) insufficient communication and collaboration between elders, families, teams, and service providers; and (5) limited bereavement and grief related support for families and teams after elders die. We discuss similarities and difference in the challenges reported here as compared to challenges reported in studies of other models of care and offer recommendations for program and policy development.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=88000044&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	320	Research on Aging		320	kwak,jung	kwak	jung
304	Geriatrics, Interprofessional Practice, And Interorganizational Collaboration: A Knowledge-To-Practice Intervention For Primary Care Teams.	2013	321	10.1002/chp.21183			321	33	3	180	Introduction: Caring for frail seniors requires health professionals with skills and knowledge in 3 core competencies: geriatrics, interprofessional practice, and interorganizational collaboration. Despite a growing population of frail seniors in all developed countries, significant gaps exist in preparation of health professionals in these skills. To help close these gaps, a knowledge-to-practice (KTP) process was undertaken to increase the capacity of newly created family health teams and longer standing Community Health Centers in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Methods: Each team identified a staff member to become its facilitator in the 3 core skill sets. Guided by a KTP framework, a set of training modules were created, compiled into a digital toolkit for transfer into practice, translated in a multimethods workshop, and implemented using a variety of strategies to optimize practice change. Results: Staff from 82% of the targeted primary care teams learned to use the toolkit in a train-the-facilitator process that was highly valued, and prompted a range of changes in personal and team practice. A digital toolkit for primary care teams remains an enduring and often used resource. Discussion: Closing the knowledge gap in the core competencies for frailty focused care is complex. A KTP framework helped guide a staged multimethod process that produced both individual and team practice change and on online toolkit that has a continuing influence.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=90547603&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	321	Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions	1	321	ryan,david	ryan	david
305	Insulin Resistance: A Risk Marker For Disease And Disability In The Older Person.	2013	322	10.1111/dme.12063			215	30	5	535	Clinical metabolic studies have demonstrated that insulin action declines progressively with age in humans. In addition to its close association with Type 2 diabetes, which reduces life expectancy in older people, age-related insulin resistance is implicated in pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders for which ageing is a major risk factor. These include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, dementia, frailty and cancer. Accordingly, insulin resistance may be viewed as biomarker of age-related ill health and reduced lifespan. The rapidly rising number of older people, coupled with a high prevalence of insulin resistance resulting from obesity and sedentary lifestyles, presents unprecedented public health and societal challenges. Studies of centenarians have shown that preserved whole-body sensitivity to insulin is associated with longevity. The mechanisms through which insulin action is associated with age-related diseases remain unclear. Changes in body composition, i.e. sarcopenia and excess adiposity, may be more potent than age per se. Moreover, the impact of insulin resistance has been difficult to disentangle from the clustering of vascular risk factors that co-segregate with the insulin resistance-hyperinsulinaemia complex. Potentially modifiable mediators of age-related changes in insulin sensitivity include alterations in adipocytokines, impaired skeletal myocyte mitochondrial function and brown fat activity. The hypothesis that improving or maintaining insulin sensitivity preserves health and extends lifespan merits further evaluation. Practical non-pharmacological interventions directed against age-related insulin resistance remain underdeveloped. Novel metabolically active pharmacological agents with theoretical implications for some age-related disorders are entering clinical trials. However, recent adverse experiences with the thiazolidinediones suggest the need for a cautious approach to the use of insulin sensitizing drugs in older people. This could be particularly important in the absence of diabetes where the risk to benefit analysis may be less favourable.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=86980487&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	215	Diabetic Medicine		322	krentz,a.j	krentz	a.j
306	Challenges Of Antibiotic Prescribing For Assisted Living Residents: Perspectives Of Providers, Staff, Residents, And Family Members.	2013	323	10.1111/jgs.12159			144	61	4	565	Objectives To better understand the antibiotic prescribing process in assisted living ( AL) communities given the growing rate of antibiotic resistance. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Four AL communities in North Carolina. Participants Assisted living residents who received antibiotics (n = 30) from October 20, 2010, to March 31, 2011, a primary family member, staff, and the prescribing medical provider. Measurements Semistructured interviews that were conducted regarding prescribing included the information available at the time of prescribing and the perceptions of the quality of communication between providers, staff, residents and family members about the resident. Providers were asked an open-ended question regarding how to improve the communication process related to antibiotic prescribing for AL residents. Results For the 30 residents who received antibiotic prescriptions, providers often had limited information about the case and lacked familiarity with the residents, the residents' families, and staff. They also felt that cases were less severe and less likely to require an antibiotic than did residents, families, and staff. Providers identified several ways to improve the communication process, including better written documentation and staff and family presence. Conclusion In a small sample of AL communities, providers faced an array of challenges in making antibiotic prescribing decisions. This work confirms the complex nature of antibiotic prescribing in AL communities and indicates that further work is needed to determine how to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=86981264&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		323	kistler,christine.e	kistler	christine.e
307	2012 – That Was The Year That Was.	2013	324	10.1093/ageing/afs201			161	42	2	140	Geriatric medicine has an encyclopaedic sweep, reflecting the complexity of both the ageing process and of our patient group. Keeping up with, and making sense of, the relevant scientific literature is challenging, especially as ageing has increased in prominence as a focus of research across many branches of the sciences and the humanities. This review of research published in 2012 in generalist, geriatric medicine and gerontology journals has been compiled with a view to extracting those aspects of research into ageing which could be considered relevant not only to the practice of geriatric medicine, but also to our understanding of the ageing process and the relationship of geriatric medicine to other medical specialties and public health. The research discussed includes new insights into global ageing and the compression of morbidity; nosological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of dementia; an innovative study on the microbiome and ageing; epidemiological perspectives into multi-morbidity; an overview of the impact of the first waves of Baby Boomers; fresh thinking on geriatric syndromes such as orthostatic hypotension, kyphosis, urinary incontinence after stroke, frailty and elder abuse; an update of the Beers criteria and the first stirrings of recognition of the longevity dividend in the biomedical literature.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=85655713&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	161	Age & Ageing		324	o'neill,desmond	o'neill	desmond

310	Palliative And Therapeutic Harmonization: A Model For Appropriate Decision-Making In Frail Older Adults.	2012	327	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04210.x			144	60	12	2326	Frail older adults face increasingly complex decisions regarding medical care. The Palliative and Therapeutic Harmonization ( PATH) model provides a structured approach that places frailty at the forefront of medical and surgical decision-making in older adults. Preliminary data from the first 150 individuals completing the PATH program shows that the population served is frail (mean Clinical Frailty Score = 6.3), has multiple comorbidities (mean 8), and takes many medications (mean = 9). Ninety-two percent of participants were able to complete decision-making for an average of three current or projected health issues, most often (76.7%) with the help of a substitute decision-maker ( SDM). Decisions to proceed with scheduled medical or surgical interventions correlated with baseline frailty level and dementia stage, with participants with a greater degree of frailty (odds ratio ( OR) = 3.41, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 1.39-8.38) or more-advanced stage of dementia ( OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.06-2.65) being more likely to choose less-aggressive treatment options. Although the PATH model is in the development stage, further evaluation is ongoing, including a qualitative analysis of the SDM experience of PATH and an assessment of the effectiveness of PATH in long-term care. The results of these studies will inform the design of a larger randomized controlled trial.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=84186989&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		327	moorhouse,paige	moorhouse	paige
311	The Association Between Geriatric Syndromes And Survival.	2012	329	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.03942.x			144	60	5	896	Objectives To ascertain the effect on survival of eight common geriatric syndromes (multiple comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, sarcopenia, malnutrition, homeostenosis, and chronic inflammation), identified by an expert panel of academic geriatricians. Design A systematic literature review sought studies from a variety of sources to compare survival and life expectancy of individuals with geriatric syndromes with those of the general population. Setting Studies used reflected the general population. Participants Community-dwelling persons aged 65 and older. Measurements Eight geriatric syndromes (multiple definitions) and survival. Results Two thousand three hundred seventy-four publications were retrieved, and 509 publications of 123 studies were included. Seven geriatric syndromes (multiple comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, malnutrition, impaired homeostasis, and chronic inflammation) were associated with poor survival. In each case, the prevalence of a syndrome was negatively associated with mortality. Malnutrition and impaired homeostasis exerted twice the influence of factors such as multiple comorbidities and frailty. From age 65 to 74, only those who are very ill or frail (e.g., impaired homeostasis, low body mass index, or advanced dementia) have a higher risk of mortality than average older adults. In the old-old, particularly aged 90 and older, the added value of predicting survival beyond 1 year is minimal. Conclusion Geriatric syndrome information is helpful to understanding survival for younger old persons but provides little information about survival for the very old. Complex survival models add comparatively little benefit to more simply measured and calculated models.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=75232505&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		329	kane,robert.l	kane	robert.l
312	Physicians’ Attitudes Toward Aging, The Aged, And The Provision Of Geriatric Care: A Systematic Narrative Review.	2012	330	10.1080/09581596.2010.539592			330	22	1	61	As the number of older adults in the population increases, the rate of medical care use is expected to rise. As a result, geriatricians and gerontologists are researching predictors of medical care in later life, which includes ageism. Ageism within health care has been widely and frequently reported and it is thought to be a product of negative attitudes toward aging. The current review systematically explores the existing literature in this area and establishes seven themes within the research. From a predominantly American population of papers, themes that emerged were the following: physicians’ attitudes toward aging are complex and mixed; mixed associations among attitude, knowledge, and medical care; aging and disease symptom attributions among physicians; attitudes, knowledge, and exposure to older adults; the role of role models; the influence of the health care culture; and the influence of the health care system. These themes were considered separately and in tandem in order to explore avenues for future research that will clarify the influence that these psychosocial factors have on health care provided to older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=71517162&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	330	Critical Public Health		330	meisner,brada	meisner	brada

Too few ED staff are trained to deal with the complex comorbidities associated with older patients, 90 per cent of whom are therefore admitted to hospital. To take the pressure off the ED and reduce the number of avoidable admissions, the hospital has set up an emergency frailty unit to treat patients over the age of 70 who need not be admitted to hospital and to ensure they can receive community care as soon as possible. This article describes how the unit operates.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=71886582&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	3	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	331	Emergency Nurse	1	331	blakemore,sophie	blakemore	sophie
314	Challenging Gait Conditions Predict 1-Year Decline In Gait Speed In Older Adults With Apparently Normal Gait.	2011	332	10.2522/ptj.20100387			281	91	12	1857	Background. Mobility often is tested under a low challenge condition (ie, over a straight, uncluttered path), which often fails to identify early mobility difficulty. Tests of walking during challenging conditions may uncover mobility difficulty that is not identified with usual gait testing. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether gait during challenging conditions predicts decline in gait speed over 1 year in older people with apparently normal gait (ie, gait speed of ≥ 1.0 m/s). Design. This was a prospective cohort study. Methods. Seventy-one older adults (mean age=75.9 years) with a usual gait speed of ≥1.0 m/s participated. Gait was tested at baseline under 4 challenging conditions: (1) narrow walk (15 cm wide), (2) stepping over obstacles (15.24 cm [6 in] and 30.48 cm [12 in]), (3) simple walking while talking (WWT), and (4) complex WWT. Usual gait speed was recorded over a 4-m course at baseline and 1 year later. A 1-year change in gait speed was calculated, and participants were classified as declined (decreased ≥ 0.10 m/s, n=18), stable (changed <0.10 m/s, n=43), or improved (increased ≥0.10 m/s, n=10). Analysis of variance was used to compare challenging condition cost (usual -- challenging condition gait speed difference) among the 3 groups. Results. Participants who declined in the ensuing year had a greater narrow walk and obstacle walk cost than those who were stable or who improved in gait speed (narrow walk cost=0.43 versus 0.33 versus 0.22 m/s and obstacle walk cost=0.35 versus 0.26 versus 0.13 m/s). Simple and complex WWT cost did not differ among the groups. Limitations. The participants who declined in gait speed over time walked the fastest, and those who improved walked the slowest at baseline; thus, the potential contribution of regression to the mean to the findings should not be overlooked. Conclusions. In older adults with apparently normal gait, the assessment of gait during challenging conditions appears to uncover mobility difficulty that is not identified by usual gait testing.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=70251284&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	281	Physical Therapy		332	brach,jennifer.s	brach	jennifer.s

316	Biobehavioral Aspects Of Health And Aging Among People Of Mexican Origin.	2011	334	10.1177/0898264311423370			242	23	7	1019	There is a growing interest in developing a deeper level of understanding of the complex phenomena that make up the aging process. Efforts to pursue questions using a multivariate and ecologically valid approaches that include biological and behavioral factors have led to significant advances in our knowledge. This special issue presents a collection of papers that represent this “biobehavioral” perspective. Little is known concerning the biobehavioral aspects of Hispanic health and there is a dearth of systematic study of how individual biological factors interact with the environmental and cultural factors to affect health outcomes among the swiftly growing older population of Mexican origin, a subgroup of older minorities that exhibits unique morbidity and mortality patterns. The group of papers here represents important contributions to understanding the health consequences in later life for individuals of Mexican descent and addresses several areas of interest including but not limited to diabetes, cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome, frailty, socio-economic status and contextual factors that impact health. The papers presented here use interesting and useful transdisciplinary approaches that increase our knowledge of health processes in older people of Mexican descent. This special issue also provides excellent examples of the critical linkages between biological variables broadly defined and traditional social stratification, social inequalities, and social justice and the ways in which they interact. The papers taken together suggest that the processes involved in aging and health are complex, particularly in people of Mexican descent, and requires the understanding of mechanisms at multiple causes and levels of analysis.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=66817069&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	242	Journal of Aging & Health		334	whitfield,keith.e	whitfield	keith.e
317	Exploring Biologically Relevant Pathways In Frailty.	2011	335				210	66A	9	975	Background. Frailty is a late-life syndrome of vulnerability to adverse health outcomes characterized by a phenotype that includes muscle weakness, fatigue, and inflammatory pathway activation. The identification of biologically relevant pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically relevant pathways that contribute to frailty. Methods. Based on current understanding of the physiological basis of frailty, we hypothesize that variation in genes related to inflammation and muscle maintenance would associate with frailty. One thousand three hundred and fifty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped across 134 candidate genes using the Illumina Genotyping platform, and the rank order by strength of association between frailty and genotype was determined in a cross-sectional study. Results. Although no single-nucleotide polymorphism reached study-wide significance after controlling family-wise false-discovery rate at 0.05, single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), Caspase 8 (CASP8), CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), and beta-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) loci were among those strongly associated with frailty. Conclusions. The apoptosis– and transcription regulation–related pathways highlighted by this preliminary analysis were consistent with prior gene expression studies in a frail mouse model and provide useful etiological insights for future biological studies of frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=64855331&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		335	ho,yen-yi	ho	yen-yi
318	Contextual Factors Influencing Success Or Failure Of Emergency Department Interventions For Cognitively Impaired Older People: A Scoping And Integrative Review.	2011	336	10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05611.x			193	67	7	1426	Aim. This paper is a report of a scoping review of research on cognitive impairment in older adults who visit Emergency Departments of acute care hospitals, followed by an integrative review that included a quality assessment to determine the effectiveness of interventions for this population. Background. Being old and cognitively impaired in the Emergency Department -- a fast-paced intervention system -- is a complex phenomenon that challenges many healthcare professionals. The rise in the incidence and prevalence of dementia will have a large impact on healthcare systems. Data sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, AgeLine, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2008, for qualitative or quantitative studies reporting extractable data on delirium or dementia in non-institutionalized older people (65+ years) in the Emergency Department. Review methods. Titles screened by a project researcher and checked against inclusion criteria by another researcher. Two reviewers completed independent data extraction and synthesis of included studies. Quality assessment occurred using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tools. Results. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for integrative review. Analysis of these studies indicates that the prevalence of cognitive impairment is high and improvements are needed. Contextual details and relevant features of an appropriate intervention are poorly explained. Conclusion. Although the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment is recognized, appropriate interventions and programmatic responses remain elusive. Quality improvements require more thorough examination of emergency department context to identify modifiable influencing factors that are transferable across settings.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=61195488&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	193	Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1	336	parke,belinda	parke	belinda
319	Frailty Scales -- Their Potential In Interprofessional Working With Older People: A Discussion Paper.	2011	337	10.3109/13561820.2011.562332			231	25	4	280	New models of interprofessional working are continuously being proposed to address the burgeoning health and social care needs of older people with complex and long-term health conditions. Evaluations of the effectiveness of these models tend to focus on process measures rather than outcomes for the older person. This discussion paper argues that the concept of frailty, and measures based on it, may provide a more user-centred tool for the evaluation of interprofessional services -- a tool that cuts across unidisciplinary preoccupations and definitions of effectiveness. Numerous frailty scales have been developed for case identification and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes. We suggest that they may also be particularly suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of interprofessional working with community-dwelling older people. Several exemplars of frailty scales that might serve this purpose are identified, and their potential contributions and limitations are discussed. Further work is required to establish which is the most suitable scales for this application. The development of an appropriate frailty scale could provide an opportunity for interprofessional debate about the forms of care and treatment that should be prioritised to improve the health and well-being of this population.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=61407023&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	231	Journal of Interprofessional Care	1	337	poltawski,leon	poltawski	leon
320	A Tentative Consensus-Based Model For Priority Setting: An Example From Elderly Patients With Myocardial Infarction And Multi-Morbidity.	2011	339	10.1177/1403494811405092			339	39	4	345	Background: In most Western countries the growing gap between available resources and greater potential for medical treatment has brought evidence-based guidelines into focus. However, such guidelines are difficult to use when the evidence base is weak. Priority setting for frail elderly patients with heart disease illustrates this problem. We have outlined a tentative model for priority setting regarding frail elderly heart patients. The model takes cardiovascular risk, frailty, and comorbidity into account. Objective: Our aim is to validate the model’s components. We want to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of the study experts’ rankings regarding each of the model’s categories. Methods: A confidential questionnaire study consisting of 15 authentic and validated cases was conducted to assess the views of purposefully selected cardiology experts (n = 58). They were asked to rank the cases regarding the need for coronary angiography using their individual clinical experience. The response rate was 71%. Responses were analysed with frequencies and descriptive statistics. The inter-rater reliability regarding the experts’ rankings of the cases was estimated via an intra-class correlation test (ICC). Results: The cardiologists considered the clinical cases to be realistic. The intra-class correlation (two-way random, consistency, average measure) was 0.978 (95% CI 0.958—0.991), which denotes a very good inter-rater reliability on the group level. The model’s components were considered relevant regarding complex cases of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Comorbidity was considered to be the most relevant component, frailty the second most relevant, followed by cardiovascular risk. Conclusions: A framework taking comorbidity, frailty, and cardiovascular risk into account could constitute a foundation for consensus-based guidelines for frail elderly heart patients. From a priority setting perspective, it is reasonable to believe that the framework is applicable to other groups of elderly patients with acute disease and complex needs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=66335932&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	339	Scandinavian Journal of Public Health		339	ekerstad,niklas	ekerstad	niklas
321	An Aging Renal Population - Is Dialysis Always The Answer?	2011	340	10.12968/bjon.2011.20.9.545			208	20	9	545	As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=60600095&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	208	British Journal of Nursing	1	340	noble,helen	noble	helen

PACE is an innovative, person-centered approach to comprehensively meeting the medical and long-term-care needs of older adults with complex, chronic conditions, and functional or cognitive disabilities. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) presents opportunities to raise awareness of PACE and test variations on the current PACE model. PACE organizations also can be a resource to policy makers because they have implemented several of the delivery system reforms and concepts in the ACA, such as accountable care, health homes, and patient-centeredness.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=62847051&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	303	Generations		342	bloom,shawn	bloom	shawn
324	Unravelling The Differences Between Complexity And Frailty In Old Age: Findings From A Constructivist Grounded Theory Study.	2011	343	10.1111/j.1365-2850.2010.01630.x			343	18	1	67	UK health policy has used the terms 'frailty' and 'complexity' synonymously but there is no common definition for either. Understanding these concepts is important if demand for health care created by the increasing number of older people in society is to be managed effectively. This paper explores some findings from a study into how mental health nurses who work with older people construct and operationalize the concept of 'age-related complexity'. Constructivist grounded theory was used. Audio-taped interviews were undertaken with 13 registered nurses and were analysed using a constant comparative method. This paper addresses the relationship between frailty and complexity, which was identified as a theme within the category 'dynamic complexity'. The findings suggest that nurses understand important differences between the two concepts. Frailty is exclusively used to describe physical states while complexity is a more encompassing term that has resonance and relevance in mental health services. The dynamic nature of complexity means that older people can become both more and less complex and this has implications for nursing practice that require further study.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=57220072&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	2	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	343	Journal of Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)	1	343	mcgeorge,s.j	mcgeorge	s.j
325	National Survey Of Geriatric Medicine Fellowship Programs: Comparing Findings In 2006/07 And 2001/02 From The American Geriatrics Society And Association Of Directors Of Geriatric Academic Programs Geriatrics Workforce Policy Studies Center Bragg Et Al. Geriatric Medicine Fellowship Programs	2010	344	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03126.x			144	58	11	2166	This article documents the development of geriatric medicine fellowship training in the United States through 2009. Results from a national cross-sectional survey of all geriatric medicine fellowship training programs conducted in 2007 is compared with results from a similar survey in 2002. Secondary data sources were used to supplement the survey results. The 2007 survey response rate was 71%. Sixty-seven percent of responding programs directors have completed formal geriatric medicine fellowship training and are board certified in geriatrics, and 29% are board certified through the practice pathway. The number of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited fellowship programs has slowly increased, from 120 (23 family medicine (FM) and 97 internal medicine (IM)) in 2001/02 to 145 in 2008/09 (40 FM and 105 IM), resulting in a 21% increase in fellowship programs and a 13% increase in the number of first-year fellows (259 to 293). In 2008/09, the growth in programs and first-year slots, combined with the weak demand for geriatrics training, resulted in more than one-third of first-year fellow positions being unfilled. The number of advanced fellows decreased slightly from 72 in 2001/00 to 65 in 2006/07. In 2006/07, 55% of the advanced fellows were enrolled at four training programs. In 2008/09, 66% of fellows were international medical school graduates. The small numbers of graduating geriatric medicine fellows are insufficient to care for the expanding population of older frail patients, train other disciples in the care of complex older adults, conduct research in aging, and be leaders in the field.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=55022253&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		344	bragg,elizabeth.j	bragg	elizabeth.j
326	Developing And Evaluating Complex Healthcare Interventions In Geriatrics: The Use Of The Medical Research Council Framework Exemplified On A Complex Fall Prevention Intervention Faes Et Al. Developing And Evaluating Geriatric Interventions.	2010	345	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03108.x			144	58	11	2212	Geriatrics focuses on a variety of multiorgan problems in a heterogeneous older population. Therefore, most geriatric healthcare interventions are complex interventions. The UK Medical Research Council (MRC) has developed a framework to systematically design, evaluate, and implement complex interventions. This article provides an overview of this framework and illustrates its use in geriatrics by showing how it was used to develop and evaluate a fall prevention intervention. The consecutive phases of the framework are described: Phase I: Development. This phase began with a literature review, which provided the existing evidence and the theoretical understanding of the process of change. This understanding was further developed through focus groups with experts and interviews with patients and caregivers. The intervention was modeled using qualitative testing of the preliminary intervention through focus groups and through the completion of Delphi surveys by independent specialists. Phase II: Feasibility and piloting. In this phase, a pilot study was conducted in a group of patients and caregivers. The feasibility of the intervention and evaluation was also discussed in focus groups of participants and instructors. Phase III: Evaluation. The information from phases I and II shaped the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention. Phase IV: Dissemination. The purpose of the final phase is to examine the implementation of the intervention into practice. The MRC framework provides an innovative and useful methodology for the development and evaluation of complex geriatric interventions that deserves greater dissemination and implementation.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=55022251&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		345	faes,miriam.c	faes	miriam.c
327	Practical Approaches To Pharmacologic Management Of Pain In Older Adults With Cancer.	2010	346	10.1188/10.ONF.S1.17-26			346	37		17	Purpose/Objectives: To identify appropriate strategies for pharmacotherapeutic agents in the management of pain in older adults with cancer.Data Sources: PubMed literature searches, personal reference collection, and clinical experience.Data Synthesis: To make good decisions about pain management when developing treatment plans for older adults, healthcare providers should focus on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in the context of the physiologic changes that occur with aging.Conclusions: Unrelieved pain can have a detrimental effect on older adults; conversely, overmedicating can lead to an increased risk of adverse events. With advancing age, physiologic changes alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs by reducing their absorption, changing their distribution, and modifying their metabolism and elimination. Also, common comorbidities increase the risk of pharmacologic toxicity and narrow the therapeutic window. In addition, polypharmacy—an issue more common in older adults—increases the complexity of prescribing and risk of adverse events. Consequently, older adults require individualization of their pharmacotherapies. Healthcare providers should consider carefully the risks and benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjuvants before initiating an analgesic trial. The 2009 guidelines published by the American Geriatrics Society described several key principles for prescribing analgesics to older adults and offered specific recommendations and caveats for each drug class.Implications for Nursing: Current guidelines support appropriate management of cancer pain in older adults with specific recommendations for each class of analgesics as well as general prescribing principles.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=53296872&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	346	Oncology Nursing Forum	1	346	brant,jeannine.m	brant	jeannine.m
328	Care Management'S Challenges And Opportunities To Reduce The Rapid Rehospitalization Of Frail Community-Dwelling Older Adults.	2010	347	10.1093/geront/gnq015			178	50	4	451	Community-based frail older adults, burdened with complex medical and social needs, are at great risk for preventable rapid rehospitalizations. Although federal and state regulations are in place to address the care transitions between the hospital and nursing home, no such guidelines exist for the much larger population of community-dwelling frail older adults. Few studies have looked at interventions to prevent rehospitalizations in this large segment of the older adult population. Similarly, standardized disease management approaches that lower hospitalization rates in an independent adult population may not suffice for guiding the care of frail persons. Care management interventions currently face unique challenges in their attempt to improve the transitional care of community-dwelling older adults. However, impending national imperatives aimed at reducing potentially avoidable hospitalizations will soon demand and reward care management strategies that identify frail persons early in the discharge process and promote the sharing of critical information among patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. Opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of care-related communications must focus on the effective blending of training and technology for improving communications vital to successful care transitions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=52553410&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	178	Gerontologist		347	golden,adam.g	golden	adam.g

The complexity of center of pressure (COP) dynamics, as quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE), during quiet standing is lower in older adults, especially those with falls. We hypothesized that COP dynamics from frail elderly individuals demonstrate less complexity than those from nonfrail elderly controls; complexity decreases when performing a dual task; and postural complexity during quiet standing is independent of other conventional correlates of balance control, such as age and vision.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=47451679&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		349	hyun,gu.kang	hyun	gu.kang
330	Nonlinear Multisystem Physiological Dysregulation Associated With Frailty In Older Women: Implications For Etiology And Treatment.	2009	352	10.1093/gerona/glp076			210	64A	10	1049	Background. Frailty in older adults, defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms, is associated with abnormal levels in individual physiological systems. We tested the hypothesis that it is the critical mass of physiological systems abnormal that is associated with frailty, over and above the status of each individual system, and that the relationship is nonlinear. Methods. Using data on women aged 70 - 79 years from the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and II, multiple analytic approaches assessed the cross-sectional association of frailty with eight physiological measures. Results. Abnormality in each system (anemia, inflammation, insulin-like growth factor-1, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, hemoglobin A1c, micronutrients, adiposity, and fine motor speed) was significantly associated with frailty status. However, adjusting for the level of each system measure, the mean number of systems impaired significantly and nonlinearly predicted frailty. Those with three or more systems impaired were most likely to be frail, with odds of frailty increasing with number of systems at abnormal level, from odds ratios (ORs) of 4.8 to 11 to 26 for those with one to two, three to four, and five or more systems abnormal (p < .05 for all). Finally, two subgroups were identified, one with isolated or no systems abnormal and a second (in 30%) with multiple systems abnormal. The latter group was independently associated with being frail (OR = 2.6, p < .05), adjusting for confounders and chronic diseases and then controlling for individual systems. Conclusions. Overall, these findings indicate that the likelihood of frailty increases nonlinearly in relationship to the number of physiological systems abnormal, and the number of abnormal systems is more predictive than the individual abnormal system. These findings support theories that aggregate loss of complexity, with aging, in physiological systems is an important cause of frailty. Implications are that a threshold loss of complexity, as indicated by number of systems abnormal, may undermine homeostatic adaptive capacity, leading to the development of frailty and its associated risk for subsequent adverse outcomes. It further suggests that replacement of any one deficient system may not be sufficient to prevent or ameliorate frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=45226757&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		352	fried,linda.p	fried	linda.p
331	Hypertensive Management In The Elderly Patient At Risk For Falls.	2009	353	10.1111/j.1745-7599.2009.00418.x			353	21	7	402	Purpose: Seventy percent of people over 65 years of age have hypertension, and one third of elders fall each year. These conditions frequently coexist, and each carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with hypertension. Data sources: A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. Conclusions: Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication management accordingly. Implications for practice: This article will assist the NP to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=42419136&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	3	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	353	Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners	1	353	sirkin,amy.j	sirkin	amy.j
332	Frailty And Impaired Cardiac Autonomic Control: New Insights From Principal Components Aggregation Of Traditional Heart Rate Variability Indices.	2009	354	10.1093/gerona/glp013			210	64A	6	682	Background. Age-related deterioration in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms leads to decreased complexity in their output. For example, the degradation of cardiac autonomic control results in loss of complexity in the heart rate signal. Frailty is a state of critically impaired homeostasis that results in heightened vulnerability to stressors. We propose a new measure of heart rate variability (HRV) to capture the impairment in cardiac autonomic control associated with frailty. Methods. Traditional time and frequency domain indices of HRV were obtained from 2-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 276 women (65-101 years old) in the Women's Health and Aging Study-I. Principal components analysis was conducted on the correlation matrix of HRV indices. Frailty was defined using a validated instrument. Regression models were used to evaluate associations of HRV measures with age, frailty, and 5-year mortality. Results. The first two principal components (PCs), PC1 and PC2, explained 90% of the variance in HRV indices. PC1 is the mean of log-transformed HRV indices. PC2 is a linear combination of log-transformed indices, with positive weights for very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), and negative weights for high frequency (HF), root-mean-squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and proportion of all N-N intervals that are larger than 50 ms (pNN50). Decreases in SDNN, VLF, LF, and LF/HF were associated with an increased risk of frailty. PC2 was more strongly associated with age (ß = -.23, p < .001) and frailty (ß = -.73, p < 10-5) than were the individual HRV indices and LFIHF. PC2 was also the best predictor of 5-year mortality (ß = -.60 < p < 10-6). Conclusions. Cardiac autonomic control, as reflected by HRV, is impaired in frailty. A new measure derived from PC aggregation of traditional HRV indices provides a compact summary of this impairment.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=40838481&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		354	varadhan,ravi	varadhan	ravi
333	A Comparison Of Frailty Indexes For The Prediction Of Falls, Disability, Fractures, And Mortality In Older Men.	2009	355	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2009.02137.x			144	57	3	492	OBJECTIVES: To compare the validity of a parsimonious frailty index (components: weight loss, inability to rise from a chair, and poor energy (Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) index)) with that of the more complex Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) index (components: unintentional weight loss, low grip strength, poor energy, slowness, and low physical activity) for prediction of adverse outcomes in older men. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Six U.S. centers. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand one hundred thirty-two men aged 67 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty status categorized as robust, intermediate stage, or frail using the SOF index and criteria similar to those used in CHS index. Falls were reported three times for 1 year. Disability (≥1 new impairments in performing instrumental activities of daily living) ascertained at 1 year. Fractures and deaths ascertained during 3 years of follow-up. Analysis of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistics compared for models containing the SOF index versus those containing the CHS index. RESULTS: Greater evidence of frailty as defined by either index was associated with greater risk of adverse outcomes. Frail men had a higher age-adjusted risk of recurrent falls (odds ratio (OR)=3.0–3.6), disability (OR=5.3–7.5), nonspine fracture (hazard ratio (HR)=2.2–2.3), and death (HR=2.5–3.5) ( P<.001 for all models). AUC comparisons revealed no differences between models with the SOF index and models with the CHS index in discriminating falls (AUC=0.63, P=.97), disability (AUC=0.68, P=.86), nonspine fracture (AUC=0.63, P=.90), or death (AUC=0.71 for model with SOF index and 0.72 for model with CHS index, P=.19). CONCLUSION: The simple SOF index predicts risk of falls, disability, fracture, and mortality in men as well as the more-complex CHS index.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=36790995&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		355	ensrud,kristine.e	ensrud	kristine.e
334	Which Patients Benefit The Most From A Geriatrician'S Care? Consensus Among Directors Of Geriatrics Academic Programs.	2008	356	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01940.x			144	56	10	1796	Given the anticipated limited availability of geriatricians for the foreseeable future, how should the geriatrician's specialized clinical skills be deployed to optimally benefit the health of our aging population? Directors of geriatrics academic programs (DGAPs) at all 145 U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were asked this question as part of a winter 2007 on-line survey. The DGAPs were to indicate the types of patients who would most benefit from a geriatrician's services in three practice situations: primary care, consultations, and care in the hospital. The survey response rate was 74.5%. There was high consensus among the DGAPs on the benefits of having a geriatrician care for the most complex and vulnerable older adults in primary care and hospital settings. There was slightly less consensus as to when geriatrics consultations are beneficial. The patient subsets that were viewed as benefiting the most from geriatrician care were aged 85 and older, frailty, geriatric syndromes, severe functional impairment, and complexity. The results of this survey suggest that, because of the predicted shortage of geriatricians, the DGAPs would target geriatricians to work with the most vulnerable older adults. These findings offer the beginning of a consensus statement as to the role of geriatricians in the continuum of American medical care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=34571692&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		356	warshaw,gregg.a	warshaw	gregg.a
335	Physiological Complexity Underlying Heart Rate Dynamics And Frailty Status In Community-Dwelling Older Women.	2008	357	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01858.x			144	56	9	1698	OBJECTIVES: To assess whether less physiological complexity underlying regulation of heart rate dynamics, as indicated by lower approximate entropy for heart rate (ApEnHR), is associated with frailty. For supporting validity, relationships between frailty and traditional linear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were also assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, a community-based observational study, 1992 to 1995. PARTICIPANTS: Subset of 389 community-dwelling women aged years and older with moderate to severe disability with ApEnHR data (convenience sampling). MEASUREMENTS: Electrocardiographic Holter recordings obtained over 2- to 3-hour periods were processed for ApEnHR and HRV measures. ApEnHR is a nonlinear statistic that quantifies the regularity of heart rate fluctuations over time. Lower ApEnHR is characteristic of heart rate time series containing a high proportion of repetitive patterns. Frailty was defined according to validated phenotype criteria. RESULTS: Median ApEnHR was lower in frail than in nonfrail subjects ( P=.02). Lower ApEnHR (top quartile) was associated with lower likelihood of frailty than higher ApEnHR (bottom three quartiles) (odds ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval=0.26–0.86), even after adjustment for major confounders. Frailty was consistently associated with lower HRV as assessed using time- and frequency-domain indices. CONCLUSION: This study supports the notion that less physiological complexity marks frailty and provides an empirical basis to the concept of frailty as a syndrome of homeostatic impairment. Future research will determine whether noninvasive measures of physiological complexity underlying heart rate dynamics might be useful for screening and monitoring of clinical vulnerability in older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=34137572&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		357	chaves,paulo.h.m	chaves	paulo.h.m
336	Elisa And Multiplex Technologies For Cytokine Measurement In Inflammation And Aging Research.	2008	358	10.1093/gerona/63.8.879			210	63	8	879	Over the last decade there has been !in enormous expansion of research focused on defining the role of inflammation in aging, age-related diseases, disability, and frailty. The availability of methods to measure cytokines and other inflammatory mediators or markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critically important. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the most widely used and best validated method, is limited by its ability to measure only a single protein in each sample. Recent developments in serum cytokine quantification technology include multiplex arrays, which offer the potential of better evaluating the complexity and dynamic nature of inflammatory responses and offer substantial cost and sample savings over traditional ELISA measurements. Despite potential advantages of this new technology, experience with these techniques is limited, and it has not emerged to date as the gold standard in inflammatory mediator measurement. This article reviews ELISA and the emerging multiplex technologies, compares the cost and effectiveness of recently developed multiplex arrays with traditional ELISA technology, and provides specific recommendations for investigators interested in measuring serum inflammatory mediators in older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=34637414&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		358	leng,sean.x	leng	sean.x

338	Patient And Carer Perceptions Of Case Management For Long-Term Conditions.	2007	360	10.1111/j.1365-2524.2007.00708.x			18	15	6	511	Nurse-led case management programmes have become increasingly popular over the last 15 years. Countries such as the USA, Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands have long running case management programmes in place for frail elderly people. The Department of Health in England has recently introduced a ‘community matron’ role to provide case management to patients with highly complex long-term conditions; a group that is predominantly comprised of elderly people. Department of Health policy documents do not define the day-to-day role of community matrons but instead describe the objectives and principles of case management for long-term conditions. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe case management from the perspective of patients and carers in order to develop a clearer understanding of how the model is being delivered for patients with long-term conditions. In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 72 patients and 52 carers who had experience of case management. Five categories of case management tasks emerged from the data: clinical care, co-ordination of care, education, advocacy and psychosocial support. Psychosocial support was emphasised by both patients and carers, and was viewed as equally important to clinical care. Patient and carer perceptions of case management appear to contrast with descriptions contained in Department of Health guidance, suggesting an ‘implementation surplus’ in relation to the policy. This particularly appears to be the case for psychosocial support activities, which are not described in official policy documents. The provision of significant psychosocial support by community matrons also appears to differentiate the model from most other case management programmes for frail elderly people described in the literature. The findings emphasise the importance of seeking patient and carer input when designing new case management programmes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=27096208&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	360	sargent,penny	sargent	penny
339	Geriatric Syndromes: Clinical, Research, And Policy Implications Of A Core Geriatric Concept.	2007	361	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01156.x			144	55	5	780	Geriatricians have embraced the term “geriatric syndrome,” using it extensively to highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors—older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility—were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=24891873&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		361	inouye,sharon.k	inouye	sharon.k

To improve accessibility and delivery of comprehensive, focused injury prevention, we developed a model incorporating applicable features of our national children's program with additional elements to address challenges of older populations. The older adult injury prevention model addresses gaps in prevention by improving access to risk factor screening, safety devices, education, counseling, medical care, and referrals.

341	Older Women And ‘Frailty‘: Aged, Gendered And Embodied Resistance.	2007	363	10.1177/0011392107073303			363	55	2	211	The concept of ‘frailty’, as used within public health and social services, represents a powerful practice where cultural constructions, the global economic rationale of cost restriction and the biomedical focus on ageing collide as inscriptions on the bodies of older women. This article draws on complex forms of resistance witnessed within three separate studies: narrative interviews on ‘frailty’, semi-structured interviews and participant observation in community organizations with older women in Montreal and Boston. Findings reveal how older women exercise resistance in complex ways, both consciously subverting and coopting the notion of ‘frailty’ on an individual and collective level. Such resistance demonstrates the tensions between undermining dominant notions of ageing, and fulfilling prescribed gendered and age-based assumptions about older women and their bodies. The intersections and forms of older women's resistance challenge social constructs, social expectations and what is recognized as resistance.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=24511917&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	363	Current Sociology		363	grenier,amanda	grenier	amanda
342	Sequential Linear Stapling Technique For Perineal Resection Of Intractable Pediatric Rectal Prolapse.	2006	365	10.1177/000313480607201212			365	72	12	1212	Rectal prolapse (RP), although most frequently encountered in the frail elderly, may also occur in children. This condition is most troublesome in the premature infant with significant associated comorbidities. Pediatric RP most often can be managed conservatively with expectant and/or judicious use of laxative-based bowel regimens. In rare instances of intractable RP, surgical intervention ranging from simple (sclerotherapy, Thiersch wire) to complex (perineal or transabdominal bowel resection) becomes necessary. We describe a modification of the Altemeier technique using a novel sequential linear stapling technique to treat intractable RP in a 5.0-kg infant with severe coexisting life-threatening comorbidities. The child had resumption of bowel movements on postoperative Day 1 and has had no recurrences. Sequential linear stapling technique for perineal resection of intractable pediatric RP appears to be a safe and potentially attractive alternative.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=23474055&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	365	American Surgeon		365	jong,in.lee	jong	in.lee
343	Detrusor Underactivity: Clinical Features And Pathogenesis Of An Underdiagnosed Geriatric Condition.	2006	366	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2006.00917.x			144	54	12	1920	Urinary incontinence and other lower urinary tract symptoms exert a major influence on the health and independence of frail older people. Detrusor underactivity (DU) is defined as a contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or a failure to achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span. DU may influence the clinical presentation and impede the therapy of disorders as common and as disparate as detrusor overactivity, urinary retention, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Urodynamically, nearly two-thirds of incontinent nursing home residents exhibit DU. The clinical diagnosis of DU when present alone or in association with other bladder conditions such as detrusor overactivity (detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility (DHIC)) is challenging, because symptoms lack adequate precision. A catheterized and increasingly noninvasive ultrasound-based postvoid residual assessment allows a bedside diagnosis of retention and may suggest the presence of DU in individuals (mostly women) with a low likelihood of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). Nevertheless, it cannot differentiate primary DU from retention secondary to BOO. The management of individuals with DHIC remains unsatisfactory, because antispasmodic anticholinergic medications may worsen retention, whereas bethanechol does not improve bladder emptying. Human detrusor biopsies reveal axonal degeneration, muscle loss, and fibrosis in DU. Animal studies suggest that multiple risk factors, including retention itself, lack of estrogen, infection, inflammation, and aging, may contribute to DU. Priority areas for future research include efforts to facilitate clinical nonurodynamic diagnosis of probable DU plus translational research designed to address the pathogenesis of this complex multifactorial geriatric syndrome.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=31148987&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		366	taylor,iii.john.a	taylor	iii.john.a
344	Giving Up Or Finding A Solution? The Experience Of Attempted Suicide In Later Life.	2006	367	10.1080/13607860600640905			96	10	6	638	Older people constitute one of the highest risk groups for suicide. Existing research in this area has been largely dominated by a risk factor approach. This is of limited usefulness since only a minority of those at risk go on to make an attempt. Therefore, prediction, prevention and the management of risk remain challenging. The present study aimed to capture the subjective experience of older people who had recently made a suicide attempt through exploring their understanding of the pathway to and from this attempt, within the context of ageing. Fifteen participants were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Three broad themes emerged—Struggle (experiencing life as a struggle before and after the attempt, and in relation to growing older), Control (trying to maintain control over life before the attempt, and following it either failing or succeeding to regain control) and Visibility (feeling invisible or disconnected from others and trying to fight against this before the attempt and either becoming more or less connected afterwards). Risk factors identified in the literature were often absent or construed by participants as not relevant to their attempt. Individual accounts highlight the diversity and complexity of experience of older people who attempt suicide.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=22832018&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	96	Aging & Mental Health		367	crocker,l	crocker	l

We applied logistic regression models to identify clinical factors associated with mortality postoperatively. The participants included patients with lower-limb amputations (n = 2,375) who were discharged from Veterans Health Administration hospitals between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003. Most (98.9%) were male. We measured cumulative in-hospital, 3-month, and 1-year mortality. The results were 180 in-hospital deaths, 368 by 3 months, and 634 by the 1-year postsurgical amputation date. Those who had perioperative systemic sepsis (odds ratio = 4.28, 95% confidence interval = 2.87--6.39) had more than a fourfold increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality. Congestive heart failure, renal failure, and liver disease were significantly associated with mortality at all time periods. Metastatic cancer was associated only at 3 months and 1 year. We concluded that high medical complexity and mortality rates attest to the need for careful medical oversight during the postacute rehabilitation period.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=24639122&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	368	Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development		368	bates,barbara	bates	barbara

347	A Framework For Understanding Old-Age Vulnerabilities.	2006	370	10.1017/S0144686X05004423			168	26	1	9	Identifying vulnerable older people and understanding the causes and consequences of their vulnerability is of human concern and an essential task of social policy. To date, vulnerability in old age has mainly been approached by identifying high risk groups, like the poor, childless, frail or isolated. Yet vulnerability is the outcome of complex interactions of discrete risks, namely of being exposed to a threat, of a threat materialising, and of lacking the defences or resources to deal with a threat. In this article, we review approaches to vulnerability in various disciplines in order to develop a systematic framework for approaching vulnerability. This framework distinguishes and examines the interactions among the domains of exposure, threats, coping capacities and outcomes. Drawing on European and Asian gerontological literature, we discuss what might be meant by these domains and their place in the understanding of vulnerability in old age. Two case studies are presented — one on homelessness in Britain, the other on familial care provision in Indonesia — to illustrate the ways in which specific vulnerabilities are created and distributed over the lifecourse.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=19760761&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	168	Ageing & Society		370	schröder-butterfill,elisabeth	schröder-butterfill	elisabeth
348	Frailty Predicts Long-Term Mortality In Elderly Subjects With Chronic Heart Failure.	2005	371	10.1111/j.1365-2362.2005.01572.x			167	35	12	723	Background  The elderly are characterized by a high prevalence of chronic heart failure (CHF) and frailty, which is a complex interaction of physical, psychological and social impairment. This study aimed to examine the predictive role of frailty on long-term mortality in elderly subjects with CHF. Materials and methods  The study assessed long-term mortality after 12-year follow up in 120 subjects with CHF and 1139 subjects without CHF, selected in 1992, from a random sample of the elderly population in the Campania region of Italy. Frailty was assessed according to a ‘Frailty Staging System’. Results  Subjects with CHF were prevalently female (60%) and older than 75 years (mean 75·9 ± 6·7); subjects without CHF were prevalently female (56·4%) and younger than 75 years (mean 74·0 ± 6·3). In subjects with and without CHF stratified into classes of frailty there was a statistically significant increase in age, comorbidity, disability and low social support, and a decrease in MMSE score. Moreover, death progressively increased more with frailty in subjects (70·0% to 94·4%, P < 0·03) than in those without (43·8.% to 88·3%, P < 0·0001) CHF. The Kaplan–Meier analysis shows that at 9 years the probability of survival progressively decreased as frailty increased (45·5% to 0%) in subjects with CHF and from 62·8% to 25·9% in subjects without CHF. The Cox regression analysis indicated that frailty is predictive of mortality in the multivariate model adjusted for several variables including sex and age in subjects with and without CHF. Moreover, the analysis showed that frailty is more predictive of mortality in elderly subjects with CHF when it was analyzed either as continuous (1·48 vs. 1·36) or as a dummy (3 vs. 1 = 1·62 vs. 1·24) variable. Conclusions  Thus mortality among elderly subjects with or without CHF increases with frailty. Moreover, frailty is more predictive of long-term mortality in elderly subjects with than in those without CHF. Hence, frailty represents a new independent variable for predicting long-term mortality in elderly subjects with CHF.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=18943149&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	167	European Journal of Clinical Investigation		371	cacciatore,f	cacciatore	f

Future research and practice must consider the complexity of family structure, adopt longitudinal designs, provide direct empirical links between family involvement and resident outcomes, and offer rigorous evaluation of interventions in order to refine the literature.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=16573344&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	96	Aging & Mental Health		373	gaugler,j.e	gaugler	j.e
351	From The Guest Editors—Geropsychiatric Inpatient Care: An Important And Challenging Area Of Nursing Practice.	2005	374	10.1080/01612840590883573			374	26	1	5	The article discusses about geropsychiatric inpatient care, which is regarded as an important and challenging area of nursing practice. The number of complex, frail older adults with comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions is predicted to increase rapidly. In turn, specialized care settings to diagnose and treat mentally ill older adults and a cadre of expertly trained health providers who have expertise in both geriatric and psychiatric care will obviously be needed. Training initiatives, instituted in the 1980s through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), held promise for responding to this challenge by training an adequate number of interdisciplinary geriatric psychiatric professionals to care for mentally ill older people in a variety of settings.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=15496383&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	1	374	Issues in Mental Health Nursing	1	374	smith,marianne	smith	marianne

354	Clinical Global Impression Of Change In Physical Frailty: Development Of A Measure Based On Clinical Judgment.	2004	377	10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52423.x			144	52	9	1560	To expand the ability to assess physical frailty by developing a Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty (CGIC-PF) instrument. Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. Academic centers. Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less. The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=14161231&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	144	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society		377	studenski,stephanie	studenski	stephanie
355	Looking Forward To A General Theory On Population Aging.	2004	378	10.1093/gerona/59.6.M590			210	59	6	590	"The main theories on population aging based on recent data on human longevity, life expectancy, morbidity changes, disability trends, and mortality decrease are presented and discussed within their own geographic, cultural, socioeconomic, and medical contexts. The complex interactions between all these components do not facilitate trend forecasting of aging population (healthy aging versus disability pandemic). In the context of population aging, four elements were introduced with their implications: 1) an increase in the survival rates of sick persons, which would explain the expansion of morbidity, 2) a control of the progression of chronic diseases, which would explain a subtle equilibrium between the decrease in mortality and the increase in disability, 3) an improvement of the health status and health behaviors of new cohorts of elderly people, which would explain the compression of morbidity, and eventually 4) an emergence of very old and frail populations, which would explain a new expansion of morbidity. Obviously, all these elements coexist today, and future trend scenarios--expansion or compression of disability--depend on their respective weights leading to the need of elaborating ""a general theory on population aging."" This theory has to be based on a world harmonization of functional decline measurements and a periodic ""International Aging Survey"" to monitor global aging through a sample of carefully selected countries."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=19657552&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:56	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		378	robine,jean-marie	robine	jean-marie

357	Variation In Medication Understanding Among The Elderly.	2004	380	10.1093/ajhp/61.4.373			380	61	4	373	Types of medication misunderstanding among community-dwelling elderly people were studied. Community-dwelling people who were at least 65 years of age and who volunteered to participate in a medication-review program were recruited for the study. A structured interview including a background interview, attitudinal questions, and questions related to dosage, frequency, timing, and what to do if a dose was missed was conducted. A total of 375 people were included in the study. Of these, 232 (62%) showed perfect understanding of their medication regimens. Twenty-eight (7.5%) of the subjects with less than perfect understanding misunderstood a limited aspect of their regimens across multiple medications, most frequently what to do if a dose was missed. These subjects had the least complex regimens, could name their medications and describe their purpose, and rated themselves as having few medical problems. Their lack of knowledge was not attributed to cognitive problems. Twenty-seven subjects (7%) did not know multiple aspects of at least one medication and appeared to be at high risk for nonadherence. These individuals had the most complex regimens, had difficulty naming and explaining the purpose of their medications, and rated themselves as less adherent. Eighty-eight subjects (23.5%) demonstrated mixed problems with understanding; they did not show a defined pattern attributable to cognitive or noncognitive factors. A majority of people over the age of 65 years had good understanding of the drugs they were taking.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=12617643&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	380	American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy		380	spiers,mary.v	spiers	mary.v

Six-hundred and sixty-five participants (596 elders with disabilities, 69 adults with disabilities) from Northern Florida, Southern California, and Western New York were surveyed through face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, or mailed surveys. The survey addressed satisfaction, importance, frequency of use, methods for learning, barriers to use, views on features, and ways the cell phone had helped. The majority of elders (60%) valued their cell phone, and a large proportion (87%) use the cell phone for emergencies. Only one third of elders reported using their cell phone daily. Suggestions for improving phone design included increasing button size (50% of subjects), increasing display size (29% of subjects), increasing overall size of the cell phone (24% subjects), and decreasing the complexity of the phone.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=13857294&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	381	Technology & Disability		381	mann,william.c	mann	william.c

Traditional representations such as the 'frail elderly' are now complemented by newer representations such as the 'remarkably' youthful elderly. This article explores the ways a group of lower socio-economic status women draw upon representations of the active and inactive elderly evident in a television documentary, when making sense of the contemporary search for the fountain of youth. Participants' discussion of the programme reveals complex relationships among notions of consumer choice, scientific progress and religion. We conclude by exploring the implications of depictions of the active and inactive elderly in framing the contemporary search for the fountain of youth.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=11068014&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	382	Health: An Interdisciplinary Journal for the Social Study of Health, Illness & Medicine		382	hodgetts,darrin	hodgetts	darrin

Information technology offers one way to meet this challenge. Scientists at the Regenstrief Institute have more than a quarter-century of experience in using medical informatics to support clinicians in the day-to-day care of older adults. Their research has progressed through several evolutionary cycles, beginning with the acquisition of relevant data and moving to studies of the most efficient and effective mechanisms that bring information to bear at the time of clinical decision making. Information technology designed with the input of the end user has the greatest promise of changing provider behavior because it balances technological challenges with the cultural context of the practice environment. One topic of active research is information technology to support transitions of care among sites and providers. These transitions place older adults at increased risk for avoidable illness, death, and health care costs. Information systems that improve communication among providers during these transitions have the potential to improve safety and reduce costs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=10802937&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	247	Annals of Internal Medicine		384	weiner,michael	weiner	michael

The basis of this clerkship is the assessment and management of frail elderly who have a combination of complex acute and chronic medical problems and functional disabilities. It includes the understanding of the need for continuity of care across settings and the transition from hospital to the community. Our main purpose is to offer students a learning experience based upon self-reflection, access to technology, interactive learning and permanent feedback. To accomplish the technological goals, didactic sessions were mostly electronic-based with two main components: web-based interactive modules that include the contents in seven web-based interactive lectures complemented with pre- and post-tests, and an electronic portfolio to assess students' acquisition of skills and attitudes. We expect that implementation of this model of clinical clerkship will prepare future physicians, not only for the practice of geriatric medicine, but also for different medical and surgical specialties, and will enhance the attitudes, knowledge, and skills practitioners need to care for older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=10779563&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	192	Educational Gerontology		385	duque,gustavo	duque	gustavo
362	From Double Jeopardy To Double Indemnity: Subtleties Of Teaching Interdisciplinary Geriatrics.	2002	386	10.1080/03601270290081380			192	28	6	433	Each of the fields of geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice intensifies the usefulness and effectiveness of the other. Combining geriatrics and interdisciplinary practice also magnifies the complexity of two singularly complex fields. However, the subtle reasons for their complexity may escape the understanding of clinicians, educators, policy makers, and administrators. Attempting to treat older patients who have complex problems while ignoring common principles of geriatrics and teamwork can cause a kind of double jeopardy. It can potentially harm the patient and decrease the provider's sense of mastery. Training either students or health care providers to appreciate the interactions and the complexities of these two fields could produce a double indemnity for the health care system and for older persons who need health care. It requires recognizing subtle factors like the barrier of presumed knowledge, the interpretation of the meaning of function, frailty, the lure of medical technology, professional hierarchies, diverse views of disease, and the myth of insufficient evidence.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=6924781&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	192	Educational Gerontology		386	drinka,theresa.j.k	drinka	theresa.j.k

These processes prime the organism for an adaptive response, making it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given set of boundary conditions, most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively short periods of time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response mode, which is denoted ""reactive tuning."" Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in resting dynamics and maladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline and frailty. Nonlinear mathematical techniques that quantify physiologic dynamics may predict the onset of frailty, and interventions aimed toward restoring healthy dynamics may prevent functional decline."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=6330854&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	210	Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences		388	lipsitz,lewis.a	lipsitz	lewis.a
365	Effect Of Aerobic Exercise On Tracking Performance In Elderly People: A Pilot Study.	2001	390	10.1093/ptj/81.12.1870			281	81	12	1870	Background and Purpose. Although much is known about the benefits of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular health, little research has been done on the effect of aerobic exercise on motor performance. This study examined whether aerobic exercise has an effect on visuospatial information processing during finger-movement tracking in elderly subjects.  Subjects. Fifteen elderly subjects (mean age=3.2 years, SD=5.7, range=72-91) from a senior housing complex were randomly assigned to a control group or an experimental (exercise) group. Twelve subjects completed the study, and data obtained for 10 subjects were used for data analysis (2 control subjects were eliminated to allow for matched-pairs analysis between the experimental and control groups). The control group (n=5) had a mean age of 80.2 years (SD=7.8). Subjects in the experimental group (n=5) had a mean age of 84.8 years (SD=2.5).  Methods. The intervention consisted of group exercise 3 times a week for 8 consecutive weeks, and included calisthenics (eg, marching in place, side stepping, mock boxing), stationary bicycling, and walking. A finger-movement tracking test and submaximal graded exercise tolerance step tests were performed before and after training to determine changes in finger-movement tracking and any aerobic training effects.  Results. Matched-pairs t tests showed a difference in tracking from pretest to posttest in the experimental group compared with the control group. Step test performance did not differ between the 2 groups. Discussion and Conclusion. The results of this small-scale study with a limited number of subjects indicate that, for elderly people, finger-movement tracking performance can improve with aerobic exercise, despite the absence of an aerobic training effect. Possible mechanisms for the treatment effect on information processing are discussed. [Bakken RC, Carey JR, Di Fabio RP, et al.

366	Evaluation Of An Inter-Organizational Prevention Program Against Injuries Among The Elderly In A Who Safe Community.	2001	391	10.1016/S0033-3506(01)00468-1			391	115	5	308	The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of a participatory community-based prevention program against injuries among the elderly. A population-based quasi-experimental design was used with pre- and post-implementation measurements in an intervention and a control area. The program was based on cross-sectoral participation in detecting and taking action against injuries among the elderly. Change in the relative risk of injury was estimated by the odds ratio. Morbidity in moderately (AIS 2) severe injury in the study area was reduced from 46 per 1000 population years to 25 per 1000 population years (odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.46–0.65), while the minor (AIS 1) injuries increased (odds ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval 1.21–1.91). The risk of severe or fatal (AIS 3–6) injuries remained constant. In the study area, only a slight decrease in the total morbidity rate was observed (odds ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.77–0.99). In the control area, there was no evident change in the total morbidity rates. Falls decreased or showed a tendency to decrease in the age groups 65 to 79-y-old in the study area, while they increased in the older age group. The results indicate that no sharp boundaries should be drawn between safety education, physical conditioning, environmental adjustments and secondary prevention measures when planning safety promotion among the elderly. Future studies should address these issues along with the methodological complexity associated with assessment of participatory community-based safety promotion programs.Public Health (2001) 115, 308–316.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=8910271&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	391	Public Health (Nature)		391	lindqvist,k	lindqvist	k
367	Satisfaction With The Care-Managed Support Of Older People: An Empirical Analysis.	2001	392	10.1046/j.1365-2524.2001.00280.x			18	9	1	31	Modernising Social Services requires the use of satisfaction surveys in  monitoring some key aspects of quality of provision, including user/carer  perceptions and experiences of services and involvement of users/carers  in assessment and review. Using data from the study Evaluating  Community Care for Elderly People (ECCEP), of physically and/or  mentally frail community-based older people in England and Wales  receiving community care services, this investigation examines three  crucial aspects of user satisfaction. The measures were: initial satisfaction  with the assessment process and help provided by social services; also  two measures obtained from a six month follow-up, namely satisfaction  with service levels and with the experience of social services. Examination  of overall satisfaction levels provided only a partial picture, due to their  association with both user characteristics and the effect of life satisfaction.  This association was therefore examined firstly by considering each  characteristic separately and secondly by modelling the presence of each  satisfaction measure in terms of those characteristics having a significant  effect, using logistic regression. Arthritis, loneliness, problems keeping  warm and an inner city location were all characteristics associated with  reduced satisfaction, while most resource inputs, including social work  involvement, were positively related to satisfaction. General life satisfaction  was also associated with increased satisfaction levels. The role of life  satisfaction as a predictor was further investigated through examining its  dependence on case characteristics. While older users were more frequently  satisfied with life, those with greater functional impairment and below  average self-perceived health reported lower life satisfaction. Findings from  this study highlight the complexity of interpreting satisfaction data and  suggest that those responsible for designing and conducting surveys need  to...	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=5895144&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	1	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	392	chesterman,john	chesterman	john

A result of this complexity is a lack of regard for the maintenance of physical and mental function. This study examined the effects of comprehensive, multidisciplinary, inpatient rehabilitation on the physical and mental function of elderly cancer patients with asthenia. We found that both physical and mental function improved following inpatient rehabilitation. However, it is difficult to predict which patients benefit most from rehabilitation. Nevertheless, functional improvement following rehabilitation may allow medical caregivers to better distribute the type and intensity of care, and reduce the caregiver burden experienced by family members in the home.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=3113311&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	139	Palliative Medicine		393	scialla,s	scialla	s

Disability and social isolation may negatively impact on their pattern of leisure participation in the home. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of assistive devices to increase participation in valued home-based leisure activities by older adults who have physical and/or sensory disabilities. The study considered the need for custom made, or specifically adapted devices, to accomplish valued leisure activities by this target population. A random sample of 25 participants was drawn from the Consumer Assessment Study (CAS) at the University at Buffalo Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Aging (RERC-Aging). Participants were seen in their homes for an interview regarding current living arrangement, work history, regard for inclusion of leisure as valued activity, past and current patterns of leisure activity engagement, and temporal use of leisure in their present daily routine. For 17 of the 25 participants, a target leisure activity was identified for intervention using assistive devices. The investigator analyzed the activity and searched for assistive devices to address the need. Assistive devices included commercially available products, devices from vendors who cater to special needs populations, custom adaptations and/or custom designed devices. Participants were supplied with devices and trained to use them. A subsequent contact at their home and/or phone interview was conducted to ascertain the participant's pattern of device use and current satisfaction with the target leisure activity. Twenty devices were supplied to 17 participants. The three custom made devices and one custom adapted device were used with maximum satisfaction by participants. Of the eight commercial devices targeted for ...	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=4837997&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	381	Technology & Disability		394	jo,a.schweitzer	jo	a.schweitzer
370	Kinds Of Love By May Sarton: A Theoretical Framework For Educating Gerontologists.	1999	395	10.1080/036012799267765			192	25	4	317	Using Kinds of Love by May Sarton in gerontology classes as a text for studying human development affords an opportunity to explore theory and research on aging. The story takes place in a small New England town through one year: fall to summer. The plot involves daily events in the lives of several characters who represent various ages and psychosocial development. The tasks of adolescence, middle age, and old age are eloquently described in the motivation and experience of Sarton's characters. Youth, middle - aged, and elders play out their lives, but it is the elder characters who represent the richest opportunity to examine the struggle for integrity, inner life, gender shift, and meaning. As a text for the study of gerontology from a human development perspective, Kinds of Love demonstrates the sweep of growth and change that are made up in intricate day - to - day tasks, decisions, and quiet ruminations. The narrative, complexity of characters, and environmental context illuminate an array of developmental movements. When analyzed within Eriksonian, constructive developmental, and relational frameworks, the novel allows readers to study the nature of human change over time. This article explores psychosocial theory and research which are found in classroom reading of Kinds of Love by May Sarton.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=2015315&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	192	Educational Gerontology		395	wolf,mary.alice	wolf	mary.alice
371	Conceptual Tools For Thinking About Interteam Work In Clinical Geronotology.	1997	396	10.1080/0360127970230704			192	23	7	651	Frail elders with complex biopsychosocial and functional problems require the collaboration of many caregivers who are often working on different teams and may come from different organizations. The development and maintenance of collaborative alliances among caregivers working on different teams is the challenge of interteam work. It is a challenge because the quality of collaborative alliances in complex environments may predict outcomes better than the internal processes of individual teams and because researchers and educators in gerontology have yet to address this important issue. In this article, business and small group research on collaborative alliances is examined and a familiar truth emerges. Just as putting individuals together to work does not necessarily make for effective teamwork, so putting teams together to work does not necessarily produce effective interteam work. Several conceptual tools for thinking about interteam work are explored. These include a framework for understanding the effect of the diverse cultures of collaborating teams, a set of boundary-crossing functions to enhance interteam linkage, an application from general systems theory that recognizes interteam collaboration as a systems issue, and a set of outcome expectations emerging from interteam experiences that feed forward and determine the quality of future collaboration. Throughout, the discussion of these tools draws on illustrations from practice in clinical gerontology.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=9710174841&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	192	Educational Gerontology		396	ryan,david.patrick	ryan	david.patrick
372	Surgery In Nonagenarians: Morbidity, Mortality, And Functional Outcome.	1995	397				397	40	2	129	Background. There are few studies that document the outcomes experienced by very old patients who undergo major surgery. Methods. This is a case series and 7-year follow-up of 116 consecutive patients who were aged 90 years or older and underwent major surgery at a large university-affiliated community hospital. We describe the functional status., short- and long-term mortality, and predictors of mortality in this group of frail elders. Results. The 116 nonagenarians in this study underwent 134 major operations. Sixty-three patients were admitted to the hospital from a nursing home. The most common surgical procedures were for hip fracture, lower extremity amputation, and abdominal problems. Nineteen patients died in the hospital following surgery, and 23 patients died within 30 days of operation. Follow-up at 7 years revealed that all but three patients had died. Survival was worse for patients admitted from nursing homes, those who were nonambulatory before surgery, and those with major or complete functional impairment. Conclusions. Major surgery in nonagenarians is associated with a 20% perioperative mortality. Functional status and ambulatory ability are maintained in most patients. Whether to operate on these frail elders is a complex decision.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=9509151921&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	397	Journal of Family Practice		397	ackermann,richard.j	ackermann	richard.j
373	Politics, Diversity, And Minority Aging.	1991	398				303	15	4	47	"This article discusses factors that affect the participation of ethnic and racial minority elders in the political process, underscoring the heterogeneity of the minority elder population and stressing that policies must reflect that complexity. Older persons in the United States are a formidable political force, whether measured by registration and voting rates, proliferation of old-age organizations, or presence of silver-haired legislatures. But what about elderly members of minority populations?By most account, minority elders do not enjoy political visibility, are not a major component of the membership base making up the national aging organizations, and have limited electoral ability at the local and state level. The minority population is aging. The benefits of improved public health measures in this country and the increased longevity enjoyed by young immigrant groups mean that they, too, will see major increases in the proportion of persons considered senior citizens. In this country, those who are dependent upon social services must have effective political advocates and they must learn to maneuver through the social services system. Factors like the ""youth culture"" orientation from the early sixties, the coming of age of the minority baby boom generation, and the changes in families being experienced by minority communities have combined to erode the status of the respected elders in culturally diverse communities. The effects of assimilation and acculturation are important indicators in understanding the past and future potential of minority elders to be political players."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hch&AN=15906509&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:29:57	0	HSNallagingandolderpatientsandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_2021.06.24.xml	0	303	Generations		398	rivas,edgar.e	rivas	edgar.e
374	Ongoing Oscillatory Electrophysiological Alterations In Frail Older Adults: A Meg Study	2021	399	 10.3389/fnagi.2021.609043			399	13			Objective: The role of the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of frailty is controversial. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to search for abnormalities in the ongoing oscillatory neural activity of frail individuals without global cognitive impairment. Methods: Fifty four older (≥70 years) and cognitively healthy (Mini-Mental State Examination ≥24) participants were classified as robust (0 criterion, n = 34) or frail (≥ 3 criteria, n = 20) following Fried's phenotype. Memory, language, attention, and executive function were assessed through well-validated neuropsychological tests. Every participant underwent a resting-state MEG and a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan. We performed MEG power spectral analyses to compare the electrophysiological profiles of frail and robust individuals. We used an ensemble learner to investigate the ability of MEG spectral power to discriminate frail from robust participants. Results: We identified increased relative power in the frail group in the mu ( p &lt; 0.05) and sensorimotor ( p &lt; 0.05) frequencies across right sensorimotor, posterior parietal, and frontal regions. The ensemble learner discriminated frail from robust participants [area under the curve = 0.73 (95% CI = 0.49–0.98)]. Frail individuals performed significantly worse in the Trail Making Test, Digit Span Test (forward), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, and Semantic Fluency Test. Interpretation: Frail individuals without global cognitive impairment showed ongoing oscillatory alterations within brain regions associated with aspects of motor control, jointly to failures in executive function. Our results suggest that some physical manifestations of frailty might partly arise from failures in central structures relevant to sensorimotor and executive processing.

375	Ethical Frameworks For Complex Medical Decision Making In Older Patients: A Narrative Review	2020	400	 10.1016/j.archger.2020.104160			400	90			Background: With an ageing population physicians are more and more faced with complex medical and moral situations. Medical professional guidelines are often of limited use in these cases. To assist the decision making process, several ethical frameworks have been proposed. Ethical frameworks are analytical tools that are designed to assist physicians and other involved healthcare workers in complex moral decision-making situations. Most frameworks are step-by-step plans that can be followed chronologically during moral case deliberations. Some of these step-by-step plans provide specific moral guidance as to what would constitute a morally acceptable conclusion, while others do not. Objective: In this narrative review we will present and discuss the ethical frameworks used for medically complex situations in older people that have been proposed in literature. Methods: Three electronic databases (embase.com. Medline Ovid and PsychINFO Ovid) were searched from inception to January 24, 2020, with the help of expert librarians. Results: Twenty-three studies were included in the review, containing seventeen different frameworks. Twenty studies described step-by-step-frameworks, with the number of steps varying from three to twelve. In four studies suggestions were made as how to balance conflicting moral values. Conclusions and implications of key findings: Ethical frameworks are meant to assist healthcare professionals who are faced with morally complex decisions in older patients. In our view, these frameworks should contain a step-by-step plan, moral values and an approach to balancing moral values.

376	So‐Called Urinary Tract Infection In The Era Of Covid‐19	2020	401	 10.1111/jgs.16685			144	68	9	1927.0	This letter discusses the prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the era of COVID‐19. When a frail older adult with incident delirium is found to have bacteria in the urine, doctors often assume the bacteriuria represents a urinary tract infection (UTI), and that the so-called UTI is causing delirium, but bacteriuria is common in older adults who are otherwise clinically stable. Accordingly, guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) include a strong recommendation against antibiotic treatment when a frail older adult develops delirium and is found to have asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). When a patient is seriously ill with COVID-19, has become delirious, and is discovered to have bacteriuria, the decision about antibiotic treatment is complex and challenging. Favoring treatment, the IDSA guideline against antibiotic treatment is not applicable because the patient does have “systemic signs of infection.” Favoring non treatment is the very low pretest likelihood that so-called UTI is causing delirium because delirium is so highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 for reasons unrelated to the urinary tract. Delirium might be a direct effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that may bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors. risks from antibiotic over- treatment are not reduced by the presence of COVID-19. The costs, bacterial resistance, destabilization of the generally beneficial microbiome, and adverse drug effects including fatal diarrhea may be harmful to patients with COVID-19.

377	Effect Of Frailty On Outcome After Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury	2020	402	 10.1089/neu.2019.6581			402	37	6	839.0	Frailty negatively affects outcome in elective spine surgery populations. This study sought to determine the effect of frailty on patient outcome after traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI). Patients with tSCI were identified from our prospectively collected database from 2004 to 2016. We examined effect of patient age, admission Total Motor Score (TMS), and Modified Frailty Index (mFI) on adverse events (AEs), acute length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, and discharge destination (home vs. other). Subgroup analysis (for three age groups: &lt; 60, 61–75, and 76+ years), and multi-variable analysis was performed to investigate the impact of age, TMS, and mFI on outcome. For the 634 patients, the mean age was 50.3 years, 77% were male, and falls were the main cause of injury (46.5%). On bivariate analysis, mFI, age at injury, and TMS were predictors of AEs, acute LOS, and in-hospital mortality. After statistical adjustment, mFI was a predictor of LOS ( p = 0.0375), but not of AEs ( p = 0.1428) or in-hospital mortality ( p = 0.1245). In patients &lt; 60 years of age, mFI predicted number of AEs, acute LOS, and in-hospital mortality. In those aged 61–75, TMS predicted AEs, LOS, and mortality. In those 76+ years of age, mFI no longer predicted outcome. Age, mFI, and TMS on admission are important determinants of outcome in patients with tSCI. mFI predicts outcomes in those &lt; 75 years of age only. The inter-relationship of advanced age and decreased physiological reserve is complex in acute tSCI, warranting further study. Identifying frailty in younger patients with tSCI may be useful for peri-operative optimization, risk stratification, and patient counseling.

378	Meanings Of Care Convoys: The Structure, Function, And Adequacy Of Care Networks Among Frail, Community-Dwelling Older Adults	2020	403	 10.1177/1049732319861934			175	30	4	583.0	Researchers propose that the convoy of care model should be used to study care networks of frail, older individuals. Care convoys are defined as the evolving collection of individuals who may or may not have close personal connections to the recipient or to one another, but who provide care, including help with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), socio-emotional care, skilled health care, monitoring, and advocacy. This study reports on community-dwelling older adults’ experiences of their care convoy, how care convoys change over time, and perceived (positive) outcomes. A qualitative analysis among 65 semi-structured interviews with frail, community-dwelling older adults demonstrates a great variety in the composition of care convoys. Participants were often actively involved in their care convoy and valued the social/relational aspect of care. Care and support covered a wide range of activities, with some activities being provided by specific types of caregivers. Participants expressed the adequacy of their care convoy in terms of satisfaction and sufficiency. Noteworthy, participants who were satisfied with their care convoy did not necessarily receive sufficient help. Policies and practice should recognize the relational aspect of care, the complex interplay between all actors, and the dynamic character of care convoys.

379	Demographically Corrected Normative Z Scores On The Neuropsychological Test Battery In Cognitively Normal Older Chinese Adults	2020	404	 10.1159/000505618			404	49	4	375.0	Background: Subjective questionnaires used for the diagnosis of pre-mild cognitive impairment (pre-MCI) and conventional criteria for MCI might mainly result in false-positive diagnostic errors. The integrated criteria based on demographically adjusted total and process Z scores on neuropsychological tests have been validated to be sensitive for measuring pre-MCI, MCI, and MCI subtypes. However, the underrepresentativity of Chinese populations and the complexity in some tests limit the use of the established Z scores in the elderly Chinese population. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a useful Z score calculator to assess individual cognitive performance after adjustment of the scores on each of the neuropsychological tests according to sex, age, and education and to establish preliminary norms for the objective assessment of cognition function in elderly Chinese individuals. Methods: The neuropsychological test battery consists of measures of performance on different cognitive domains, including episodic memory, language, executive function, processing speed, and attention. Data were obtained from 220 clinically cognitively normal Chinese volunteers aged 60 years or older from the cohort of the Shanghai study of health promotion among frail elderly individuals. Regression models were used to investigate the impact of age, education, and sex on test scores. Z scores were estimated for the different scores by subtracting the predicted mean from the raw score and dividing it by the root mean square error term for any given linear regression model. Results: Preliminary analyses indicated that age, sex, or level of education significantly affected test scores. A series of linear regression models was constructed for all instruments, i.e.: the Trail-Making Test A and B, to assess executive function or attention; the Boston Naming Test and animal list generation, to assess language; delayed free correct responses and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) recognition, as well as three process scores, i.e., intrusion errors, learning slope, and retroactive interference, from the HVLT-R, to assess memory, by adjusting for the covariates of age, sex, and level of education concurrently. The Z scores on all neuropsychological tests were estimated based on the corresponding regression coefficients. Conclusions: We constructed a multivariable regression-based normative Z score method for the measurement of cognition among older Chinese individuals in the community. The normative score will be useful for the accurate diagnosis of different subtypes of pre-MCI and MCI after preliminary rapid screening in the community.

The incidence and prevalence of epilepsy is higher in this age group than in any other. Diagnosing epilepsy in the elderly can be challenging because the causes and clinical manifestations of seizures often differ as compared with younger individuals. Particular differential diagnoses, such as syncope and amyloid spells, are commonly encountered in the elderly population. A diagnosis of epilepsy has important implications in the older adult, many of which already present a variety of concomitant complex medical problems, such as cognitive impairment, comorbid cerebrovascular disease, and frailty. The treatment of epilepsy in the elderly is complicated by a variety of factors related to aging, including physiological changes, medical comorbidities, and polypharmacy. In this narrative review, we will address the descriptive epidemiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of epilepsy in the elderly individual.

381	The Experience Of Transitions In Care In Very Old Age: Implications For General Practice	2019	406	 10.1093/fampra/cmz014			406	36	6	778.0	Background: It can be challenging for general practitioners to support their oldest old patients through the complex process of relocation. Objective: To provide a typology of the experiences of moving in very old age that is clinically useful for practitioners navigating very old people’s relocation. Methods: Qualitative analysis of data from a mixed-methods UK population-based longitudinal study, Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C), from Year 21 follow-up onwards. Interviews with participants aged ≥95 years old and proxy informants (Year 21: 44/48, 92%, subsequent attrition all deaths). Thematic analysis of qualitative data available from 26/32 participants who moved before they died. Results: Individuals who moved voluntarily in with family experienced gratitude, and those who moved into sheltered house or care homes voluntarily had no regrets. One voluntary move into care was experienced with regret, loss and increased isolation as it severed life-long community ties. Regret and loss were key experiences for those making involuntary moves into care, but acceptance, relief and appreciation of increased company were also observed. The key experience of family members was trauma. Establishing connections with people or place ahead of moving, for example through previous respite care, eased moving. A checklist for practitioners based on the resulting typology of relocation is proposed. Conclusions: Most of the sample moved into residential care. This study highlights the importance of connections to locality, people and place along with good family relationships as the key facilitators of a healthy transition into care for the oldest old. The proposed checklist may have clinical utility.

382	Quality Of Life Of Older Persons In Nursing Homes After The Implementation Of A Knowledge‐Based Palliative Care Intervention	2019	407	 10.1111/opn.12258			152	14	4		Background: The goals of palliative care are to relieve suffering and promote quality of life. Palliative care for older persons has been less prioritised than palliative care for younger people with cancer, which may lead to unnecessary suffering and decreased quality of life at the final stage of life. Aim: To evaluate whether a palliative care intervention had any influence on the perceived quality of life of older persons (≥ 65 years). Methods: This study was conducted as a complex intervention performed with an experimental crossover design. The intervention was implemented in 20 nursing homes, with a six‐month intervention period in each nursing home. Twenty‐three older persons (≥ 65 years) in the intervention group and 29 in the control group were interviewed using the WHOQOL‐BREF and WHOQOL‐OLD questionnaires at both baseline and follow‐up. The collected data were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test to compare paired data between baseline and follow‐up. Results: In the intervention group, no statistically significant increases in quality of life were found. This result contrasted with the control group, which revealed statistically significant declines in quality of life at both the dimension and item levels. Accordingly, this study showed a trend of decreased health after nine months in both the intervention and control groups. Conclusion: It is reasonable to believe that quality of life decreases with age as part of the natural course of the ageing process. However, it seems that the palliative care approach of the intervention prevented unnecessary quality of life decline by supporting sensory abilities, autonomy and social participation among older persons in nursing homes. From the ageing perspective, it may not be realistic to strive for an increased quality of life in older people living in nursing homes; maybe the goal should be to delay or prevent reduced quality of life. Based on this perspective, the intervention prevented decline in quality of life in nursing home residents. Implications for practice: The high number of deaths shows the importance to identify palliative care needs in older persons at an early stage to prevent or delay deterioration of quality of life.

383	The Seventh Age On Stage: Representation Of Older Adults And Aging In U.S. Broadway And Off-Broadway Theater	2019	408	 10.1080/03601277.2019.1685736			192	45	11	645.0	Older persons’ involvement in theater often focuses on health, educational, and therapeutic benefits. Though less examined, artistic depictions of aging help bridge gerontological and humanities approaches to this topic. Qualitative textual script analysis was used to analyze the representation of older adults in six plays produced on and off Broadway, 1991–2017. Traditional character constructions of age and older adults emerged—frailty, fear, caregiving burden—with counternarratives of resilience, resistance, and self-reflexivity also present. Uncovered dyadic pairs (e.g. frailty/resistance) served as examples of the complexity of age portrayed on stage. From this dyadic tension present in the plays emerged a way to build upon and expand traditional, and often more limited, societal notions of aging.

384	Medication Appropriateness In Vulnerable Older Adults: Healthy Skepticism Of Appropriate Polypharmacy	2019	409	 10.1111/jgs.15798			144	67	6	1123.0	Older adults are prescribed a growing number of medications. Polypharmacy, commonly considered the receipt of five or more medications, is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. There is a debate about the reason(s) why. On one side is the assertion that older persons are being prescribed too many medications, with the number of medications increasing the risk of adverse events. On the other side is the observation that polypharmacy is associated both with overprescribing of inappropriate medications and underprescribing of appropriate medications. This leads to the concept of “inappropriate” vs “appropriate” polypharmacy, with the latter resulting from the prescription of many correct medications to persons with multiple chronic conditions. Few studies have examined the health outcomes associated with adding and/or removing medications to address this debate directly. The criteria used to identify underutilized medications are based on results of randomized controlled trials that may not be generalizable to older adults. Several randomized controlled trials and many more observational studies provide evidence that these criteria overestimate medication benefits and underestimate harms. In addition, evidence suggests that the marginal effects of medications added to an already complex regimen differ from their effects when considered individually. Although in selected circumstances adding medications results in benefit to patients, patients with multimorbidity and frailty/disability have susceptibilities that can decrease the likelihood of medication benefit and increase the likelihood of harms. The identification of appropriate polypharmacy requires more robust criteria to evaluate the net effects of complex medication regimens.

385	Social Exclusion And Community In An Urban Retirement Village	2019	410	 10.1016/j.jaging.2019.03.003			410	49		25.0	Large purpose-built retirement complexes including continuing care options are increasingly popular ways to ‘age in place’ for older people in New Zealand and internationally. Promoted by their corporate owners as a lifestyle choice offering a wealth of activities and social interaction in manicured settings along with security and increasing care on site as needed, these entities offer new ways for wealthier older people to age. Applying an ethnographic approach to a case study residential complex in Auckland, New Zealand, we explore how residents experience inclusion and exclusion, and sense of community within such environments with a diversity of fit and frail residents. Data was collected from interviews, walk-about conversations, social site mapping and a selection of media material to gain an understanding of the social issues important to the residents. The twelve participants, aged between 70 and 87, were all independent residents living in the independent part of the complex, which is situated in a socio-economically wealthy suburb of Auckland. We identified that social connections were often fragile, and existing social group membership was key to shared community experiences and a sense of belonging. Residents who found themselves on the social fringes, particularly as newcomers or through health decline, were at risk of marginalisation, stigma, and social exclusion. Further, we identified how the design and layout, and tensions in the structure of the resident-management relationship potentially hinder inclusiveness and sense of community. These findings shed light on alternative experiences at odds with the commercial and populist framing of these places as age-friendly and inclusive communities promoting active lifestyles.

386	Strengths And Support Of Older People Affected By Precarity In South Louisiana	2019	411	 10.1111/opn.12232			152	14	2	10.0	Background: Few empirical studies have examined strengths and support of older people in circumstances of precarity. A better understanding of this problem has the potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery. Purpose: To investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana. Method: More than 300 hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for low‐income older persons and two senior citizen centres. Results: The findings demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home‐based healthcare services, (b) stress after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home‐based services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships and activities, and (i) grocery store and café contacts. Conclusion: Home‐based services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services. Implications for practice This study adds to the literature about precarity among community‐based older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home‐based services are necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths and supportive resources of older people.

387	Frailty Is Inversely Related To Age At Menopause And Elevated In Women Who Have Had A Hysterectomy: An Analysis Of The Canadian Longitudinal Study On Aging	2019	412	 10.1093/gerona/gly092			412	74	5	675.0	Background Frailty is a complex pathophysiological phenomenon that will impact a significant proportion of adults over the age of 65 and contributes to the risk of several adverse health outcomes. Although women have a disproportionately higher risk of frailty, the sex-specific factors related to this syndrome are not well described. Hence, we sought to examine the relationship of age at menopause, hysterectomy status, and hormone replacement therapy use with prevalent frailty in older women. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) Baseline Comprehensive Cohort (n = 30,097, 45–85 years old). Frailty was operationalized using both the deficit accumulation (frailty index) and frailty phenotype (Fried) models. Postmenopausal women were categorized as follows: premature (30–39 years), early (40–45 years), normal (46–54 years), and late (55+ years) menopause, or hysterectomy. Associations were determined using multivariate analysis, adjusting for sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, social support, and hormone replacement therapy use. Results Age at menopause was inversely related to frailty in older Canadian women. The frailty index decreased 1.2% of the mean (p &lt; .001) with every year of menopause onset and was significantly higher for women in the premature (24%; p &lt; .001) and early (7%; p &lt; .01) menopause and hysterectomy (21%; p &lt; .001) groups, compared to the normal menopause group. The odds for being classified as frail using Fried’s criteria was higher for the premature menopause (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.72–2.27) and hysterectomy (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.25–2.02) groups. Conclusions Our study supports a role for age at menopause and hysterectomy in the risk of frailty in older women and warrants further investigation.

388	Long-Term Efficacy And Safety Of Lacosamide And Levetiracetam Monotherapy In Elderly Patients With Focal Epilepsy: A Retrospective Study	2019	413	 10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.02.022			405	94		178.0	Objectives: Epilepsy management in elderly patients is often complex because of several concomitant comorbidities that may limit the use of some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Levetiracetam (LEV) is a second-generation AED widely used in elderly patients with epilepsy while lacosamide (LCM), which has been recently approved in European Union (EU) as monotherapy for the treatment of focal onset seizures, is affected by a scarcity of data in such frail population. This study is aimed at assessing the efficacy and the tolerability of LCM as monotherapy in elderly patients affected by focal onset epilepsy compared with those receiving LEV. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients aged ≥ 65 years suffering from focal onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization on LCM monotherapy or LEV monotherapy, was performed. Data regarding demographic characteristics, seizure type and etiology, LCM and LEV daily dose, number of lifetime AEDs, seizure frequency at baseline and at 12 months of follow-up, and seizure freedom rates were reported. Results: In this observational retrospective study, 22 patients on LCM (10 males, 12 females, mean age: 76.23 ± 7.5) and 24 patients on LEV (10 males, 14 females, mean age: 73.58 ± 6.39) were enrolled. Mean LCM daily dose was 204.51 ± 88.51 mg and mean LEV daily dose was 1281.25 ± 378.15 mg. All patients had comorbidities on chronic treatment. At 12 months of follow-up, mean monthly seizure frequency reduced from 4.23 ± 8.53 to 0.33 ± 0.9 (p &lt; .001) in LCM group and from 2.29 ± 6.11 to 0.2 ± 0.81 (p &lt; .001) in LEV group. Furthermore, 16/22 (72.7%) LCM patients were seizure-free at 12 months of follow-up while seizure freedom was achieved by 17/24 (70.8%) patients in LEV group. Discussion and conclusion: Epilepsy management in elderly patients is often challenging. In this retrospective real-life study, the efficacy and the tolerability of LCM as monotherapy was favorable even at low doses in older patients and comparable with LEV with a high rate of long-term seizure freedom. Considering the frequent comorbidities and the risk of drug–drug interactions, LCM monotherapy may be a valuable option in elderly patients with focal onset epilepsy because of its favorable pharmacokinetic profile.

389	Active@Home: Investigating The Value Of A Home Care Worker–Led Exercise Program For Older Adults With Complex Care Needs	2019	414	 10.1123/japa.2017-0443			414	27	2	284.0	Exercise has proven health benefits for older adults independent of age, disability, and disease. However, barriers to exercise participation exist, including travel to, and access to, appropriate facilities and programs. Evidence shows that in-home exercise delivered by allied health professionals can improve physical health and prolong independence among individuals with government supported aged care packages. A less costly alternative is program delivery by home care workers. However, effective training for workers and resources to guide the consumer is required. This project evaluated an exercise training module for home care workers and a consumer resource to promote in-home exercise participation among older Australians with government supported aged care packages. Outcomes included a significant improvement in functional capacity as measured by the short physical performance battery (mean increase of 1.4 points), a 19% reduction in participants classified as frail and a reduction in healthcare service access of 47% across the intervention.

390	Using The Heterotopic Mirror To Reveal Tensions In Public Reaction To A Photographic Essay Of Eldercare Staff And Older Adults	2019	415	 10.1016/j.jaging.2018.12.002			410	48		17.0	This paper analyses a photographic essay of older adults and workers in a nursing home environment, as a day-in-the-life documentary photographic essay Who cares published in Kai Tiaki, Nursing New Zealand in 2006. We discuss the essay, which intended to make eldercare work more visible and valued. The purpose of this paper is to ask, ‘Why were these photographs so uncomfortable to view, and why did they elicit such strong polysemous reactions from viewers?’ We argue that in order to address this question, sites of eldercare may be understood as heterotopias, or places of exclusion from social norms. While the photographs were meant to make it possible for viewers to look into the daily reality of eldercare work, we suggest the visual essay instead acted as a heterotopic hall of mirrors, revealing tensions that obscured the labour value to viewers. As observers looked into the mirror of their own lives, the utopian discourse of a residential care ‘home’ was disrupted, as the idealised version of eldercare work we have become attuned to in the media was punctured by the powerful heterotopia of the photographic essay. This article illustrates the way in which eldercare work is made invisible through complex social processes involving sight and site related to contemporary visual and spatial practices of aging and eldercare.

391	Is Episodic Memory Performance More Vulnerable To Depressive Affect In Older Adulthood?	2019	416	 10.1080/13825585.2018.1424314			416	26	2	244.0	This study examined how age, depressive symptoms, demographic variables, frailty, and health factors jointly influence episodic memory across the lifespan in two large, diverse samples. Hierarchical regression analyses from both samples showed that depressive symptoms negatively impacted episodic memory performance with the effect being more pronounced for older adults. Health and frailty tended not to be associated with episodic memory. However, the main effect of depressive symptoms tended to remain significant over and above other predictors, while the interaction with age was weakened with the addition of demographic variables. The unique contribution of this study is demonstrating that the relationship between depressive symptoms and episodic memory is moderated by age across relatively large non-clinical lifespan samples of adults. The findings indicate the importance of measuring and studying depressive symptoms during the course of aging in order to better understand the complex relationship between age, affect, physical functioning, and memory.

392	Community Care For Severely Frail Older People: Developing Explanations Of How, Why And For Whom It Works	2019	417	 10.1111/opn.12217			152	14	1		Background: A Community Wellness Team was implemented in North East England in 2014, in line with national policy directives to support frail older people in the community. The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. Design: A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Results: Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self‐management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. Discussion: The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team “works” is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live. Conclusion: Severely frail older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a complex and flexible person‐centred approach. Implications for Practice: This study paves the way for further research into the care networks surrounding severely frail older people living in the community, and how they can most effectively be implemented.

393	Prognosis Of Acute Subdural Hematoma In The Elderly: A Systematic Review	2019	418	 10.1089/neu.2018.5829			402	36	4	517.0	Acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) is among the most common injury types encountered by neurosurgeons, and carries a poor prognosis, particularly in the elderly. As the incidence of aSDH in the elderly population rises, identifying those patients who may benefit from operative intervention is crucial. This systematic review aimed to identify data on prognostic factors or indices, such as the modified frailty index, that may help predict outcome, and hence guide management. A comprehensive search of online databases was conducted by two independent authors, and data on prognostic factors and outcomes were extracted. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Of 769 studies identified in the initial search, 7 satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria. Mortality and morbidity varied considerably among studies. Initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3–8 was the most consistently reported negative prognostic feature. Several studies evaluated the impact of medical comorbidities and premorbid frailty, but were limited by small sample size. A previous history of pneumonia was shown to increase the risk of Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) 1–3 (odds ratio [OR] 6.4 [95% CI 1.6–25.2], p = 0.04) in a single study, which also reported a greater increase in GOS at 3 months in those with fewer than five comorbidities (56% vs. 19%, p &lt; 0.01). There are limited data describing prognostic factors or the use of frailty indices within the specific group of elderly patients with aSDH. Prospective research is needed to evaluate the utility of accurate and validated assessments of frailty to enhance the neurosurgeon's ability to appropriately manage this complex and expanding patient group.

394	Investigation Of Frailty As A Moderator Of The Relationship Between Neuropathology And Dementia In Alzheimer'S Disease: A Cross-Sectional Analysis Of Data From The Rush Memory And Aging Project	2019	419	 10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30371-5			419	18	2	177.0	"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 18(3) of The Lancet Neurology (see record 2019-10087-001). The funding for this manuscript should have stated ""This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, including via the Canadian Collaboration on Neurodegeneration in Aging.""] Background: Some people with substantial Alzheimer's disease pathology at autopsy had shown few characteristic clinical symptoms or signs of the disease, whereas others with little Alzheimer's disease pathology have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. We aimed to examine whether frailty, which is associated with both age and dementia, moderates the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. Methods: We did a cross-sectional analysis of data from participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a clinical–pathological cohort study of older adults (older than 59 years) without known dementia at baseline, living in Illinois, USA. Participants in the cohort study underwent annual neuropsychological and clinical evaluations. In the present cross-sectional analysis, we included those participants who did not have any form of dementia or who had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of their last clinical assessment and who had died and for whom complete autopsy data were available. Alzheimer's disease pathology was quantified by a summary measure of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic and diffuse plaques. Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia was based on clinician consensus. Frailty was operationalised retrospectively using health variable information obtained at each clinical evaluation using the deficit accumulation approach (41-item frailty index). Logistic regression and moderation modelling were used to assess relationships between Alzheimer's disease pathology, frailty, and Alzheimer's dementia. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and education. Findings: Up to data cutoff (Jan 20, 2017), we included 456 participants (mean age at death 89·7 years [SD 6·1]; 316 [69%] women). 242 (53%) had a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia at their last clinical assessment. Frailty (odds ratio 1·76, 95% CI 1·54–2·02; p &lt; 0·0001) and Alzheimer's disease pathology (4·81, 3·31–7·01; p &lt; 0·0001) were independently associated with Alzheimer's dementia, after adjusting for age, sex, and education. When frailty was added to the model for the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia, model fit improved (p &lt; 0·0001). There was a significant interaction between frailty and Alzheimer's disease pathology (odds ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·57–0·94; p interaction = 0·015). People with an increased frailty score had a weakened direct link between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia; that is, people with a low amount of frailty were better able to tolerate Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas those with higher amounts of frailty were more likely both to have more Alzheimer's disease pathology and for it to be expressed as dementia. Interpretation: The degree of frailty among people of the same age modifies the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. That frailty is related to both odds of Alzheimer's dementia and disease expression has implications for clinical management, since individuals with even a low level of Alzheimer's disease pathology might be at risk for dementia if they have high amounts of frailty. Further research should assess how frailty and cognition change over time to better elucidate this complex relationship.

395	Does A Social Prescribing ‘Holistic’ Link-Worker For Older People With Complex, Multimorbidity Improve Well-Being And Frailty And Reduce Health And Social Care Use And Costs? A 12-Month Before-And-After Evaluation	2019	420	 10.1017/S1463423619000598			420	20			Aim: To evaluate the impact of ‘holistic’ link-workers on service users’ well-being, activation and frailty, and their use of health and social care services and the associated costs. Background: UK policy is encouraging social prescribing (SP) as a means to improve well-being, self-care and reduce demand on the NHS and social services. However, the evidence to support this policy is generally weak and poorly conceptualised, particularly in relation to frail, older people and patient activation. Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, an integrated care organisation, commissioned a Well-being Co-ordinator service to support older adults (≥50 years) with complex health needs (≥2 long-term conditions), as part of its service redesign. Methods: A before-and-after study measuring health and social well-being, activation and frailty at 12 weeks and primary, community and secondary care service use and cost at 12 months prior and after intervention. Findings: Most of the 86 participants achieved their goals (85%). On average health and well-being, patient activation and frailty showed a statistically significant improvement in mean score. Mean activity increased for all services (some changes were statistically significant). Forty-four per cent of participants saw a decrease in service use or no change. Thirteen high-cost users (&gt;£5000 change in costs) accounted for 59% of the overall cost increase. This was largely due to significant, rapid escalation in morbidity and frailty. Co-ordinators played a valuable key-worker role, improving the continuity of care, reducing isolation and supporting carers. No entry-level participant characteristic was associated with change in well-being or service use. Larger, better conceptualised, controlled studies are needed to strengthen claims of causality and develop national policy in this area.

396	The (Cost‐)Effectiveness Of Preventive, Integrated Care For Community‐Dwelling Frail Older People: A Systematic Review	2019	421	 10.1111/hsc.12571			18	27	1	1.0	Integrated care is increasingly promoted as an effective and cost‐effective way to organise care for community‐dwelling frail older people with complex problems but the question remains whether high expectations are justified. Our study aims to systematically review the empirical evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for community‐dwelling frail older people and close attention is paid to the elements and levels of integration of the interventions. We searched nine databases for eligible studies until May 2016 with a comparison group and reporting at least one outcome regarding effectiveness or cost‐effectiveness. We identified 2,998 unique records and, after exclusions, selected 46 studies on 29 interventions. We assessed the quality of the included studies with the Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk‐of‐bias tool. The interventions were described following Rainbow Model of Integrated Care framework by Valentijn. Our systematic review reveals that the majority of the reported outcomes in the studies on preventive, integrated care show no effects. In terms of health outcomes, effectiveness is demonstrated most often for seldom‐reported outcomes such as well‐being. Outcomes regarding informal caregivers and professionals are rarely considered and negligible. Most promising are the care process outcomes that did improve for preventive, integrated care interventions as compared to usual care. Healthcare utilisation was the most reported outcome but we found mixed results. Evidence for cost‐effectiveness is limited. High expectations should be tempered given this limited and fragmented evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for frail older people. Future research should focus on unravelling the heterogeneity of frailty and on exploring what outcomes among frail older people may realistically be expected.

397	Health, Illness And Frailty In Old Age: A Phenomenological Exploration	2018	422	 10.1016/j.jaging.2018.10.002			410	47		24.0	The aim of this paper is to subject the clinical classification of frailty to scrutiny through exploring, via a phenomenological lens, the lived experiences of older people who meet the objective, or clinical, criteria of frailty. Drawing on a range of published research that explores the heterogeneous experiences of embodied ageing, the paper highlights the continuity of phenomenological structures of experience across successful ageing, normal ageing and frailty, suggesting the permeability and contestability of the boundaries between them and highlighting the complexity of health and illness in old age. Such data suggests a need to question the perception of frailty as something both apart from ‘normal’ ageing, and constitutive of frailed or failed ageing, and challenges the construction of the third age/fourth age polarity that underpins much of the meaning accorded to old age today.

398	Adoption And Feasibility Of A Communication App To Enhance Social Connectedness Amongst Frail Institutionalized Oldest Old: An Embedded Case Study	2018	423	 10.1080/1369118X.2017.1348534			423	21	11	1681.0	The risks of social isolation and loneliness are becoming emergent issues for older adults (aged 65+) in industrialized countries, particularly for oldest old people (80+) who are frail and institutionalized. Socially isolated and lonely older people are more likely to experience depression, social disengagement, cognitive and physical decline, morbidity, and early mortality. In response to these significant negative health and socioeconomic costs, research suggests using new technologies to enhance opportunities for social connectedness as a strategy to help alleviate both social isolation and loneliness. In this context, following a participatory design method, we developed an accessible communication app with and for frail institutionalized older adults. To test the adoption of this innovative technology and its feasibility to address social isolation and loneliness, we conducted a two-month deployment of the app in a long-term care home with five oldest old and their relatives. Due to access, recruitment, and ethical challenges, the oldest old are a specially understudied group. Using an embedded case study (based on interviews, psychometric scales, field observations, and usability and accessibility testing) and a recursive approach to technology studies, our findings show that technology adoption is based on a complex set of interrelated factors: social, attitudinal, physical, digital literacy, and usability. We also discuss the feasibility of the app to enhance perceived social connectedness amongst our target population, provided that at least one strong tie is involved and communication norms and expectations across generations are considered.

399	The Relationship Between Gait Dynamics And Future Cognitive Decline: A Prospective Pilot Study In Geriatric Patients	2018	424	 10.1017/S1041610217002770			424	30	9	1301.0	Background: Walking ability recently emerged as a sub-clinical marker of cognitive decline. Hence, the relationship between baseline gait and future cognitive decline was examined in geriatric patients. Because a “loss of complexity” (LOC) is a key phenomenon of the aging process that exhibits in multiple systems, we propose the idea that age- and cognition-related LOC may also become manifested in gait function. The LOC theory suggests that even healthy aging is associated with a (neuro)physiological breakdown of system elements that causes a decline in variability and an overall LOC. We used coordination dynamics as a conceptual framework and hypothesized that a LOC is reflected in dynamic gait outcomes (e.g. gait regularity, complexity, stability) and that such outcomes could increase the specificity of the gait-cognition link. Methods: 19 geriatric patients (age 80.0±5.8) were followed for 14.4 ± 6.6 months. An iPod collected three-dimensional (3D) trunk accelerations while patients walked for 3 minutes. Cognition was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Seven-Minute screen (7 MS) test. The Reliable Change Index (RCI) quantified the magnitude of cognitive change. Spearman's Rho coefficients (ρ) indexed correlations between baseline gait and future cognitive change. Results: Seven patients showed reliable cognitive decline (“Cognitive Decline” group), and 12 patients remained cognitively stable (“Cognitive Stable” group) over time. Future cognitive decline was correlated with a more regular (ρ = 0.579*) and predictable (ρ = 0.486*) gait pattern, but not with gait speed. Conclusions: The increase in gait regularity and predictability possibly reflects a LOC due to age- and cognition-related (neuro)physiological decline. Because dynamic versus traditional gait outcomes (i.e. gait speed and (variability of) stride time) were more strongly correlated with future cognitive decline, the use of wearable sensors in predicting and monitoring cognitive and physical health in vulnerable geriatric patients can be considered promising. However, our results are preliminary and do require replication in larger cohorts.

400	Visibility And Meanings Of Partnership In Health Care For Older People Who Need Support To Live At Home	2018	425	 10.1111/scs.12545			170	32	3	1027.0	Introduction: Problems experienced by older people with complex needs to live at home have been reported in the literature. This qualitative study builds on previous research and investigates enduring issues older people face when interacting with healthcare services. Aim: To gain an in-depth understanding of what is involved in providing good quality health care for older people who need support to live at home. Methodological design: We adopted an interpretive descriptive approach and conducted semi-structured interviews with older people (n = 7), carers (n = 8) and key informants (n = 11). Initial and secondary analysis of qualitative data was completed. Findings: Major themes emerged about meanings of partnership in health care, and invisibility of the older person as a partner in health care. Partnership in health care was understood to mean being treated as an equal, being involved in decision-making, and making contributions which impact on health care and health systems. The metaphorical concept of ‘invisibility’ related to the older person not being seen and heard as a partner in health care, as well as being a recipient of care. Conclusions: We concluded that older people who need support to live at home are not highly visible to health providers, policymakers and researchers as a central partner and consumer to be meaningfully engaged in shaping their health care. Opportunities to address persistent issues with quality of health care may in future be achieved through stronger partnerships between older people and health providers, to find new ways to improve the quality of care for older people.

401	Deprescribing For Frail Older People—Learning From The Case Of Mrs. Hansen	2018	426	 10.1016/j.sapharm.2017.07.003			426	14	6	612.0	Drug treatment is often an essential part in treatment and prevention of diseases in older people, but there is much concern about inappropriate medication use. This paper aims to describe the complexity of medication safety issues and clinical judgments when optimizing prescribing in older individuals. It uses the case of Mrs. Hansen, an aged nursing home resident, to illustrate the facilitators and barriers of this process. With decreasing life expectancy, medication use should shift from cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment to increase the patient's well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of (potentially) dangerous medications were reduced, and non-pharmacological alternatives were considered. There were some medicines added, as underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. Deprescribing long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family as “giving up hope”. More clinical evidence and practical communication tools are needed to guide deprescribing decisions, taking medical and patient-centered priorities into account. Studies evaluating such interventions should select outcome measures that are particularly relevant for frail old individuals.

402	Interdisciplinary Home Visits For Individuals With Advanced Parkinson'S Disease And Related Disorders	2018	427	 10.1111/jgs.15337			144	66	6	1226.0	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisymptom, neurodegenerative disease affecting primarily older adults. With progression, many individuals become homebound and removed from coordinated, expert care, resulting in excess morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures in acute care settings and institutions. Home visit care models have achieved the triple aim of improving individual and population health while reducing costs in many frail, community‐dwelling geriatric cohorts. This study details a novel, interdisciplinary home visit program specifically designed for individuals with PD and related disorders and their family caregivers built upon best practice principles in the care of multimorbid older adults. At each quarterly home visit, a movement disorders–trained neurologist, social worker, and nurse work in parallel with the individual and caregiver to complete a history, physical, detailed medication reconciliation, psychosocial needs assessment, and home safety assessment. A comprehensive, person‐centered plan is agreed upon, referrals to community resources are made, standardized documentation is shared, and follow‐up communication is instituted. In the first 2 years, 272 visits were conducted with 85 individuals who represent one of the oldest, most disabled PD populations reported. Satisfaction with and retention in the program were high. This study represents the first translation of the success of interdisciplinary and home‐based geriatric care models to a population with a specific neurological disease. Preliminary evidence supports the need for such programs in vulnerable populations. Future studies will prospectively assess person‐centered outcomes, the effect of using telemedicine on sustainability, and cost effectiveness.

403	The Use Of Case Management For Community‐Dwelling Older People: The Effects On Loneliness, Symptoms Of Depression And Life Satisfaction In A Randomised Controlled Trial	2018	428	 10.1111/scs.12520			170	32	2	889.0	Aim: To investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community‐dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Design: A two‐armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow‐ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group. Method: Inclusion criteria were the following: ≥ 65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self‐reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses. Results: During the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow‐ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months. Conclusions: The use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

404	Rational Suicide In Elderly Adults: A Clinician'S Perspective	2018	429	 10.1111/jgs.15263			144	66	5	998.0	Geriatricians are increasingly encountering older adults expressing suicidal wishes in the absence of overt mental illness. This is expected to grow as life expectancy increases. This article describes the case of an older adult who expressed the wish to end his life in the absence of a diagnosable mental illness. Although he had chronic medical illnesses, he was not terminally ill. The complex subject of rational suicide in elderly adults is approached from a clinician’s perspective. Issues of ageism, gerontophobia, and changing perspectives on death are highlighted. The experience of being a Baby Boomer and its influence on rational suicide is reviewed. Finally, clinical topics such as aging, frailty, dependence on younger and healthier individuals, and the older adult’s need for a sense of control are explored.

405	Professionals’ Perspectives Towards Health Promotion In Residential Aged Care: An Explorative Study In Austria	2018	430				430	33	2	268.0	Following the trend in most developed countries, in Austria the oldest old are the fastest growing population group. Among this group, there is a high prevalence of multimorbidity, functional impairment, dementia and psychiatric conditions. While health promotion (HP) has been considered relevant in coping with the challenges of an aging population, it has so far been viewed as a foreign concept in relation to the oldest old, especially those living in residential aged care (RAC) facilities. Although there is an acknowledgement that HP should be integrated into routine nursing, there has been little research on how professionals working with RAC interpret and implement HP. In this study, 13 semi-structured interviews were carried out with professionals from four major Austrian RAC providers. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings show that, typically, professionals understand HP as a concept that is oriented towards maintaining potentials and resources, thereby promoting self-determination, autonomy and social integration, including frail and functionally impaired elderly residents. However, data analysis also revealed a gap between the conceptual understanding and positive attitudes towards HP and its implementation in practice. Implementation of HP seems to occur in isolated cases, related to specific health issues. It seems that more complex HP approaches, especially the ‘settings approach’, are hardly practiced. To implement more comprehensive and systematic HP in Austrian RAC, support from external HP agencies as well as changes in financial incentives are needed.

406	Making Sense Of Frailty: An Ethnographic Study Of The Experience Of Older People Living With Complex Health Problems	2018	431	 10.1111/opn.12172			152	13	1	1.0	Aim: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in their daily lives. Background: A better understanding of the personal experience of frailty in the context of fluctuating ill-health has the potential to contribute to the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. Design: An ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a community matron service in a large city in the North of England. Methods: Up to six care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11 months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4-year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method. Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: Fluctuating ill-health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living . Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person-centred care . Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.

407	Gender Differences In The Incidence And Determinants Of Components Of The Frailty Phenotype Among Older Adults: Findings From The Sabe Study	2018	433	 10.1177/0898264316671228			433	30	2	190.0	Objective: To analyze gender differences in incidence and determinants of the components of the frailty phenotype. Method: A total of 1,413 older adults were selected in 2006. To estimate the incidence of each frailty component, only individuals who did not exhibit a given component at baseline (independently of the presence of other components) were included in the study. The variables of interest were socioeconomic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric factors and physical performance. The incidence of each component in 2010 was the outcome. Results: Unintentional weight loss and slowness were more incident in men up to 74 years of age. The other frailty components were more incident in women at all age groups, except weakness. Besides age, the determinants of incidence of the components of frailty were different between genders. Discussion: Strategies for preventing or delaying the installation of frailty need to address gender differences, considering the greater complexity in the network determinants among women.

408	Feasibility Trial Of Tailored Home Modifications: Process Outcomes	2018	434				434	72	1		Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a process evaluation to examine the implementation of a randomized controlled trial of home modifications designed to reduce the risk of falls and improve daily activity performance among community-dwelling older adults. Method: A process evaluation was conducted alongside a blinded, randomized sham-controlled trial ( n = 92). Participants were followed for 1 yr after intervention. The process evaluation was framed using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Results: The treatment group improved daily activity performance over 12 mo compared with the sham control group ( F = 4.13; p = .024). The intervention elements and dose were delivered with greater than 90% accuracy. Participants reported a 91% adherence rate at 12 mo. Conclusion: The complex intervention of home modifications examined in this study is acceptable to older adults, is feasible, and can be delivered with high fidelity for frail, community-dwelling older adults.

409	Operationalisation And Validation Of The Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, And Injuries (Steadi) Fall Risk Algorithm In A Nationally Representative Sample	2017	435				435	71	12	1191.0	Background: Preventing falls and fall-related injuries among older adults is a public health priority. The Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) tool was developed to promote fall risk screening and encourage coordination between clinical and community-based fall prevention resources; however, little is known about the tool’s predictive validity or adaptability to survey data. Methods: Data from five annual rounds (2011–2015) of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a representative cohort of adults age 65 years and older in the USA. Analytic sample respondents (n = 7392) were categorised at baseline as having low, moderate or high fall risk according to the STEADI algorithm adapted for use with NHATS data. Logistic mixed-effects regression was used to estimate the association between baseline fall risk and subsequent falls and mortality. Analyses incorporated complex sampling and weighting elements to permit inferences at a national level. Results: Participants classified as having moderate and high fall risk had 2.62 (95% CI 2.29 to 2.99) and 4.76 (95% CI 3.51 to 6.47) times greater odds of falling during follow-up compared with those with low risk, respectively, controlling for sociodemographic and health-related risk factors for falls. High fall risk was also associated with greater likelihood of falling multiple times annually but not with greater risk of mortality. Conclusion: The adapted STEADI clinical fall risk screening tool is a valid measure for predicting future fall risk using survey cohort data. Further efforts to standardise screening for fall risk and to coordinate between clinical and community-based fall prevention initiatives are warranted.

410	Self-Perceived Coping Resources Of Middle-Aged And Older Adults—Results Of A Large Population-Based Study	2017	436	 10.1080/13607863.2016.1220918			96	21	12	1303.0	Objectives: Psychosocial resources (personal resources, social resources, and other) are important for coping with aging and impairment. The aim of this study was to describe the resources of older adults and to compare subgroups with frailty, complex health care needs, and/or mental disorders. Method: At the third follow-up of the large population-based German ESTHER study, 3124 elderly persons (aged 55–85) were included. Psychosocial resources were assessed during a home visit by trained study doctors by using a list of 26 different items. Resources were described for the total group, separated by sex, and for the three subgroups of persons with frailty, complex health care needs, and mental disorders. Results: Family, self-efficacy, and financial security were the most frequently reported resources of older adults. Women and men showed significant differences in their self-perceived resources. Personal resources (self-efficacy, optimism, mastery), social resources, and financial security were reported significantly less frequently by frail persons, persons with complex health care needs, and mentally ill older adults compared to non-impaired participants. Apart from external support, patients who experienced complex health care needs reported resources less frequently compared to frail and mentally ill patients. Conclusion: Coping resources in older adults are associated with sex and impairment. Evaluation and support of personal resources of frail or mentally ill persons or individuals with complex health care needs should be integrated in the therapeutic process.

411	Toward Best Practice In Human Machine Interface Design For Older Drivers: A Review Of Current Design Guidelines	2017	437	 10.1016/j.aap.2016.06.010			437	106		460.0	Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the driving population. While there is a strong emphasis for older people to maintain their mobility, the safety of older drivers is a serious community concern. Frailty and declines in a range of age-related sensory, cognitive, and physical impairments can place older drivers at an increased risk of crash-related injuries and death. A number of studies have indicated that in-vehicle technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS) may provide assistance to older drivers. However, these technologies will only benefit older drivers if their design is congruent with the complex needs and diverse abilities of this driving cohort. The design of ADAS and IVIS is largely informed by automotive Human Machine Interface (HMI) guidelines. However, it is unclear to what extent the declining sensory, cognitive and physical capabilities of older drivers are addressed in the current guidelines. This paper provides a review of key current design guidelines for IVIS and ADAS with respect to the extent they address age-related changes in functional capacities. The review revealed that most of the HMI guidelines do not address design issues related to older driver impairments. In fact, in many guidelines driver age and sensory cognitive and physical impairments are not mentioned at all and where reference is made, it is typically very broad. Prescriptive advice on how to actually design a system so that it addresses the needs and limitations of older drivers is not provided. In order for older drivers to reap the full benefits that in-vehicle technology can afford, it is critical that further work establish how older driver limitations and capabilities can be supported by the system design process, including their inclusion into HMI design guidelines.

412	Dynamical Resilience Indicators In Time Series Of Self-Rated Health Correspond To Frailty Levels In Older Adults	2017	439	 10.1093/gerona/glx065			412	72	7	991.0	Background: We currently still lack valid methods to dynamically measure resilience for stressors before the appearance of adverse health outcomes that hamper well-being. Quantifying an older adult’s resilience in an early stage would aid complex decision-making in health care. Translating complex dynamical systems theory to humans, we hypothesized that three dynamical indicators of resilience (variance, temporal autocorrelation, and cross-correlation) in time series of self-rated physical, mental, and social health were associated with frailty levels in older adults. Methods: We monitored self-rated physical, mental, and social health during 100 days using daily visual analogue scale questions in 22 institutionalized older adults (mean age 84.0, SD: 5.9 years). Frailty was determined by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) frailty index. The resilience indicators (variance, temporal autocorrelation, and cross-correlation) were calculated using multilevel models. Results: The self-rated health time series of frail elderly exhibited significantly elevated variance in the physical, mental, and social domain, as well as significantly stronger cross-correlations between all three domains, as compared to the nonfrail group (all P &lt; 0.001). Temporal autocorrelation was not significantly associated with frailty. Conclusions: We found supporting evidence for two out of three hypothesized resilience indicators to be related to frailty levels in older adults. By mirroring the dynamical resilience indicators to a frailty index, we delivered a first empirical base to validate and quantify the construct of systemic resilience in older adults in a dynamic way.

413	The Relationship Between Neuropsychological Assessment, Numeracy, And Functional Status In Older Adults With Type 1 Diabetes	2017	440	 10.1080/09602011.2015.1116448			440	27	4	507.0	While data are accumulating on the association between neuropsychological performance and real-world endpoints, less is known about the association with medical self-management skills. The self-management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is often complex, and mismanagement can result in hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia and associated morbidity and mortality. The T1D Exchange conducted a case-control study evaluating factors associated with severe hypoglycaemia in older adults (≥ 60 years old) with longstanding T1D (≥ 20 years). A battery of neuropsychological and functional assessments was administered, including measures of diabetes-specific self-management skill (diabetes numeracy) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). After adjusting for confounding variables, diabetes numeracy was related to memory and complex speeded attention; while IADL were associated with simple processing speed, executive functioning, complex speeded attention and dominant hand dexterity. The severity of overall cognitive deficit was uniquely associated with both diabetes numeracy and IADL, when controlling for age, education, frailty and depression. This study demonstrates that the cognitive deficits in older adults with T1D have functional implications for both diabetes management and IADL. Further research is needed to determine specific interventions to maximise diabetes self-management in older adults with declining cognition.

414	Defining Aging Phenotypes And Related Outcomes: Clues To Recognize Frailty In Hospitalized Older Patients	2017	441				412	72	3	395.0	Background: Because frailty is a complex phenomenon associated with poor outcomes, the identification of patient profiles with different care needs might be of greater practical help than to look for a unifying definition. This study aimed at identifying aging phenotypes and their related outcomes in order to recognize frailty in hospitalized older patients. Methods: Patients aged 65 or older enrolled in internal medicine and geriatric wards participating in the REPOSI registry. Relationships among variables associated to sociodemographic, physical, cognitive, functional, and medical status were explored using a multiple correspondence analysis. The hierarchical cluster analysis was then performed to identify possible patient profiles. Multivariable logistic regression was used to verify the association between clusters and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and 3-month postdischarge mortality and rehospitalization). Results: 2,841 patients were included in the statistical analyses. Four clusters were identified: the healthiest (I); those with multimorbidity (II); the functionally independent women with osteoporosis and arthritis (III); and the functionally dependent oldest old patients with cognitive impairment (IV). There was a significantly higher in-hospital mortality in Cluster II (odds ratio [OR] = 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15–4.46) and Cluster IV (OR = 5.15, 95% CI = 2.58–10.26) and a higher 3-month mortality in Cluster II (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.13–2.44) and Cluster IV (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15–3.00) than in Cluster I. Conclusions: Using alternative analytical techniques among hospitalized older patients, we could distinguish different frailty phenotypes, differently associated with adverse events. The identification of different patient profiles can help defining the best care strategy according to specific patient needs.

415	Key Elements Of Optimal Treatment Decision-Making For Surgeons And Older Patients With Colorectal Or Pancreatic Cancer: A Qualitative Study	2017	442	 10.1016/j.pec.2016.10.013			442	100	3	473.0	Objective: To identify key elements of optimal treatment decision-making for surgeons and older patients with colorectal (CRC) or pancreatic cancer (PC). Methods: Six focus groups with different participants were performed: three with older CRC/PC patients and relatives, and three with physicians. Supplementary in-depth interviews were conducted in another seven patients. Framework analysis was used to identify key elements in decision-making. Results: 23 physicians, 22 patients and 14 relatives participated. Three interacting components were revealed: preconditions, content and facilitators of decision-making. To provide optimal information about treatments’ impact on an older patient’s daily life, physicians should obtain an overall picture and take into account patients’ frailty. Depending on patients’ preferences and capacities, dividing decision-making into more sessions will be helpful and simultaneously emphasize patients’ own responsibility. GPs may have a valuable contribution because of their background knowledge and supportive role. Conclusion: Stakeholders identified several crucial elements in the complex surgical decision-making of older CRC/PC patients. Structured qualitative research may also be of great help in optimizing other treatment directed decision-making processes. Practice implications: Surgeons should be trained in examining preconditions and useful facilitators in decision-making in older CRC/PC patients to optimize its content and to improve the quality of shared care.

416	Personality And Frailty: Evidence From Four Samples	2017	443	 10.1016/j.jrp.2016.12.006			443	66		46.0	Frailty is a prevalent geriatric syndrome. Little is known about the psychological factors associated with this syndrome. Based on four large samples of older adults aged from 65 to 104years old, the present study examined whether personality traits are related to frailty. High neuroticism, low conscientiousness, low extraversion, low openness and low agreeableness were related to higher frailty across samples. Longitudinal analysis conducted in one sample revealed that high neuroticism was associated with worsening frailty over an 8-year period. Higher frailty at baseline and over time was related to maladaptive personality changes. This study extends existing knowledge on the link between personality and health in older adults, by identifying the personality traits associated with frailty, a complex geriatric syndrome.

417	Use Of Methadone As An Adjuvant Medication To Low-Dose Opioids For Neuropathic Pain In The Frail Elderly: A Case Series	2016	444	 10.1089/jpm.2016.0246			444	19	12	1351.0	Palliative care clinicians are increasingly involved in the care of elderly patients suffering from chronic malignant and nonmalignant illnesses, of which neuropathic pain is a prevalent problem. As a person becomes more frail, pain medications such as opioid analgesics and adjuvant pain medications can result in unwanted effects such as sedation, confusion, and increased risk of falls. Treating pain in patients with advanced dementia or neurodegenerative diseases that can affect swallowing is particularly challenging because most adjuvant pain medications used to ameliorate neuropathic pain must be taken orally. Furthermore, dosing of neuropathic medications is limited by renal function, which is often impaired in the elderly due to both normal aging and renal disease. Methadone is an opioid analgesic that is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, is excreted by the bowels, is highly lipophilic, and can be administered through the oral, buccal, or sublingual routes. We present three cases highlighting the use of low-dose adjuvant methadone to manage complex neuropathic pain in the frail elderly.

418	In Brief, Look Sharp: Short Form Assessment In The Geriatric Setting	2016	446	 10.1111/ap.12203			446	51	5	342.0	Objective: Older adults are an increasing proportion of the population globally. They are also an underserved population with respect to psychological services generally, and neuropsychological services specifically, with both cognitive and psychological concerns going undetected and therefore untreated. Strategies to improve detection of cognitive and psychological concerns in this population, as well as means of obtaining data within limited time or service delivery constraints, include the use of relatively brief assessment protocols. This review of such tools aims to assist clinicians in understanding when best to use such approaches with older adults. Method A review of the extant empirical literature on brief assessment tools for older adults was undertaken, with the aim of enumerating both advantages and drawbacks of the use of such tools. Results Although short‐form assessments in geriatric settings can indeed be advantageous and appropriate, if used incorrectly, they can potentially hamper accurate diagnosis and treatment. Measures, which hold particular promise with this population span, refer to both cognitive and affective measures, and include instruments designed for specific populations, for example specific cultural groups or disorders. Conclusion Older adults present across a wide range of settings, often with complex presentations, impaired cognition, and frail health that can challenge both diagnostic and assessment efforts as well as actual health service provision. This review provides data to enable practitioners to sharpen their practice with brief assessments for greatest efficacy in serving geriatric populations. Consideration is also given to possible areas for future clinical and research developments with respect to brief assessment strategies.

419	Expert And Patient Consensus On A Dynamic Model For Shared Decision-Making In Frail Older Patients	2016	448	 10.1016/j.pec.2015.12.014			442	99	6	1069.0	Objective: Shared decision-making (SDM) is widely recommended as a way to support patients in making healthcare choices. Due to an ageing population, the number of older patients will increase. Existing models for SDM are not sufficient for this patient group, due to their multi-morbidity, the lack of guidelines and evidence applicable to the numerous combinations of diseases. The aim of this study was to gain consensus on a model for SDM in frail older patients with multiple morbidities. Methods: We used a three-round Delphi study to reach consensus on a model for SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities. The expert panel consisted of 16 patients (round 1), and 59 professionals (rounds 1–3). In round 1, the SDM model was introduced, rounds 2 and 3 were used to validate the importance and feasibility of the SDM model. Results: Consensus for the proposed SDM model as a whole was achieved for both importance (91% panel agreement) and feasibility (76% panel agreement). Conclusions: SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities is a dynamic process. It requires a continuous counselling dialogue between professional and patient or proxy decision maker. Practice implications: The developed model for SDM in clinical practice may help professionals to apply SDM in the complex situation of the care for older patients.

420	Adherence To Long-Term Drug Regimen After Hospital Discharge: General Practitioners’ Attitude	2016	449	 10.1111/jgs.14018			144	64	3	657.0	Presents the study which discuses the general practitioners’ attitude about the adherence to long-term drug regimen after hospital discharge. A prospective study was conducted on 150 older adults hospitalized in an academic rehabilitation geriatric center in France. A medical report was sent to GPs within 2 to 3 weeks after the end of the stay, and they were contacted by telephone to present the study. Four months after they had agreed to participate, they received a questionnaire assessing their attitude regarding the recommendations for long-term drug regimen that the geriatricians had prescribed. These results emphasize the active role that GPs play in the adherence of frail, polymedicated, and polymorbid individuals to recommendations for complex drug regimens. They also underline the need to enhance continuity of care between hospital and the community.

421	The Geriatric Icf Core Set Reflecting Health-Related Problems In Community-Living Older Adults Aged 75 Years And Older Without Dementia: Development And Validation	2015	450	 10.3109/09638288.2015.1024337			450	37	25	2337.0	Purpose: The aim of the present study was to develop a valid Geriatric ICF Core Set reflecting relevant health-related problems of community-living older adults without dementia. Methods: A Delphi study was performed in order to reach consensus (≥70% agreement) on second-level categories from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The Delphi panel comprised 41 older adults, medical and non-medical experts. Content validity of the set was tested in a cross-sectional study including 267 older adults identified as frail or having complex care needs. Results: Consensus was reached for 30 ICF categories in the Delphi study (fourteen Body functions, ten Activities and Participation and six Environmental Factors categories). Content validity of the set was high: the prevalence of all the problems was &gt;10%, except for d530 Toileting . The most frequently reported problems were b710 Mobility of joint functions (70%), b152 Emotional functions (65%) and b455 Exercise tolerance functions (62%). No categories had missing values. Conclusion: The final Geriatric ICF Core Set is a comprehensive and valid set of 29 ICF categories, reflecting the most relevant health-related problems among community-living older adults without dementia. This Core Set may contribute to optimal care provision and support of the older population.Implications for Rehabilitation: (i) The Geriatric ICF Core Set may provide a practical tool for gaining an understanding of the relevant health-related problems of community-living older adults without dementia. (ii) The Geriatric ICF Core Set may be used in primary care practice as an assessment tool in order to tailor care and support to the needs of older adults. (iii) The Geriatric ICF Core Set may be suitable for use in multidisciplinary teams in integrated care settings, since it is based on a broad range of problems in functioning. (iv) Professionals should pay special attention to health problems related to mobility and emotional functioning since these are the most prevalent problems in community-living older adults.

422	Cost-Effectiveness Of A Chronic Care Model For Frail Older Adults In Primary Care: Economic Evaluation Alongside A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized Trial	2015	451				144	63	12	2494.0	Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Geriatric Care Model (GCM), an integrated care model for frail older adults based on the Chronic Care Model, with that of usual care. Design: Economic evaluation alongside a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting: Primary care (35 practices) in two regions in the Netherlands. Participants: Community-dwelling older adults who were frail according to their primary care physicians and the Program on Research for Integrating Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy case-finding tool questionnaire (N = 1,147). Interventions: The GCM consisted of the following components: a regularly scheduled in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment by a practice nurse followed by a customized care plan, management and training of practice nurses by a geriatric expert team, and coordination of care through community network meetings and multidisciplinary team consultations of individuals with complex care needs. Measurements: Outcomes were measured every 6 months and included costs from a societal perspective, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 12- item Short-Form Survey (SF-12) physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scales), functional limitations (Katz activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), and quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D. Results: Multilevel regression models adjusted for time and baseline confounders showed no significant differences in costs ($356, 95% confidence interval = −$488–1,134) and outcomes between intervention and usual care phases. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that, for the SF-12 PCS and MCS, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.76 if decision-makers are willing to pay $30,000 per point improvement on the SF-12 scales (range 0–100). For all other outcomes the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was low. Conclusion: Because the GCM was not cost-effective compared to usual care after 24 months of follow-up, widespread implementation in its current form is not recommended.

423	Complex Health Problems Among The Oldest Old In Sweden: Increased Prevalence Rates Between 1992 And 2002 And Stable Rates Thereafter	2015	452	 10.1007/s10433-015-0351-2			452	12	4	285.0	Studies of health trends in older populations usually focus on single health indicators. We include multiple medical and functional indicators, which together indicate the broader impact of health problems experienced by individuals and the need for integrated care from several providers of medical and long-term care. The study identified severe problems in three health domains (diseases/symptoms, mobility, and cognition/communication) in three nationally representative samples of the Swedish population aged 77+ in 1992, 2002, and 2011 ( n ≈ 1900; response rate &gt; 85 %). Institutionalized people and proxy interviews were included. People with severe problems in two or three domains were considered to have complex health problems. Results showed a significant increase of older adults with complex health problems from 19 % in 1992 to 26 % in 2002 and no change thereafter. Changes over time remained when controlling for age and sex. When stratified by education, complex health problems increased significantly for people with lower education between 1992 and 2002 and did not change significantly between 2002 and 2011. For higher-educated people, there was no significant change over time. Among the people with severe problems in the symptoms/disease domain, about half had no severe problems in the other domains. People with severe mobility problems, on the other hand, were more likely to also have severe problems in other domains. Even stable rates may imply an increasing number of very old people with complex health problems, resulting in a need for improved coordination between providers of medical care and social services.

424	Predictive Validity Of A Frailty Measure (Gfi) And A Case Complexity Measure (Im-E-Sa) On Healthcare Costs In An Elderly Population	2015	453	 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.09.015			453	79	5	404.0	Objectives: Measures of frailty (Groningen Frailty Indicator, GFI) and case complexity (INTERMED for the Elderly, IM-E-SA) may assist healthcare professionals to allocate healthcare resources. Both instruments have been evaluated with good psychometric properties. Limited evidence has been published about their predictive validity. Thus, our aim is to evaluate the predictive validity of both instruments on healthcare costs. Methods: Multivariate linear regression models were developed to estimate associations between the predictors frailty (GFI) and/or case complexity (IM-E-SA) and the healthcare costs (in € log transformed) in the following year. All models were adjusted for demographics and the presence of morbidity. Results: In the multivariate regression analyses the continuous scores of the GFI and IM-E-SA remained significant predictors for total healthcare costs. Adjusted βs for GFI and IM-E-SA were respectively 0.14 (95% CI 0.10–0.18) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.04–0.07). The corresponding explained variance (R2) for both models was 0.40. Frailty remained a significant predictor of long-term care costs (adjusted β 0.13 [95% CI 0.09–0.16]), while case complexity was a significant predictor of curative care costs (adjusted β 0.03 [95% CI 0.02–0.05]). Conclusions: The GFI and IM-E-SA both accurately predict total healthcare costs in the following year.

425	Delivery Of Institutional Long-Term Care Under Two Social Insurances: Lessons From The Korean Experience	2015	454	 10.1016/j.healthpol.2015.07.009			454	119	10	1330.0	Little is known about health and social care provision for people with long-term care (LTC) needs under multiple insurances. The aim of this study is to compare the profile, case-mix, and service provision to older people at long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) covered by the national health insurance (NHI) with those of older people at long-term care facilities (LTCFs) covered by the public long-term care insurance (LTCI) in Korea. A national LTC survey using common functional measures and a case-mix classification system was conducted with a nationally representative sample of older people at LTCFs and LTCHs in 2013. The majority of older people in both settings were female and frail, with complex chronic diseases. About one fourth were a low-income population with Medical-Aid. The key functional status was similar between the two groups. As for case-mix, more than half of the LTCH population were categorized as having lower medical care needs, while more than one fourth of the LTCF residents had moderate or higher medical care needs. Those with high medical care needs at LTCFs were significantly more likely to be admitted to acute-care hospitals than their counterparts at LTCHs. The current delivery of institutional LTC under the two insurances in Korea is not coordinated well. It is necessary to redefine the roles of LTCHs and strengthen health care in LTCFs. A systems approach is critical to establish person-centered, integrated LTC delivery across different financial sources.

426	Association Between Oxidative Stress And Frailty In An Elderly German Population: Results From The Esther Cohort Study	2015	455	 10.1159/000380881			455	61	5	407.0	Background: Oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory biomarkers have been postulated to be important factors in the development of age-related diseases. While causes of frailty are complex and multidimensional based on the interaction of genetic, biological, physical, and environmental factors, the biological basis of frailty has been difficult to establish. Objective: In this study, we aimed to assess the possible association between different OS and inflammatory biomarkers and frailty. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis was performed among 2,518 subjects participating in a large population-based cohort study on aging conducted in Germany. Frailty was assessed as proposed by Fried et al. [J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2001;56:M146–M156]. OS biomarkers, biological antioxidant potential (BAP), derivate of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) and total thiol levels (TTL), and an established biomarker of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by spectrophotometry and immunoturbidimetry. Logistic regression models were performed to assess the relationship between the OS biomarkers and frailty status. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to quantify the associations. Results: Mean levels of d-ROM, TTL, and CRP differed between frail and non-frail participants (p values &lt; 0.0001). Comparing highest and lowest quartiles of the biomarkers, statistically significant positive associations with frailty were observed for d-ROM (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.25–3.25) and CRP (OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 2.00–4.96), respectively, after controlling for age and sex. An inverse statistically significant association with frailty was observed for TTL (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.25–0.69). Conclusion: The strong associations with OS biomarkers and CRP support a major role of OS and inflammation in the development of frailty, which should be followed up in further longitudinal studies on frailty.

427	Obesity In The Context Of Aging: Quality Of Life Considerations	2015	457	 10.1007/s40273-014-0237-8			457	33	7	655.0	The progressive increase in the prevalence of obesity and aging in the population is resulting in increased healthcare and disability spending. The burden of obesity is particularly relevant in old age, due to accumulating co-morbidities and changes in body composition. Sarcopenic obesity, a mix of over- and under-nutrition, causes frailty, disability, and problems in social and psychological areas, impacting overall health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). The relationship between obesity, aging, and HR-QOL is, however, much more complex than generally acknowledged and is difficult to disentangle. The impact of obesity on HR-QOL is particularly strong in young people, who are free of co-morbidities. It progressively attenuates, compared with the general population, with advancing age, when co-morbid conditions are diffusely present and reduce the perceived health status, independent of obesity. However, even this apparent ‘obesity paradox’ should not minimize the importance of obesity on HR-QOL, as other obesity-associated limitations and disabilities do impact HR-QOL in older age. A patient-centered approach aimed at reducing the disability and social isolation of advancing age is mandatory to improve HR-QOL in any class of obesity.

Depressive symptoms are also common in older adults and may affect ADLs. Safe storage and utilization of firearms are complex ADLs, which require intact judgment, executive function, and visuospatial ability, and may be affected by cognitive impairment. Depression or cognitive impairment may cause paranoia, delusions, disinhibition, apathy, or aggression and thereby limit the ability to safely utilize firearms. These problems may be superimposed upon impaired mobility, arthritis, visual impairment, or poor balance. Inadequate attention to personal protection may also cause hearing impairment and accidents. In this article, we review the data on prevalence of firearms access among older adults; safety concerns due to age-related conditions; barriers to addressing this problem; indications prompting screening for firearms access; and resources available to patients, caregivers, and health care providers.

429	Gerontological Social Work: Reflections On Its Role, Purpose And Value	2015	459	 10.1093/bjsw/bct195			459	45	4	1296.0	Over the last twenty years, successive welfare policies have undermined gerontological social work as a specialist area of social work practice. The UK’s ageing population offers an opportunity for gerontological social work to rebuild itself. Increasing numbers of older people with long-term conditions, significant growth in the population of family carers and enhanced community-based living for people with long-term needs combine to reposition social work as—potentially—playing a crucial role in the achievement of key policy goals. The particular skill and knowledge set of social workers uniquely equips them to manage the intersection of issues that currently challenge health and welfare services: complex needs, risk, transitions, end of life, carer stress and frailty. That older service users value the approach, input and expertise of social workers and that social workers have greater capacity to deliver sustainable support are also relevant. For gerontological social work to have a future, not only is it required to reclaim its specialist role, but it must re-establish its commitment to social justice, invest in building an evidence base of effectiveness and embed ageing-related teaching in the social work curriculum.

430	Elder Abuse: An Approach To Identification, Assessment And Intervention	2015	460	 10.1503/cmaj.141329			460	187	8	575.0	This article discusses an approach to identification, assessment and intervention to elder abuse. Evidence regarding the risk factors for, assessment of and interventions to address elder abuse is limited. Although multidisciplinary teams have existed for several decades, only one study has demonstrated a measurable effect of such teams, and it was limited to financial abuse. Elder abuse is probably best considered as a syndrome, similar to the other “geriatric giants” such as falls and frailty, given its complexity. The best intervention strategy at this time appears to be education targeted at increasing awareness of elder abuse among health care professionals, analogous to the incorporation of child abuse training into the medical school curriculum.

431	Ageing, Exercise And The Chemistry Of Inflammation	2015	461	 10.1017/S0959259815000088			461	25	2	73.0	Exercise has a complex influence on the biochemical markers of inflammation that includes suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The magnitude of this effect is large for prolonged activity at high work rates. People who are able to perform regular mild–moderate exercise have lower baseline pro-inflammatory cytokine levels that appear to be associated with a number of health benefits, including reduced all-cause mortality. These effects extend into old age. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic myokine released by active muscle cells, appears to play a central role in these observed phenomena, though the mechanisms of action are intricate and incompletely understood. The minimum threshold of the exercise–cytokine dose–response, if any, has not been clearly characterized. Therefore, the potential to influence cytokine activity and reduce age-associated inflammation in very aged or frail people able to perform only very low levels of physical activity is unknown.

432	Extracare: Does It Promote Resident Satisfaction Compared To Residential And Home Care?	2015	462	 10.1093/bjsw/bct185			459	45	3	949.0	Extracare housing is seen as an innovative solution to meet both accommodation and care needs of increasing numbers of older people. This paper is based on a mixed method study exploring whether extracare is for ‘fit’ and ‘frail’ older people. In particular, we compare the satisfaction (financial, personal, social, environmental and access to personal services) of older people in extracare with those in residential care and older people in the community. In relation to the domains of financial satisfaction, residential care respondents reported lower satisfaction, fewer friends and lower social support than those in extracare and in the community, but older people in extracare were less satisfied with their access to personal social services. Additionally, although the care environment did not predict social satisfaction, from our qualitative interviews, we found that, whereas more opportunities to socialise existed in extracare, there was little evidence of new developing friendships. These findings are important for social workers and social care professionals when assessing the needs of older people and exploring provision that can meet often complex needs in times of crisis and transition.

433	Frailty In Older Adults: An Evolutionary Concept Analysis	2015	145	 10.1891/1541-6577.29.1.66			463	29	1	66.0	The term frailty is often used to describe a subset of the older population with complex health issues. It is associated with dependence, disability, increased health care use, and mortality. An emergent problem is the lack of consensus as to the etiology and definition of frailty. The purpose of this concept analysis is to clarify the concept of frailty in the context of older adults and propose a definition of frailty that may be relevant to identification of frail older adults. The results from this analysis conclude frailty in older adults is a tenuous state of health that is the result of the complex interplay of physiological, psychosocial, and environmental stressors that increases an older adult’s susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.

434	Everyday Mobilisations Among Grandmothers In South Africa: Survival, Support And Social Change In The Era Of Hiv/Aids	2014	464	 10.1017/S0144686X13000317			168	34	10	1641.0	In many sub-Saharan African communities, caring for vulnerable children in the era of HIV/AIDS appears to be creating deep financial, physical and psychological strains for care-givers, the great majority of whom are ageing women or 'gi andmothers'. Yet, limited primary research has been carried out with older women in specific communities, and therefore grandmothers' collective responses, sources of support, complex lived experiences, and diverse family situations are not well understood. This paper presents the findings of research undertaken in four communities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between 2006 and 2010. The purpose was to understand the daily stresses, collective responses and mobilisations of older women in these communities. The research involved repeated focus groups, interviews and participant observation involving approximately 100 older women. In the analysis, attention is given to the diversities among participants, the ways in which HIV/AIDS intermingles with other stresses in their lives to drive their mobilisations, and their collective responses, even amidst highly constrained conditions. Through these lenses, the paper illuminates how older women in these communities are organising in response to the combined, devastating and diverse effects of HIV/AIDS, poverty, violence and illness. It also suggests that, counter to some stereotyping of 'African grandmothers' as frail or passive, these women are forming associations in order to generate incomes, resist stigma, connect with broader support networks and provide care to hundreds in their communities.

435	Direct And Indirect Effects Of Nutritional Status, Physical Function And Cognitive Function On Activities Of Daily Living In Japanese Older Adults Requiring Long‐Term Care	2014	465	 10.1111/ggi.12169			119	14	4	799.0	Aim: To identify the direct and indirect effects of nutritional status, physical function, and cognitive function on activities of daily living in Japanese older adults requiring long-term care. Methods: In total, 179 participants aged ≥65 years who were eligible for long-term care insurance (mean age 85.5 ± 7.8 years) were recruited for this study. Nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment, Short Form) and physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery) were examined. Activities of daily living, cognitive function and frailty were assessed using the Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Frailty Scale, respectively. Path analysis was used to determine relationships between these factors and the activities of daily living. Results: For Japanese older adults requiring long-term care, pathways were modeled for nutritional status, physical function and the activities of daily living. The total effect of nutritional status was 0.516 ( P &lt; 0.001). The indirect effect of nutritional status through physical function on the activities of daily living was 0.458 ( P &lt; 0.001). Finally, no significant direct effect of nutritional status on activities of daily living was observed (b = 0.058, P = 0.258). Conclusions: The present study identified the complex pathway from nutritional status to the activities of daily living through physical function in aged Japanese people requiring long-term care. These findings suggest that maintaining good nutritional status and nutritional support might delay physical function decline, and prolong the activities of daily living.

436	Delirium And Depression: Inter-Relationship And Clinical Overlap In Elderly People	2014	467	 10.1016/S2215-0366(14)70281-0			467	1	4	303.0	Delirium and depression are complex neuropsychiatric syndromes common in the elderly and are associated with poor health-care outcomes. Accurate diagnosis is essential to the provision of optimum health care for individuals with these conditions but is complicated by substantial clinical overlap in symptoms and comorbidities. A careful assessment of the patient's symptoms, including their context and time course, is needed for accurate diagnosis. Previous depression is common in patients with delirium and depressive illness is a recognised sequelae of delirium. The two syndromes seem to be caused by similar pathophysiological mechanisms, involving disturbances in stress and inflammatory responses, monoaminergic and melatonergic signalling, which point to new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Improved methods to assess delirium and depression in populations at high risk by virtue of their age, diminished cognitive reserve and physical frailty is a key target to achieve improved health-care outcomes in elderly individuals.

437	Shorter Telomeres In Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells From Older Persons With Sarcopenia: Results From An Exploratory Study	2014	468	 10.3389/fnagi.2014.00233			399	6			Background: Telomere shortening in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been associated with biological age and several chronic degenerative diseases. However, the relationship between telomere length and sarcopenia, a hallmark of the aging process, is unknown. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether PBMC telomeres obtained from sarcopenic older persons were shorter relative to non-sarcopenic peers. We further explored if PBMC telomere length was associated with frailty, a major clinical correlate of sarcopenia. Methods: Analyses were conducted in 142 persons aged ≥ 65 years referred to a geriatric outpatient clinic (University Hospital). The presence of sarcopenia was established according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria, with bioelectrical impedance analysis used for muscle mass estimation. The frailty status was determined by both the Fried’s criteria (physical frailty, PF) and a modified Rockwood’s frailty index (FI). Telomere length was measured in PBMCs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction according to the telomere/single-copy gene ratio ( T/S ) method. Results: Among 142 outpatients (mean age 75.0 ± 6.5 years, 59.2% women), sarcopenia was diagnosed in 23 individuals (19.3%). The PF phenotype was detected in 74 participants (52.1%). The average FI score was 0.46 ± 0.17. PBMC telomeres were shorter in sarcopenic subjects ( T/S = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.18–0.24) relative to non-sarcopenic individuals ( T/S = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.24–0.28; p = 0.01), independent of age, gender, smoking habit, or comorbidity. No significant associations were determined between telomere length and either PF or the FI. Conclusion: PBMC telomere length, expressed as T/S values, is shorter in older outpatients with sarcopenia. The cross-sectional assessment of PBMC telomere length is not sufficient at capturing the complex, multidimensional syndrome of frailty.

This concern was clearly expressed during the ""Speaking of Aging Tour"" that the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Institute of Aging undertook in 2012. The goal of this consultation was to identify gaps in knowledge and where new research was most needed as well as transfer of existing knowledge to best care practices health services organizations.

439	Development Of A Level 1 Geriatric Outpatient Social Work Screen	2014	470	 10.1111/jgs.12812			144	62	5	988.0	presents a study on the development of a level 1 geriatric outpatient social work screen. This pilot study was designed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a nurse-administered Level 1 social work screen to identify individuals potentially in need of intervention by a master's-level social worker, in addressing the safety concerns of individuals attending a Department of Veteran Affairs Geriatric Patient Aligned Care Team clinic (GERI-PACT). Interdisciplinary care for medically complex older adults necessitates targeting of the population with the greatest potential for benefit. This has been done with nutrition screening in hospitalized individuals with Level 1 screening by nurses at the time of admission followed by a detailed Level 2 dietary assessment for individuals at high risk of nutrition-related disorders and for pharmacy in a high-risk geriatric clinic. Use of a brief Level 1 Social Work Screen by clinic nurses at check-in for a frail elderly clinic population showed high discordance between nurse and social work review, suggesting that the instrument may have limited utility in targeting social work review when used in a high-risk population.

440	Intentional Non-Adherence To Medications By Older Adults	2014	471	 10.1007/s40266-014-0153-9			471	31	3	149.0	The extent to which an individual’s medication-taking behaviour and/or execution of lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider’, is a highly complex behaviour, defined as adherence. However, intentional non-adherence is regularly observed and results in negative outcomes for patients along with increased healthcare provision costs. Whilst this is a consistent issue amongst adults of all ages, the burden of chronic disease is greatest amongst older adults. As a result, the absolute prevalence of intentional non-adherence is increased in this population. This non-systematic review of intentional non-adherence to medication highlights the extent of the problem amongst older adults. It notes that age, per se, is not a contributory factor in intentionally nonadherent behaviours. Moreover, it describes the difference in methodology required to identify such behaviours in contrast to reports of non-adherence in general: the use of focus groups, semi-structured, one-to-one interviews and questionnaires as opposed to pill counts, electronic medication monitors and analysis of prescription refill rates. Using Leventhal’s Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation, it emphasizes six key factors that may contribute to intentional non-adherence amongst older adults: illness beliefs, the perceived risks (e.g. dependence, adverse effects), benefits and necessity of potential treatments, the patient–practitioner relationship, inter-current physical and mental illnesses, financial constraints and pharmaceutical/pharmacological issues (poly-pharmacy/regimen complexity). It describes the current evidence for each of these aspects and notes the paucity of data validating Leventhal’s model in this regard. It also reports on interventions that may address these issues and explicitly acknowledges the lack of evidence-based interventions available to healthcare practitioners. As a result, it highlights five key areas that require urgent research amongst older adults: (1) the overlap between intentional and unintentional non-adherence, particularly amongst those who may be frail or isolated; (2) the potential correlation between symptomatic benefit and intentional vs. unintentional non-adherence to medication; (3) an evaluation of the source of prescribing (i.e. a long-standing provider vs. an acute episode of care) and the patient–prescriber relationship as determinants of intentional and unintentional non-adherence; (4) the decision-making processes leading to selective intentional nonadherence amongst older adults with multiple medical problems; and (5) the development and evaluation of interventions designed to reduce intentional non-adherence, specifically addressing each of the aspects listed above.

However, they remain at increased risk of adverse outcome in comparison with younger patients. This may relate to the association of ageing with physiological deterioration, multi-morbidity and geriatric syndromes such as frailty, all of which are independent predictors of adverse post-operative outcome. Although there is an emerging evidence base for the identification and management of these predictors, this has not yet translated into routine clinical practice. Older patients undergoing surgery often receive suboptimal care and surgical pathways are not well suited to complex older patients with multi-pathology. Evidence is emerging for alternative models of care that incorporate the evolving evidence base for optimal peri-operative management of the older surgical patient, including risk assessment and optimization. This article aims to provide a practical overview of the literature to all disciplines working in this field.

442	What Impedes And What Facilitates A Quality Improvement Project For Older Hospitalized Patients?	2014	473	 10.1093/intqhc/mzt079			473	26	1	41.0	Objective: To gain insight into which factors impede, and which facilitate, the implementation of a complex multi-component improvement initiative in hospitalized older patients. Design: A qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews. The three dimensions of Pettigrew and Whipp’s theoretical framework, namely, Process, Content and Context, were used to undertake a structured data analysis. Setting: The study was conducted in 19 Dutch hospitals implementing the Frail Elderly Project. Participants: Sixty-five members of staff, including physicians, nurses and members of the policy team. Intervention: The Frail Elderly Project, a Dutch quality improvement program, aims to decrease adverse events in frail older hospitalized people by implementing screening instruments and interventions targeting delirium, falls, malnutrition and physical impairment. Main outcome measures: The management of the process of implementation, participants’ opinions of the program elements and contextual factors which influence the implementation. Results: Barriers to implementation included two process factors (insufficient involvement of clinicians and lack of time), two content factors (having divergent objectives and concerns about recommended program elements) and two contextual factors (a lack of knowledge of delirium and minimal insight into the purposes and effects of the program). Facilitating factors included one process factor (leadership), one content factor (flexibility in choosing methods) and two contextual factors (the program’s guidance and the use of digital patient records). Conclusion: We identified the barriers and the factors which facilitate implementing complex multi-component improvement programs concerning care for older patients. These barriers must be resolved in future improvement programs in order to ensure successful implementation.

443	Metabolic Syndrome And Disability: Findings From The Prospective Three-City Study	2014	475	 10.1093/gerona/glt101			412	69	1	79.0	Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a potentially reversible cause of disability in the elderly people. The published literature suggests that the MetS–disability association is likely to be complex, depending on co-existing risk factors and with possible variation for each of the specific MetS components. Further evidence is needed to understand the specific consequences of the MetS as a whole and as a function of its components. Methods: Prospective analyses included data from 6,141 participants (60.9% women) aged 65 and older from the Three-City cohort. Mixed logistic models were used to determine associations between MetS (National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and 7-year incident disability measured as social restriction, mobility limitations (Rosow and Breslau scale), and limitations in instrumental and basic activities of daily living. Results: MetS was associated with incident social restriction (odds ratio = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.14–2.09), limited mobility (odds ratio = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.21–1.90), and instrumental activities of daily living limitations (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.24–2.10) after adjustment for a range of potential sociodemographic, health behavior, and health status confounders at baseline. These associations were independent of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease and dementia. There was evidence of associations between MetS components: central obesity, high triglycerides, and elevated fasting glucose and incidence of limitations in mobility and instrumental activities of daily living. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the increased risk of mobility and instrumental activities of daily living limitations in the elderly people associated with MetS is over and above that associated with its components.

444	Malnutrition In Older Adults: Urgent Need For Action: A Plea For Improving The Nutritional Situation Of Older Adults	2013	478	 10.1159/000346142			455	59	4	328.0	During the past decades, malnutrition has attracted increasing scientific attention and is by now regarded as a true geriatric syndrome characterized by multifactorial causality, identified by symptoms and accompanied by frailty, disability and poor outcome. This viewpoint summarizes our present knowledge and the usual current handling of malnutrition in older people and highlights the urgent need for action in this field. Age-related changes in the complex system of appetite regulation, resulting in the so-called anorexia of aging, predispose older adults to a decrease in food intake which may lead to malnutrition, if additional risk factors like health or social problems occur. Consequently, malnutrition is widespread in the older population, notably in those who are institutionalized. Despite the fact that effective interventions are available, prevention and treatment of malnutrition do not currently receive appropriate attention. As an important first step towards better awareness, screening for malnutrition should become a mandatory integral part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment. Furthermore, practical local guidelines should be implemented in all geriatric hospital wards and nursing homes in order to improve nutritional care in the daily routine. Important to note is that reasonable nutritional management is not possible without qualified staff in adequate numbers allowing appropriate individual nutritional care. Regarding future research, studies at the cellular, metabolic and clinical levels and the linking of information from different research approaches are required to better understand the transition from good nutritional health and independence of old people to malnutrition, functional impairment and poor health. In parallel to well-designed observational and intervention studies, standardized documentation of nutritional information in daily routine would enable the uniform collection of data for research as well as for political decisions. In summary, the time is ripe for better inclusion of nutrition in geriatric health care. This will not only bring about improved nutritional status and outcome, and thus individual benefit for the affected person, but also economic benefits both for the institution and the health-care system.

445	Exclusion Of Older Adults From Ongoing Clinical Trials About Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	2013	480	 10.1111/jgs.12215			144	61	5	734.0	Objective: To assess the extent of exclusion of older individuals from ongoing clinical trials regarding type 2 diabetes mellitus. Design: Cohort study. Setting: World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Participants: Using the Participation of the Elderly in Clinical Trials methodology, data from ongoing clinical trials on type 2 diabetes mellitus were extracted from the platform on July 31, 2011. Measurements: Proportion of trials excluding individuals using an arbitrary upper age limit or other exclusion criteria that might indirectly cause limited recruitment of older individuals. Exclusion criteria were classified as justified or poorly justified. Results: Of 440 trials investigating treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 289 (65.7%) excluded individuals using an arbitrary upper age limit. Such exclusion was significantly more common in trials with calculated sample sizes of less than 100 subjects (73.6% vs 59.5%; P = .002). Exclusion for comorbidity was present in 338 trials (76.8%); this exclusion was poorly justified in 236 trials (53.6%). Exclusion for polypharmacy (29.5% of trials), cognitive impairment (18.4%), short life expectancy (8.9%), and other poorly justified exclusion criteria that could limit the inclusion of older individuals was also present. Only six trials (1.4%) were designed specifically to study older adults. Conclusion: Despite the recommendations of international regulatory agencies, exclusion of older individuals from ongoing trials regarding type 2 diabetes mellitus is frequent— higher than reported for other age-related diseases. This exclusion limits the value of the evidence that clinicians use when treating old, frail, complex patients with diabetes mellitus.

446	Prescription Errors In Older Individuals With An Intellectual Disability: Prevalence And Risk Factors In The Healthy Ageing And Intellectual Disability Study	2013	481	 10.1016/j.ridd.2013.02.005			481	34	5	1656.0	Prescribing pharmacotherapy for older individuals with an intellectual disability (ID) is a complex process, possibly leading to an increased risk of prescription errors. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of older individuals with an intellectual disability with at least one prescription error and (2) to identify potential risk factors for these prescription errors (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), frailty index, level of intellectual disability and living situation). The study population consisted of 600 older (≥ 50 years) individuals with an ID using one or more drugs who were randomly selected from the study cohort of the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID) Study. The medication used at the time of measurement was screened for errors by a hospital pharmacist/clinical pharmacologist and a Master’s student pharmacy using consensus methodology. Participants with one or more prescription errors were compared to participants without prescription errors by multivariate logistic regression to identify potential risk factors. The prevalence of individuals with one or more prescription errors was 47.5% (285 of 600 individuals; 95% confidence interval (CI) 43– 52%). Relevant errors, defined as errors that actually do require a change of pharmacotherapy, were identified in 26.8% of the individuals (161 of 600 individuals; 95% CI 23–30%). Higher age (adjusted odds ratio (OR adj ) 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.06), less severe intellectual disability (moderate: OR adj 0.48; 95% CI 0.31–0.74 and severe: OR adj 0.56; 95% CI 0.32–0.98), higher BMI (OR adj 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.08), higher frailty index (0.39–0.54: OR adj 2.4; 95% CI 1.21–4.77 and ≥ 0.55: OR adj 3.4; 95% CI 1.03–11.02), polypharmacy (OR adj 8.06; 95% CI 5.59–11.62) and use of medicines acting on the central nervous system (OR adj 3.34; 95% CI 2.35–4.73) were independently associated with the occurrence of prescription errors. Interventions targeted to high risk patients should be designed and implemented to improve pharmacotherapy in older individuals with an intellectual disability.

447	Good News And Bad News: Depressive Symptoms Decline And Undertreatment Increases With Age In Home Care And Institutional Settings	2012	482	 10.1097/JGP.0b013e3182331702			482	20	12	1045.0	Objectives: Examination of prevalence of depressive symptoms among older persons in home care (HC) and complex continuing care (CCC) hospitals/units, factors associated with depressive symptoms in those settings, and rate of antidepressant use among older persons with depressive symptoms. Design: Observational study using data from interRAI assessments used in normal clinical practice. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the frail elderly and treatment approaches were described. Settings: Fourteen HC agencies and 134 CCC hospitals/units in Ontario, Canada. Participants: Older persons (N = 191,9871) aged 65 years and older, including 114,497 persons from HC and 77,490 persons from CCC. Measurement: Data were collected using Resident Assessment Instrument 2.0 (RAI 2.0) (1996–2004) in CCC and Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care (RAI-HC) (2003–2004) in HC. Results: Prevalence of depressive symptoms among older HC enrollees was lower (12.0%) than in CCC (23.6%). It decreased significantly with age in HC (to about 6% in those older than 95 years) but there were not substantial age differences in CCC. Common factors associated with depressive symptoms in both types of care were cognitive impairment, instability of health, daily pain, disability in activities of daily living; however, advanced age lost its protective effect in CCC. Less than half of the persons in HC and CCC with depressive symptoms were treated with antidepressants and their use decreased with age. Conclusions: Undertreatment of depressive symptoms among older persons remains a serious problem. Learning more about factors associated with depressive symptoms among the oldest old might improve detection and treatment of depression.

448	Palliative And Therapeutic Harmonization: A Model For Appropriate Decision‐Making In Frail Older Adults	2012	483	 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04210.x			144	60	12	2326.0	Frail older adults face increasingly complex decisions regarding medical care. The Palliative and Therapeutic Harmonization (PATH) model provides a structured approach that places frailty at the forefront of medical and surgical decision‐making in older adults. Preliminary data from the first 150 individuals completing the PATH program shows that the population served is frail (mean Clinical Frailty Score = 6.3), has multiple comorbidities (mean 8), and takes many medications (mean = 9). Ninety‐two percent of participants were able to complete decision‐making for an average of three current or projected health issues, most often (76.7%) with the help of a substitute decision‐maker (SDM). Decisions to proceed with scheduled medical or surgical interventions correlated with baseline frailty level and dementia stage, with participants with a greater degree of frailty (odds ratio (OR) = 3.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.39–8.38) or more‐advanced stage of dementia (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.06–2.65) being more likely to choose less‐aggressive treatment options. Although the PATH model is in the development stage, further evaluation is ongoing, including a qualitative analysis of the SDM experience of PATH and an assessment of the effectiveness of PATH in long‐term care. The results of these studies will inform the design of a larger randomized controlled trial.

449	Ingestive Skill Difficulties Are Frequent Among Acutely-Hospitalized Frail Elderly Patients, And Predict Hospital Outcomes	2012	484	 10.3109/02703181.2012.736019			484	30	4	271.0	Purpose: To examine the relationship between ingestive skill performance while eating and drinking and frailty status in acutely-hospitalized elderly patients and to examine whether there is a relationship between the proportion of ingestive skill difficulties and Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) and discharge destination. Methods: Frail ( n = 64) and robust ( n = 40) acutely-hospitalized elderly patients were assessed using The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment. Results: Forty-three ingestive skills were significantly more affected in frail patients (21.9% to 95.3%) versus robust patients (2.5% to 65.0%). When adjusting for frailty status, difficulties in self-feeding and texture management were related to prolonged LOS, and difficulties in positioning and liquid ingestion were related to discharge to institutional care. Conclusion: Ingestive skill difficulties among acutely-hospitalized frail elderly patients were frequent and characterized by great complexity. This necessitates a broad range of management strategies related to the patients’ ability in positioning, self-feeding skills, as well as oropharyngeal sensorimotor skills.

450	The Multiple Dimensions Of Frailty: Physical Capacity, Cognition, And Quality Of Life	2012	485	 10.1017/S1041610212000634			424	24	9	1429.0	Background: Frailty is a complex health state of increased vulnerability associated with adverse outcomes such as disability, falls, hospitalization, and death. Along with physical impairments, cognition and quality of life may be affected in frail older adults. Yet, evidence is still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare frail and non-frail older adults on physical, cognitive, and psychological dimensions. Methods: Thirty-nine frail and 44 non-frail elders were compared on several measures of physical capacity, cognition, and quality of life. Frailty status was based on a geriatric examination and scored using the Modified Physical Performance Test. Results: After controlling for demographic and medical characteristics, physical capacity measures (i.e. functional capacities, physical endurance, gait speed, and mobility) were significantly lower in frail participants. Frail participants showed reduced performances in specific cognitive measures of executive functions and processing speed. On the quality of life dimension, frail elders reported poor self-perceptions of physical capacity, cognition, affectivity, housekeeping efficacy, and physical health. Conclusion: In addition to the reduced physical capacity, frailty might affect selective components of cognition and quality of life. These dimensions should be investigated in intervention programs designed for frail older adults.

451	Geriatrician Input Into Nursing Homes Reduces Emergency Hospital Admissions	2012	486	 10.1016/j.archger.2011.10.014			400	55	2	331.0	Nursing home residents are often very dependent, very frail and have complex care needs. Effective partnerships between primary and secondary care will be of benefit to these residents. We looked at 1954 admission episodes to our Trust from April 2006 to March 2009 inclusive. 3 nursing homes had the highest number of multiple admissions (≥4). Four strategies to reduce hospital admissions were used at these nursing homes for 3 months. An alert was also sent to the geriatrician if one of the residents was admitted so that their discharge from hospital could be expedited. The project was then extended for another 4 months with 6 nursing homes. The results showed that geriatrician input into nursing homes had a significant impact on admissions from nursing homes (χ ²(2) = 6.261, p &lt;0.05). The second part of the project also showed significant impact on admissions (χ ²(2)=12.552, p &lt;0.05). Furthermore, in both parts of the project the length of stay in hospital for the residents was reduced. Geriatricians working together with co-ordinated multidisciplinary teams are well placed to manage the care needs of frail, elderly care home residents.

452	Validation Of The Danish Version Of The Mcgill Ingestive Skills Assessment Using Classical Test Theory And The Rasch Model	2012	484	 10.3109/09638288.2011.624249			450	34	10	859.0	Purpose: The study aimed to validate the Danish version of the Canadian the “McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment” (MISA-DK) for measuring dysphagia in frail elders. Method: One-hundred and ten consecutive older medical patients were recruited to the study. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Chronbach’s alpha). External construct validity (convergent and known-groups validity) was evaluated against theoretical constructs assessing the complex concept of ingestive skills. Internal construct validity was tested using Rasch analysis. Results: High internal consistency reliability with Chronbach’s alpha of 0.77–0.95 was evident. External construct validity was supported by expected high correlations with most of the constructs related to ingestive skills (rs = 0.53 to rs = 0.66). The MISA-DK discriminated significantly between known-groups. Fit to the Rasch model (x² (df) = 12 (12), p = 0.424) and unidimensionality of the MISA-DK was confirmed after resolving disordered thresholds for 11 items and adjustment of local dependency. Conclusion: The psychometric properties of the MISA-DK equal the original Canadian version. Assessment of internal construct validity indicated multidimensionality due to local dependency. Although achieving good fit to the Rasch model after adjustments, additional studies are needed to establish cross-cultural validity. Finally, establishment of the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the MISA-DK is also needed.

453	Medication Reconciliation: Identifying Medication Discrepancies In Acutely Ill Hospitalized Older Adults	2011	489	 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2011.07.005			489	9	5	339.0	Background: Medication discrepancies may occur during transitions from community to acute care hospitals. The elderly are at risk for such discrepancies due to multiple comorbidities and complex medication regimens. Medication reconciliation involves verifying medication use and identifying and rectifying discrepancies. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalences and types of medication discrepancies in acutely ill older patients. Methods: Patients who were ≥70 years and were admitted to any of 3 acute care for elders (ACE) units over a period of 2 nonconsecutive months in 2008 were prospectively enrolled. Medication discrepancies were classified as intentional, undocumented intentional, and unintentional. Unintentional medication discrepancies were classified by a blinded rater for potential to harm. This study was primarily qualitative, and descriptive (univariate) statistics are presented. Results: Sixty-seven patients (42 women; mean [SD] age, 84.0 [6.5] years) were enrolled. There were 37 unintentional prescription-medication discrepancies in 27 patients (40.3%) and 43 unintentional over-the-counter (OTC) medication discrepancies in 19 patients (28.4%), which translates to Medication Reconciliation Success Index (MRSI) of 89% for prescription medications and 59% for OTC medications. The overall MRSI was 83%. More than half of the prescription-medication discrepancies (56.8%) were classified as potentially causing moderate/severe discomfort or clinical deterioration. Conclusion: Despite a fairly high overall MRSI in these patients admitted to ACE units, a substantial proportion of the prescription-medication discrepancies were associated with potential harm.

454	A Tentative Consensus-Based Model For Priority Setting: An Example From Elderly Patients With Myocardial Infarction And Multi-Morbidity	2011	490	 10.1177/1403494811405092			339	39	4	345.0	Background: In most Western countries the growing gap between available resources and greater potential for medical treatment has brought evidence-based guidelines into focus. However, such guidelines are difficult to use when the evidence base is weak. Priority setting for frail elderly patients with heart disease illustrates this problem. We have outlined a tentative model for priority setting regarding frail elderly heart patients. The model takes cardiovascular risk, frailty, and comorbidity into account. Objective: Our aim is to validate the model’s components. We want to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of the study experts’ rankings regarding each of the model’s categories. Methods: A confidential questionnaire study consisting of 15 authentic and validated cases was conducted to assess the views of purposefully selected cardiology experts (n=58). They were asked to rank the cases regarding the need for coronary angiography using their individual clinical experience. The response rate was 71%. Responses were analysed with frequencies and descriptive statistics. The inter-rater reliability regarding the experts' rankings of the cases was estimated via an intra-class correlation test (ICC). Results: The cardiologists considered the clinical cases to be realistic. The intra-class correlation (two-way random, consistency, average measure) was 0.978 (95% CI 0.958–0.991), which denotes a very good inter-rater reliability on the group level. The model’s components were considered relevant regarding complex cases of non-STelevation myocardial infarction. Comorbidity was considered to be the most relevant component, frailty the second most relevant, followed by cardiovascular risk. Conclusions: A framework taking comorbidity, frailty, and cardiovascular risk into account could constitute a foundation for consensus-based guidelines for frail elderly heart patients. From a priority setting perspective, it is reasonable to believe that the framework is applicable to other groups of elderly patients with acute disease and complex needs .

455	Acute Care For The Elderly: A Literature Review	2010	492	 10.1089/pop.2009.0058			492	13	4	219.0	Traditionally, acute medical care has been insufficient to meet the complex care needs of frail older adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) units at improving hospitalization outcomes for adults older than 65 years of age. A review of the literature was performed, focusing on randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, reviews, and meta-analyses from 1990 to 2008. This review revealed ACE to be associated with positive global outcomes (eg, cost, length of stay, readmission rates, utilization, rehabilitation, cognition, function, patient/staff satisfaction). Furthermore, some studies may point to a decreased incidence of delirium and polypharmacy. Though larger studies with consistent operational definitions and replicative studies are needed, the literature presents compelling evidence that warrants further investigation of ACE as a valuable alternative paradigm of acute geriatric care.

The objective of this study was 1) to measure and compare the time needed to complete the Timed Up &amp; Go test (TUG), the time needed to imagine performing the same test (iTUG) and to calculate the time difference between both of these conditions (delta time) in a sample of young and older adults, and 2) to examine whether there was an association between the Timed Up &amp; Go test results (TUG, iTUG, delta time), age and cognitive decline. Methods: A total of 162 subjects (38 healthy young adults, mean age 25.7 ± 2.3 years, 73.7% women and 124 older inpatients, mean age 85.3 ± 6.5 years, 76.6% women) were included in this cross-sectional study. The mean ± SD of TUG, iTUG and delta time, age and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score were used as main outcomes. Results: Age was associated with an increase in time of TUG ( P &lt;0.001) and of delta time ( P =0.015), and with a decrease in time of iTUG ( P &lt;0.001), whereas cognitive decline was only associated with increase in delta time ( P =0.030). There was an increase in time of TUG ( P &lt;0.001) and in delta time ( P &lt;0.001) for subjects who used a walking aid. The increase in delta time depended on the MMSE score when the subjects did not use a walking aid ( P for trend=0.001). Conclusions: iTUG is clinically feasible among frail older adults and may quickly inform any clinician about higher-level changes in control of gait and balance in older adults.

457	Parkinson'S Disease In Older Adults: A New Scenario For This Old Actor?	2010	494	 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02832.x			144	58	5	982.0	Presents the case study of an 82-year-old man with insomnia and agitation in the night was admitted to the Geriatric Unit of the University Hospital of Parma. His medical history was characterized only by hypertension with cardiac hypertrophy. He was a past director of a bank and was cognitively normal. The clinical definition of frailty is rarely encompassed by a single altered system; multiple systems must be involved, and we propose that the model of Parkinsonian syndrome with its complexity of clinical manifestations could be considered as a prototype of this condition, providing new insight and new perspective to understand the complex biological pathways underlying the pathogenesis of frailty and physical disability in older persons.

458	Multi-Component Health Promotion And Disease Prevention For Community-Dwelling Frail Elderly Persons: A Systematic Review	2009	495	 10.1007/s10433-009-0132-x			452	6	4	315.0	The objective was to investigate definitions of frailty used in studies of multi-component health promotion and disease-preventive (HPDP) intervention programmes for community-dwelling frail elderly persons and to review the content, organization and effects of HPDP interventions. A systematic review of 19 articles was made, and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) was used as a structural framework for the analysis. The result shows that a consensus was reached on including various aspects of impairments in body functions and structures as an integral part of the frailty concept, with the exception of one subgroup: mental/cognitive functions. Additionally, opinions varied quite consistently regarding aspects of activity limitations and participation restrictions, personal and environmental factors. Ten of the 14 HPDP programmes covered various intervention elements referring to all four ICF components. Eleven programmes involved registered personnel only, while a more divergent pattern was seen in the remaining organizational aspects of the interventions: length of interventions and location plus age segments, participatory approach and contextual information, as well as the theoretical foundation of the interventions. Measures of body functions and structures were significantly improved in 5 out of 17 (29%) targeted aspects. For activity and participation, 12 out of 32 (38%) targeted aspects were positively changed, while the score for environmental factors was 7 out of 22 (32%), and for personal factors 8 out of 22 (36%). Our review suggests that further research is needed to explore and disentangle the complex interrelationships between various interventions and outcomes.

459	Comment: Comparison Of Two Tools Developed To Assess The Needs Of Older People With Complex Care Needs	2009	497	 10.1177/1744987108096973			497	14	5	437.0	"Comments on the article ""Comparison of two tools developed to assess the needs of older people with complex care needs"" by Susan Lambert, Wai-Yee Cheung, Shan Davies, Lyn Gardner, and Valerie Thomas (see record 2009-12617-006). This well-reported study has been carried out methodically and generated some interesting findings about the comparison of two internationally used assessment instruments (MDS-RAI and EASY-Care). The authors suggest that ‘The use of tools should enable older people to discuss their needs with practitioners so that staff caring for them have holistic assessment of the older person’s situation’. Notwithstanding, the finding that both tools were reasonable indicators of activities of daily living (ADL) is encouraging. It is good to know that tools attempting to measure the same thing have consistency. However, this raises other issues of whether consistency around ADLs really matters, when quality of life might be more important to the frail older person than ADLs. An issue of particular concern is the fact that neither of these tools was able to adequately measure cognitive performance and depression. The aim of the study was to test MDS-RAI and EASY-Care for use by nurses in three settings to establish whether they could be recommended as standardised instruments under Single Assessment Process (SAP)—without addressing some of the wider issues identified above, such a recommendation would be unwise. The authors are to be commended for concluding that the tools used needed further development for use under SAP and that neither tool could be recommended as a substitute for the other to undertake comprehensive assessments of older people. Their recommendation that MDS-RAI should consider strengthening the tool to facilitate person-centred assessment and that developers of both tools should consider further testing of the validity of measurement of depression and cognitive performance is most welcome.

460	Hypertensive Management In The Elderly Patient At Risk For Falls	2009	498	 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2009.00418.x			353	21	7	402.0	Purpose: Seventy percent of people over 65 years of age have hypertension, and one third of elders fall each year. These conditions frequently coexist, and each carries a risk for substantial functional decline or mortality. This article reviews the risks of and interventions to reduce falls in the elderly patient with hypertension. Data sources: A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature and consensus panel recommendations through January 2008 are discussed. Conclusions: Hypertension management in the frail elder at risk for fall must include a thoughtful assessment of the relative risks and benefits of treatments that are most likely to preserve function, independence, and quality of life. Stringent adherence to guidelines may not be appropriate for all patients. The periodic use of a standardized fall risk screening tool can assist the nurse practitioner (NP) to identify patients at risk for falls and adjust medication management accordingly. Implications for practice: This article will assist the NP to weigh management options in the context of the complex elderly patient.

461	Medication Problems In Older, Newly Diagnosed Cancer Patients In Canada: How Common Are They? A Prospective Pilot Study	2009	499	 10.2165/00002512-200926060-00008			471	26	6	519.0	Background: Prescribing for older patients is challenging and complex. Cancer patients are at a considerable increased risk of drug-related problems because they typically receive a large number of medications during their cancer treatment, both for the cancer itself and for supportive care. Few studies have examined the scope of this problem in older newly diagnosed cancer patients. Objective: To investigate the number and severity of potential drug problems and factors associated with the occurrence of potential drug problems in older newly diagnosed cancer patients. Methods: This prospective pilot study was conducted in newly diagnosed cancer patients aged ≥65 years recruited in the Segal Cancer Centre, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Vigilance Santé software was used to identify the presence and type of potential drug problems. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the presence of one or more severe or moderately severe potential drug problems. Results: There were 112 participants with a mean age of 74.2 years, and 70% were women. A total of 103 patients (92%) were taking medications. The median number of medications per patient was 5 (interquartile range 3–9) and a total of 247 potential drug problems were identified. Sixty-four patients (62.1%) had a potential drug problem of any level of severity and 49 patients had a potential moderate/severe drug problem identified (47.6%). Two (0.8%) potential drug problems of the most severe level were identified, 122 warnings (49.4%) of all potential problems were of moderate severity and 123 warnings (49.8%) were at the least severe level. Factors associated with having one or more moderate/severe potential drug problems were taking five or more drugs and age ≥76 years. Conclusion: The majority of older newly diagnosed cancer patients in this study were taking at least one medication and the median number of medications per patient was 5. Published studies have shown that medication problems are common in community-dwelling older persons, but they are mostly of low severity. In this group of older newly diagnosed cancer patients, potential medication problems were also found to be common; however, half of the potential problems identified were of moderate severity.

462	The Concept Of Frailty And Its Significance In The Consequences Of Care Or Neglect For Older People: An Analysis	2009	500	 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2009.00165.x			152	4	2	120.0	Older people, and particularly those of advanced age, become increasingly vulnerable to the consequences of abuse or neglect and, since the birth of specialist services for older people, researchers and clinicians have sought to understand the reasons for this. Multi-agency work across the UK is developing innovative strategies, protocols and tools to support investigation into situations of possible neglect in formal care settings. Emerging within this work has been a dilemma concerning which terminology should be used to most accurately describe care in specific situations, for example should care be described as ‘inadequate’ or ‘poor’, or as ‘neglect’. One key element in this decision is the consequence, or consequences, of the care for the vulnerable person, i.e. its impact on the individual. Because of the complex changes which accompany ageing, and particularly older age, this is not straightforward. Is a person’s health deteriorating as a consequence of ageing or disease? Are factors such as mental state or motivation impacting on their health? Is this the trajectory that their health would naturally follow? Or is the deterioration a direct consequence of the care that they have, or have not, been given? And, if so, to what degree? Identifying ways of addressing these questions could support the development of a lexicon of terms and definitions which could be used to accurately define specific categories of neglect in specific circumstances. This paper describes the practice based dilemmas that prompted this work. It briefly sets a historical context for contemporary understandings of the mechanisms that render older people particularly vulnerable to the effects of neglect. Some perspectives on defining neglect are offered. The paper then outlines the findings of a literature review and concepts analysis of the term frailty. It offers a new definition of frailty and explains the theoretical approach within which this nests. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of frailty as a consequence of care or neglect for older people.

463	A Geriatric Emergency Service For Acutely Ill Elderly Patients: Pattern Of Use And Comparison With A Conventional Emergency Department In Italy	2008	502	 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01991.x			144	56	11	2131.0	The current disease-oriented, episodic model of emergency care does not adequately address the complex needs of older adults presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Dedicated ED facilities with a specific organization (e.g., geriatric EDs (GEDs)) have been advocated. One of the few GED experiences in the world is described and its outcomes compared with those of a conventional ED (CED). In a secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort of 200 acutely ill elderly patients presenting to two urban EDs in Ancona, Italy, identifiers and triage, clinical, and social data were collected and the following outcomes considered: early (30-day) and late (6-month) ED revisit, frequent ED return, hospital admission, and functional decline. Death, functional decline, any ED revisit and any hospital admission were also considered as a composite outcome. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Overall, GED patients were older and frailer than CED patients. The two EDs did not differ in terms of early, late, or frequent ED return or in 6-month hospital admission or functional decline. The mortality rate was slightly but significantly lower in the GED patients (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.22–0.99, P = .047). The data suggest noninferiority and, indirectly, a slight superiority for the GED system in the acute care of elderly people, supporting the hypothesis that ED facilities specially designed for older adults may provide better care.

Developed from the findings of a two-year qualitative research project, the case represents a composite of selected data collected at five AL facilities that participated in the study. Students will participate in individual and small group exercises that challenge them to identify everyday ethical concerns in AL, and to suggest ways that management can address these issues. The case is suitable for cross-disciplinary use, and can be effectively applied in the fields of management, health care administration, sociology, gerontology, social work, and nursing, either on the graduate or undergraduate level. It is especially well suited to courses that incorporate the topics of long-term care, senior housing, or ethics.

465	Potentially Inappropriate Use Of Psychotropic Medications In Hospitalized Elderly Patients In France: Cross-Sectional Analysis Of The Prospective, Multicentre Safes Cohort	2008	504	 10.2165/0002512-200825110-00004			471	25	11	933.0	Background: In France, there is evidence to suggest that 50% of elderly individuals are prescribed psychotropic medications. However, it is known that use of these agents increases the risk of falls, fractures and delirium in older people. Objective: To study the consumption of 'potentially inappropriate medication' (PIM) among patients aged ≥75 years, paying particular attention to psychotropic drugs and the factors influencing the use of 'potentially inappropriate psychotropics' (PIPs). Method: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective multicentre cohort of 1,306 hospitalized French patients aged ≥75 years (the SAFEs [Sujet Âgé Fragile: Évaluation et suivi (Frail Elderly Subjects: Evaluation and follow-up)] cohort). The present analysis involved the 1,176 patients for whom there was information on the usual treatments being taken in the 2 weeks before hospitalization. The drugs were coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification; the Beers list as updated in 2003 defined which medications were considered PIPs. Standardized geriatric assessment variables were recorded on inclusion in the study. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors linked to use of psychotropics and PIPs. Results: The mean number of drugs taken was 5.7 ± 2.9 per patient. Twenty-eight percent of patients took at least one PIM. The number of patients who had taken at least one psychotropic drug in the 2 weeks before hospitalization (mean 1.6 ± 0.9 psychotropics per patient) was 589 (50.1%). More than half of both the 510 patients with a depressive syndrome and the 543 patients affected by dementia were treated with psychotropics. Multivariate analysis showed that prescription of psychotropics was linked to the presence of a dementia syndrome (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.9; p = 0.03), the presence of a depressive syndrome (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.3, 2.1; p &lt; 0.001), living in an institution (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.5, 3.4; p &lt; 0.001), use of more than five drugs (OR = 3.2; 95% CI 2.5,4.2; p &lt; 0.001) and Charlson's co-morbidity score &gt;1 (OR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.5, 0.8; p = 0.001). Nineteen percent of all psychotropics prescribed were PIPs. Of these PIPs, 66.5% were anxiolytics, 28.4% were antidepressants and 5.1% were antipsychotics. Use of PIPs in the multivariate analysis was associated only with consumption of more than five drugs (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.5; p = 0.01). Conclusion: PIM use is common among hospitalized older adults in France. The most important determinant of risk of receiving a psychotropic medication or a PIP was the number of drugs being taken. The elderly, who have multiple comorbidities, complex chronic conditions and are usually receiving polypharmacy, are at increased risk for adverse drug events. These adverse events are often linked to problems that could be preventable such as delirium, depression and falls. Regular review of prescriptions would help optimize prescription of psychotropics in the elderly. The Beers list is a good tool for evaluating PIMs but is too restrictive with respect to psychotropics; in the latter respect, the list could usefully be widened.

466	Psychological Implications Of Domestic Assistive Technology For The Elderly	2007	505				505	5	3	229.0	The ROBOCARE Domestic Environment (RDE) is the result of a three-year project aimed at developing cognitive support technology for elderly people. Specifically, the domestic environment is equipped with sensors, intelligent software components and devices which cooperate to provide cognitive support to the assisted person. The ROBOCARE interaction capabilities have been concentrated in a robotic mediator who acts as the main communication channel between the users and the intelligent domestic environment. This paper presents an evaluation of elderly people's perception of assistive robots and smart domotic environments. Results show how the acceptability of robotic devices in home setting does not depend only on the practical benefits they can provide, but also on complex relationships between the cognitive, affective and emotional components of people's images of robot. Specially, we analyzes a number of evaluation criteria related to the robot's aspect, the way in which it communicates with the user, and the perceived usefulness of its support services. Among these criteria, the paper proposes and reports an evaluation of how perceived frailty, with reference to both health in general and fear of cognitive weakening, more specifically, can influence the evaluation of a potential aid in everyday life, namely the robotic assistant. The paper also provides a discussion which can be useful for the design of future assistive agents and socially interactive robotic.

467	Pharmacological Management Of Cancer Pain In The Elderly	2007	506	 10.2165/00002512-200724090-00004			471	24	9	761.0	Existing studies indicate a high prevalence rate and poor management of cancer pain in the elderly. Pain is often considered an expected concomitant of aging, and older patients are considered more sensitive to opioids. Despite the well known pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly, the complex network of factors involved in the opioid response make the evaluation of a single element, such as age, more difficult. Notwithstanding such difficulties, appropriate analgesic treatment is able to control cancer pain in the elderly in most cases. Skills necessary to optimise pain control in older cancer patients include the ability to objectively assess functional age (not necessarily related to chronological age since the rate of decline is variable), understand the impact of coexisting conditions, carefully manage the numbers and types of drugs taken at the same time and adequately communicate with patients and relatives. The most common treatment of cancer pain consists of the use of regularly given oral analgesics. The elderly are at increased risk of developing toxicity from NSAIDs, and the overall safety of these drugs in frail elderly patients should be considered. When older patients have clear contraindications to NSAIDs, manifest signs of toxicity from these agents, or find that pain is no longer controlled with this class of drugs, opioids should be started. A variety of opioids are available, and they differ widely with respect to analgesic potency and adverse effects among the elderly. Although the aged population requires lower doses of opioids, only careful titration based on individual response can ensure the appropriate response to clinical demand. Elderly patients are potentially more likely to be affected by opioid toxicity because of the physiological changes associated with aging. Nevertheless, appropriate dosage and administration may limit these risks. Cancer patients with pain who do not respond to increasing doses of opioids because they develop adverse effects before achieving acceptable analgesia may be switched to alternative opioids. Despite the favourable effects reported with opioid switching, monitoring is crucial, particularly in the elderly or patients who are switched from high doses of opioids. Adjuvant analgesics, including antidepressants, antiepileptics, corticosteroids and bisphosphonates may help in the treatment of certain types of chronic pain. With an appropriate and careful approach, it should be possible to reduce or eliminate unrelieved cancer pain in most elderly patients and, consequently, to enhance their quality of life. Older patients with cancer should be continuously assessed for cancer pain, both before and after analgesic treatment.

This study examined factors in the lives of older individuals that influenced their ability and willingness to participate in a health-related community-capacity-building project to help their frailer, older neighbours. Using cross-sectional survey methodology, 107 volunteers who lived in a high density seniors' apartment complex known for its high health service utilization were compared with a random sample of 74 non-volunteers from the same community. Factors associated with volunteer involvement included age, activity level, functional ability, life satisfaction and certain personality characteristics.

469	A Framework For Understanding Old-Age Vulnerabilities	2006	508	 10.1017/S0144686X05004423			168	26	1	9.0	Identifying vulnerable older people and understanding the causes and consequences of their vulnerability is of human concern and an essential task of social policy. To date, vulnerability in old age has mainly been approached by identifying high risk groups, like the poor, childless, frail or isolated. Yet vulnerability is the outcome of complex interactions of discrete risks, namely of being exposed to a threat, of a threat materialising, and of lacking the defences or resources to deal with a threat. In this article, we review approaches to vulnerability in various disciplines in order to develop a systematic framework for approaching vulnerability. This framework distinguishes and examines the interactions among the domains of exposure, threats, coping capacities and outcomes. Drawing on European and Asian gerontological literature, we discuss what might be meant by these domains and their place in the understanding of vulnerability in old age. Two case studies are presented - one on homelessness in Britain, the other on familial care provision in Indonesia - to illustrate the ways in which specific vulnerabilities arc created and distributed over the lifecourse.

Common care dilemmas, including the interplay of social, medical, and psychiatric factors in treating complex patients, are perhaps best understood by examining such a case. The hypothetical case of ""Helen"" illustrates the multi-dimensional and often perplexing care needs of patients admitted multiple times for inpatient care. Linked nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions, and interdisciplinary care plans emphasize the changing care needs of such patients.

471	The Impact Of Medical Issues In Inpatient Geriatric Psychiatry	2005	511	 10.1080/01612840590883591			374	26	1	23.0	At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.

472	Clinical Global Impression Of Change In Physical Frailty: Development Of A Measure Based On Clinical Judgment	2004	512	 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52423.x			144	52	9	1560.0	Objectives: To expand the ability to assess physical frailty by developing a Clinical Global Impression of Change in Physical Frailty (CGIC-PF) instrument. Design: Qualitative and quantitative instrument development. Setting: Academic centers. Participants: Six expert panel members, 46 clinicians, 24 patients, and 12 caregivers. Measurements: Literature review and structured group processes with experts, clinicians, and consumers were used to generate an initial list of domains and indicators. Structured interviews with clinical experts in the area of frailty were used to establish relevance and feasibility of measurement of domains. Interrater reliability was assessed through a Web-based study. Geriatricians pilot tested the feasibility of the baseline CGIC-PF with 10 patients. Results: The CGIC-PF includes six intrinsic domains (mobility, balance, strength, endurance, nutrition, and neuromotor performance) and seven consequences domains (medical complexity, healthcare utilization, appearance, self-perceived health, activities of daily living, emotional status, and social status). Each domain has two to four clinical indicators. Change is scored on a 7-point scale from markedly worse to markedly improved. Average interrater reliability of the CGIC-PF for the Web-based cases was 0.97. Geriatricians completed a baseline CGIC-PF on their own patients in 10 minutes or less. Conclusion: The CGIC-PF is a structured assessment of change in physical frailty with defined content and process. It has strong face validity, reliability, and feasibility for use in clinical research. It may be useful as one criterion of change and as an anchor for change in other measures.

473	Canadian Study Of Health And Aging: Study Description And Patterns Of Early Cognitive Decline	2004	513	 10.1080/13825580490511044			416	11	2-3	149.0	The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) is a national longitudinal study of the epidemiology of dementia in Canada. The CSHA also described patterns of disability, frailty and healthy aging. The study involved 10,263 people aged 65 or over, sampled representatively from the community and from long-term care institutions, and participants were interviewed and assessed clinically in 1991, 1996 and 2001. Over 200 papers have been published from the study; a brief summary of results is given. The current analyses provide descriptive statistics on patterns and correlates of early cognitive decline in the study cohort. Several salient findings emerged: almost half of this representative sample showed no cognitive decline over a 10-year period. Education showed a strong protective effect against decline, but not after age 80. There was little difference in crude rates of cognitive decline between men and women, but after adjustment for disability and cardiovascular risk factors, men showed a greater risk of decline, up to age 80. Among those who experienced cognitive decline, the extent of decline was predicted mainly by age, rather than by baseline cognitive scores. Among those who developed dementia, baseline tests were better able to predict Alzheimer's disease than vascular dementia. Further analyses designed to elucidate these complex associations are described.

474	Caregiver Role Strain Of Older Workers	2004	514				514	22	2	99.0	The purpose of this study was to measure role strain in older adult workers who were also caregivers of frail elders according to Komarovsky's role strain theory, and to determine whether different patterns of role strain exist for male worker-caregivers than females. Researchers developed the Job-Caregiver Role Strain Scale Survey, which was adapted from a survey that measured role strain in working parents and spouses. Surveys were distributed to 11 male and 34 female older workers who were also caregivers. A factor analysis was completed, which isolated four factors of role strain. Researchers named the factors time management and arrangements, health and competing role demands, low rewards, and reactions to perceptions. Role strain in older adult worker-caregivers is complex and involves multiple variables. A discriminant function analysis predicted differences in the way older male and female worker-caregivers perceived role strain. Use of role strain theory can assist employers and occupational therapists in developing and maintaining work environments that support not only the older employee's work performance, but participation in the role of elder caregiver as well.

475	The Mds-Chess Scale: A New Measure To Predict Mortality In Institutionalized Older People	2003	515	 10.1034/j.1601-5215.2002.51017.x			144	51	1	96.0	OBJECTIVES: To develop a scale predicting mortality and other adverse outcomes associated with frailty. DESIGN: Observational study based on Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 and mortality data. SETTING: Ontario chronic hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All chronic hospital patients (N = 28,495) assessed with the MDS 2.0 after mandatory implementation in July 1996 followed until May 1999. MEASUREMENTS: MDS 2.0 assessments done as part of normal practice mainly by registered nurses or multidisciplinary teams in a chronic hospital. Mortality data are available from the accompanying discharge tracking form. RESULTS: The MDS-Changes in Health, End-stage disease and Symptoms and Signs (CHESS) score is a composite measure addressing changes in health, end-stage disease, and symptoms and signs of medical problems. It is a strong predictor of mortality (P &lt; .0001) independent of the effects of age, sex, activities of daily living impairment, cognition, and do-not-resuscitate orders. It is also strongly associated with physician activity, complex medical procedures, and pain (F &lt; .001 for each dependent variable). CONCLUSIONS: The CHESS score provides a useful new MDS-based test to predict mortality and to measure instability in health as a clinical outcome.

476	Extrapyramidal Symptoms And Antidepressant Drugs: Neuropharmacological Aspects Of A Frequent Interaction In The Elderly	2001	517	 10.1038/sj.mp.4000801			517	6	2	134.0	Depression is the most prevalent functional psychiatric disorder in late life. The problem of motor disorders associated with antidepressant use is relevant in the elderly. Elderly people are physically more frail and more likely to be suffering from physical illness, and any drug given may exacerbate pre-existing diseases, or interact with other drug treatments being administered for physical conditions. Antidepressants have been reported to induce extrapyramidal symptoms, including parkinsonism. These observations prompted us to review the neurobiological mechanism that may be involved in this complex interplay including neurotransmitters and neuronal circuits involved in movement and emotion control and their changes related to aging and disease. The study of the correlations between motor and mood disorders and their putative biochemical bases, as presented in this review, provide a rationale either to understand or to foresee motor side effects for psychotropic drugs, in particular antidepressants.

477	Recent Advances: Geriatric Medicine	2001	518	 10.1136/bmj.322.7278.86			518	322	7278	86.0	Reviewed the contents of ACP Journal Club and Evidence Based Medicine from 1998 to 2000 and, after discussion with colleagues, selected articles believed to be relevant to the care of geriatric patients. Topics addressed include: cardiovascular risk, heart failure, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, and falls. The author concludes that although we have evidence about the effectiveness of some interventions in elderly people, and many advances have been made in the care of elderly people, many gaps in our knowledge remain. We need to encourage research in elderly people and encourage our elderly patients to participate in this research. In particular, we need to encourage the inclusion of frail elderly people (those with complex medical and psychosocial problems) in studies assessing interventions, prognosis, and quality of life.

478	Constant Hierarchic Patterns Of Physical Functioing Across Seven Populations In Five Countries	1998	519	 10.1093/geront/38.3.286			138	38	3	286.0	This research was aimed at identifying critical steps in the decline in physical function that often parallels aging. Six basic and 9 instrumental activities of daily living were classified into 4 domains of disability characterized by specific underlying physical impairment. These domains included (1) ability to perform complex manual dexterity activities while in an unstable posture; (2) good balance on slippery or steep surfaces and the ability to walk long distances and overcome obstacles; (3) capacity to maintain static balance, mobility in the home environment, and good upper extremity control; and (4) ability in activities that can be performed using the upper extremities even in a seated position. The hierarchical order of this classification was verified in 2 random samples representative of the older home-dwelling population. The concordance level of disability and results of performance-based measures of physical function were also tested. Finally, the cross-cultural reliability of the model was verified in 7 population-based samples of older persons living in 5 European countries. In older persons the disabling process follows a general pattern of progression based on a typical sequence of impairments.

479	Integration Of Research Methods And Outcome Measures: Comprehensive Care For The Frail Elderly	1995	520	 10.1017/S0714980800005481			148	14	1, Suppl 1	151.0	Research measures can be integrated into routine care if they are useful to care providers by facilitating the processes of care, and if the outcomes which they measure reflect outcomes of importance to the patient. Many current measures suffer from being unwieldy for routine use, or not adequately measuring relevant outcomes. In the care of the frail elderly, who have complex needs, these challenges are particularly difficult. The techniques of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) are proposed as means of embracing the complexity of the needs of the frail elderly, and measuring the effectiveness of specialized interventions. GAS appears to meet the current definition of a Health-Related Quality of Life measure, suggesting that its routine use provides advantages both as a management process and as an outcome measure.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular and mixed dementias afflicted 63% of the Ss and were associated with excess consumption of nursing resources, complications of treatment, nosocomial infections, lengthy hospitalizations, and financial losses to the hospital. Demented Ss suffered more frequently from life-threatening infections, sepsis, iatrogenic disease, and prolonged hospital stays. Hospital losses were 75% higher for demented Ss than for nondemented Ss. Although dementia affected most of the Ss, it was rarely coded as an admitting diagnosis, even though it may have been the proximate cause of the medical morbidity that led to the acute hospitalization. Results indicate that dementia was not considered an acute diagnosis, nor was it recognized as a complex medical illness.

483	Implementation Fidelity Of The Systems For Person-Centered Elder Care (Spec): A Process Evaluation Study	2021	524	10.1186/s13012-021-01113-3	33980251	WOS:000649716100001	524	16	1	nan	Background: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex intervention, was conducted to examine its effectiveness as a technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for frail older persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where formal long-term care has recently been introduced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation fidelity of the SPEC intervention and to identify moderating factors that influence the implementation fidelity. Methods: This study was a process evaluation based on an evidence-based framework for implementation fidelity using a mixed-methods design. Quantitative data from consultant logbooks, NH documentations, an information and communications technology (ICT) system, and a standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to December 2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics. Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary teams from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a semi-structured questionnaire and the focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Results: The SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and adherence to the SPEC program was strong in all aspects, such as content, coverage, frequency, and duration. Of the participating on-site coordinators, 60% reported that the SPEC model positively impacted needs assessment and the reporting system for resident care. The important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies, assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good implementation fidelity. The key factors of good implementation fidelity were tailored delivery of evidence-based interventions over process evaluation work, facilitating strategies, and ICT support. Larger implementation studies with a more user-friendly ICT system are recommended.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	524	Implementation Science		524	choi,hyoungshim	choi	hyoungshim
484	A New Approach To The Identification Of Palliative Care Needs And Advanced Chronic Patients Among Nursing Home Residents	2021	526	10.3390/ijerph18063171	33808567	WOS:000639190800001	526	18	6	nan	Background: Proper planning of Palliative Care in nursing homes requires advanced knowledge of the care needs that residents show. The aim of the study was to evaluate Palliative Needs and other conditions such as fragility, complexity, and prognosis and also to suggest new indicators for the establishment of the resident's advanced chronic condition. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 149 nursing homes Complex Chronic residents evaluated by trained professionals. Palliative Care Needs, assessed by the NECPAL ICO-CCOMS (c) tool, and fragility, case and palliative complexity and prognosis were evaluate through a comprehensive assessment. Descriptive analyses and association measures were performed setting the statistical significance at 0.05. Results: More than 50% of the residents had positive Surprise Question and other Palliative Needs and were classified as Advanced Chronic Patients. Distress and/or Severe Adaptative Disorder was the most frequent need shown by the residents and significant differences in levels of frailty and other characteristics, were found between the Positive and the Negative Surprise Question Groups. Statistically significant correlations were also found between aspects of both groups. Conclusions: Nursing homes residents show Palliative Needs regardless of the response to the Surprise Question of the NECPAL tool. Other characteristics such as presence of an intermediate level of frailty are suggested as a new perspective to identify advanced chronic patients among nursing homes residents.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	526	International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health		526	esteban-burgos,ana a	esteban-burgos	ana a
485	Identifying Research Priorities In Adult Day Centers To Support Evidence-Based Care Of Vulnerable Older Adults	2021	527		33775968	WOS:000631910300013	527	15	1	127	Adult day centers (ADCs) are essential community resources that allow frail older adults to remain in their communities. Research demonstrates that ADC staff have the capacity to leverage their culturally and socially congruent relationships with clients and caregivers, to deliver evidence-based interventions that improve health outcomes. Yet, they remain a largely overlooked neighborhood resource for older adults with complex health care needs. The National Adult Day Services Association (NADSA) created a multistakeholder work group to identify priority areas for research to enhance the quality of services offered in ADCs and the delivery of evidence-based practices to clients. This perspective piece, which presents the workgroup's findings in the form of key research priorities, is intended as practical guide for researchers seeking to align their research questions with the needs of ADCs and those they serve. In addition to identifying areas of further exploration, we discuss current studies being undertaken within the ADC setting.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	527	Progress In Community Health Partnerships-Research Education And Action		527	sadarangani,tina	sadarangani	tina
486	Metaphors In The Making: Illuminating The Process Of Arts-Based Health Research Through A Case Exemplar Linking Arts-Based, Qualitative And Quantitative Research Data	2021	528	10.1177/1609406920987954		WOS:000625084800001	528	20		nan	Background: The potentials of arts-based health research are increasingly being realized as an approach to understanding and communicating the complexities of the human experience of health and illness. Despite this, arts-based health research often remains shrouded in obscurity, limiting its potential utility. Arts-based health research offers unique opportunities to integrate evidence of patients' lived experience with other forms of research evidence to improve understanding and knowledge translation, but transparent descriptions of this praxis are generally lacking. In response, this article offers methodological insight and guidance through an in-depth case exemplar of an arts-based health research process linking qualitative research with diverse evidence sources in the context of frailty research. Methods: Responding to research data generated within a Centre of Research Excellence in Frailty and Healthy Ageing, we adopted a researcher-as-practitioner stance to produce research-based artworks to integrate and communicate conflicting research findings. We structure this process according to Ecker's seven domains of qualitative inquiry, demonstrating parallels between the arts-based research and qualitative inquiry processes and offering opportunities for engaging with evidence misalignments resulting from incongruent evidence sources. Findings: Arts-based health research can enable meaningful reflection upon, integration, and communication of evidence-misalignments in research spanning the health and social sciences. Such misalignments are problematic when the lived experience of health and illness conflicts with other empirical evidence, including gold standard evidence guiding treatment decisions. These in turn, can function as plausible barriers to self management and to achievement of health outcomes. Interpretation: Through the researcher-as-practitioner lens, and with an orientation to production, this work engaged with a new means of materiality-one that extends beyond text and numerical representations-and whose meaning and connections may not be immediately apparent. These relationships change how the researchers-practitioner engages with, understands, explores, and represents concepts, enabling epistemological and ontological gains of benefit to the health and social sciences.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	528	International Journal Of Qualitative Methods	1	528	archibald,mandy	archibald	mandy
487	The Cardiac Care Bridge Randomized Trial In High-Risk Older Cardiac Patients: A Mixed-Methods Process Evaluation	2021	529	10.1111/jan.14786	33594695	WOS:000618632800001	52	77	5	2498	Aim To evaluate healthcare professionals' performance and treatment fidelity in the Cardiac Care Bridge (CCB) nurse-coordinated transitional care intervention in older cardiac patients to understand and interpret the study results. Design A mixed-methods process evaluation based on the Medical Research Council Process Evaluation framework. Methods Quantitative data on intervention key elements were collected from 153 logbooks of all intervention patients. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 CCB professionals (cardiac nurses, community nurses and primary care physical therapists), from June 2017 until October 2018. Qualitative data-analysis is based on thematic analysis and integrated with quantitative key element outcomes. The analysis was blinded to trial outcomes. Fidelity was defined as the level of intervention adherence. Results The overall intervention fidelity was 67%, ranging from severely low fidelity in the consultation of in-hospital geriatric teams (17%) to maximum fidelity in the comprehensive geriatric assessment (100%). Main themes of influence in the intervention performance that emerged from the interviews are interdisciplinary collaboration, organizational preconditions, confidence in the programme, time management and patient characteristics. In addition to practical issues, the patient's frailty status and limited motivation were barriers to the intervention. Conclusion Although involved healthcare professionals expressed their confidence in the intervention, the fidelity rate was suboptimal. This could have influenced the non-significant effect of the CCB intervention on the primary composite outcome of readmission and mortality 6 months after randomization. Feasibility of intervention key elements should be reconsidered in relation to experienced barriers and the population. Impact In addition to insight in effectiveness, insight in intervention fidelity and performance is necessary to understand the mechanism of impact. This study demonstrates that the suboptimal fidelity was subject to a complex interplay of organizational, professionals' and patients' issues. The results support intervention redesign and inform future development of transitional care interventions in older cardiac patients.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	529	verweij,lotte	verweij	lotte
488	Deviations In Hippocampal Subregion In Older Adults With Cognitive Frailty	2021	532	10.3389/fnagi.2020.615852	33519422	WOS:000612000200001	532	12		nan	Background Cognitive frailty is a particular state of cognitive vulnerability toward dementia with neuropathological hallmarks. The hippocampus is a complex, heterogeneous structure closely relates to the cognitive impairment in elderly which is composed of 12 subregions. Atrophy of these subregions has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the changes in hippocampal subregions in older adults with cognitive frailty and the relationship between subregions and cognitive impairment as well as physical frailty. Methods Twenty-six older adults with cognitive frailty and 26 matched healthy controls were included in this study. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (Fuzhou version) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Chinese version (WMS-RC), while physical frailty was tested with the Chinese version of the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS) and grip strength. The volume of the hippocampal subregions was measured with structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Partial correlation analysis was carried out between the volumes of hippocampal subregions and MoCA scores, Wechsler's Memory Quotient and physical frailty indexes. Results A significant volume decrease was found in six hippocampal subregions, including the bilateral presubiculum, the left parasubiculum, molecular layer of the hippocampus proper (molecular layer of the HP), and hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA), and the right cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) area, in older adults with cognitive frailty, while the proportion of brain parenchyma and total number of white matter fibers were lower than those in the healthy controls. Positive correlations were found between Wechsler's Memory Quotient and the size of the left molecular layer of the HP and HATA and the right presubiculum. The sizes of the left presubiculum, molecular of the layer HP, and HATA and right CA1 and presubiculum were found to be positively correlated with MoCA score. The sizes of the left parasubiculum, molecular layer of the HP and HATA were found to be negatively correlated with the physical frailty index. Conclusion Significant volume decrease occurs in hippocampal subregions of older adults with cognitive frailty, and these changes are correlated with cognitive impairment and physical frailty. Therefore, the atrophy of hippocampal subregions could participate in the pathological progression of cognitive frailty.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	532	Frontiers In Aging Neuroscience		532	wan,mingyue	wan	mingyue
489	Association Between Dysphagia And Inpatient Outcomes Across Frailty Level Among Patients >= 50 Years Of Age	2020	540	10.1007/s00455-019-10084-z	31811381	WOS:000573262900006	540	35	5	787	Frail patients may have heightened risk of dysphagia, a potentially modifiable health factor. Our aim is to examine whether the relationship between dysphagia and adverse health outcomes differs by frailty conditions among inpatients >= 50 years of age. Medical or surgical hospitalizations among patients >= 50 years of age in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample from 2014 through the first three quarters of 2015 were included. Adverse outcomes included length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, in-hospital mortality, discharge status, and medical complications. Dysphagia was determined by ICD-9-CM codes. Frailty was defined as (a) >= 1 condition in the10-item Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) frailty measure and a frailty index for the (b) ACG and (c) a 19-item Frailty Risk Score (FRS) categorized as non-frail, pre-frail, and frail. Weighted generalized linear models for complex survey designs using generalized estimating equations were performed. Of 6,230,114 unweighted hospitalizations, 4.0% had a dysphagia diagnosis. Dysphagia presented in 3.1% and 11.0% of non-frail and frail hospitalizations using the binary ACG (p < 0.001) and in 2.9%, 7.9%, and 16.0% of non-frail, pre-frail, and frail hospitalizations using the indexed FRS (p < 0.001). Dysphagia was associated with greater LOS, higher total costs, increased non-routine discharges, and more medical complications among both frail and non-frail patients using the three frailty definitions. Dysphagia was associated with adverse outcomes in both frail and non-frail medical or surgical hospitalizations. Dysphagia management is an important consideration for providers seeking to reduce risk in vulnerable populations.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	540	Dysphagia		540	cohen,seth m	cohen	seth m
490	The Current State Of Hiv And Aging: Findings Presented At The 10Th International Workshop On Hiv And Aging	2020	541	10.1089/aid.2020.0128	32847368	WOS:000574523500001	541	36	12	973	With increasing effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, people with HIV (PWH) are living longer and the prevalence of older PWH continues to increase. Accordingly, PWH are experiencing an increased burden of age-related comorbidities. With this shifting demographics, clinicians and researchers face additional challenges in how to identify, address, and manage the complex intersections of HIV- and aging-related conditions. Established in 2009, the International Workshop on HIV and Aging brings together clinicians and researchers in cross-disciplinary fields along with community advocates and PWH to address the multidisciplinary nature of HIV and aging. This article summarizes plenary talks from the 10th Annual International Workshop on HIV and Aging, which took place in New York City on October 10 and 11, 2019. Presentation topics included the following: the burdens of HIV-associated comorbidities, aging phenotypes, community engagement, and loneliness; these issues are especially important for older PWH, considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss broad questions and potential directions for future research necessary to better understand the interaction between HIV and aging.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	541	Aids Research And Human Retroviruses		541	shiau,stephanie	shiau	stephanie
491	Quality Of Life And Dependence Degree Of Chronic Patients In A Chronicity Care Model	2020	543	10.3390/healthcare8030293	32846995	WOS:000582171100001	543	8	3	nan	Background: The complex chronic patient is a person with one or several long-term diseases, the clinical management of which are considered difficult and related to cognitive or functional impairment. The chronicity care model deeply affects the quality of life and degree of dependence. Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyse the perceived quality of life and dependence degree in complex chronic patients within a chronicity care model in the Autonomous Communities of Cantabria and the Balearic Islands (Spain). Design: This was a multicentred, transversal, descriptive, and observational study on a cohort of 206 chronic patients included in a chronicity care program. Methods: Patients' sociodemographic variables, integral valuation, nurse follow-up records, nursing outcomes classification (NOC)/nursing interventions classification (NIC), nurse diagnoses, and hospitalization data were analysed. A descriptive analysis of all data was carried out. The bivariate analysis assessed the relation between covariables and the overall scoring in European Quality of Life Scale (EuroQuol-5D), Barthel, Braden, and Chronic Patient eXperience Assessment Instrument (IEXPAC in the Spanish abbreviation). A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted. Results: The mean age was 79.4 years (standard deviation (SD) = 9.12; range: 39-94). A percentage of 79.3% of the study population shows functional impairment in one or more activities of daily life. A percentage of 83.3% of patients showed a physical dependence. There is a significant relationship between the gender and kinship degree of the caregiver (chi(2) = 18.2; p = 0.001). An overall mean score of 55.38 points in EuroQuol-5D was obtained, along with a 36.87-point satisfaction with the care given in IEXPAC. The overall score correlated positively and significantly with Barthel, Braden, and IEXPAC. The dependence levels improved slightly in the observed patients, which was a very significant outcome in statistical terms (t = 2.08; p = 0.039). A percentage of 66% (R-2 = 0.66) of the score variability at the Barthel index could be predicted from Braden scale scoring. Conclusions: Dependence is not only affected by the related pathology, but also by the effect on mobility and daily-life activities, which cause a worse perception of the quality of life. The health-care model based on the case management nurse is having positive effects, especially on dependence and patients with ulcer issues.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	543	Healthcare		543	molina-mula,jesus	molina-mula	jesus
492	Admiral Nursing-A Model Of Specialist Dementia Care In Acute Hospitals	2020	546	10.1177/2377960820952677	33415301	WOS:000567938000001	546	6		nan	Introduction: The rising prevalence of dementia has led to increased numbers of people with dementia being admitted to acute hospitals. This demand is set to continue due to an increasingly older population who are likely to have higher levels of dependency, dementia, and comorbidity. If admitted to the hospital, people with dementia are at higher risk of poor outcomes during and following a hospital admission. Yet, there remains a significant lack of specialist support within acute hospitals to support people with dementia, their families and hospital staff. Methods: Admiral Nurses are specialists that work with families affected by dementia and provide consultancy and support to health and social care colleagues to improve the delivery of evidenced based dementia care. Historically, Admiral Nurses have predominantly been based in community settings. In response to the increasing fragmentation of services across the dementia trajectory, the Admiral Nurse model is evolving and adapting to meet the complex needs of families impacted upon by dementia inclusive of acute hospital care. Results: The Admiral Nurse acute hospital model provides specialist interventions which improve staff confidence and competence and enables positive change by improving skills and knowledge in the provision of person-centred dementia care. The role has the capacity to address some of the barriers to delivering person centred dementia care in the acute hospital and contribute to improvements across the hospital both as a result of direct interventions or influencing the practice of others. Conclusion: Improving services for people with dementia and their families requires a whole system approach to enable care coordination and service integration, this must include acute hospital care. The increasing numbers of people with dementia in hospitals, and the detrimental effects of admission, make providing equitable, consistent, safe, quality care and support to people with dementia and their families a national priority requiring immediate investment. The inclusion of Admiral Nursing within acute hospital services supports service and quality improvement which positively impacts upon the experience and outcomes for families affected by dementia.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	546	Sage Open Nursing	1	546	aldridge,zena	aldridge	zena
493	Clinical Evaluation With Long-Term Follow-Up Of Patients With Pressure Ulcers In One Swedish County	2020	547	10.12968/jowc.2020.29.8.472	32804034	WOS:000562967200009	547	29	8	472	Objective: To conduct a screening, skin examination and risk assessment of patients with pressure ulcers (PUs) in one Swedish county (inpatient, primary and community care) with follow-up after six months to investigate ulcer healing, frequency of amputation and mortality rate linked to preventive measures. Method: The methodology recommended by the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel was used. Screening, risk assessment and skin examination were performed during March 2017. The modified Norton scale was used to assess PU risk, with a score of <= 20 indicating presence of risk. A research questionnaire was used to document prevention and treatment. Follow-up was performed after six months, during September 2017. The same research questionnaire was used to capture the current situation of the patients, including ulcer healing, frequency of amputation, and mortality rate. Results: Screening covered 464 patients: 303 hospitalised, 68 in community care, and 93 in primary care. A total of 110 patients-55 at risk of PU and 55 with PUs, the majority of which were category 2-4 PUs-were included in the study. At follow-up, 67% were treated in community care, 32% in primary care, and 1% in hospital. Mortality rate for patients with PUs was 44%. Of the remaining 31 patients, 17 had unhealed PUs, 10 had healed PUs, two had undergone amputation, and complete follow-up data was missing in the remaining two patients. Conclusion: These results reflect the complex situation of an aged and frail patient group, including a lack of preventive measures and follow-up routines in community and primary care.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	547	Journal Of Wound Care	1	547	oien,rut frank	oien	rut frank
494	Challenges In Measuring Integrated Care Models: International Knowledge And The Case Of Quebec	2020	548	10.1177/2053434520945087		WOS:000558584500001	548	23	2-3	75	Introduction: The implementation of integrated care models requires significant efforts, especially due to institutional and organisational inertial forces that characterize health and social care systems of developed countries. It is therefore crucial to deploy strategies that promote continuous adjustment to these barriers so as to improve the benefits of integrating care. Measuring the implementation and effects of integrated care models are key component of these strategies. However, measuring integrated care also faces major challenges. This study aims to identify and characterise integrated care measurement challenges. Methods: A review of reviews on the measurement of integrated care identified 12 papers. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify and categorize measurement challenges. Document analysis was done on the measurement of an integrated care model for older adults in Quebec. Results: Eight categories of measurement challenges were identified. These challenges include difficulties in measuring structures, processes, and effects of models; conceptual ambiguity and heterogeneity of organisational forms; involving multiple actors in the measurement strategy; and including multiple data sources, amongst others. These challenges revealed and explained potential gaps in the measurement of integrated care for older adults in Quebec. For instance, the Quebec measurement strategy did not include effects indicators. Conclusion: Although the measurement of integrated care is a complex endeavour, there is a need for adequate measurement strategies that allow to appreciate important elements of integrate care. The findings of this study could be used as a reflexive tool in advancing research and practice of measuring integrated care.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	548	International Journal Of Care Coordination		548	wankah,paul	wankah	paul
495	Caring Responsibility From The Perspectives Of Older Persons Whose Adult Children Are Their Caregivers	2020	549	10.1111/opn.12335	32716593	WOS:000552464400001	33	15	4	nan	Aim: To describe lifeworld insights into the phenomenon of caring responsibility from the perspectives of persons aged 80+ years living alone with chronic illness, physical frailty and dependency on adult children. Design: A phenomenological inquiry inspired by Reflective Lifeworld Research. Method: Semi-structured lifeworld interviews with 11 persons aged 80+ years were conducted following their discharge. The interviews lasted 35-83 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Both interviews and the analysis followed the epistemological and methodological principles of Reflective Lifeworld Research. Findings: We identified the essential meaning 'It means everything' and four constituents illuminating different aspects inherent in the complex phenomenon of caring responsibility; 'A life-constraining transition,' 'Trusting the children to fill the gaps and be the glue,' 'Tacit responsibility, agreement and acceptance' and 'Depending on the children and knowing they are burdened by you.' Conclusions: Caring responsibility is based on a trusting relationship and tacit agreements indicating an understanding of interdependence and acceptance of dependence on adult children. However, a paradox appears when older persons express a deep-rooted perception of autonomy and independence as they have difficulties with their growing dependency and feelings of being burdensome. Older persons try to balance the continuum of autonomy, their existential self-image and actual capability. The practical part of caring responsibility seems to dominate and strongly affect the parent-child relationship because the child needs to take care of practical issues related to healthcare management and instrumental activities of daily living, leaving less time for meaningful togetherness. Implications for practice: Older persons want their adult children to be involved and acknowledged when planning care and treatment because they often seem to serve as the 'glue' that makes it possible for the parent to remain in his/her own home.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	549	andersen,helle elisabeth	andersen	helle elisabeth
496	Nursing Competence In Municipal In-Patient Acute Care In Norway: A Cross-Sectional Study	2020	550	10.1186/s12912-020-00463-5		WOS:000555091300001	550	19	1	nan	Background The primary health care services are becoming increasingly complex, which presents challenges for the municipal nursing services. In Norway, municipal in-patient acute care (MipAC) has been introduced in all municipalities, and the competence at the services has been questioned. Few studies have examined the nursing services in the units. This study aims to get an overview of the nursing competence in those units across geographical regions, and different groups of organisation and localisation. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted, and an ad hoc questionnaire was distributed to first-line leaders in all the MipAC units in Norway. Data were collected in the period between 6 March 2019 to 6 June 2019. Measures to get an overview of the nursing competence were ratio of registered nurses (RNs) in staff, count of shifts with only one RN on duty and count of RNs with master's degrees/specialisation. Descriptive comparative statistics were used. Results Of all 226 first-line leaders invited to participate, 207 (91.6%) responded to the questionnaire. Overall a considerable variance across the sample was revealed. The median ratio of RNs in staff was 56 (IQR = 40-70), the count of shifts with only one RN on duty median 28 (IQR = 5-49), and the count of RNs with a master's degree or specialisation median 3 (IQR = 0-5). The regions of Northern and Central Norway, MipACs located in nursing home and MipACs organised at long-term care units, showed significantly lower nursing competence in staff compared to the remaining institution and organisations. Conclusion This study generates knowledge that can inform planning, priorities and interventions that may be initiated at all organisational and political levels concerning the MipAC services. An overall conclusion is that advanced nursing competence is lacking. The study also highlights the most urgent direction for improvements regarding nursing competence in the services. It seemed to be MipACs in Northern and Central Norway, and those located at nursing homes organised together with long-term care units, that needed improvements the most.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	550	Bmc Nursing	1	550	vatnoy,torunn kitty	vatnoy	torunn kitty
497	Improving Oral Health In Nursing Home Residents: A Process Evaluation Of A Shared Oral Care Intervention	2020	553	10.1111/jocn.15373	32533875	WOS:000542562300001	34	29	17-18	3392	Aims and objectives To evaluate the process of implementing an oral care intervention in nursing homes in a Danish municipality. Background Older people with aged natural dentition require preventive and curative oral health care. An intervention based on principles of situated learning was implemented to establish closer cooperation between dental and nursing staff in nursing homes, leading to improved oral hygiene in nursing home residents. Design An embedded multiple-case study combined with principles of realist evaluation unfolded in three phases: Formulation of initial programme theory, Testing and Refining the programme theory. The COREQ checklist is followed in reporting. Methods Observations, six group interviews and 22 face-to-face interviews with dentists, dental practitioners, nursing home managers, care professionals and residents were conducted in three nursing homes (n = 41). Results Three main outcomes of a programme theory were identified, relating to (a) residents, in the form of new oral care routines; (b) interdisciplinary working, in the form of professional pride in performing sufficient oral care; (c) organisational level changes, in the form of increased interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. The overarching supportive mechanisms were the creation of relationships between residents, dental practitioners and care professionals as well as nursing home management taking responsibility for structure, planning and knowledge sharing. Conclusion The situated learning perspective supported residents and care professionals' competencies in performing sufficient oral care. The shared oral care intervention supports an individual and multidisciplinary assessment of nursing home residents' ability to self-care concerning oral care. Contextual factors, supportive and restraining mechanisms influence the intervention's success. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the complexity within interdisciplinary cooperation in primary nursing and unravelling the necessary properties to enhance nursing home residents' oral health care are areas of improvement for care service in nursing homes.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	553	aagaard,karin	aagaard	karin
498	Transitional Palliative Care Interventions For Older Adults With Advanced Non-Malignant Diseases And Frailty: A Systematic Review	2020	196	10.1108/JICA-02-2020-0012		WOS:000547007000001	554	28	4	387	Purpose To identify transitional palliative care (TPC) interventions for older adults with non-malignant chronic diseases and complex conditions. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the literature was conducted. CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase and Pubmed databases were searched for studies reporting TPC interventions for older adults, published between 2002 and 2019. The Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool was used for quality appraisal. Findings A total of six studies were included. Outcomes related to TPC interventions were grouped into three categories: healthcare system-related outcomes (rehospitalisation, length of stay [LOS] and emergency department [ED] visits), patient-related outcomes and family/carer important outcomes. Overall, TPC interventions were associated with lower readmission rates and LOS, improved quality of life and better decision-making concerning hospice care among families. Outcomes for ED visits were unclear. Research limitations/implications Positive outcomes related to healthcare services (including readmissions and LOS), patients (quality of life) and families (decision-making) were reported. However, the number of studies supporting the evidence were limited. Originality/value Studies examining the effectiveness of existing care models to support transitions for those in need of palliative care are limited. This systematic literature review identified and appraised interventions aimed at improving transitions to palliative care in older adults with advanced non-malignant diseases or frailty.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	554	Journal Of Integrated Care		196	sezgin,duygu	sezgin	duygu
499	Population Segments As A Tool For Health Care Performance Reporting: An Exploratory Study In The Canadian Province Of British Columbia	2020	557	10.1186/s12875-020-01141-w	32475339	WOS:000538019000002	557	21	1	nan	Background Primary care serves all age groups and individuals with health states ranging from those with no chronic conditions to those who are medically complex, or frail and approaching the end of life. For information to be actionable and guide planning, there must be some population disaggregation based on differences in expected needs for care. Promising approaches to segmentation in primary care reflect both the breadth and severity of health states, the types and amounts of health care utilization that are expected, and the roles of the primary care provider. The purpose of this study was to assess population segmentation as a tool to create distinct patient groups for use in primary care performance reporting. Methods This cross-sectional study used administrative data (patient characteristics, physician and hospital billings, prescription medicines data, emergency department visits) to classify the population of British Columbia (BC), Canada into one of four population segments: low need, multiple morbidities, medically complex, and frail. Each segment was further classified using socioeconomic status (SES) as a proxy for patient vulnerability. Regression analyses were used to examine predictors of health care use, costs and selected measures of primary care attributes (access, continuity, coordination) by segment. Results Average annual health care costs increased from the low need ($ 1460) to frail segment ($10,798). Differences in primary care cost by segment only emerged when attributes of primary care were included in regression models: accessing primary care outside business hours and discontinuous primary care (>= 5 different GP's in a given year) were associated with higher health care costs across all segments and higher continuity of care was associated with lower costs in the frail segment (cost ratio = 0.61). Additionally, low SES was associated with higher costs across all segments, but the difference was largest in the medically complex group (cost ratio = 1.11). Conclusions Population segments based on expected need for care can support primary care measurement and reporting by identifying nuances which may be lost when all patients are grouped together. Our findings demonstrate that variables such as SES and use of regression analyses can further enhance the usefulness of segments for performance measurement and reporting.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	557	Bmc Family Practice		557	langton,julia m	langton	julia m
500	Blood Pressure Control And Complex Health Conditions In Older Adults: Impact Of Recent Hypertension Management Guidelines	2021	558	10.1038/s41371-020-0334-4	32346124	WOS:000529474800001	558	35	3	280	The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017 guidelines for hypertension management lowered blood pressure (BP) thresholds to 130/80 mmHg to define hypertension while the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) 2018 guidelines retained 140/90 mmHg. Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65+ aged between 67 and 80 years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how to manage hypertension.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	558	Journal Of Human Hypertension		558	anker,daniela	anker	daniela
501	Engaging Older Adults In Self-Management Talk In Healthcare Encounters: A Systematic Review Protocol	2020	563	10.1186/s13643-020-1276-1	31948463	WOS:000521252000002	563	9	1	nan	Background Clinical practice guidelines for the management of complex chronic conditions in older adults encourage healthcare providers to engage patients in shared decision-making about self-management goals and actions. Yet, healthcare decision-making and communication for this population can pose significant challenges. As a result, healthcare professionals may struggle to help patients define and prioritise their values, goals, and preferences in ways that are clinically and personally meaningful, incorporating physical functioning and quality of life, when faced with numerous diagnostic and treatment alternatives. The aim of this systematic review is to locate and synthesise a body of fine-grained observational research on communication between professionals, older adults, and carers regarding self-management in audio/audio-visually recorded naturalistic interactions. Methods/design The paper describes a systematic review of the published conversation analytic and discourse analytic research, using an aggregative thematic approach and following the PRISMA-P guidelines. This review will include studies reporting on adult patients (female or male) aged >= 60 years whose consultations are conducted in English in any healthcare setting and stakeholders involved in their care, e.g. general practitioners, nurses, allied health professionals, and family carers. We will search nine electronic databases and the grey literature and two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts to identify potential studies. Discrepancies will be resolved via consultation with the review team. The methodological quality of the final set of included studies will be appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research and a detailed description of the characteristics of the included studies using a customised template. Discussion This is the first systematic review to date to locate and synthesise the conversation analytic research on how healthcare professionals raise and pursue talk about self-management with older adults in routine clinical interactions. Amalgamating these findings will enable the identification of effective and potentially trainable communication practices for engaging older adults in healthcare decision-making about the self-management goals and actions that enable the greatest possible health and quality of life in older adulthood.

502	Older Adults In The Cardiac Intensive Care Unit: Factoring Geriatric Syndromes In The Management, Prognosis, And Process Of Care: A Scientific Statement From The American Heart Association	2020	564	10.1161/CIR.0000000000000741	31813278	WOS:000509545800003	564	141	2	E6	Longevity is increasing, and more adults are living to the stage of life when age-related biological factors determine a higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease in a distinctive context of concurrent geriatric conditions. Older adults with cardiovascular disease are frequently admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), where care is commensurate with high age-related cardiovascular disease risks but where the associated geriatric conditions (including multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and delirium, and frailty) may be inadvertently exacerbated and destabilized. The CICU environment of procedures, new medications, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, prolonged bed rest, malnourishment, and sleep is usually inherently disruptive to older patients regardless of the excellence of cardiovascular disease care. Given these fundamental and broad challenges of patient aging, CICU management priorities and associated decision-making are particularly complex and in need of enhancements. In this American Heart Association statement, we examine age-related risks and describe some of the distinctive dynamics pertinent to older adults and emerging opportunities to enhance CICU care. Relevant assessment tools are discussed, as well as the need for additional clinical research to best advance CICU care for the already dominating and still expanding population of older adults.		2021-07-02 01:31:12	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	564	Circulation		564	damluji,abdulla a	damluji	abdulla a
503	Frailty In Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease And Risk Of Exacerbations And Hospitalizations	2020	567	10.2147/COPD.S245505	32848382	WOS:000561095400001	567	15		1967	Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. While frailty is thought to be common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the relationship between frailty and COPD-related outcomes such as risk of acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) and hospitalizations is unclear. Purpose: To examine the association between physical frailty and risk of acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality in patients with COPD. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of data from a cohort of 280 participants was performed. Baseline frailty measures included exhaustion, weakness, low activity, slowness, and undernutrition. Outcome measures included AE-COPD, hospitalizations, and mortality over 2 years. Negative binomial regression and Cox proportional hazard modeling were used. Results: Sixty-two percent of the study population met criteria for pre-frail and 23% were frail. In adjusted analyses, the frailty syndrome was not associated with COPD exacerbations. However, among the individual components of the frailty syndrome, weakness measured by handgrip strength was associated with increased risk of COPD exacerbations (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.97). The frailty phenotype was not associated with all-cause hospitalizations but was associated with increased risk of non-COPD-related hospitalizations. Conclusion: This longitudinal cohort study shows that a high proportion of patients with COPD are pre-frail or frail. The frailty phenotype was associated with an increased risk of non-COPD hospitalizations but not with all-cause hospitalizations or COPD exacerbations. Among the individual frailty components, low handgrip strength was associated with increased risk of COPD exacerbations over a 2-year period. Measuring handgrip strength may identify COPD patients who could benefit from programs to reduce COPD exacerbations.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	567	International Journal Of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease		567	yee,nathan	yee	nathan

Nonspecific symptoms, complex medical conditions, insufficient awareness of diagnostic criteria, and unnecessary urine studies all contribute to the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in PALTC residents. In 2017, the Infection Advisory Subcommittee at AMDA-The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine convened a workgroup comprised of experts in geriatrics and infectious diseases to review recent literature regarding UTIs in the PALTC population. The workgroup used evidence as well as their collective clinical expertise to develop this consensus statement with the goal of providing comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of UTIs in PALTC residents. The recommendations acknowledge limitations inherent to providing medical care for frail older adults, practicing within a resource limited setting, and prevention strategies tailored to PALTC populations. In addition, the consensus statement encourages integrating antibiotic stewardship principles into the policies and procedures used by PALTC nursing staff and by prescribing clinicians as they care for residents with a suspected UTI.

The average age of the HF patient has increased substantially and many have a number of comorbidities. For the older HF patient, diligent planning of care has the potential to reduce hospitalization, improve quality of life and mortality; nevertheless, this vital component is often overlooked. Frailty, cachexia, sarcopenia, and cognitive impairment are all common in the older HF patient and require special care considerations. Many older HF patients live for many years with troublesome symptoms that could be better addressed through the incorporation of a palliative approach to care. Effective care plans can help patients maximize their health potential through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. However, current evidence remains scarce on what constitutes an optimal plan, therefore further studies are urgently needed. We review the care that could be implemented for the complex older HF patient with comorbidities.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	573	European Heart Journal Supplements		573	hill,loreena	hill	loreena

508	Effect Of The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention On Outcomes Of Care For Residents Of Aged Care Facilities: A Non-Randomised Trial	2020	78	10.1111/1742-6723.13415	31773885	WOS:000498594800001	575	32	3	422	Objective As the population of Australia ages, EDs will experience an increasing frequency of presentations of older adults from residential aged care facilities (RACFs). These presentations are often complex and time consuming in the chaotic and potentially hazardous ED environment. The Geriatric Emergency Department Intervention (GEDI) model was developed to optimise the care of frail older adults, especially RACF residents, in the ED. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the GEDI model on the primary outcomes of disposition (admission, discharge or death) and ED length of stay for residents of RACFs, presenting to an ED in regional Queensland, Australia. Methods GEDI is a nurse-led, physician-championed, innovative model delivered by advanced practice nurses with expertise in gerontology. This quasi-experimental pragmatic study compared outcomes for RACF residents who presented to a regional Queensland ED during three time periods: pre-GEDI, interim GEDI and post-GEDI implementation of the GEDI model. Outcomes included disposition, ED length of stay, ED re-presentation and mortality. Results A significant increase in the likelihood of discharge from ED (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.26) and reductions in ED length of stay (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.78) were evident for RACF residents following the implementation of the GEDI intervention. There were no differences in mortality, ED re-presentation or in-hospital length of stay between the three time periods. Conclusion There is a paucity of evidence to support the implementation of nurse-led teams in EDs designed to target older adults living in RACFs. The GEDI model was effective in reducing ED length of stay while increasing the likelihood of safe discharge for RACF residents.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	575	Emergency Medicine Australasia		78	marsden,elizabeth	Marsden	Elizabeth

The interplay between the two conditions is complex, due to overlaps in underlying mechanisms, symptoms and prognosis. The assessment of frailty in patients with HF is crucial, as it is associated with both unfavourable outcomes and reduced access and tolerance to treatments. However, to date a consensus definition of frailty in patients with HF remains lacking and the need for a validated assessment score, for identifying those HF patients with frailty, is high and timely. This position paper proposes a new definition of frailty for use by healthcare professionals in the setting of HF and creates a foundation for the design of a tailored and validated score for this common condition.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	577	European Journal Of Heart Failure		577	vitale,cristiana	vitale	cristiana
510	Prevalence And Impact Of Functional And Psychosocial Problems In Hospitalized Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study	2019	578	10.1016/j.jamda.2019.03.012	31078487	WOS:000487829800017	570	20	10	1294	Objectives: Underpinning standards for delivering comprehensive care in hospital is the need to identify issues contributing to patient complexity and risk of harm. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of functional and psychosocial problems in hospitalized adults, to compare prevalence rates across age groups, and to assess their impact on discharge outcomes. Design, setting, and participants: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 4 hospitals in Australia during September 2015 to June 2016, recruiting patients aged 18 and over. Measures: Research nurses assessed patients at admission using the interRAI Acute Care instrument, which includes algorithms for diagnostic and risk screening and measuring problem severity. Length of stay and discharge outcome were recorded from medical records. Results: The median age of the study population (n = 910) was 66 (range 18-99 years), and 47.7% were female. Although 64.6% of patients aged >= 70 years had at least 1 classic geriatric syndrome (cognitive impairment, dependency in activities of daily living, history of falls, or incontinence), similar problems were prevalent in younger cohorts (34.6% in those aged <50 and 38.9% in those aged 50-69 years). Of 17 health issues assessed across multiple domains, only 26 patients (2.9%) had no problems. Independent of age, gender, and Comorbidity Index, having a greater number of problems was significantly associated with an adverse discharge outcome, odds ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29); for each additional problem, the length of stay increased by 6.7% (95% CI 4.3%-9.2%). Conclusions/Implications: The high prevalence of functional and psychosocial problems across the age range of patients indicates that universal screening and assessment is warranted for all adult patients to aid in care planning to meet patient needs both in acute care and post discharge.

511	Hydration Interventions For Older People Living In Residential And Nursing Care Homes: Overview Of The Literature	2019	579	10.1093/bmb/ldz027	31556943	WOS:000509507600007	579	131	1	71	Introduction: Care home populations experiencing high levels of multimorbidity and dementia require support from caregivers to meet their hydration requirements. This article provides an overview of literature related to hydration interventions and highlights gaps in knowledge. Sources of data: This paper draws on UK-focused literature from Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), CINAHL, Medline, Proquest Hospital Premium Collection, Cochrane Library and RCN databases on hydration interventions for older people living with multi-morbidity and dementia in care homes. Areas of agreement: Fluid intake is too low in care home residents, and no single hydration intervention is effective in addressing the complex problems that older residents present. Areas of controversy: There is a lack of consensus about how much fluid an older person should consume daily for optimum health. There is also lack of agreement about what interventions are effective in supporting individuals with complex physical and cognitive problems to achieve daily fluid intake targets. Growing points: To improve hydration care for residents, care home teams should be competent in the delivery of hydration care, and work closely with integrated multi-professional healthcare specialists to provide proactive case management. Areas timely for developing research: There is a need for understanding of what hydration practices and processes are effective for care home residents and including these in multi-component interventions.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	579	British Medical Bulletin		579	cook,glenda	cook	glenda
512	Experiences And Involvement Of Family Members In Transfer Decisions From Nursing Home To Hospital: A Systematic Review Of Qualitative Research	2019	581	10.1186/s12877-019-1170-7	31164101	WOS:000470286200001	49	19		nan	BackgroundNursing home residents (NHR) are characterized by increasing frailty, multimorbidity and care dependency. These conditions result in frequent hospital transfers which can lead to negative effects on residents' health status and are often avoidable. Reasons for emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions are complex. Prior research indicated factors influencing transfer decisions in view of nursing staff and general practitioners. The aim of this systematic review is to explore how family members experience and influence transfers from nursing home (NH) to hospital and how they are involved in the transfer decision.MethodsA systematic literature search was performed in Medline via PubMed, Ebsco Scopus and CINAHL in May 2018. Studies were eligible if they contained information a) about the decision to transfer NHR to hospital and b) the experiences or influence of family members. The review followed Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) approach for qualitative systematic reviews. Screening, selection and quality appraisal of studies were performed independently by two reviewers. Synthesis of qualitative data was conducted through meta-aggregation.ResultsAfter screening of n=2863 articles, in total n=10 qualitative studies were included in the review. Results indicate that family members of NHR experience decision-making before hospitalization differently. They mainly reported NH-related, hospital-related, and family/resident-related factors influencing the transfer decision. The involvement of family members in the decision-making process varies - from no involvement to insistence on a decision in favor of their personal preferences. However, hospital transfer decisions and other treatment decisions (e.g. advance care planning (ACP) discussions) were commonly discussed with physicians and nurses. Conflicts between family members and healthcare providers mostly arose around the interpretation of resident's best interest. In general, family members perceive discussions as challenging thus leading to emotional stress and discomfort.ConclusionThe influence of NHR family members concerning hospital transfer decisions varies. Family members are an important link for communication between resident and medical staff and for communication between NH and hospital. Interventions aiming to reduce hospitalization rates have to take these findings into account.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	49	Bmc Geriatrics		581	pulst,alexandra	pulst	alexandra

A better understanding of this problem has the potential to contribute to the development of care planning and delivery. PurposeTo investigate how older people deal with episodes of precarity in South Louisiana. MethodMore than 300hr of participant observation and interviews were conducted with 20 predominantly older African American women in a housing complex for low-income older persons and two senior citizen centres. ResultsThe findings demonstrate five central negative conditions of precarity that older people had to manage: (a) loss and discontinuity of home-based healthcare services, (b) stress after loss or disruption of social support, (c) problems of poverty, (d) cognitive impairment and declining health and (e) stress of eviction. Strengths and support that older people used were as follows: (a) spiritual faith, (b) psychological strengths, (c) spiritual relationships, (d) family support, (e) friendships of love and friendships of helpfulness, (f) care and support performed by home-based services, (g) senior centre and housing complex activities, (h) church memberships and activities, and (i) grocery store and cafe contacts. ConclusionHome-based services were not sufficient to prevent and reduce precarity for older people because of a lack of and discontinuities in these services. Implications for practiceThis study adds to the literature about precarity among community-based older people by demonstrating gaps in care support and medication access. The findings suggest that ongoing state funding and support by home-based services are necessary to support frail older people in precarious living conditions to survive and handle stressful life events by reducing vulnerability and enhancing strengths and supportive resources of older people.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	2	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	582	hedman,karl	hedman	karl

515	Application Of An Electronic Frailty Index In Australian Primary Care: Data Quality And Feasibility Assessment	2019	587	10.1007/s40520-018-1023-9	30132204	WOS:000466418700008	587	31	5	653	BackgroundThe primary care setting is the ideal location for identifying the condition of frailty in older adults.AimsThe aim of this pragmatic study was twofold: (1) to identify data items to extract the data required for an electronic Frailty Index (eFI) from electronic health records (EHRs); and (2) test the ability of an eFI to accurately and feasibly identify frailty in older adults.MethodsIn a rural South Australian primary care clinic, we derived an eFI from routinely collected EHRs using methodology described by Clegg et al. We assessed feasibility and accuracy of the eFI, including complexities in data extraction. The reference standard for comparison was Fried's frailty phenotype.ResultsThe mean (SD) age of participants was 80.2 (4.8) years, with 36 (60.0%) female (n=60). Frailty prevalence was 21.7% by Fried's frailty phenotype, and 35.0% by eFI (scores>0.21). When deriving the eFI, 85% of EHRs were perceived as easy or neutral difficulty to extract the required data from. Complexities in data extraction were present in EHRs of patients with multiple health problems and/or where the majority of data items were located other than on the patient's summary problem list.DiscussionThis study demonstrated that it is entirely feasible to extract an eFI from routinely collected Australian primary care data. We have outlined a process for extracting an eFI from EHRs without needing to modify existing infrastructure. Results from this study can inform the development of automated eFIs, including which data items to best access data from.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	587	Aging Clinical And Experimental Research		587	ambagtsheer,rachel c	ambagtsheer	rachel c

Subjects with OH were older, thinner, more commonly to have weakness, slowness, poorer physical function and higher levels of frailty. The prevalence of OH was substantially increased as higher levels of CFS (p for trend <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed significant association between OH and frailty (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.7), but the association attenuated after adjustment for physical function. (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7-2.6). Nevertheless, associations between OH and frailty remained significant among vulnerable subgroups like women, subjects having weakness, slowness, poor cognitive function, polypharmacy or any IADL limitation.ConclusionsOH in hospitalized older patients was associated with frailty and multiple complex care needs, especially in the vulnerable subgroups. Further study is needed to clarify the roles of OH in clinical practice.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	589	Journal Of Nutrition Health & Aging		589	chen,l	chen	l

This pilot study was created to determine feasibility and acceptability of a community-delivered posthospital multifactorial program. Method: This mixed-method study used randomized controlled design (quantitative component) and interviews (qualitative component). People aged >= 65 years, hospitalized for a fall, underwent assessment for quality of life and falls-related outcomes, followed by interviews, randomization into intervention (exercise, medication review, and education) or control group, and follow-up at 6 months. Results: Thirteen people commenced, with 10 people assessed at 6 months. Participants were complex with high degrees of frailty, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and falls risk. Interview data related to intervention, impacts on quality of life, and fall-related outcomes. Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest suitability of a multifactorial program for older people posthospital discharge following a fall. A social component would be a useful addition to falls prevention strategies, utilizing existing community nursing organizations.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	590	Journal Of Aging And Physical Activity		590	renehan,emma	renehan	emma

The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. Design A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Results Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self-management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. Discussion The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team works is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live. Conclusion Severely frail older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a complex and flexible person-centred approach		2021-07-02 01:31:13	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	591	lhussier,monique	lhussier	monique
519	Being Acknowledged By Others And Bracketing Negative Thoughts And Feelings: Frail Older People'S Narrations Of How Existential Loneliness Is Eased	2019	592	10.1111/opn.12213	30403002	WOS:000459481400006	33	14	1	nan	Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to describe how EL was eased, as narrated by frail older people. Background Existential loneliness (EL) is an unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older people, the experience of EL can be reduced. Design In this qualitative study, we used an exploratory and descriptive design. Methods The study was based on 22 narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were receiving long-term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis. Results Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the rear-view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract themselves. Conclusion Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person-centred care and create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherne		2021-07-02 01:31:13	2	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	592	sjoberg,marina	sjoberg	marina

Older adults frequently depend on complex medication regimens and polypharmacy, both of which can lead to potentially devastating and debilitating medication-related problems and to subsequent far-reaching public health, social, and economic effects. This perspectives article provides an overview of the current state of medication management, reflects on its relevance among polymedicated home-dwelling older adults living with multiple chronic conditions, and proposes patient-centered approaches for optimizing medication management and preventing medication-related problems.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	593	Patient Preference And Adherence		593	pereira,filipa	pereira	filipa
521	Structured Follow-Up Of Frail Home-Dwelling Older People In Primary Health Care: Is There A Special Need, And Could A Checklist Be Of Any Benefit? A Qualitative Study Of Experiences From Registered Nurses And Their Leaders	2019	594	10.2147/JMDH.S212283	31686832	WOS:000482134000001	594	12		675	Aim: To identify experiences and opinions about the need for a structured follow-up and to identify potential benefits and barriers to the use of a checklist (Sub Acute Functional decline in the Older people [SAFE]) when caring for frail home-dwelling older people. Background: The complexity of older peoples' health situation requires more coordinated health care across health care levels and a better structured follow-up than is currently being offered, especially in the transitional phase between hospital discharge and primary care, but also in more stable phases at home. Design: This was a qualitative study using focus group interviews. Methods: Data were collected during six focus group interviews in three districts in a municipality. Nineteen registered nurses (RNs) and seventeen leaders responsible for the follow-up of frail home-dwelling older people participated. Participants were representatives of the RNs in homecare and their leaders. Results: Our results highlight that although most RNs and their leaders saw a number of significant benefits to conducting a structured assessment and follow-up of frail older people home care recipients, a number of barriers made this difficult to realize on a daily basis. Conclusion: There is no common perception that a structured follow-up of frail homed-welling older people in primary health care is an important and contributing factor to better quality of health care. Despite this, most RNs and leaders found that the use of a structured checklist such as SAFE was a benefit to achieving a structured follow-up of the frail older people. We identified several factors of importance to whether a structured follow-up with a checklist is conducted in home care.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	594	Journal Of Multidisciplinary Healthcare		594	naess,gro	naess	gro
522	Physicians' And Pharmacists' Clinical Considerations For Elderly Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Implica2 Study	2019	595	10.1007/s40261-018-0713-6	30315498	WOS:000458236500007	595	39	1	73	BackgroundManagement of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex due to their age-related conditions. Several clinical guidelines provide specific recommendations for management of these patientsbut little is known about their implementation in clinical practice.ObjectiveTo describe physician and community pharmacist perceptions and routine clinical practice in the management of elderly T2DM patients.MethodsCross-sectional study.ResultsA total of 993 physicians and 999 community pharmacists completed the questionnaire. More physicians than pharmacists agreed on the need to establish more flexible HbA1c targets for elderly (79.4% vs. 30.6%; p<0.001) and frail (92.6% vs. 31.4%; p<0.001) patients than for the general diabetic population. HbA1c targets<7.5% for elderly patients and<8.5% for frail patients (as recommended by the principle guidelines) were set by 38.9% and 28.7% of physicians, respectively. Furthermore, 62.8% of physicians stated they follow guideline recommendations but, based on their prescription decisions for hypothetical patients, less than 50% were aligned with them. In addition, 73.1% of physicians monitor treatment adherence, mainly by using dispensing control (59.1%). Specific nutritional approaches for elderly patients are provided by 62.9% of physicians and 56.0% of pharmacists, whilst 57.4% and 21.7%, respectively, deliver specific physical exercise programs.ConclusionsLow adherence to guideline recommendations (i.e. setting more stringent HbA1c targets or delaying treatment intensification) may lead to suboptimal glycaemic control in elderly patients. The standardization of processes, extensive monitoring of patient treatment adherence and providing advice regarding specific personal lifestyle habits may improve the management of elderly T2DM patients.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	595	Clinical Drug Investigation		595	franch-nadal,josep	franch-nadal	josep

Care decisions are complex because patients may have multiple comorbidities, frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy. Additionally, older adults often have vague symptomology, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and a reported delay of treatment. Although multiple clinical guidelines are available, the applicability of guidelines to the older population needs to be evaluated based on a holistic, individualized basis. Emphasis should be on patient-centered outcomes and priorities, incorporating risk-benefit assessment, quality of life, functional assessment, and frailty assessment when making treatment decisions.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	598	Jnp-Journal For Nurse Practitioners	1	598	ulrich,ethel	ulrich	ethel
524	Effectiveness And Cost-Effectiveness Of Integrated Care Models For Elderly, Complex Patients: A Narrative Review. Don'T We Need A Value-Based Approach?	2018	600	10.1177/2053434518817019		WOS:000455363400004	548	21	4	120	Introduction: The management of patients with complex health and social needs is one of the main challenges for healthcare systems. Integrated care seems to respond to this issue, with collaborative working and integration efforts of the care system components professionals and service providers aimed at improving efficiency, appropriateness and person centeredness of care. We conducted a narrative review to analyse the available evidences published on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated care models targeted on the management of such elderly patients. Methods: MEDLINE, Scopus and EBSCO were searched. We reported this narrative review according to the PRISMA Checklist. For studies to be included, they had to: (i) refer to integrated care models through implemented experimental or demonstration projects; (ii) focus on frail elderly 65 years old, with complex health and social needs, not disease-specific; (iii) evaluate effectiveness and/or cost and/or cost-effectiveness; (iv) report quantitative data (e.g. health outcomes, utilization outcomes, cost and cost-effectiveness). Results: Thirty articles were included, identifying 13 integrated care models. Common features were identified in case management, geriatric assessment and multidisciplinary team. Favourable impacts on healthcare facilities utilization rates, though with mixed results on costs, were found. The development of community-based and cost-effective integrated systems of care for the elderly is possible, thanks to the cooperation across care professionals and providers, to achieving a relevant impact on healthcare and efficient resource management. The elements of success or failure are not always unique and identifiable, but the potential clearly exists for these models to be successful and generalized on a large scale. Discussion: We found out a favourable impact of integrated care models/methods on health outcomes, care utilization and costs. The selected interventions are likely to be implemented at community level, focused on the patient management in terms of continuity of care. Thus, we propose a value-based framework for the evaluation of these services.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	548	International Journal Of Care Coordination		600	marino,marta	marino	marta
525	Communicating End-Of-Life Care Goals And Decision-Making Among A Multidisciplinary Geriatric Inpatient Rehabilitation Team: A Qualitative Descriptive Study	2018	602	10.1177/0269216318790353	30074431	WOS:000452481600009	139	32	10	1615	Background: In geriatric inpatient rehabilitation settings, where the goal is to optimise function, providing end-of-life care can be challenging. Aim: The aim of this study is to explore how end-of-life care goals and decision-making are communicated in a geriatric inpatient rehabilitation setting. Design: The design is a qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured individual and group interviews. Setting/participants: This study was conducted in a 154-bed facility in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, providing geriatric inpatient rehabilitation for older patients; medical, nursing and allied health clinicians, who had cared for an inpatient who died, were recruited. Data collection: Participants were interviewed using a conversational approach, guided by an 'aide memoire'. Results: A total of 19 clinicians participated in this study, with 12 interviewed individually and the remaining 7 clinicians participating in group interviews. The typical patient was described as older, frail and with complex needs. Clinicians described the challenge of identifying patients who were deteriorating towards death, with some relying on others to inform them. How patient deterioration and decision-making was communicated among the team varied. Communication with the patient/family about dying was expected but did not always occur, nor was it always documented. Some clinicians relied on documentation, such as commencement of a dying care pathway to indicate when a patient was dying. Conclusion: Clinicians reported difficulties recognising patient deterioration towards death. Uncertainty and inconsistent communication among clinicians about patient deterioration negatively impacted team understanding, decision-making, and patient and family communication. Further education for all members of the multidisciplinary team focusing on how to recognise and communicate impending death will aid multidisciplinary teams to provide quality end-of-life care when required.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	139	Palliative Medicine		602	bloomer,melissa j	bloomer	melissa j
526	The Role Of Advanced Geriatric Nurses In Norway: A Descriptive Exploratory Study	2018	607	10.1111/opn.12188	29527828	WOS:000442344100001	33	13	3	nan	Background: Care of older adults in the community is becoming increasingly complex. However, nursing staff often has insufficient knowledge and skills to adequately address the needs of frail older adults. There is therefore a need for nurses with advanced qualifications. To meet this need, advanced geriatric nursing has been introduced in Norway. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses with their new role as advanced geriatric nurses in care of older adults and to determine what strategies the nurses considered important in the development of their new role. Design: This study applied a descriptive, exploratory design. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 nurses who had undergone an educational programme to become advanced geriatric nurses in Norway in 2016. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The participants described a complex and extensive nursing role, which they related to a new understanding of the patients, relatives and the system in which they worked. This new gaze had developed based on a combination of their new knowledge, their skills, experiences and professional interests. The opportunities to use their role depended on their workplace conditions. They related to contextual challenges at their workplace in different ways to optimise the use of their new gaze. Conclusions: Common for all participants was a broader and deeper understanding of the patient's health and life situation, which guided participants' actions. The key issue in developing the new role was developing effective strategies to foster role integration. Implications for Practice: Advanced geriatric nurses should collaborate with their managers to create a role that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills, as well as collaborate with colleagues to enhance understanding of utilisation of their role.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	607	henni,silje havrevold	henni	silje havrevold

Recently, nine proactive primary-care programs aiming to prevent functional decline in older adults showed inconclusive effects. The aim of this study was to systematically unravel, compare, and synthesize the development and evaluation of nine primary-care programs within a controlled trial to further improve the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Study Design and Setting: A systematic overview of all written data on the nine proactive primary-care programs was conducted using a validated item list. The nine proactive primary-care programs involved 214 general practices throughout the Netherlands. Results: There was little or no focus on the (1) context surrounding the care program, (2) modeling of processes and outcomes, (3) intervention fidelity and adaptation, and (4) content and evaluation of training for interventionists. Conclusions: An in-depth analysis of the context, modeling of the processes and outcomes, measurement and reporting of intervention fidelity, and implementation of effective training for interventionists is needed to enhance the development and replication of future complex interventions.

529	Making Sense Of Frailty: An Ethnographic Study Of The Experience Of Older People Living With Complex Health Problems	2018	615	10.1111/opn.12172	28990309	WOS:000425184600008	33	13	1	nan	Aim: To explore how older people with complex health problems experience frailty in their daily lives. Background: A better understanding of the personal experience of frailty in the context of fluctuating ill-health has the potential to contribute to the development of personalised approaches to care planning and delivery. Design: An ethnographic study of older people, living at home, receiving support from a community matron service in a large city in the North of England. Methods: Up to six care encounters with each of ten older people, and their community matron, were observed at monthly intervals, over a period of time ranging from 4 to 11months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the older participants in their own homes. Fieldwork took place over a 4-year period. Data analysis was undertaken using the constant comparative method. Findings: The experience of frailty was understood through the construction of four themes: Fluctuating ill-health and the disruption of daily living; Changes to the management of daily living; Frailty as fear, anxiety and uncertainty; Making sense of changes to health and daily living. Conclusions: Older people work hard to shape and maintain daily routines in the context of complicated and enduring transitions in health and illness. However, they experience episodic moments of frailty, often articulated as uncertainty, where daily living becomes precarious and their resilience is threatened. Developing an understanding of the personal experiences of frail older people in the context of transition has the potential to inform nursing practice in person-centred care . Implications for practice: Nurses need to support frail older people to maintain independence and continuity of personhood in the context of daily routines.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	2	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	615	skilbeck,julie kathryn	skilbeck	julie kathryn
530	Emergency Department Staff Priorities For Improving Palliative Care Provision For Older People: A Qualitative Study	2018	616	10.1177/0269216317705789	28429643	WOS:000423322000013	139	32	2	417	Background: Emergency department-based palliative care services are increasing, but research to develop these services rarely includes input from emergency clinicians, jeopardizing the effectiveness of subsequent palliative care interventions. Aim: To collaboratively identify with emergency clinicians' improvement priorities for emergency department-based palliative care for older people. Design: This was one component of an experience-based co-design project, conducted using semi-structured interviews and feedback sessions. Setting/participants: In-depth interviews with 15 emergency clinicians (nurses and doctors) at a large teaching hospital emergency department in the United Kingdom exploring experiences of palliative care delivery for older people. A thematic analysis identified core challenges that were presented to 64 clinicians over five feedback sessions, validating interview findings, and identifying shared priorities for improving palliative care delivery. Results: Eight challenges emerged: patient age; access to information; communication with patients, family members, and clinicians; understanding of palliative care; role uncertainty; complex systems and processes; time constraints; and limited training and education. Through feedback sessions, clinicians selected four challenges as improvement priorities: time constraints; communication and information; systems and processes; and understanding of palliative care. As resulting improvement plans evolved, training and education replaced time constraints as a priority. Conclusion: Clinician priorities for improving emergency department-based palliative care were identified through collaborative, iterative processes. Though generally aware of older palliative patients' needs, clinicians struggled to provide high-quality care due to a range of complex factors. Further research should identify whether priorities are shared across other emergency departments, and develop, implement, and evaluate strategies developed by clinicians.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	139	Palliative Medicine		616	wright,rebecca j	wright	rebecca j
531	Genetic Variants And Hamstring Injury In Soccer: An Association And Validation Study	2018	617	10.1249/MSS.0000000000001434	28976491	WOS:000419936500022	617	50	2	361	Purpose This study aimed to investigate the association of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with noncontact hamstring muscle injuries in elite soccer players and to create and validate a model to assess the risk of hamstring injury. Methods A total of 107 elite male outfield players were prospectively followed for six seasons. Players were genotyped for 37 SNP previously investigated in relation to musculoskeletal injuries. The association of SNP, previous injury, age, level of play, position, and anthropometric data with 129 hamstring injuries (413 observations) was investigated in the discovery phase (2010-2015), and a multivariable Cox frailty model was created using forward selection. The model's discriminative ability was tested in the validation phase (2015-2016, 31 injuries, 98 observations) using Harrell's C index. Results Five SNP were found to be significantly associated with hamstring injury in a multivariable model: matrix metalloproteinase 3 rs679620 (A vs G, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-2.81), tenascin C rs2104772 (A vs T, HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.17-2.32), interleukin 6 rs1800795 (GG vs GC + CC, HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.11-2.53), nitric oxide synthase 3 rs1799983 (G vs T, HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.01-1.79), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 rs11549465 (CC vs CT, HR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.00-4.29). Age also entered the model (24 vs <24 yr, HR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.29-3.42). The model showed acceptable discrimination in the discovery phase (C index = 0.74), but not in the validation phase (C index = 0.52). Conclusion Genetic variants appear to be involved in the etiology of hamstring injuries but were not found to have predictive value by themselves. Further research, increasing the number of genetic variants and including environmental factors in complex multifactorial risk models, is necessary.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	617	Medicine And Science In Sports And Exercise		617	larruskain,jon	larruskain	jon
532	Advanced Nurse Practitioners In Municipal Healthcare As A Way To Meet The Growing Healthcare Needs Of The Frail Elderly: A Qualitative Interview Study With Managers, Doctors And Specialist Nurses	2017	621	10.1186/s12912-017-0258-7	29176932	WOS:000415314500001	550	16		nan	Background: The number of frail elderly people with complex nursing and medical care needs is increasing, and consequently, the healthcare burden. The implementation of Advanced Nurse Practitioners globally has been shown to make healthcare more effective and increase patient safety, continuity of care and access to care. In Sweden, research about Advanced Nurse Practitioners is limited. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the opinions of managers, doctors and nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare about the role of ANPs in municipal healthcare as a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of the frail elderly. Methods: Managers, doctors and specialist nurses in primary care and municipal healthcare adopted a qualitative, descriptive design through 12 semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using content analysis. Results: The participants expressed both opportunities as well as challenges with Advanced Nurse Practitioners in municipal healthcare. This role considered to satisfy frail elderly people's healthcare needs and making the healthcare more effective as the doctors would have more time for other patients. The challenges mainly consist of doubts from the managers whether the nurses would be motivated to pursue further education to become an Advanced Nurse Practitioner if the role becomes a reality. The doctors were unsure if the nurses would consider taking the responsibility the role would imply. Conclusions: Advanced Nurse Practitioner is considered to be a valuable resource not only for the frail elderly but also for the nurses in the municipal healthcare and for the doctors in primary care as they probably would make healthcare more effective. They might be a way to meet the increasing healthcare needs of frail elderly, however there are also challenges to overcome before they can become a reality in a Swedish healthcare context. Consequently, this role deserves further investigation.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	550	Bmc Nursing	1	621	ljungbeck,birgitta	ljungbeck	birgitta
533	Health Literacy In Older Latinos With Heart Failure A Systematic Review	2017	626	10.1097/JCN.0000000000000314	26646599	WOS:000394459400012	619	32	2	125	Background: By 2050, one-third of US residents will be Latino, with an incidence of heart failure (HF) higher than other ethnicities. Culturally linked risk factors and socioeconomic challenges result in cardiometabolic risks, healthcare disparities, and worsening health outcomes. Individuals with low health literacy (HL) and HF are less likely to possess tools for optimal self-care, disease management, or preventative health strategies. Objective: In this systematic review, we analyzed the literature studying older Latinos with HF and limited HL. Method: We searched the literature and used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an iterative process. Inclusion criteria were research studies, Latinos, HF, and HL. Results: Eight quantitative studies were identified for final review. Inadequate HL was reported in 87.2% of elderly Latinos. Higher HL was associated with more HF knowledge. Clinics serving minorities reported lower HL levels and higher medical complexity. Conclusions: Nurses and advanced practice nurses serve a pivotal role improving access and understanding of health information. Before conducting intervention research affecting clinical outcomes, it is essential to describe elderly Latinos with HF and their HL and self-care levels. Barriers identified confirm the need to alter research protocols for older adults and ensure the availability of assistive devices. The need to examine HL in older Latinos with HF is confirmed by the medical complexity of ethnic minority patients with limited HL, limited HL in the elderly, and the relationship of HL with HF knowledge. In culturally diverse populations, HL levels alone may not be reliable predictors of a person's ability to self-manage, recognize symptoms, and develop, implement, and revise a self-care action plan to manage their health.		2021-07-02 01:31:13	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	619	Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing	1	626	delgado,janet m	delgado	janet m
534	Deprescribing In Older Adults: A New Concept For Nurses In Administering Medicines And As Prescribers Of Medicine	2017	631	10.1136/ejhpharm-2016-000908	31156898	WOS:000396467800013	631	24	1	47	Deprescribing is a new and emerging theme in the care of older adults living with multimorbidities including frailty. Deprescribing requires a comprehensive review of risk and benefits of a medication in the context of the quality of remaining life and patient and family priorities and preferences. Nursing to date has not engaged with this issue, yet in their roles administering medicines and prescribing medicines they are a fundamental part of the pathway in deprescribing decisions and in supporting patients to make such decisions. In administering medicines, nurses are in a position to observe the degree of difficulty or burden experienced by patients due to polypharmacy or side effects of medicines. While as prescribers for adults with multimorbidities, active review of the risk and benefits of all medicines using evidence-based instruments is part of prescribing responsibility. This article is calling for a critical examination of nurses' roles in deprescribing and in supporting patients to make informed choices about their treatment. There is a need to articulate the role of nursing in this emerging area of medicines management and contribute to a multidisciplinary discourse on deprescribing. Equally professional standards and continuous professional development for nurses as prescribers and administrators of medicines needs to reflect the complexity of an older population. A deprescribing ethos challenges nurses to actively elicit patients' experiences of medicines burden, while nurse prescribers should recognise that appropriate deprescribing is as much a part of their role as appropriate prescribing.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	631	European Journal Of Hospital Pharmacy-Science And Practice		631	naughton,corina	naughton	corina

While AT may extend independence in ageing, there are racial and ethnic disparities in late-life AT use, with lower rates reported among Hispanic older populations. The aim of this study was to identify barriers experienced by Hispanic community-living older adults for using AT. Sixty Hispanic older adults (70 years and older) with functional limitations participated in this study. A descriptive qualitative research design was used guided by the principles of the Human Activity Assistive Technology Model to gain in-depth understanding of participants' perspectives regarding barriers to using AT devices. Individual in-depth semi-structure interviews were conducted, using the Assistive Technology Devices Cards (ATDC) assessment as a prompt to facilitate participants' qualitative responses. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and rigorous thematic content analysis. Lack of AT awareness and information, cost of AT, limited coverage of AT by heath care plans, and perceived complexity of AT were the predominant barriers experienced by the participants. A multi-level approach is required for a better understanding of the barriers for using AT devices. The personal, contextual, and activity-based barriers found in this study can be used to develop culturally sensitive AT interventions to reduce existent disparities in independent living disabilities among older Hispanics.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	632	Journal Of Racial And Ethnic Health Disparities		632	orellano-colon,elsa m	orellano-colon	elsa m

This study is part of a larger project on newly graduated nurses where previous research indicated that building professional pride at their workplace could be important for remaining in the profession and in municipal health care. However, the recently graduated nurse's first job assignment in municipal health care can also be a critical period with cuts in their pride as nurses who may have an impact on nursing care for their patients. AimThe aim of this study is to illuminate recently graduated nurses' experiences with professional pride in municipal health and care services. MethodsA phenomenological hermeneutic approach was chosen to illuminate meaning. A purposive sample of eight recently graduated nurses working in nursing homes or home health care was chosen for this study with narrative interviews and diaries. FindingsThree themes were identified: doing the good thing and doing what is right; being recognized and confirmed; and finally thriving in a community of practice. An important source of pride is the relation to patients. Recently graduated nurses build their professional pride in an active and social process in a community of practice. The first cut in their professional pride seems to take place when they were not recognized and confirmed as professional persons. ConclusionRecently graduated nurses in municipal health care describe their professional pride as a complex phenomenon with relational, dynamic and collective dimensions. The cuts in their pride may hurt their identity and nursing care.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	100	Scandinavian Journal Of Caring Sciences	1	637	sneltvedt,torild	sneltvedt	torild
537	Ambiguous Participation In Older Hospitalized Patients: Gaining Influence Through Active And Passive Approaches-A Qualitative Study	2016	638	10.1186/s12912-016-0171-5	27563281	WOS:000382358400001	550	15		nan	Background: Patient participation is required by law in Norway and in several western countries. Current participation ideology is based on individualism, which may conflict with the older generation's commonly held values of solidarity and community. Hence, different values and ideologies may come in conflict when older patients receive treatment and rehabilitation in geriatric wards. Participation is a guiding principle in rehabilitation. Criteria for admission of older patients to geriatric wards are complex health problems, acute illness and/or acute physical and/or cognitive functional failure. The ideal is an active and engaged patient. The aim of the study was to describe the difficulties experienced by older patients on acute geriatric wards when involving themselves with their own treatment and care. Methods: In this qualitative study older patients were interviewed during hospitalization in geriatric wards and asked to tell about their experiences with participation. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. Results: The patients experienced difficulties in participating in decisions and care. They linked their difficulties to their own diminishing capabilities, and cited the ward's busy schedule as a reason for abstaining from participation. However, despite their reservations, they did participate in decisions in different ways. Their participatory practices appeared ambiguous and they employed various strategies to put themselves in a position of influence. The most important of these involved their relatives. The patients delegated to family the tasks of seeking, receiving and giving information to the nurses and the staff, and, to some extent, for the dialogues with hospital staff about their needs and plan of care. The family appeared to accept the responsibility willingly. Conclusions: The patients addressed their difficulties by authorizing family members to act and participate on their behalf. This underlines the family's important role in patient participation and the role that nurses and other staff must play in collaborating with the patient and their family to facilitate participation independently of the patients' performances of participation.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	550	Bmc Nursing	1	638	nyborg,ingrid	nyborg	ingrid
538	Designing, Implementing, And Evaluating Mobile Health Technologies For Managing Chronic Conditions In Older Adults: A Scoping Review	2016	639	10.2196/mhealth.5127	27282195	WOS:000381182400014	639	4	2	164	Background: The current landscape of a rapidly aging population accompanied by multiple chronic conditions presents numerous challenges to optimally support the complex needs of this group. Mobile health ( mHealth) technologies have shown promise in supporting older persons to manage chronic conditions; however, there remains a dearth of evidence-informed guidance to develop such innovations. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to conduct a scoping review of current practices and recommendations for designing, implementing, and evaluating mHealth technologies to support the management of chronic conditions in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A 5-stage scoping review methodology was used to map the relevant literature published between January 2005 and March 2015 as follows: ( 1) identified the research question, ( 2) identified relevant studies, ( 3) selected relevant studies for review, ( 4) charted data from selected literature, and ( 5) summarized and reported results. Electronic searches were conducted in 5 databases. In addition, hand searches of reference lists and a key journal were completed. Inclusion criteria were research and nonresearch papers focused on mHealth technologies designed for use by community-living older adults with at least one chronic condition, or health care providers or informal caregivers providing care in the home and community setting. Two reviewers independently identified articles for review and extracted data. Results: We identified 42 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, described innovations focused on older adults with specific chronic conditions ( n= 17), chronic conditions in general ( n= 6), or older adults in general or those receiving homecare services ( n= 18). Most of the mHealth solutions described were designed for use by both patients and health care providers or health care providers only. Thematic categories identified included the following: ( 1) practices and considerations when designing mHealth technologies; ( 2) factors that support/ hinder feasibility, acceptability, and usability of mHealth technologies; and ( 3) approaches or methods for evaluating mHealth technologies. Conclusions: There is limited yet increasing use of mHealth technologies in home health care for older adults. A user-centered, collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to enhance feasibility, acceptability, and usability of mHealth innovations is imperative. Creating teams with the required pools of expertise and insight regarding needs is critical. The cyclical, iterative process of developing mHealth innovations needs to be viewed as a whole with supportive theoretical frameworks. Many barriers to implementation and sustainability have limited the number of successful, evidence-based mHealth solutions beyond the pilot or feasibility stage. The science of implementation of mHealth technologies in home-based care for older adults and self-management of chronic conditions are important areas for further research. Additionally, changing needs as cohorts and technologies advance are important considerations. Lessons learned from the data and important implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed to inform the future development of innovations.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	639	Jmir Mhealth And Uhealth		639	matthew-maich,nancy	matthew-maich	nancy
539	Provision Of Nhs Generalist And Specialist Services To Care Homes In England: Review Of Surveys	2016	641	10.1017/S1463423615000250	25939731	WOS:000369934500004	641	17	2	122	Background: The number of beds in care homes (with and without nurses) in the United Kingdom is three times greater than the number of beds in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Care homes are predominantly owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective. Objectives: To critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes. Methods: A review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose. Results: Five surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with in-house provision. Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient. Conclusions: Historical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking to improve the quality of care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	641	Primary Health Care Research And Development		641	iliffe,steve	iliffe	steve
540	The Role Of The Advanced Practice Nurse In Geriatric Oncology Care	2016	642	10.1016/j.soncn.2015.11.005	26830266	WOS:000418788400005	574	32	1	33	OBJECTIVES: To describe how the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) is uniquely suited to meet the needs of older adults throughout the continuum of cancer, to explore the progress that APNs have made in gero-oncology care, and make suggestions for future directions. DATA SOURCE: Google Scholar, PubMed, and CINAHL. Search terms included: gero-oncology, geriatric oncology, Advanced Practice Nurse, Nurse Practitioner, older adult, elderly, and cancer. CONCLUSION: Over the last decade, APNs have made advances in caring for older adults with cancer by playing a role in prevention, screening, and diagnosis; through evidence-based gero-oncology care during cancer treatment; and in designing tailored survivorship care models. APNs must combat ageism in treatment choice for older adults, standardize comprehensive geriatric assessments, and focus on providing person-centered care, specifically during care transitions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: APNs are well-positioned to help understand the complex relationship between risk factors, geriatric syndromes, and frailty and translate research into practice. Palliative care must expand beyond specialty providers and shift toward APNs with a focus on early advanced care planning. Finally, APNs should continue to establish multidisciplinary survivorship models across care settings, with a focus on primary care.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	2	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	574	Seminars In Oncology Nursing	1	642	morgan,brianna	morgan	brianna
541	Sufficient Competence In Community Elderly Care? Results From A Competence Measurement Of Nursing Staff	2016	643	10.1186/s12912-016-0124-z	26778919	WOS:000377514400002	550	15		nan	Background: Multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment leave many old patients in a frail condition with a high risk of adverse outcomes if proper health care is not provided. Knowledge about available competence is necessary to evaluate whether we are able to offer equitable and balanced health care to older persons with acute and/ or complex health care needs. This study investigates the sufficiency of nursing staff competence in Norwegian community elderly care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1016 nursing staff in nursing homes and home care services with the instrument Nursing Older People - Competence Evaluation Tool. Statistical analyses were ANOVA and multiple regression. Results: We found that nursing staff have competence in all areas measured, but that the level of competence was insufficient in the areas nursing measures, advanced procedures, and nursing documentation. Nursing staff in nursing homes scored higher than staff in home care services, and older nursing staff scored lower than younger nursing staff. Conclusions: A reason for the relatively low influence of education and training on competence could be the diffuse roles that nursing staff have in community elderly care, implying that they have poor standards against which to judge their own competence. Clearer role descriptions for all groups of nursing staff are recommended as well as general competence development in geriatric nursing care.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	550	Bmc Nursing	1	643	bing-jonsson,pia cecilie	bing-jonsson	pia cecilie
542	Renal Disease And Accidental Falls: A Review Of Published Evidence	2015	645	10.1186/s12882-015-0173-7	26510510	WOS:000363623600002	645	16		nan	Background: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification of risk factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship between renal disease and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal dysfunction. Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller* or fallen or slip* or trip* or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency (chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal disease* or kidney disease* or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls were analyzed. Results: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between 1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce. Conclusions: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	645	Bmc Nephrology		645	jesus lopez-soto,pablo	jesus lopez-soto	pablo
543	Feasibility Of A Nursing Intervention To Prepare Frail Older Patients For Cardiac Surgery: A Mixed-Methods Study	2015	647	10.1177/1474515114535511	24821716	WOS:000357949600009	609	14	4	342	Background: Given the growing number of vulnerable, older cardiac surgery patients, the preadmission PREvention Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery patients (PREDOCS) programme was developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Before the clinical effects of such a complex multicomponent intervention can be evaluated, the feasibility needs to be determined to detect possible problems with the acceptability, compliance and delivery. Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the PREDOCS programme on its feasibility and estimate theoretical cost savings. Methods: In a mixed-methods multicentre study, the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines concerning testing feasibility were followed, and theoretical cost savings were calculated. We used data from interviews and the continuous data registry at three hospitals. The results were reported following the criteria for reporting the feasibility of complex interventions (CReDECI). Results: Twenty-one females and 49 males out of 114 eligible patients completed the intervention and provided full data. Patients were equally satisfied with the usual care and the PREDOCS programme (satisfaction rate respectively standard deviation (SD): 7.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4-8.7) and 7.6 (6.6-8.6)). The involved nurses were satisfied with the tools for guiding patients to reduce their risk of postoperative complications and considered the PREDOCS programme as complementary to usual care. Integrating PREDOCS into current hospital structures appeared to be difficult. Both patients and nurses indicated that the additional consult was tiresome for the patient. The PREDOCS programme will be cost-effective when postoperative complications are prevented in six to sixteen of 1000 cardiac surgery patients. Conclusions: The PREDOCS programme is acceptable for patients and nurses but should be built into the hospital's cardiac surgery pathway or applied in home care.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	2	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	609	European Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing	1	647	ettema,roelof	ettema	roelof
544	Ageism And Age Discrimination In Health Care: Fact Or Fiction? A Narrative Review Of The Literature	2015	648	10.1016/j.maturitas.2015.05.002	26044073	WOS:000359175700004	143	81	4	432	Ageism and age discrimination are terms used in best practice statements and in the literature to define negative attitudes towards older people and towards people because of their age (whether old or young). However, 'old age' is a nebulous concept with definitions ranging from the over 50s to the over 85s. In seeking to explore ageism and age discrimination within health care, this paper discusses the concept of 'old' and discusses the findings of a narrative review of the literature on these two concepts. Results show that negative attitudes have been perceived by users of health care services, but the reasons are not clear. Such attitudes are usually reported in acute health care settings, where targets and quick turnover are encouraged. Thus people, usually those with complex needs, who require longer periods of recuperation and rehabilitation following an episode of ill health, are troublesome to staff working in a system geared up for early discharges. This type of service user is usually over the age of 85. Recommendations from this paper include the need for acute frailty units, with well trained staff, where frail older people can be comprehensively assessed, receive timely and targeted care, followed by a supported discharge.

545	Implementing Oral Care Practices And Policy Into Long-Term Care: The Brushing Up On Mouth Care Project	2015	650	10.1016/j.jamda.2014.08.018	25306289	WOS:000350176900008	570	16	3	200	Background: Optimal mouth care is integral to the health and quality of life of dependent older adults. Yet, a persistent lack of adequate oral care in long-term care (LTC) facilities exacerbates the burden of disease experienced by residents. The reasons for this are complex and create enormous challenges for care providers, clinicians, and administrators dedicated to comprehensive high quality care. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive program for daily mouth care for LTC. Design: A case study design using a participatory and qualitative approach examined how individual, organizational (workplace practices and culture), and system factors (standards and policy) influenced the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to improve the delivery of daily oral care in LTC. Setting and Participants: The research was undertaken in 3 LTC residences administered under the same health authority and included personal care providers, nurse managers, and directors of care. Intervention: A comprehensive program for care providers including, education, resources, and organizational guidelines, to improve the delivery of daily mouth care to LTC residents was created, rolled out, and refined over a 12-month period. Measurements: Data was collected through diary studies, targeted interviews, field notes, oral care activities records, site team meetings, and direct feedback from members of the care team. Results: The oral care intervention resulted in a heightened awareness, support and greater efficiency amongst care team. The presence of a champion was a key feature for sustaining processes. Management had a clear role to play to ensure support and accountability for the intervention. Conclusions: Optimizing oral care in long-term care can be achieved through an integrated approach that includes education, provision of resources, an oral care champion, support from managers and administrators, and appropriate organizational policy.

546	How Older People Cope With Frailty Within The Context Of Transition Care In Australia: Implications For Improving Service Delivery	2015	651	10.1111/hsc.12142	25427647	WOS:000349019800013	651	23	2	216	Transition care is increasingly common for older people, yet little is known about the subjective experience of the transition care journey' from the perspective of clients themselves. This study examines how older people cope with frailty within the context of a dedicated transition care programme and discusses implications for improving service delivery. Qualitative in-depth interviews were carried out during 2011 in the homes of 20 older people who had recently been discharged from a transition care programme operating in Adelaide, South Australia (average age 80years, 65% female). Thematic analysis identified three key themes: a new definition of recovery', complexities of control' and the disempowering system'. Despite describing many positive aspects of the programme, including meeting personal milestones and a renewed sense of independence, participants recognised that they were unlikely to regain their previous level of functioning. For some, this was exacerbated by lacking control over the transition care process while adapting to their new level of frailty. Overall, this research highlighted that benefits associated with transition care can be undermined by fragmentation in service delivery, loss of control and uncertainties around future support.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	651	Health & Social Care In The Community	1	651	walker,ruth	walker	ruth
547	Reliability Of The Interrai Long Term Care Facilities (Ltcf) And Interrai Home Care (Hc)	2015	652	10.1111/ggi.12330	25163513	WOS:000348670100012	119	15	2	220	AimSharing clinical information across care settings is a cornerstone to providing quality care to older people with complex conditions. The purpose of the present study was to examine the reliability of the interRAI Long Term Care Facilities (interRAI LTCF) and the interRAI Home Care (interRAI HC), comprehensive and integrated assessment instruments with common core items, in Korea, an Asian county where comprehensive geriatric assessment is not widely used in long-term care. MethodsThe Korean version of the instruments was developed through field tests, as well as multiple iterations of translations, back-translations and expert reviews. For the reliability test, a random sample of 908 older people in 27 long-term care hospitals or nursing homes, or at home with home care, were assessed by regular staff, among which a subsample of 534 people were dually assessed. The Cronbach's alphas of seven major composite scales in the instruments were examined for internal consistency. Interrater reliability was tested using agreement, kappa coefficients and interclass correlation coefficients. ResultsThe internal consistencies of all key measures were adequate (Cronbach's alpha 0.75). The overall mean kappa statistics of the items in the interRAI LTCF and those in the interRAI HC were 0.78 and 0.89, respectively. All key common items in the interRAI LTCF and the interRAI HC had almost perfect (0.81) or substantial (0.610.80) interrater reliability. ConclusionsThe findings show the interRAI LTCF and the interRAI HC have adequate reliability for assessing the function and health of frail older adults across various long-term settings, which can promote continuity of care for the aged.

548	Experience Of Advanced Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Metasynthesis Of Qualitative Research	2014	657	10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2014.03.009	24780181	WOS:000346742300017	104	48	6	1182	Context. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a life-limiting illness. Despite best available treatments, individuals continue to experience symptom burden and have high health care utilization. Objectives. To increase understanding of the experience and ongoing needs of individuals living with COPD. Methods. Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Sociological Abstracts were searched for articles published between January 1990 and June 2013. Metasynthesis of qualitative data followed the principles of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Metasyntheses are increasingly used to gain understandings of complex research questions through synthesizing data from individual qualitative studies. Descriptive and analytical themes were developed through thematic synthesis and expert panel discussion of extracted primary quotes, not the primary data themselves. Results. Twenty-two studies were included. Four hundred twenty-two free codes were condensed into seven descriptive themes: better understanding of condition, breathlessness, fatigue, frailty, anxiety, social isolation, and loss of hope and maintaining meaning. These seven themes were condensed further into three analytical themes that described the experience and ongoing needs of individuals with COPD: the need for better understanding of condition, sustained symptom burden, and the unrelenting psychological impact of living with COPD. Conclusion. Combining discrete qualitative studies provided a useful perspective of the experience of living with COPD over the past two decades. Further studies into the ongoing needs of individuals with COPD are unlikely to add to this well-established picture. Future research should focus on solutions through the development of interventions that address patients' ongoing needs. (C) 2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

549	Development Of A Nursing Intervention To Prepare Frail Older Patients For Cardiac Surgery (The Predocs Programme), Following Phase One Of The Guidelines Of The Medical Research Council	2014	658	10.1177/1474515113511715	24186065	WOS:000345335600003	609	13	6	494	Background: In older patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the timely identification and preparation of patients at risk for frequent postoperative hospital complications provide opportunities to reduce the risk of these complications. Aims: We developed an evidence-based, multi-component nursing intervention (Prevention of Decline in Older Cardiac Surgery Patients; the PREDOCS programme) for application in the preadmission period to improve patients' physical and psychosocial condition to reduce their risk of postoperative complications. This paper describes in detail the process used to design and develop this multi-component intervention. Methods: In a team of researchers, experts, cardiac surgeons, registered cardiac surgery nurses, and patients, the revised guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions of the Medical Research Council (MRC) were followed, including identifying existing evidence, identifying and developing theory and modelling the process and outcomes. Additionally, the criteria for reporting the development of complex interventions in healthcare (CReDECI) were followed. Results: The intervention is administered during a consultation by the nurse two to four weeks before the surgery procedure. The consultation includes three parts: a general part for all patients, a second part in which patients with an increased risk are identified, and a third part in which selected patients are informed about how to prepare themselves for the hospital admission to reduce their risk. Conclusions: Following the MRC guidelines, an extended, stepwise, multi-method procedure was used to develop the multi-component nursing intervention to prepare older patients for cardiac surgery, creating transparency in the assumed working mechanisms. Additionally, a detailed description of the intervention is provided.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	609	European Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing	1	658	ettema,roelof g a	ettema	roelof g a
550	The Modified Hospital Elder Life Program Adapting A Complex Intervention For Feasibility And Scalability In A Surgical Setting	2014	661	10.3928/00989134-20140110-01	24443887	WOS:000335951600003	60	40	5	16	The purpose of this article is to provide the rationale and methods for adapting the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP). The HELP is a complex intervention that has been shown to reduce rates of delirium and functional decline. However, modification of the program may be required to meet local circumstances and specialized populations. We selected three key elements based on our prior work and the concept of shared risk factors and modified the HELP to include only three shared risk factors (functional, nutritional, and cognitive status) that were targeted by three nursing protocols: early mobilization, oral and nutritional assistance, and orienting communication. These protocols were adapted, refined, and pilot-tested for feasibility and efficacy. We hope by reporting the rationale and protocols for the modified HELP, we will advance the field for others adapting evidence-based, complex nursing interventions.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	60	Journal Of Gerontological Nursing	1	661	chen,cheryl chia-hui	chen	cheryl chia-hui
551	Nutritional Status Plays The Mediating Role Of The Functional Status And Comorbidity Among Older Patients Admitted To The Geriatric Evaluation And Management Unit: A Tobit Model Application	2014	662	10.1016/j.eurger.2013.12.003		WOS:000334020700004	662	5	2	87	Health care for older people is featured by simultaneous management of the multiple comorbid complex conditions, including acute illnesses, underlying comorbid conditions, nutritional status, functional status and many others. The purpose of this study was to investigate nutritional status and its effect on the relationship between co-existing diseases and functional status among older patients admitted to the geriatric ward in Taiwan. A descriptive correlational design was used and data of 401 patients were retrospectively collected for analysis. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed for all patients, which included the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, the Barthel Index, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. The Tobit model was used to manage censoring data, and hierarchical logistic regressions were conducted to determine the relationships among nutrition status, functional status and comorbid conditions. A significant mediating effect of nutritional status on the relationship between multimorbidity and functional status was found. Although multimorbidity, nutritional status, and functional status are usually interlinked in geriatric care, results of this study showed that nutritional intervention may play a stronger role in improving functional status of older patients admitted for acute geriatric services. Further intervention study is needed to confirm the mediating role of nutritional status between comorbidity and functional status for older patients.

552	Screening For Frailty In Primary Care: A Systematic Review Of The Psychometric Properties Of The Frailty Index In Community-Dwelling Older People	2014	663	10.1186/1471-2318-14-27	24597624	WOS:000333087800001	49	14		nan	Background: To better accommodate for the complex care needs of frail, older people, general practitioners must be capable of easily identifying frailty in daily clinical practice, for example, by using the frailty index (FI). To explore whether the FI is a valid and adequate screening instrument for primary care, we conducted a systematic review of its psychometric properties. Methods: We searched the Cochrane, PubMed and Embase databases and included original studies focusing on the criterion validity, construct validity and responsiveness of the FI when applied in community-dwelling older people. We evaluated the quality of the studies included using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. This systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA statement. Results: Of the twenty studies identified, eighteen reported on FIs derived from research data, one reported upon an FI derived from an administrative database of home-care clients, and one reported upon an FI derived from routine primary care data. In general, the FI showed good criterion and construct validity but lacked studies on responsiveness. When compared with studies that used data gathered for research purposes, there are indications that the FI mean score and range might be different in datasets using routine primary care data; however, this finding needs further investigation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the FI is a valid frailty screening instrument. However, further research using routine Electronic Medical Record data is necessary to investigate whether the psychometric properties of the FI are generalizable to a primary care setting and to facilitate its interpretation and implementation in daily clinical practice.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	49	Bmc Geriatrics		663	drubbel,irene	drubbel	irene
553	Pilot Trial Of Stop Delirium! (Pitstop) - A Complex Intervention To Prevent Delirium In Care Homes For Older People: Study Protocol For A Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial	2014	664	10.1186/1745-6215-15-47	24495514	WOS:000333468700001	59	15		nan	Background: Delirium (or acute confusion) is a serious illness common in older people, in which a person's thinking and perceptions may be affected. Reducing delirium is important because of the considerable distress it causes, and the poor outcomes associated with it, such as increased admissions to hospital, falls, mortality and costs to the National Health Service (NHS). Preventing delirium is possible using multicomponent interventions; successful interventions in hospitals have reduced it by one-third. However, there is little research to guide practice in care homes, where it is common because of the clustering of known risk factors (older age, frailty, and dementia). In previous work we developed a multicomponent intervention to prevent delirium in care homes, called Stop Delirium! The intervention was based upon evidence from the research literature relating to the prevention of delirium and on strategies to change professional practice. Before starting a large costly trial of Stop Delirium!, this pilot study will test and help improve the design and feasibility of the trial protocol. Methods/Design: We plan to conduct a cluster randomised pilot trial in 14 care homes (independent residential and nursing). Following recruitment of residents (over 60 years, consenting or with consultee agreement, able to communicate in English, and not in palliative care) participating homes will be randomised, stratified by size of home and proportion of residents with dementia. Stop Delirium! will be delivered to intervention homes over 16 months, with controls receiving usual care. The primary outcome measure will be the presence of delirium on any day during a one-month post-intervention period. We will collect data to determine 1) recruitment and attrition rates, 2) feasibility of various outcomes measurements, and 3) feasibility of capturing health resource use (resident diaries and by examining health records). We will estimate the between-cluster variation for the primary outcome, delirium occurrence. Discussion: This pilot study will refine methods for the definitive trial. The lessons learnt will also contribute to implementing National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) delirium guidelines, which recommend multicomponent interventions for delirium prevention.

554	Evidence-Informed Guidelines For Treating Frail Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: From The Diabetes Care Program Of Nova Scotia (Dcpns) And The Palliative And Therapeutic Harmonization (Path) Program	2013	666	10.1016/j.jamda.2013.08.002	24074961	WOS:000326296000006	570	14	11	801	Clinical practice guidelines specific to the medical care of frail older adults have yet to be widely disseminated. Because of the complex conditions associated with frailty, guidelines for frail older patients should be based on careful consideration of the characteristics of this population, balanced against the benefits and harms associated with treatment. In response to this need, the Diabetes Care Program of Nova Scotia (DCPNS) collaborated with the Palliative and Therapeutic Harmonization (PATH) program to develop and disseminate guidelines for the treatment of frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The DCPNS/PATH guidelines are unique in that they recommend the following: 1. Maintain HbA1c at or above 8% rather than below a specific level, in keeping with the conclusion that lower HbA1c levels are associated with increased hypoglycemic events without accruing meaningful benefit for frail older adults with type 2 diabetes. The guideline supports a wide range of acceptable HbA1c targets so that treatment decisions can focus on whether to aim for HbA1c levels between 8% and 9% or within a higher range (ie,> 9% and < 12%) based on individual circumstances and symptoms. 2. Simplify treatment by administering basal insulin alone and avoiding administration of regular and rapid-acting insulin when feasible. This recommendation takes into account the variations in oral intake that are commonly associated with frailty. 3. Use neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin instead of long-acting insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine (Lantus) or insulin detemir (Levemir), as insulin analogues do not appear to provide clinically meaningful benefit but are significantly more costly. 4. With acceptance of more liberalized blood glucose targets, there is no need for routine blood glucose testing when oral hypoglycemic medications or well-established doses of basal insulin (used alone) are not routinely changed as a result of blood glucose testing. Although these recommendations may appear radical, they are based on careful review of research findings.

555	A Nurse-Led Interdisciplinary Primary Care Approach To Prevent Disability Among Community-Dwelling Frail Older People: A Large-Scale Process Evaluation	2013	670	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.12.016	23384696	WOS:000322938400006	111	50	9	1184	Background: The complex healthcare needs of frail older people and their increased risk of disability require an integrated and proactive approach. In the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary primary care approach has recently been developed, involving individualized assessment and interventions (tailor-made care), case management and long-term follow-up. The practice nurse as part of a general practice is case manager and plans, organizes and monitors the care process and facilitates cooperation between professionals. The approach has shown positive indications regarding its feasibility in a small pilot, but its implementation on a large scale had not hitherto been investigated. Objectives: To examine the extent to which the interdisciplinary care approach is implemented as planned and to gain insight into healthcare professionals' and frail older people's experiences regarding the benefits, burden, stimulating factors and barriers. Design: A process evaluation was conducted using a mixed methods design. Settings: Six GP practices in the south of the Netherlands. Participants: Practice nurses (n = 7), GPs (n = 12), occupational therapists (n = 6) and physical therapists (n = 20) participated in the process evaluation. Furthermore, 194 community-dwelling frail older people (>= 70 years) were included using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. People who were terminally ill, were confined to bed, had severe cognitive or psychological impairments or were unable to communicate in Dutch were excluded. Methods: Quantitative data (logbooks and evaluation forms) were collected from all the participating frail older people and 13 semi-structured interviews with a selection of them were conducted. In addition, data from healthcare professionals were collected through 12 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions. Results: Although some parts of the protocol were insufficiently executed, healthcare professionals and frail older people were satisfied with the care approach, as it provided a useful structure for the delivery of geriatric primary care and increased the attention to preventive treatment. Frail older people felt acknowledged by healthcare professionals and experienced support in handling their problems and fulfilling their wishes. Conclusions: The findings of the study revealed several positive aspects of the interdisciplinary primary care approach. Given its complexity, the implementation of the nurse-led interdisciplinary care approach is challenging and some parts of the protocol need special attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

556	Exploring Conflict Between Caregiving And Work For Caregivers Of Elders With Dementia: A Cross-Sectional, Correlational Study	2013	673	10.1111/j.1365-2648.2012.06092.x	22776026	WOS:000316810400006	52	69	5	1051	Aim To report the moderating effects of work-related conditions and interactive family-care-giving variables, including mutuality and preparedness, on caregiver role strain and mental health for family caregivers of patients with dementia. Background Few studies have examined the interrelationships among caregivers' working conditions, care-giving dynamics and caregiver well-being. Design Cross-sectional, correlational study. Methods Data were collected by self-completed questionnaires from 176 primary family caregivers of patients with dementia in Taiwan from May 2005January 2006. Caregiver role strain and mental health were analysed by multiple regressions using a hierarchical method to enter independent variables and two- and three-way interaction terms after controlling for caregiver age and gender, employment status, and work flexibility and the simple effect of each independent variable. Results More preparedness was associated with less role strain for family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict. More care-giving demand was associated with poorer mental health only for caregivers with low work/care-giving conflict and with average and low preparedness, but not high preparedness. For family caregivers with less work/care-giving conflict, more preparedness decreased role strain and maintained mental health even when care-giving demand was high. Conclusion These results provide a knowledge base for understanding complex family caregiver phenomena and serve as a guide for developing interventions. Future studies with longitudinal follow-ups are suggested to explore actual causal relationships.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	673	wang,yu-nu	wang	yu-nu
557	Older Persons' Transitions In Care (Optic): A Study Protocol	2012	675	10.1186/1471-2318-12-75	23241360	WOS:000315579200001	49	12		nan	Background: Changes in health status, triggered by events such as infections, falls, and geriatric syndromes, are common among nursing home (NH) residents and necessitate transitions between NHs and Emergency Departments (EDs). During transitions, residents frequently experience care that is delayed, unnecessary, not evidence-based, potentially unsafe, and fragmented. Furthermore, a high proportion of residents and their family caregivers report substantial unmet needs during transitions. This study is part of a program of research whose overall aim is to improve quality of care for frail older adults who reside in NHs. The purpose of this study is to identify successful transitions from multiple perspectives and to identify organizational and individual factors related to transition success, in order to inform improvements in care for frail elderly NH residents during transitions to and from acute care. Specific objectives are to: 1. define successful and unsuccessful elements of transitions from multiple perspectives; 2. develop and test a practical tool to assess transition success; 3. assess transition processes in a discrete set of transfers in two study sites over a one year period; 4. assess the influence of organizational factors in key practice locations, e.g., NHs, emergency medical services (EMS), and EDs, on transition success; and 5. identify opportunities for evidence-informed management and quality improvement decisions related to the management of NH - ED transitions. Methods/Design: This is a mixed-methods observational study incorporating an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) approach. It uses data from multiple levels (facility, care unit, individual) and sources (healthcare providers, residents, health records, and administrative databases). Discussion: Key to study success is operationalizing the IKT approach by using a partnership model in which the OPTIC governance structure provides for team decision-makers and researchers to participate equally in developing study goals, design, data collection, analysis and implications of findings. As preliminary and ongoing study findings are developed, their implications for practice and policy in study settings will be discussed by the research team and shared with study site administrators and staff. The study is designed to investigate the complexities of transitions and to enhance the potential for successful and sustained improvement of these transitions.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	49	Bmc Geriatrics		675	cummings,greta g	cummings	greta g
558	Standards Of Medical Care For Nursing Home Residents In Europe	2012	676	10.1016/j.eurger.2012.07.455		WOS:000312744700007	662	3	6	365	Objective: Nursing home inhabitants represent the most vulnerable and frail group of older people. They have more complex medical backgrounds and more significant care requirements. With an ever-ageing European population, the number of people requiring nursing home care will only increase. It is important then that we optimise the medical care of older people living in nursing homes. Methods: Formalized care standards are essential to optimal care but we feel that such guidelines are lacking. We decided to investigate this by means of a survey on nursing home care standards sent to the geriatric medicine societies around Europe. Results: Only five of 25 (20%) health services have a requirement for specific training in geriatric medicine for doctors in nursing homes, while only three of 25 (12%) countries have written medical care standards applicable to nursing home care provided by professional organizations. Four of 25 (16%) had a nursing home doctor society and one of these, The Netherlands, provided written medical care standards for nursing homes which were also adopted by the relevant general practitioner society. Discussion: The Europe-wide deficiency of documented care standards for nursing homes is alarming. It should be a prerequisite that physicians dealing with these complex patients have undertaken some level of specific training in geriatric medicine. It is important that geriatricians, old age psychiatrists and family doctors across European countries engage more formally on the development of appropriate models for both developing care standards and specifying appropriate training and support for doctors working in nursing homes.

559	Differentiating Frailty In Older People Using The Swedish Ambulance Service: A Retrospective Audit	2012	677	10.1016/j.ienj.2011.09.005	23084511	WOS:000208853400007	677	20	4	228	The elderly population in Sweden is increasing. This will lead to an increased need for healthcare resources and put extra demands on healthcare professionals. Consequently, ambulance personnel will be faced with the challenge of meeting extra demands from increasing numbers of older people with complex and atypical clinical presentations. Therefore we highlight that great problems exist for ambulance personnel to understand and meet these patients' care needs. Using a caring science approach, we apply the patient's perspective, and the aim of this study is to identify and illuminate the conditions that affect elderly people assessed with the assessment category general affected health condition. Thus, we have analyzed the characteristics belonging to this specific condition. The method is a retrospective audit, involving a qualitative content analysis of a total of 88 emergency service records. The conclusion is that by using caring science, the concept of frailty which is based on a comprehensive understanding of human life can clarify the state of general affected health condition, as either illness or ill-health. This offers a new assessment category and outlines care and treatment that strengthen and support the health and wellbeing of the individual elderly person. Furthermore, the concept of frailty ought to be included in The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

560	Residents' Experiences Of Interpersonal Factors In Nursing Home Care: A Qualitative Study	2011	680	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.05.012	21696735	WOS:000297403000007	111	48	11	1357	Background: With life expectancy lengthening, the number of those who will require care in a nursing home will increase dramatically in the next 20 years. Nursing home residents are frail older adults with complex needs, dependent on advanced nursing care. Long-term residents in nursing homes have long-term relationships with the nurses, which require a unique approach to the interpersonal aspects of nursing care. Understanding what is experienced as care quality, including quality of interpersonal processes, requires insight into the residents' perspectives for best value in care to be realized. Objective: Main objective was to describe the nursing home residents' experience with direct nursing care, related to the interpersonal aspects of quality of care. Design: A descriptive, exploratory design was used. Settings: Four public municipal nursing homes in Norway with long-term residents were purposely selected for the study. Participants: Fifteen mentally lucid residents were included. The inclusion criteria were aged 65 and over, being a resident of the nursing home for one month or longer, and physical and mental capacity to participate in the interview. Method: In-depth interviews with the residents were performed. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using meaning categorizing. Results: The residents emphasized the importance of nurses acknowledging their individual needs, which included need for general and specialized care, health promotion and prevention of complications, and prioritizing the individuals. The challenging balance between self-determination and dependency, the altered role from homeowner to resident, and feelings of indignity and depreciation of social status were key issues in which the residents perceived that their integrity was at risk in the patient-nurse interaction and care. Psychosocial well-being was a major issue, and the residents expressed an important role of the nursing staff helping them to balance the need for social contact and to be alone, and preserving a social network. Conclusions: Quality nursing care in nursing home implies a balanced, individual approach to medical, physical and psychosocial care, including interpersonal aspects of care. The interpersonal relationship between resident and nurse implies long-term commitment, reciprocal relationship on a personal level and interpersonal competence of the nurses to understand each resident's needs.

Physicians play a pivotal role in the rehabilitation, complex medical care, and end-of-life care of this frail and vulnerable population. The reasons for admission are multifactorial and a comprehensive care plan based on the Minimum Data Set guides the multidisciplinary nursing home team in the care of the patient and provides assessments of the quality of care provided. Using the cases of 2 patients with different experiences, we describe the physician's role in planning for admission, participating as a team member in the ongoing assessment and care in the nursing home, and guiding care at the end of life. The increasing population of older adults has also promoted community-based and residential alternatives to traditional nursing homes. The future of longterm care will include additional challenges and rich innovations in services and options for older adults.

Currently, most of their treatment guidelines have been adapted from studies conducted in younger patients. However, studies have shown that breast cancer in the elderly have distinctive biological characteristics from the young. Also, older patients have different needs from younger patients including increased frailty, decreased functional status, comorbidities, polypharmacy, cognition, psychosocial support and nutrition. These should be assessed appropriately to take into account their daily function and quality of life. A comprehensive geriatric assessment could help identify pre-treatment risk factors and could guide clinical decision making, improving morbidity and prognosis. We describe a potential set up for a dedicated multidisciplinary-led elderly breast cancer clinic to provide the assessment, review and management of this distinctive set of patients.

563	Perspective: Autonomic Care Systems For Hospitalized Patients	2009	687	10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181bf9bfd	19940580	WOS:000207786300020	687	84	12	1727	With advancements of medical technology and improved diagnostic and treatment options, children with severe birth defects who would otherwise have no chance of surviving post birth survive to go home every day. The average lifespan in the United States has increased substantially over the last century. These successes and many other medical breakthroughs in managing complex illnesses, particularly in frail, elderly patients, have resulted in an increasing percentage of patients with comorbidities. This, coupled with a policy change by Medicare (i.e., Medicare will no longer reimburse hospitals for costs associated with treating preventable errors and injuries that a patient acquires while in the hospital), creates an enormous challenge to health care providers. To meet the challenge, the authors propose a new model of health care-the autonomic care system (ACS)-a concept derived from the intensive care unit and the autonomic computing initiative in the computer industry. Using wound care as an example, the authors examine the necessity, feasibility, design, and challenges related to ACS. Specifically, they discuss the role of the human operator, the potential combination of ACS and existing hospital information technology (e.g., electronic medical records and computerized provider order entry), and the costs associated with ACS. ACS may serve as a roadmap to revamp the health care system, bringing down the barriers among different specialties and improving the quality of care for each problem for all hospitalized patients.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	687	Academic Medicine		687	goldschmidt-clermont,pascal j	goldschmidt-clermont	pascal j
564	A Case Study Of An Ambient Living And Wellness Management Health Care Model In Australia	2009	690			WOS:000270130800007	690	5597		48	The QSHI (Queensland Smart Home Initiative) consortium was established in Queensland Australia in 2006 for the purpose of promoting a model of health care based on ambient living and wellness management. This model was based on the adoption of smart home and intelligent assistive technologies. A technology research and development program was also established to promote independent living, improved quality of life and reduced unnecessary hospital admissions for the frail elderly, chronic illness sufferers and people with disabilities. The consortium joined the technology industry, care providers, government and researchers to a collaborative Research & Development program to assist people and their families. The first Phase has been completed and on-going streams of research have been established. These included the establishment of a demonstrator Smart Home in a residential retirement and aged care complex in a metropolitan setting in Queensland, Australia. This paper reports on the development of the model and outlines the project scope and experiences, the outcomes and learnings achieved, and details the planning considerations for future developments.		2021-07-02 01:31:14	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	690	Ambient Assistive Health And Wellness Management In The Heart Of The City, Proceeding		690	soar,jeffrey	soar	jeffrey
565	Who Cares For Older People With Mental Illness? A Survey Of Residential Aged Care Facilities In The Australian Capital Territory: Implications For Mental Health Nursing	2007	692	10.1111/j.1447-0349.2007.00482.x	17845552	WOS:000208493300005	692	16	5	327	Residential aged care facilities are increasingly becoming locations wherein the most frail and older people with mental illness live out the remainder of their lives, yet it has become apparent in recent years that these institutions are fraught with a variety of social and clinical problems. One issue of concern has been the exodus of registered nurses (both general and psychiatric), who have been increasingly replaced by carers with little or no expertise in psychiatric illness or disorders of cognitive decline. This 'de-professionalizing' of aged care has important implications for the well-being of clients, particularity those with complex mental health problems. In this survey we sought to discover demographic information concerning those who provide front-line care to this population of aged Australians, and we sought also to ascertain how much education in caring for residents who suffer specifically from neurodegenerative disorders (the dementias) and mental illness was provided by the facilities to those who care for such older people. The lack of training in the areas of mental health and cognitive impairment raises a variety of issues that mental health nurses need to address. These issues cover clinical, professional, and social justice dimensions. We believe that mental health nurses are strategically and professionally placed to take a leadership role in raising the profile of aged care in this country and they need to act proactively to secure the well-being of this particularly vulnerable client group.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	692	International Journal Of Mental Health Nursing	1	692	jones,tony s	jones	tony s
566	Factors Influencing The Speed Of Cancer Diagnosis In Rural Western Australia: A General Practice Perspective	2007	693	10.1186/1471-2296-8-27	17480219	WOS:000246530400001	557	8		nan	Introduction: The speed of diagnosis impacts on prognosis and survival in all types of cancer. In most cases survival and prognosis are significantly worse in rural and remote Australian populations who have less access to diagnostic and therapeutic services than metropolitan communities in this country. Research suggests that in general delays in diagnosis were a factor of misdiagnosis, the confounding effect of existing conditions and delayed or misleading investigation of symptoms. The aim of this study is to further explore the factors that impact on the speed of diagnosis in rural Western Australia with direct reference to General Practitioners (GPs) working in this setting. Methods: The methodology consisted of a structured discussion of specific cases. GPs based in two rural locations in Western Australia were asked to identify up to eight clinical cases for discussion. A diversity of cases was requested encompassing those with timely and delayed diagnosis of cancer. Focus groups were held with the practitioners to identify which factors under six headings delayed or facilitated the diagnosis in each case. A structured summary of the discussion was relayed to a wider group of GPs to seek additional views or comments on specific factors that impact on the speed of cancer diagnosis in rural and remote locations in Australia. Results: A number of factors affecting the speed of diagnosis were identified: the demographic shift towards a frailer and older population, presenting with multiple and complex diseases, increases the challenge to identify early cancer symptoms; seasonal and demanding work patterns leading to procrastination in presenting for medical care; unhelpful scheduling of specialist appointments; and the varying impact of informal networks and social relationships. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study we have generated a number of hypotheses that require formal evaluation: ( 1) GPs working within informal professional and social networks are better informed about their patients' health needs and have an advantage in making early diagnosis; ( 2) Despite the other differences in the population characteristics decentralising services would improve the prospect for timely diagnosis; and ( 3) Careful coordination of specialist appointments would improve the speed of diagnosis for rural patients.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	557	Bmc Family Practice		693	jiwa,moyez	jiwa	moyez
567	Nutritional Status, Well-Being And Functional Ability In Frail Elderly Service Flat Residents	2005	696	10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602067	15483631	WOS:000226690200014	696	59	2	263	Objective: To investigate nutritional status and its relationship to cognition, well-being, functional ability and energy intake in frail elderly service flat residents. Design: Cross-sectional and prospective study. Setting: Two municipal service flat complexes. Subjects: A total of 80 residents (median age 85.5 (79-90) y) with regular home care assistance participated. A subgroup of 35 residents took part in a re-examination 1 y later. Methods: Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Barthel Index and Health Index were used for the evaluation of nutritional, cognitive and ADL function and well-being, respectively. Results: In all, 30% of the frail and chronically ill service flat residents were assessed as malnourished and 59% were at risk of malnutrition. The malnourished residents had worse cognitive conditions (P < 0.001) and well-being (P < 0.05), lower functional ability (P < 0.01) and they had a greater need for daily assistance (P < 0.05) than the other residents. The median night fast period was 14.0 (12.5-15.0) h. Five subjects classified as malnourished at baseline had lost a median of -9.6 kg (range -11.0 to +7.3 kg) (P < 0.05) in body weight at the 1-y follow-up, which contrasted significantly from the weight stability in residents classified as at risk for malnutrition or well-nourished. Conclusion: Out of 10 residents, nine were assessed to have impending nutritional problems that related to impaired wellbeing, cognition, and functional ability. Malnourished residents had a significant weight loss over one year. Studies are needed to determine whether weight loss and nutrition-related dysfunction in service flat residents are preventable or treatable.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	696	European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition		696	olin,ao	olin	ao
568	Withholding Antibiotic Treatment In Pneumonia Patients With Dementia - A Quantitative Observational Study	2002	698	10.1001/archinte.162.15.1753	12153379	WOS:000177283900012	698	162	15	1753	Background: Pneumonia is a life-threatening disease in nursing home patients with dementia. Physicians and families face choices about whether to withhold antibiotics when patients are expected to die soon or when treatment may be burdensome. However, little information exists on what factors influence this complex decision-making process. Objective: To identify factors associated with decisions on whether to withhold curative antibiotic treatment in patients with dementia who have pneumonia. Methods: We performed an observational cohort study with 3-month monitoring for cure and death. Patients with pneumonia (N = 706) were enrolled in nursing home units for patients with dementia from all over the Netherlands (61 nursing homes). Characteristics of patients, physicians, and facilities were related to the outcome of withholding antibiotic treatment. Results: In 23% of the patients, antibiotic treatment was withheld. The other patients received antibiotics with palliative (8%) or curative (69%) intent. Compared with the patients who received antibiotics with curative intent, patients in whom antibiotic treatment was withheld had more severe dementia, had more severe pneumonia, had lower food and fluid intake, and were more often dehydrated. In addition, withholding antibiotics occurred more often in the summer and in patients with an initial episode of pneumonia. Characteristics of facilities and physicians were unrelated to the decision. However, considerable variation occurred in how patient age, aspiration, and history of pneumonia were related to decision making by individual physicians. Conclusions: In the Netherlands, antibiotic treatment is commonly withheld in pneumonia patients with severe dementia who are especially frail. Understanding the circumstances in which this occurs can illuminate the international discussion of appropriate dementia care.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	698	Archives Of Internal Medicine		698	van der steen,jt	van der steen	jt

The patient is assessed simultaneously by different disciplines to develop a holistic and practical plan of care. It is termed arena assessment, borrowing from the pediatric literature on transdisciplinary assessment of children. The article explores the benefits and limitations of this approach for patients and families, as well as for professional learners.

Although much has been written about how health professionals and family caregivers should relate to one another, we know very little about the relationships that develop between them. Using data from a qualitative study, this article illustrates that relationships between community nurses and family members caring for frail elders are complex. dynamic, and multifaceted. Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient. Each type is described, and implications for nursing practice and research are discussed.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	2	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	701	Advances In Nursing Science	1	701	ward-griffin,c	ward-griffin	c
571	Nursing Case Management For Psychogeriatric Patients And Their Families - Description Of A Clinical Model	1998	702		9719696	WOS:000076118400012	702	33	3	529	A theoretical model of clinical case management for psychogeriatric patients and their families is described. Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively with members of a multidisciplinary team.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	1	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	702	Nursing Clinics Of North America	1	702	borgermans,lad	borgermans	lad
572	Handle With Care - Considerations And Approaches To Nursing The Frail Older Person	1995	703			WOS:A1995TF62200007	699	11	2	44	As society ages, a challenge is presented to health care providers. The increased population of frail older persons, those over 85 years of age, poses a complexity of needs and concerns. The registered nurse is often called upon to be the coordinator of the team of health professionals striving to meet the needs of frail older patients. This article examines implications for the nursing care of the frail older person, using the nursing process. It also examines and considers interdisciplinary rehabilitative interventions appropriate for this population. Case studies are used to compare and contrast approaches for frail older persons in the home and in institutional settings.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	699	Topics In Geriatric Rehabilitation		703	dennehy,ma	dennehy	ma
573	Discharge Planning - Issues And Challenges For Gerontological Nursing - A Critique Of The Literature	1994	705	10.1111/j.1365-2648.1994.tb01112.x	8014310	WOS:A1994NB47100012	52	19	3	492	Families are rapidly becoming unpaid givers of complex care. Using McKeehan & Coulton's systems model, this critique reviews the evolution of the structure and processes of discharge planning programmes. It explores three common assumptions: discharge planning programmes are cost-effective, allow for enhancement of patients' and families' quality of life, and ensure continuity of care between hospital and community. Funds are saved due to decreased lengths of initial hospital admissions and readmission rates. However, the cost of additional hospital and community resources is rarely considered. Little evidence supports the concept that discharge planning directly affects a patient's health status. Patients and families often do not perceive the same level of benefit from discharge planning as do health professionals. Several issues surrounding research methodologies used in the reviewed studies are identified. Of particular concern is the lack of qualitative research into patients' and families' experiences. The critique concludes with an exploration of ethical issues and challenges arising from increased emphasis on cost-effective discharge planning. These include patients' rights, provision of sufficient human, social and financial resources, improved hospital-community communications, and control over hospital-developed but community-implemented programmes.		2021-07-02 01:31:15	0	complexityorcomplextiorabandallaging_onlynursing_2021.06.24.xls	1	52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	705	jackson,mf	jackson	mf
574	Quality Of Life Of Older Persons In Nursing Homes After The Implementation Of A Knowledge-Based Palliative Care Intervention.	2019	707	10.1111/opn.12258	31298499		33	14	4	e12258	BACKGROUND: The goals of palliative care are to relieve suffering and promote quality of life. Palliative care for older persons has been less prioritised than palliative care for younger people with cancer, which may lead to unnecessary suffering and decreased quality of life at the final stage of life. AIM: To evaluate whether a palliative care intervention had any influence on the perceived quality of life of older persons (≥65 years). METHODS: This study was conducted as a complex intervention performed with an experimental crossover design. The intervention was implemented in 20 nursing homes, with a six-month intervention period in each nursing home. Twenty-three older persons (≥65 years) in the intervention group and 29 in the control group were interviewed using the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD questionnaires at both baseline and follow-up. The collected data were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare paired data between baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: In the intervention group, no statistically significant increases in quality of life were found. This result contrasted with the control group, which revealed statistically significant declines in quality of life at both the dimension and item levels. Accordingly, this study showed a trend of decreased health after nine months in both the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: It is reasonable to believe that quality of life decreases with age as part of the natural course of the ageing process. However, it seems that the palliative care approach of the intervention prevented unnecessary quality of life decline by supporting sensory abilities, autonomy and social participation among older persons in nursing homes. From the ageing perspective, it may not be realistic to strive for an increased quality of life in older people living in nursing homes; maybe the goal should be to delay or prevent reduced quality of life. Based on this perspective, the intervention prevented decline in quality of life in nursing home residents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The high number of deaths shows the importance to identify palliative care needs in older persons at an early stage to prevent or delay deterioration of quality of life.		2021-07-02 01:32:47	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	707	bökberg,christina	Bökberg	Christina

METHODS: It is a concept analysis, guided by the method proposed by Walker and Avant, made operational through an integrative literature review. The search in a scientific database was carried out using the descriptors: Frail elderly, syndrome, phenotype, geriatric assessment, and aging. The literary corpus comprised 66 studies. RESULTS: The study found the antecedents and attributes (categorized as physical, sociodemographic, and behavioral/environmental) that integrate the signs and symptoms evidenced in the ""frailty syndrome,"" as well as the consequences of this concept. The variables were analyzed with emphasis on the conceptions that influence the frailty process of the elderly. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the complexity arising from the multifactorial genesis of the referred syndrome, emphasizing the specificities of the elderly's frailty.

576	Initiating End-Of-Life Care At The Emergency Department: An Observational Study.	2019	709	10.1177/1049909119836931	30862168		47	36	11	941	OBJECTIVE: Terminally ill patients at their end-of-life (EOL) phase attending the emergency department (ED) may have complex and specialized care needs frequently overlooked by ED physicians. To tailor to the needs of this unique group, the ED in a tertiary hospital implemented an EOL pathway since 2014. The objective of our study is to describe the epidemiological characteristics, symptom burden and management of patients using a protocolized management care bundle. METHODS: We conducted an observational study on the database of EOL patients over a 28-month period. Patients aged 21 years and above, who attended the ED and were managed according to these guidelines, were included. Clinical data were extracted from the hospital's electronic medical records system. RESULTS: Two hundred five patients were managed under the EOL pathway, with a slight male predominance (106/205, 51.7%) and a median age of 78 (interquartile range 69-87) years. The majority were chronically frail (42.0%) or diagnosed with cancer or other terminal illnesses (32.7%). The 3 most commonly experienced symptoms were drowsiness (66.3%), dyspnea (61.5%), and fever (29.7%). Through the protocolized management care bundle, 74.1% of patients with dyspnea and/or pain received opiates while 59.5% with copious secretions received hyoscine butylbromide for symptomatic relief. CONCLUSION: The institution of a protocolized care bundle is feasible and provides ED physicians with a guide in managing EOL patients. Though still suboptimal, considerable advances in EOL care at the ED have been achieved and may be further improved through continual education and enhancements in the care bundle.		2021-07-02 01:32:47	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		47	The American Journal Of Hospice & Palliative Care		709	chor,wei.ping.daniel	Chor	Wei Ping Daniel

To approach this new and growing scenario of care for the elderly, the formal health and social care systems must define specific jobs for geriatric nursing specialists trained to address the needs of older people from a perspective of comprehensive care, both for healthy aging, and for the different health problems of this population group, characterized by the consequences of aging and chronicity, towards dependence, and develop the powers established by law in the framework of an interdisciplinary team, for those who have been trained and accredited, thus adding value to the response that health systems have to provide for this growing problem of the 'aging-chronicity-dependence' triad.		2021-07-02 01:32:47	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		710	Enfermeria Clinica (English Edition)		710	viña-garcía-bericua,maría	Viña-García-Bericua	María
578	Nurse Practitioners' Role In Improving Service For Elderly Trauma Patients.	2019	721	10.1097/JTN.0000000000000445	31283744		721	26	4	174	Preexisting conditions and decreased physiological reserve in the elderly frequently complicate the provision of health care in this population. A Level 1 trauma center expanded its nurse practitioner (NP) model to facilitate admission of low-acuity patients, including the elderly, to trauma services. This model enabled NPs to initiate admissions and coordinate day-to-day care for low-acuity patients under the supervision of a trauma attending. The complexity of elderly trauma care and the need to evaluate the efficacy of management provided by NPs led to the development of the current study. Accordingly, this study endeavored to compare outcomes in elderly patients whose care was coordinated by trauma NP (TNP) versus nontrauma NP (NTNP) services. Patients under the care of TNPs had a 1.22-day shorter duration of hospitalization compared with that of the NTNP cohort (4.38 ± 3.54 vs. 5.60 ± 3.98, p = .048). Decreased length of stay in the TNP cohort resulted in an average decrease in hospital charges of $13,000 per admission ($38,053 ± $29,640.76 vs. $51,317.79 ± $34,756.83, p = .016). A significantly higher percentage of patients admitted to the TNP service were discharged home (67.1% vs. 36.0%, p = .002), and a significantly lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (25.7% vs. 51.9%, p = .040). These clinical and economic outcomes have proven beneficial in substantiating the care provided by TNPs at the study institution. Future research will focus on examining the association of positive outcomes with specific care elements routinely performed by the TNPs in the current practice model.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		721	Journal Of Trauma Nursing: The Official Journal Of The Society Of Trauma Nurses	1	721	bethea,audis	Bethea	Audis
579	Enteral Nutrition For Older Adults In Nursing Facilities.	2011	723	10.1177/0884533611405794	21586411		723	26	3	261	Older adults who reside in nursing facilities tend to be frail and to have multiple comorbidities, increased risk of unintended weight loss, and protein energy malnutrition. Approximately 5.8% of nursing facility residents in the United States receive enteral feedings. The prevalence is higher for residents with cognitive impairment, ranging from 18% to 34%. In cognitively impaired residents, the majority of tube feeding placements occur in the acute care setting and result in significant use of additional healthcare resources and high postinsertion mortality rates within 60 days of insertion. Nursing facilities must abide by state and federal regulations and undergo stringent survey evaluation while balancing complex decisions related to initial placement of feeding tubes. Informed choice, resident-centered care decisions, and the role of advance directives are essential in the decision-making process. In nursing facilities, it is often the registered dietitian who alerts the healthcare team to determine whether a feeding tube is appropriate. Once a tube is placed, healthcare practitioners must make careful decisions related to ordering, administering, and monitoring enteral nutrition (EN) delivery; adequacy of nutritional content; tolerance to feedings; monitoring for potential complications; and the possibility of return to oral feeding or, conversely, the decision to discontinue feedings. Further evidence-based research is needed to document effectiveness, along with research to support positive outcomes for residents in nursing facilities who receive EN. Optimal care requires careful coordination and an interdisciplinary approach across the continuum of care and between caregivers within the individual nursing facility.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		723	Nutrition In Clinical Practice: Official Publication Of The American Society For Parenteral And Enteral Nutrition		723	dorner,becky	Dorner	Becky

Limited research exists on why, when, and how Amish older adults and their caregivers experience health care services outside of their family and community. The purpose of the current study was to describe and explore the perspectives of Amish caregivers caring for older adults and their experiences with health care services outside of their community. A qualitative phenomenological research design was used in combination with a community-based participatory framework with caregivers in a small, rural Amish settlement. Amish caregiving of older adults is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by cultural characteristics. Caregivers place significant cultural value on home caregiving, emphasize the experience as a blessing, and relate misunderstandings between themselves and outside health care providers as significant concerns.

582	Attributes Of Person-Centred Communication: A Qualitative Exploration Of Communication With Older Persons In Home Health Care.	2020	742	10.1111/opn.12284	31642182		33	15	1	e12284	BACKGROUND: Previous research points to challenges related to the home healthcare of older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although person-centred care has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home. METHODS: A descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the attributes of person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions. CONCLUSION: The nurses' attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. Implication for practice The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included in education and training.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		33	International Journal Of Older People Nursing	1	742	sundler,annelie.j	Sundler	Annelie J

A reduction in hospitalizations and improvement of quality of life are the primary goals in the management of heart failure. Evidence-based medicine provides clinicians with the best armamentarium to provide high quality and cost-effective care to patients diagnosed with this chronic, progressive, and debilitating condition. A multidisciplinary approach to care can be instrumental in the management of these complex patients. Further studies are warranted in elderly patients to provide the evidence for optimal therapies in this frail population.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		745	Director (Cincinnati, Ohio)	1	745	gaulden,laura	Gaulden	Laura

585	Profile And Results Of Frail Patient Assessed By Advanced Practice Nursing In An Emergency Department.	2018	749	10.1016/j.enfcli.2017.04.003	28583833		710	28	6	365	OBJECTIVES: To describe the profile of patients evaluated by Nurse Care Management in an Emergency Department and identify the type of alternative healthcare resource assigned and report the results of clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up, on admission to the Emergency Department in an acute hospital and on discharge from the alternative healthcare resource, of patients assessed by Nurse Care Management, from July to December 2015. The patient characteristics, social environment and results of clinical practice were studied. RESULTS: 190 patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 122 (59.8%) cases from the Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital and 1 (0.5%) died. Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with dementia, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative healthcare resource (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with advanced age, complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other patients. After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional capacity and present less polypharmacy.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		710	Enfermeria Clinica (English Edition)		749	solé-casals,montserrat	Solé-Casals	Montserrat
586	Revisiting Geriatric Failure To Thrive: A Complex And Compelling Clinical Condition.	2009	751	10.3928/00989134-20090101-08	19227099		60	35	1	18	Geriatric failure to thrive (GFTT) poses a complex clinical issue in gerontological nursing practice. GFTT is not a normal part of aging, nor is it an outcome of chronic illness. Rather, GFTT describes a lack of vitality and diminished capacity for life and outlines a process of functional decline that is often difficult to explain. The purpose of this article is to review GFTT, examine the literature on GFTT, and suggest strategies for the identification, assessment, and creative management of this complex condition that affects millions of older adults.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		60	Journal Of Gerontological Nursing	1	751	rocchiccioli,judith.townsend	Rocchiccioli	Judith Townsend
587	Increasing The Profile Of The Care Of The Older Person In The Ed: A Contemporary Nursing Challenge.	2008	752	10.1016/j.ienj.2008.05.005	18627799		677	16	3	152	The numbers of frail older persons using emergency departments are already considerable and will continue to increase over time. There are a number of issues related to the assessment and care of older patients that are significantly different to other patient groups. The traditional emergency department (ED) model focusing on rapid triage, treatment and throughput does not meet the needs of many older patients, who have complex presentations, and require comprehensive assessment and referral. In response to this, there are already a number of appropriate and innovative approaches to the care of the older patient demonstrated in the literature. Nurses have a crucial role in contributing to these approaches and in raising the profile of quality care of the older person. Some specific areas that ED nurses can focus on include a more comprehensive approach to assessment and discharge planning, improved communication with the patient and their personal carers, attention to basic nursing care, and making the physical environment safer and less stressful for the older patient. While developing collaborations with their aged care nursing colleagues is important, emergency nurses need to view care of the older person as a central part of their own core business.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		677	International Emergency Nursing	1	752	shanley,chris	Shanley	Chris
588	Professional And Family Caregivers' Attitudes Towards Involuntary Treatment In Community-Dwelling People With Dementia.	2019	755	10.1111/jan.13839	30168165		52	75	1	96	AIMS: The aim of this study was to gain insight into professional and family caregivers' attitudes towards involuntary treatment in community-dwelling people with dementia (PwD). BACKGROUND: The number of PwD with complex care needs living at home is increasing rapidly. In some situations, caregivers provide care against the will of PwD, referred to as involuntary treatment, which includes non-consensual care, psychotropic medication and physical restraints. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 228 professional (nursing staff, general practitioners (GPs) and other healthcare professionals such as physical therapists and psychologists) and 77 family caregivers of PwD completed the Maastricht Attitude Questionnaire-Home Care. This questionnaire measures attitudes towards involuntary treatment and perceived restrictiveness of and experienced discomfort in using involuntary treatment. Data were collected in the Netherlands between June and November 2016. RESULTS: Family caregivers and GPs had more positive attitudes towards involuntary treatment than nursing staff and other healthcare professionals, indicating that they are more accepting of involuntary treatment. A more positive attitude was associated with higher perceived caregiver burden and being a family caregiver. Family caregivers and GPs found the use of involuntary treatment less restrictive and indicated feeling more comfortable when using these measures. CONCLUSION: It is important to account for the differences in attitudes and foster dialogue among professional and family caregivers to find common ground about alternatives to involuntary treatment. These results will inform the development of an intervention that aims to prevent involuntary treatment in home care.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	755	mengelers,angela.m.h.j	Mengelers	Angela M H J
589	The Impact Of Medical Issues In Inpatient Geriatric Psychiatry.	2005	762	10.1080/01612840590883591	15842104		762	26	1	23	At an advanced age, serious medical and psychiatric illnesses frequently coalesce. Often, the need for admission to inpatient geriatric psychiatric care arises from coexisting medical problems. While cognitive and behavioral interventions are important, the complexity of physical comorbidities usually becomes the focus of hospitalization and requires intensive medical treatments. This paper describes adaptations made in one metropolitan geriatric psychiatry unit in order to better treat complex patients who experience both medical and psychiatric illness. The need for all members of the interdisciplinary team to expand their practice and the importance of complementary approaches of psychiatry and medicine are emphasized.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		762	Issues In Mental Health Nursing	1	762	inventor,ben.remor.e	Inventor	Ben Remor E

It was hypothesized that a diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and postponing problems resulting from inactivity.

591	Restraint-Free Care: How Does A Nurse Decide?	1996	764	10.3928/0098-9134-19960901-07	8975033		60	22	9	7	Decisions by nurses to avoid physical restraint use in older adults is a complex process that requires individualized, comprehensive assessment and creative problem-solving. Institutional and social policy increasingly support a standard of restraint elimination influencing care decisions with frail older adults. It has become clear that the decision to avoid or use physical restraint is influenced as well by nurses' attitude or beliefs about the efficacy of restraint. To further understand how decisions are made to avoid physical restraint, it is important to also explore the degree to which nurses possess knowledge, autonomy, and accountability in this decision-making process. Understanding how decisions are influenced will advance the development of restraint-free care interventions for older adults.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		60	Journal Of Gerontological Nursing	1	764	sullivan-marx,e.m	Sullivan-Marx	E M
592	Psychological Transition Into A Residential Care Facility: Older People'S Experiences.	2010	52	10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05280.x	20423358		52	66	5	1159	AIM: The aim of this paper is to discuss the complexity of admission into a residential care facility from a psychological perspective for residents and their relatives and the resulting implications for nursing care. BACKGROUND: Admission into a residential care facility can be a stressful time for older people, as well as for their relatives. Many relatives have requested continued, meaningful involvement in care in the home, and researchers have identified reasons why it is important to implement strategies for including relatives in care. DATA SOURCES: The background for the paper is published research from the year 2000 on relocation into nursing homes and psychological transitions. DISCUSSION: The concepts of transition from the theory of Personal Constructs are used to make sense of challenges faced by residents and their relatives. The psychological transition is experienced in very different ways by both residents and their relatives, and nurses can make a difference to how this major transition is experienced. However, nurses require improved communication strategies (based on the concepts of transition) that will support residents and their relatives during the admission phase. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses in residential care facilities need to develop communication strategies that will have a positive impact on the psychological transition that occurs when an older person is admitted into care. CONCLUSION: Improving the psychological health of older people moving into care should be an important goal for all nurses in residential care facilities. Using the theory of personal constructs as a guide, nurses can intervene to make this psychological transition a more positive experience.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		52	Journal Of Advanced Nursing	1	52	ellis,julie.m	Ellis	Julie M
593	Triaging Seniors In Health Crisis In The Emergency Department: A Three-Year Summary.	1996	776		8900636		776	20	3	8	"The ""geriatric triage"" approach for management of the most complex frail older adult population by geriatric nurses in the emergency department setting was a benefit to the patient/family and the health care system. The patients, through assessment and individualized plans of care, received the right care in the right setting. Seniors were assessed and their care planned by health care professionals who had geriatric knowledge, understood the complexity of their problems, and acted as their advocate. Geriatric triaging resulted in benefits across the health care system. Resources were used effectively. Patients received care in the most appropriate and cost-efficient setting. This new and creative approach served as a catalyst for improvement in services and care for the senior population. Health care workers in the hospitals as well as the community increased their knowledge of geriatrics through consultation with this service. The community and hospitals had a formal linkage, which provided an opportunity for collaboration and continuity of care. The hospital system experienced decreased competition for scarce acute care beds due to diverted admissions. The emergency department had consultants to assist with the decision-making for this high-risk population and decreased the number of patients held in emergency department awaiting an inpatient bed. The community system received patients with a comprehensive plan of care that provided creative and innovative care management strategies. Home care adapted its service to respond with immediate services to assist with health crises in addition to what had been traditionally available. The finding of this study supports a new approach to care of the elderly and chronically ill population who present to the emergency department in health crisis. Creative strategies are required to meet the needs of the aging population in these times of fiscal restraint. The nursing geriatric triage service is one strategy that holds merit."		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		776	Perspectives (Gerontological Nursing Association (Canada))	1	776	freeman,m	Freeman	M

Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility outcomes.		2021-07-02 01:32:48	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		783	The Journal Of Nursing Education	1	783	mcconnell,eleanor.s	McConnell	Eleanor S
596	Key Elements Of Optimal Treatment Decision-Making For Surgeons And Older Patients With Colorectal Or Pancreatic Cancer: A Qualitative Study.	2017	791	10.1016/j.pec.2016.10.013	28029569		791	100	3	473	OBJECTIVE: To identify key elements of optimal treatment decision-making for surgeons and older patients with colorectal (CRC) or pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: Six focus groups with different participants were performed: three with older CRC/PC patients and relatives, and three with physicians. Supplementary in-depth interviews were conducted in another seven patients. Framework analysis was used to identify key elements in decision-making. RESULTS: 23 physicians, 22 patients and 14 relatives participated. Three interacting components were revealed: preconditions, content and facilitators of decision-making. To provide optimal information about treatments' impact on an older patient's daily life, physicians should obtain an overall picture and take into account patients' frailty. Depending on patients' preferences and capacities, dividing decision-making into more sessions will be helpful and simultaneously emphasize patients' own responsibility. GPs may have a valuable contribution because of their background knowledge and supportive role. CONCLUSION: Stakeholders identified several crucial elements in the complex surgical decision-making of older CRC/PC patients. Structured qualitative research may also be of great help in optimizing other treatment directed decision-making processes. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Surgeons should be trained in examining preconditions and useful facilitators in decision-making in older CRC/PC patients to optimize its content and to improve the quality of shared care.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		791	Patient Education And Counseling	1	791	geessink,noralie.h	Geessink	Noralie H
597	Factors That Affect Decisions To Receive (Or Not Receive) Life-Sustaining Treatment In Advance Care Planning.	2014	797	10.3928/02793695-20131028-01	24200911		129	52	2	38	This study identifies factors that affect decisions people make regarding whether they want to receive life-sustaining treatment. It is an interpretive-descriptive study based on qualitative data from three focus groups (N = 23), representing a diverse population in central Pennsylvania. Study sites included a suburban senior center serving a primarily White, middle-class population; an urban senior center serving a frail, underserved, African American population; and a breast cancer support group. The most important factors affecting whether participants wished to receive life-sustaining medical treatment were prognosis, expected quality of life, burden to others, burden to oneself in terms of the medical condition and treatment, and effect on mental functioning and independence. Our findings contribute to the knowledge of the complex factors that influence how people make decisions about advance care planning and life-sustaining treatments. This understanding is critical if nurses are to translate the patient's goals, values, and preferences into an actionable medical plan.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		129	Journal Of Psychosocial Nursing And Mental Health Services	1	797	schubart,jane.r	Schubart	Jane R
598	A Systematic Review Of Predictors And Screening Instruments To Identify Older Hospitalized Patients At Risk For Functional Decline.	2007	802	10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01579.x	17181666		34	16	1	46	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine a valid, reliable and clinical user-friendly instrument, based on predictors of functional decline, to identify older patients at risk for functional decline. The predictors of functional decline are initially considered and, subsequently, the characteristics and psychometric qualities of existing screening instruments are investigated. BACKGROUND: Functional decline is a common and serious problem in older hospitalized patients, resulting in a change in quality of life and lifestyle. Studies have shown that 30-60% of older people develop new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) during their hospital stay. Adverse health outcomes such as mortality, a prolonged hospital stay, nursing home placement and increased dependency of older people at home are the results. Not only are the personal costs high but also, in a rapidly growing older population, the impact on health-care costs is also high. RESULTS: Age, lower functional status, cognitive impairment, preadmission disability in instrumental activities of daily life (IADL), depression and length of hospital stay were identified as predictors of functional decline. Three screening instruments to identify hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline were found in the literature: the Hospital Admission Risk Profile, the Identification of Seniors at Risk and the Care Complexity Prediction Instrument. The reported validity was moderate. Reliability and the ease of use in the clinical setting were not well described. CONCLUSION: These three instruments should be further tested in a hospitalized older population. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Screening is a first step to identify patients at risk for functional decline and this will make it possible to treat patients who are identified so as to prevent functional decline. Because of their ability to observe and to guide the patients and the overall view they have, nurses play a key role in this process.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		34	Journal Of Clinical Nursing	1	802	hoogerduijn,jita.g	Hoogerduijn	Jita G
599	Expert And Patient Consensus On A Dynamic Model For Shared Decision-Making In Frail Older Patients.	2016	803	10.1016/j.pec.2015.12.014	26763871		791	99	6	1069	OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) is widely recommended as a way to support patients in making healthcare choices. Due to an ageing population, the number of older patients will increase. Existing models for SDM are not sufficient for this patient group, due to their multi-morbidity, the lack of guidelines and evidence applicable to the numerous combinations of diseases. The aim of this study was to gain consensus on a model for SDM in frail older patients with multiple morbidities. METHODS: We used a three-round Delphi study to reach consensus on a model for SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities. The expert panel consisted of 16 patients (round 1), and 59 professionals (rounds 1-3). In round 1, the SDM model was introduced, rounds 2 and 3 were used to validate the importance and feasibility of the SDM model. RESULTS: Consensus for the proposed SDM model as a whole was achieved for both importance (91% panel agreement) and feasibility (76% panel agreement). CONCLUSIONS: SDM in older patients with multiple morbidities is a dynamic process. It requires a continuous counselling dialogue between professional and patient or proxy decision maker. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The developed model for SDM in clinical practice may help professionals to apply SDM in the complex situation of the care for older patients.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		791	Patient Education And Counseling	1	803	van de pol,marjolein.h.j	van de Pol	Marjolein H J

601	Visibility And Meanings Of Partnership In Health Care For Older People Who Need Support To Live At Home.	2018	806	10.1111/scs.12545	29171678		100	32	3	1027	INTRODUCTION: Problems experienced by older people with complex needs to live at home have been reported in the literature. This qualitative study builds on previous research and investigates enduring issues older people face when interacting with healthcare services. AIM: To gain an in-depth understanding of what is involved in providing good quality health care for older people who need support to live at home. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN: We adopted an interpretive descriptive approach and conducted semi-structured interviews with older people (n = 7), carers (n = 8) and key informants (n = 11). Initial and secondary analysis of qualitative data was completed. FINDINGS: Major themes emerged about meanings of partnership in health care, and invisibility of the older person as a partner in health care. Partnership in health care was understood to mean being treated as an equal, being involved in decision-making, and making contributions which impact on health care and health systems. The metaphorical concept of 'invisibility' related to the older person not being seen and heard as a partner in health care, as well as being a recipient of care. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that older people who need support to live at home are not highly visible to health providers, policymakers and researchers as a central partner and consumer to be meaningfully engaged in shaping their health care. Opportunities to address persistent issues with quality of health care may in future be achieved through stronger partnerships between older people and health providers, to find new ways to improve the quality of care for older people.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		100	Scandinavian Journal Of Caring Sciences	1	806	gregory,anna	Gregory	Anna
602	Health And Social Care Planning In Collaboration In Older Persons' Homes: The Perspectives Of Older Persons, Family Members And Professionals.	2018	813	10.1111/scs.12440	28543670		100	32	1	147	Providing health and social care to older persons is challenging, since older persons often have multiple diseases and a complex health situation. Hence many professions and organisations are involved. Lack of interprofessional and interorganisational collaboration leads to fragmented care. Care planning meetings before hospital discharge have long been used to overcome this fragmentation, but meetings conducted at the hospital have limitations in identifying long-term needs at home. A new model for health and social care planning in collaboration (HSCPC) in older persons' homes was introduced in two Swedish municipalities. The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the HSCPC-meeting from the perspectives of older persons, family members, and professionals. Ten care planning meetings from two municipalities were consecutively included. Interviews in retrospect with ten older persons, eight family members, and ten groups of professionals who had attended the HSCPC-meeting at home were analysed with a hermeneutic approach. Four themes emerged: unspoken agendas and unpreparedness, security and enhanced understanding, asymmetric relationships, and ambiguity about the mission and need for follow-up. The comprehensive interpretation is that the professionals handled the HSCPC-meeting mainly as a routine task, while the older persons and family members viewed it as part of their life course. Older persons are in an inferior institutional, cognitive and existential position. However, meeting together in the home partly reduced their inferior position. Findings from this study provide some general suggestions for how HSCPC-meetings should be designed and developed: attention of power relations, the importance of meeting skills and follow-up.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	1	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		100	Scandinavian Journal Of Caring Sciences	1	813	sundström,malin	Sundström	Malin

Three of these 17 facilities did not have easy access to speech pathologists, and the facility feeding the greatest number of residents by syringe did not use the services of a speech pathologist to assess swallowing. The practice of syringe feeding seems to be going out of favor, but until this practice is no longer used it is hoped that the recommendations in this article will increase the knowledge and awareness of professional nurses, who are often instrumental in coordinating the difficult and complex decision to syringe feed.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		55	Geriatric Nursing (New York, N.Y.)	1	814	soriano,r	Soriano	R

Faced with the challenge of respecting resident autonomy and simultaneously adhering to nursing home standards, nursing home staff often experience a frustrating ethical conflict. This study examines the effects of sets of independent variables on six autonomy dimensions to examine nursing home personnel's perceptions of how care was provided in their facility. For each of six case studies, respondents were asked the following question: ""If Mr. or Mrs. X were at your facility, what would have been decided?"" Responses were recorded along a continuum that indicated whether the resident would be allowed to make his or her own decisions or whether the nursing home staff would decide for the resident. Findings indicated staff members' education and race had the greatest effect on their perceptions of personal autonomy. Somewhat surprisingly, staffing levels, turnover rates, and restraint usage did not affect their views of autonomy.

Opinions vary as to how to communicate with and care for confused patients and professional carers often find the patients' situation almost as distressing as the patients' themselves do. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe professional carers' experiences of their encounters with older confused patients. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: Data was collected from interviews with 10 professional carers working on a ward specializing in the care of older confused patients. A descriptive phenomenological research approach was used to gather knowledge of professional carers' experiences of encounters with older confused patients. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: A Regional Board of Research Ethics granted ethical permission for the study. The appropriate ethical principles were followed. The participants were contacted personally and received a letter providing information on the study. Written consent was requested before the interview. If needed, the participants were able to get in contact with the staff health service for a follow-up after the interview. Names or places have been changed in order to ensure confidentiality. RESULTS: The encounter with the confused patient is experienced as an encounter with an unfamiliar person, where the patients' actions and words are unforeseeable and with a lack of immediate trust. The essential meaning is further illuminated by the meaning constituents: the unforeseeable encounter, always being on guard and using oneself as a tool. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper focuses on the importance of encouraging professional carers to pay attention to the complexity of the encounter with the confused patient, reflecting upon their own behaviour within these encounters and the importance of knowledge of the patient's preferred senses and life stories. Caring for confused patients involves a great responsibility where both the professional carers and the patients are vulnerable and exposed.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		100	Scandinavian Journal Of Caring Sciences	1	821	stenwall,ewa	Stenwall	Ewa

Because many of these care givers are themselves frail and elderly, the home care nurse must assist both the patient and the caregiver to cope with demands for physical care, complex technology, and behavioral manifestations of chronic conditions. Specialty practice nurses are in an ideal position to assist both the primary visiting nurse and the lay caregiver in the management of complex wound, ostomy, and continence care associated with early discharge from the hospital.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		831	Journal Of Wound, Ostomy, And Continence Nursing: Official Publication Of The Wound, Ostomy And Continence Nurses Society	1	831	brogna,l	Brogna	L

Most of the nursing literature regarding elderly cardiac surgery patients focuses on the 65- to 75-year-old age group; little has been written about the 80- to 90-year-old age group. Very elderly patients present unique and complex challenges to the interdisciplinary teams involved in their care. Nurses must recognize and anticipate the specialized needs of these frail individuals to optimally manage their care. Aortic valve replacement is the most common cardiac valve surgical procedure performed in very elderly persons. A case study and an integrated care plan for the aortic valve surgery patient are described.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		35	The Journal Of Cardiovascular Nursing	1	834	rossi,m.s	Rossi	M S

612	Nurse Case Management: Collaborative Beyond The Hospital Walls.	1994	837		8000323		837	3	2	51	In 1989, St. Joseph Medical Center initiated a community-based nursing case management program with two nurses providing care to high-risk, chronically ill, frail elderly patients. This program has expanded to five registered nurses actively following over 120 patients. Target populations now served have expanded to include: frail elderly, high-risk pregnant women, premature infants, AIDS patients, and those with chronic physical and mental illness. The nurse manages and coordinates the care for patients through all settings (community and hospital), brokering services, acting as a patient advocate, and giving traditional hands-on care as needed. Outcomes analysis has shown that, after nursing case management intervention, the patients demonstrated a 71% decrease in admissions to the medical center, a 21% decrease in length of stay, and a 64% decrease in Emergency Room usage. Nursing case management helps to prevent patients' health problems from becoming more complex. Consequently, managing their health effectively requires fewer, less costly resources while achieving improved patient outcomes.		2021-07-02 01:32:49	0	pubmed-frailtyMeS-complexityorcomplex-allaging-nursjour-2021.06.24.txt		837	Journal Of Case Management	1	837	swindle,d.n	Swindle	D N
613	Exploring A Nursing Home-Specific, Interdisciplinary, Function-Focused, Communicative Framework Based On Situation, Background, Assessment, And Recommendation.	2021	838	10.1097/jnr.0000000000000428			838	29	3	e151	Background: Improved methods of communication are needed among professionals in related fields to address the increasing complexity of clinical situations and various levels of functioning experienced by older adults who live in nursing homes. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore function-focused clinical communication among nurses and providers based on the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) approach toward interdisciplinary collaboration to maintain function among nursing home residents and to identify the characteristics of SBAR flows in nursing homes. Methods: Detailed interviews with 28 interdisciplinary professionals working in four nursing homes were conducted. Directed qualitative content analysis was used to identify the internal attributes of SBAR-based communication. Case analysis was conducted to identify SBAR flows. Results: Four themes emerged as key factors for function-focused interdisciplinary staff communication in nursing homes. Effective nursing care to maintain function among nursing home residents requires accurate awareness of abnormal circumstances. Knowledge of assessment and resident background are needed to address situations requiring intervention and identify the problems underlying a resident's current state. The optimal therapeutic environment is created by sharing roles and tasks among practitioners through referrals. Twelve generalized situations requiring function-focused communication (i.e., dislocation of body line because of joint contracture, change in walking, difficulty of moving because of pain, difficulty in eating, fever, change in sleep pattern, change in excretion pattern, change in weight, change in condition, change in problematic behavior, decrease in cognitive function, and change in relationships) and the related nurse-centered SBAR pathways were identified. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: These results represent a first prototype for developing practical communication guidelines for nursing-home-specific function-focused care and provide new insights into the interdisciplinary approach.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=150250201&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	838	Journal of Nursing Research (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)	1	838	park,min.sun	park	min.sun

Program effectiveness for the residents was measured through an evaluation of participation, services used, and healthcare utilization. Educational effectiveness was measured through a change in health concepts and perceptions of interprofessional practice. Health care utilization among participating residents showed an 8.6% reduction in emergency department visits and 9.8% reduction in hospital admissions. Students demonstrated improved knowledge in motivational interviewing (p =.02); diabetes (p =.02); hypertension (p ≤.01); and frailty (p ≤.01). Changes in students perception of interprofessional practice were significant in two areas; Teamwork and Collaboration (p ≥.00); and Person Centeredness (p =.00). This care coordination model may be an effective approach to reduce care resource utilization among medically complex lower income older adults and provides a rich interprofessional learning experience for students.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=150588583&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	840	Nursing Outlook	1	840	parsons,pamela.l	parsons	pamela.l

Method: an ecological study that analyzed 1,153 elder abuse police reports (2009 to 2013). Local gross and empirical Bayesian rates and Local Moran's I were calculated. Results: there was a heterogeneous distribution of concentration of sectors with a high incidence rate surrounded by neighbors with also high rates, considering place of residence. In contrast, analysis by place of occurrence showed a greater concentration in the central areas of the municipality. More than 80% of cases of violence occurred at their own homes and with spatial dependence on distribution by occurrence up to a 5,000 m distance from their places of residence. Conclusion: data reinforce that violence is a complex phenomenon, affecting several social strata, including in central urban areas and in elderly people families' own context.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=148738827&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	842	Revista Brasileira de Enfermagem	1	842	rosalina,aparecida.partezani.rodrigues	rosalina	aparecida.partezani.rodrigues

These innovations, including kidney replacement therapies, have been effective in providing additional options to patients facing serious illness, but they have also introduced a new level of complexity in the provider assessment of treatment for these patients. Health care providers are being tasked to decide if medical care is appropriate for an aging and medically complex population, a decision complicated by a variety of factors.

617	Planning For End Of Life Care In Dialysis.	2020	848	10.33235/rsaj.16.3.106-110			848	16	3	106	Background With the increasing age and complex comorbidities of dialysis patients globally, there has been increased attention to planning for end of life care (EoLC) and advanced care directives. Objectives We sought to understand the thoughts and experiences of dialysis patients in relation to EoLC planning. Methods An eight-question closed-ended survey at two time points 12 months apart through our Renal Supportive Care Program. All people undergoing dialysis in the service were invited to participate. Results There were good response rates to the survey at both time points (T) (T1 n=224 T2 n=247) and, for the majority, planning for EoLC was considered to be very important (80%). However, only 23% reported having a conversation with their healthcare provider regarding advanced care directives and only 30% had documented their future care goals. At T2 there was an increased awareness of planning in this population which resulted in an improvement in advanced care directives (40%). This study suggests that there is a subgroup of patients who are aware of advanced care directives but do not have any in place. Conclusion There is an ongoing reluctance in dialysis units by patients to have a conversation with their healthcare providers regarding advance care directives despite this population being at heightened risk of deterioration. This is likely impacting on the delivery of complex and possibly unnecessary and unwanted invasive care in the last year/s of life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=147618019&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	848	Renal Society of Australasia Journal	1	848	lunardi,laura	lunardi	laura
618	What Is The Effect Of Age On Wound Healing In The Acute Trauma Setting? A Scoping Review.	2020	849	10.33235/wpr.28.3.115-126			849	28	3	115	The ability to heal an acute traumatic wound or wounds is a complex matrix of overlapping biological processes impacted by intrinsic and extrinsic human factors. As we age, the body's physiological resilience is compromised and homeostasis becomes difficult to maintain. This scoping review examines the influence of biological ageing and the impact of age-related concerns on wound healing, including frailty, malnutrition, pre-existing medical conditions and clinician practices. Frailty rather than age was seen to have a greater physiological impact on outcome, resilience and healing. Clinician support, education and engagement were fundamental to achieve acute wound healing in the aged population. With an increasing ageing population, specialised knowledge, guidelines and structures to support geriatric care are recommended for best clinical practice.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=145759470&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	849	Wound Practice & Research		849	upton,larelle	upton	larelle

620	Challenges And Strategies For Diabetes Management In Community‐Living Older Adults.	2020	851	10.2337/ds20-0013			850	33	3	217	The prevalence of diabetes is increasing, especially in older people, mainly because of an increase in life expectancy. The number of comorbidities also increases with increasing age, leading to a unique diabetes phenotype in old age that includes vascular disease, physical and neuropathic complications, and mental dysfunction. These three categories of complications appear to have a synergistic effect that can lead to a vicious cycle of deterioration into disability. Early assessment and appropriate, timely interventions may delay adverse outcomes. However, this complex phenotype constitutes a great challenge for health care professionals. This article reviews the complex diabetes phenotype in old age and explores management strategies that are predominantly based on the overall functional status of patients within this heterogeneous age-group.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=145107738&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	850	Diabetes Spectrum		851	sinclair,alan.j	sinclair	alan.j
621	Challenges And Strategies For Managing Diabetes In The Elderly In Long-Term Care Settings.	2020	852	10.2337/ds20-0018			850	33	3	236	Diabetes affects a large number of patients in the long-term care (LTC) setting, and their care is often complicated because of multimorbidity, diabetes-related complications, disability, dependency on caregivers, and geriatric syndromes, including frailty and cognitive impairment. This population includes patients receiving short-term rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities, those who are residents in LTC facilities, and those receiving palliative or end-of-life care. An individualized approach to care based on clinical complexity, diabetes trajectory, and patients' preferences and goals is required. Such patients may experience one or more transitions of care and decline in condition. They are also prone to adverse drug events, cardiovascular events, and hypoglycemia. Facility-related challenges include varying staff competencies and practitioner preferences, inconsistent interdisciplinary communication, overly complex medication regimens, and poorly implemented care transitions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=145107740&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	850	Diabetes Spectrum		852	pandya,naushira	pandya	naushira

The recent publication of the 2018 Wellness and Reablement Report Outcomes indicated that organizations lack formal processes to measure the impact of their programs on service users. There are therefore limited data exits on measuring outcomes and the performance of the ACCOM tool in the real world. Knowledge of a strong causal relationship between services provided and outcomes enables confidence in assuming the care provided was largely responsible for the outcome achieved. This paper will reflect on the experiences of one service provider in Brisbane, in implementing the Australian Community Care Outcomes Measurement (ACCOM) tool to measure and demonstrate the impact of their programs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=144388284&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	857	Home Health Care Services Quarterly		857	cardona,beatriz	cardona	beatriz
623	Informal Carers' Experiences Of Caring For A Person With Heart Failure In A Community Setting.	2020	859	10.1111/hsc.12919			18	28	3	883	Heart failure (HF) is a life‐limiting condition with a poor prognosis and unpredictable disease trajectory. HF brings physical and emotional challenges for patients and their carers. Predominantly the informal carer population consists of older females, however, caring is evolving as longevity increases and complex conditions are becoming more commonplace. Consequently, more men and younger people are contributing to daily care. The aim of this study was to explore the positive as well as negative dimensions of caring in HF across a range of carer characteristics. Fourteen semi‐structured interviews were conducted with informal carers of people with HF in the UK (median age 71; female 10). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed with the assistance of NVivo10 using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Findings from the study demonstrated that most participants considered caring as integral to their relationships. Dimensions facilitating positivity in caring included compassion, thoughtfulness and understanding. An ability to cope was influenced by a range of attributes including quality of relationships in the carer/patient dyad and with formal social care providers who offered access to tailored and timely information and support. The unpredictable HF disease trajectory influenced the carer experience and enhanced the challenges encountered. The information needs of carers were not always adequately met and younger adult carers expressed particular difficulties with appropriate information and support. Expectations of our informal carer population are increasing and evolving. Health and social care policy requires innovative proposals for the funding and delivery of health and social care that has the contribution made by informal carers at its core.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=142521692&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	859	barnes,sarah	barnes	sarah
624	Skill Mix: The Potential For Personal Assistants To Undertake Health‐Related Tasks For People With Personal Health Budgets.	2020	860	10.1111/hsc.12923			18	28	3	922	Personal health budgets (PHBs) are being promoted in England as expanding the benefits of choice and control to individuals with healthcare needs. National Health Service (NHS) money is provided to eligible people to use as set out in approved care plans, including direct employment of personal assistants (PAs). The government plans to increase NHS‐funded PHBs and to further introduce integrated personal budgets (IPBs). This potentially creates more demand for directly employed or self‐employed PAs with health‐related skills. The objective of this paper is to report findings from interviews with PAs (n = 105) and key informants (n = 26) from across England, undertaken between October 2016 and August 2017, about the potential for the PA workforce to undertake 'health‐related' tasks as facilitated by the introduction of PHBs. PAs were purposefully recruited to ensure the sample included participants from different geographical locations. Key informants were purposefully selected based on their knowledge of policy and community services. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. This paper focuses on reporting qualitative findings, which are set within the theoretical framework of normalisation process theory to explore implementation challenges of PHBs. The majority (64%) of PAs confirmed that they saw their current roles as congruent with PHBs, were willing to engage with PHBs and undertake health‐related tasks. However, 74% of PAs said they would need additional training if enacting such roles. Key informant interviews appraised the development of PHBs as complex, noting incongruences arising from NHS and social care‐funded PAs carrying out similar roles within different organisational systems. We conclude the current PA workforce is willing to take on PHB work and is likely to interweave this with work funded by PBs and self‐funding care users. Implications include the need for careful consideration of training requirements and delivery for PHB‐funded PAs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=142521696&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	860	norrie,caroline	norrie	caroline

626	What Implies Registered Nurses' Leadership Close To Older Adults In Municipal Home Health Care? A Systematic Review.	2020	862	10.1186/s12912-020-00413-1			855	19	1	1	Background: Registered nurses are key figures in municipal home health care for older adults. Thus, registered nurses' leadership is crucial to a successful and preventive care process as well as a supportive organization in order to achieve safe care. However, there is limited research on what registered nurses' leadership implies close to older adults in municipal home health care. Thus, the aim is to compile and critically evaluate how international research results describe registered nurses' leadership close to older adults in municipal home health care. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with a qualitative research study. The main search was conducted on 20 April 2018. The review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines and is registered in the PROSPERO database (ID# CRD42019109206). Nine articles from PubMed and CINAHL meet the quality criteria. A synthesis of data was performed in four stages according to qualitative research synthesis. Results: Ten themes describe what registered nurses' leadership close to older adults in municipal home health care entails: trust and control; continuous learning; competence through knowledge and ability; nursing responsibility on an organizational level; application of skills; awareness of the individual's needs and wholeness; mutual support; mutual relationships; collaborating on organizational and interpersonal levels; and exposure to challenges. Conclusions: Registered nurses leading close to older adults in municipal home health care implies being multi-artists. Nursing education, including specialist education for registered nurses, should prepare individuals for their unique and complex leadership role as a multi-artist. Municipal employers require knowledge about what registered nurses' leadership implies in order to create adequate conditions for their leadership objectives to achieve safe care. Further research is warranted to explore registered nurses' leadership close to older adults in municipal home health care from different perspectives, such as older adults and next of kin.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=142814968&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	855	BMC Nursing	1	862	claesson,maria	claesson	maria
627	A Responsibility That Never Rests – The Life Situation Of A Family Caregiver To An Older Person.	2020	864	10.1111/scs.12703			170	34	1	44	Background: When the ageing population increases, the burden and responsibility of close family members will likely increase. Those closely related who assume a great responsibility can be significantly affected in health, well‐being and daily life. Aim: This study aims to describe the life situation when family caregivers are imposed responsibility for an older person with complex care needs in their own home. Methods: In this Swedish qualitative study, ten family caregivers were strategically selected in order to achieve variations in the life situation. A reflective lifeworld research design based on phenomenological philosophy was used throughout the data collection with the lifeworld interviews and the analytic process. Findings: In terms of extensive responsibility, the life situation is complex and involves emotions that are difficult to manage. In essence, a paradoxical life situation is described which is experienced as both voluntarily and nonchosen at the same time. The responsibility never rests. The essential meaning is further illustrated with three constituents: loss of freedom, contradictory feelings and affected relationships. Conclusion: A life situation with extensive responsibility for an older family member interferes with the whole life situation with an impact on health and relationships with other people. The findings are crucial for professional caregivers in order to capture the nature of family support in a way that enables a meaningful life for both the family caregiver and the older person being cared for. Knowledge of this will give professional caregivers an increased awareness of the life situation of family caregivers and provide a better understanding of the support they are longing for, and, in some countries, such as Sweden, also are entitled to by law.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141997551&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	864	jarling,aleksandra	jarling	aleksandra
628	Dignity As A Guiding Principle For Family Care Partners In The Care Of An Old Relative With Dementia.	2020	865	10.1111/scs.12708			170	34	1	87	Aim: There is a growing number of older people (65+) with dementia, and many family care partners are involved in making help‐seeking choices. The aim of this study was to reveal how family care partners with an old relative with dementia proceed in the name of dignity in their desire to secure the best care possible while still maintaining their own dignity. Methods: Data were collected in 2009–2010 in open semi‐structured interviews and follow‐up contacts with seven family care partners with an old relative with dementia on 14 occasions. From this collected data and for this study, a design based on patterns labelled archetypes was chosen to permit an in‐depth data analysis. Results: In the analysis, three archetypes emerged, emanating from three specific family care partners. A prominent feature in the findings was that the dignity of an old relative with dementia was hard to separate from the dignity as a family care partner, which gave rise to their need to express accounts in terms of excuses and justifications. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the connection between different elements of dignity and it contributes to explain the complexity behind family care partners' decisions in the care of an old relative with dementia. This multifaceted meaning of dignity needs more attention for a better understanding and thereby implementation in practice and in the follow‐up of policy for older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=141997556&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	865	söderberg,maria	söderberg	maria

630	Does Older Adults' Use Of Social Care Influence Their Healthcare Utilisation? A Systematic Review Of International Evidence.	2019	872	10.1111/hsc.12798			18	27	5	e651	Improving our understanding of the complex relationship between health and social care utilisation is vital as populations age. This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence on the relationship between older adults' use of social care and their healthcare utilisation. Ten databases were searched for international literature on social care (exposure), healthcare use (outcome) and older adults (population). Searches were carried out in October 2016, and updated May 2018. Studies were eligible if they were published after 2000 in a high income country, examined the relationship between use of social care and healthcare utilisation by older adults (aged ≥60 years), and controlled for an indicator of need. Study quality and bias were rated using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross‐Sectional Studies. Study data were extracted and a narrative synthesis was conducted. Data were not suitable for quantitative synthesis. Thirteen studies were identified from 12,065 citations. Overall, the quality and volume of evidence was low. There was limited evidence to suggest that longer lengths of stay in care homes were associated with a lower risk of inpatient admissions. Residents of care homes with onsite nursing had fewer than expected admissions to hospital, compared to people in care homes without nursing, and adjusting for need. Evidence for other healthcare use outcomes was even more limited and heterogeneous, with notable gaps in primary care. We conclude that older adults' use of care homes may moderate inpatient admissions. In particular, the presence of registered nurses in care homes may reduce the need to transfer residents to hospital. However, further evidence is needed to add weight to this conclusion. Future research should build on this evidence and address gaps regarding the influence of community based social care on older adults' healthcare use. A greater focus on primary care outcomes is imperative.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=138203883&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	872	spiers,gemma	spiers	gemma
631	Effects Of Multifactorial And Follow-Up Programs Applying A Capacity Building Strategy: Focusing On Older Adults Living In A Urban-Rural Complex Area.	2019	874	10.12799/jkachn.2019.30.2.243			874	30	2	243	Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine effects of a multifactorial program for preventing the frailty of older adults and effects of a follow-up program applying a capacity building strategy. Methods: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used for the nonequivalent control group. The follow-up group (n=75) and non-follow-up group (n=68) received the same multifactorial program comprising muscle strength exercise, cognitive training, and psychosocial programs for 12 weeks. After completion of multifactorial program, the follow-up group took follow-up programs applying the capacity building strategy for following 12 weeks. The data of physical function, cognitive function, and psychological function, and self-rated health were collected from both groups three times: before intervention, after intervention, and 12 weeks after intervention. The data were analyzed using x2 test and t-test. Results: In comparison with the non-follow-up group, the scores of Timed Up & Go Test, and physical activities energy expenditure were significantly improved in the follow-up group. Conclusion: These results indicate that a multifactorial program with follow-up adapting the strategies of capacity building for the older adults group is feasible to prevent the physical frailty in community.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=137263440&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	874	Journal of Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing / Jiyeog Sahoe Ganho Hakoeji	1	874	song,han	song	han
632	The Older Person With Diabetes: Considerations For Care.	2019	875	10.12968/bjcn.2019.24.4.160			163	24	4	160	With the increasingly ageing population worldwide, more older people are living with diabetes. The conditions that often accompany older age, such as dementia, renal impairment, visual impairment and manual dexterity difficulties, can make diabetes management complex and self-care challenging. However, the status of older people varies considerably, and so choice of glucose-lowering agents and clinical targets should be individualised to maximise safety and ensure that the risks of treatments do not outweigh the benefits. For many patients, there will be an increasing dependence on others to manage their diabetes care, so an appropriate skill mix among healthcare professionals and carers, adequate training and regular competency assessment are crucial to support patients to remain safe and symptom free from diabetes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=135850080&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	163	British Journal of Community Nursing	1	875	hill,jill	hill	jill
633	Does Informal Care Impact Utilisation Of Home‐Based Formal Care Services Among End‐Of‐Life Patients? A Decade Of Evidence From Ontario, Canada.	2019	876	10.1111/hsc.12664			18	27	2	437	Understanding how informal care impacts formal care utilisation for home‐based end‐of‐life patients is an important policy‐ and practice‐relevant question. This paper aims to assess the relationship between informal and formal home care among home‐based end‐of‐life patients and how this relationship has changed over the last decade and over the end‐of‐life trajectory. We focus on informal care provided by family members or friends, and three types of home‐based formal care services: care by personal support workers, physician visits, and nurse visits. Using survey data collected in a home‐based end‐of‐life care programme in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2016, we build a two‐part utilisation model analysing both the propensity to use each type of formal care and the amount of formal care received by patients. The results suggest that informal care is a substitute for care by personal support workers, but a complement to physician visits and nurse visits. In the case of nurse visits, an increased complementary effect is observed in more recent years. For home‐based physician and nurse visits, the complementary effect grows with patient's proximity to death. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between informal and formal care among home‐based end‐of‐life patients. Decision‐makers need to take into account the relationship between informal care and different types of formal services when introducing future policies.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=134685908&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:24	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	876	sun,zhuolu	sun	zhuolu

635	Hospital Readmission: Older Married Male Patients' Experiences Of Life Conditions And Critical Incidents Affecting The Course Of Care, A Qualitative Study.	2018	883	10.1111/scs.12583			170	32	4	1379	Background: Despite the frequency of hospital readmissions, there is still a relatively incomplete understanding of the broader array of factors pertaining to readmission in older persons. Few studies have explored how older persons experience readmission and their perceptions of circumstances affecting the course of care. Research indicates that males experience poorer health outcomes and are at higher risk of readmission compared to women. Aim: To explore life conditions and critical incidents pertained to hospital readmission from the perspective of older males. Methods: The study used a qualitative explorative design using the Critical Incident Technique. A purposive sample of four males aged 65–75 were recruited from two internal medical wards. Data were collected through narrative double interviews. The study was registered by the North Denmark Region's joint notification of health research (ID 2008‐58‐0028). Findings: The analysis revealed four themes of life conditions: 'Ambiguity of ageing', 'Living with the burden of illness', 'Realisation of dependency' and 'Growing sense of vulnerability and mortality'. Critical incidents comprised four areas: 'Balancing demands and resources in everyday life', 'Back home again – a period of recovery', 'Care interaction' and 'Navigating within and between healthcare system(s)'. Conclusion: This study illustrated the interconnectedness, dynamics and complexity of life conditions and critical incidents that over time and across diverse healthcare sectors affected the course of care in older persons. Hospital readmissions seem related to a complex web of interacting life conditions and critical incidents rather than growing age or specific illnesses.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=133687391&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	883	pedersen,mona.kyndi	pedersen	mona.kyndi
636	Patient Safety Culture In Nursing Homes – A Cross-Sectional Study Among Nurses And Nursing Aides Caring For Residents With Diabetes.	2018	889	10.1186/s12912-018-0305-z			855	17	1		"Background: Due to the high morbidity and disability level among diabetes patients in nursing homes, the conditions for caregivers are exceedingly complex and challenging. The patient safety culture in nursing homes should be evaluated in order to improve patient safety and the quality of care. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the perceptions of patient safety culture of nursing personnel in nursing homes, and its associations with the participants' (i) profession, (ii) education, (iii) specific knowledge related to their own residents with diabetes, and (iv) familiarity with clinical diabetes guidelines for older people. Methods: Cross-sectional survey design. The study included 89 nursing home personnel (38 registered nurses and 51 nurse aides), 25 (28%) with advanced education, at two nursing homes. We collected self-reported questionnaire data on age, profession, education and work experience, diabetes knowledge and familiarity with diabetes guidelines. In addition, we applied the Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture instrument, with 42 items and 12 dimensions. Results: In general, those with advanced education scored higher in all patient safety culture dimensions than those without, however statistically significant only for the dimensions ""teamwork"" (mean score 81.7 and 67.7, p = 0.042) and ""overall perceptions of resident safety"" (mean score 90.0 and 74.3, p = 0.016). Nursing personnel who were familiar with diabetes guidelines for older people had more positive perceptions in key areas of patient safety culture, than those without familiarity with the guidelines. Conclusions: The findings from this study show that advanced education and familiarity with current diabetes guidelines was related to adequate evaluations on essential areas of patient safety culture in nursing homes."	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=131122563&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	855	BMC Nursing	1	889	titlestad,irit	titlestad	irit
637	Integrated Approach To Oral Health In Aged Care Facilities Using Oral Health Practitioners And Teledentistry In Rural Queensland.	2018	890	10.1111/ajr.12410			890	26	4	290	Abstract: Problem: Residents of residential aged care facilities are at very high risk of developing complex oral diseases and dental problems. Key barriers exist in delivering oral health services to residential aged care facilities, particularly in regional and rural areas. Design: A quality improvement study incorporating pre‐ and post chart audits and pre‐ and post consultation with key stakeholders, including staff and residents, expert opinion on cost estimates and field notes were used. Setting: One regional and three rural residential aged care facilities situated in a non‐metropolitan hospital and health service in Queensland. Key measures for improvement: Number of appointments avoided at an oral health facility  Feedback on program experience by staff and residents  Compliance with oral health care plan implementation  Observations of costs involved to deliver new service. Strategies for change: The model developed incorporated a visit by an oral health therapist for screening, education, simple intervention and referral for a teledentistry session if required. Effects of change: Results showed an improvement in implementation of oral health care plans and a minimisation of need for residents to attend an oral health care facility. Potential financial and social cost savings for residents and the facilities were also noted. Lessons learnt: Screening via the oral health therapist and teledentistry appointment minimises the need for a visit to an oral health facility and subsequent disruption to residents in residential aged care facilities.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=131279401&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	890	Australian Journal of Rural Health		890	tynan,anna	tynan	anna
638	Developing And Utilising A New Funding Model For Home‐Care Services In New Zealand.	2018	892	10.1111/hsc.12525			18	26	3	345	Abstract: Worldwide increases in the numbers of older people alongside an accompanying international policy incentive to support ageing‐in‐place have focussed the importance of home‐care services as an alternative to institutionalisation. Despite this, funding models that facilitate a responsive, flexible approach are lacking. Casemix provides one solution, but the transition from the well‐established hospital system to community has been problematic. This research seeks to develop a Casemix funding solution for home‐care services through meaningful client profile groups and supporting pathways. Unique assessments from 3,135 older people were collected from two health board regions in 2012. Of these, 1,009 arose from older people with non‐complex needs using the <italic>inter</italic>RAI‐Contact Assessment (CA) and 2,126 from the <italic>inter</italic>RAI‐Home‐Care (HC) from older people with complex needs. Home‐care service hours were collected for 3 months following each assessment and the mean weekly hours were calculated. Data were analysed using a decision tree analysis, whereby mean hours of weekly home‐care was the dependent variable with responses from the assessment tools, the independent variables. A total of three main groups were developed from the <italic>inter</italic>RAI‐CA, each one further classified into “stable” or “flexible.” The classification explained 16% of formal home‐care service hour variability. Analysis of the <italic>inter</italic>RAI‐HC generated 33 clusters, organised through eight disability “sub” groups and five “lead” groups. The groupings explained 24% of formal home‐care services hour variance. Adopting a Casemix system within home‐care services can facilitate a more appropriate response to the changing needs of older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=128973581&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	892	parsons,matthew	parsons	matthew

Complex persistent pain is associated with physical, psychological and emotional burdens. All of these factors can result in existential suffering. Current pain management in aged care is targeted at passive strategies. More consideration needs to be given to how assessment and management of pain in this population can be improved, using a biopsychosocial model, to decrease unnecessary suffering.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=130946022&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	893	Contemporary Nurse: A Journal for the Australian Nursing Profession	1	893	holloway,helen	holloway	helen
640	The Evolving Role Of The Personal Support Worker In Home Care In Ontario, Canada.	2018	895	10.1111/hsc.12514			18	26	2	240	Abstract: To meet increasing demand for home care, the role of personal support workers (PSWs) is shifting from providing primarily personal and supportive care to include care activities previously provided by regulated health professionals (RHPs). Much of the research examining this shift focuses on specialty programmes, with few studies investigating the daily care being provided by PSWs, frequency of care activities being provided by PSWs, and characteristics of the population receiving more complex tasks. Between January and April 2015, a review of 517 home‐care service user charts was undertaken in Ontario, Canada, to: (1) describe the range of tasks being performed by PSWs in home care, (2) identify tasks transferred by RHPs to PSWs, and (3) examine characteristics of service users receiving transferred care. Findings indicate that normally, PSWs provide personal and supportive care commensurate with their training. However, in approximately one quarter of care plans reviewed, PSWs also completed more complex care activities transferred to them by RHPs. Service users receiving transferred care were older and had higher levels of cognitive and functional impairment. Although there is potential for the expansion of home‐care services through increased utilisation of PSWs, healthcare leadership must ensure that the right provider is being utilised at the right time and in the right place to ensure safe and effective quality care. Thus, several actions are recommended: PSW core competencies be clearly articulated, processes used to transfer care activities from RHPs to PSWs be standardised and a team‐based approach to the delivery of home‐care services be considered. Utilisation of a team‐based model can help establish positive relationships among home‐care providers, provide increased support for PSWs, allow for easier scheduling of initial training and ensure regular reassessments of PSW competence among PSWs providing added skills.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=127818705&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	895	saari,margaret	saari	margaret
641	Visiting Nurses’ Posthospital Medication Management In Home Health Care: An Ethnographic Study.	2018	898	10.1111/scs.12451			170	32	1	222	Background: Medication management is the most challenging component of a successful transition from hospital to home, a challenge of growing complexity as the number of older persons living with chronic conditions grows, along with increasingly specialised and accelerated hospital treatment plans. Thus, many patients are discharged with complex medication regimen instructions, accentuating the risk of medication errors that may cause readmission, adverse drug events and a need for further health care. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore visiting nurses’ medication management in home health care after hospital discharge and to identify key elements in patient medication for improved patient safety. Method: Inspired by the ethnographic research cycle, participant observations and informal interviews were conducted at 12 initial visits by a nurse in a patient's home after hospital discharge. Data consisted of field notes and photographs from the patients’ homes, medication lists and medical records. Field notes were analysed in four steps. Findings: The analysis showed 12 stages in medication management in which nurses strove to adjust medication management to the patients’ actual health status by <italic>mediating</italic> on knowledge of the patient, information to the patient and on rules and regulations and by <italic>establishing order</italic> in medication lists and medications in the home. Conclusion: The nurse–patient relationship, the integration of care and the context of care challenged patient safety in visiting nurses’ medication management in patients’ homes after hospital discharge. The implications for practice were the following: to ensure nurses’ opportunities to continuously evolve their observation skills and skills in making sound clinical judgements; to establish interprofessional working processes which support the continuous assessment of patients’ needs and the adjustment of care and treatment; to clarify expectations to nurses’ responsibility and patients’ privacy.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=128262548&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	898	kollerup,mette.geil	kollerup	mette.geil
642	The Physical Environment, Activity And Interaction In Residential Care Facilities For Older People: A Comparative Case Study.	2017	900	10.1111/scs.12391			170	31	4	727	The physical environment is of particular importance for supporting activities and interactions among older people living in residential care facilities ( RCFs) who spend most of their time inside the facility. More knowledge is needed regarding the complex relationships between older people and environmental aspects in long-term care. The present study aimed to explore how the physical environment influences resident activities and interactions at two RCFs by using a mixed-method approach. Environmental assessments were conducted via the Swedish version of the Sheffield Care Environment Assessment Matrix (S- SCEAM), and resident activities, interactions and locations were assessed through an adapted version of the Dementia Care Mapping ( DCM). The Observed Emotion Rating Scale ( OERS) was used to assess residents' affective states. Field notes and walk-along interviews were also used. Findings indicate that the design of the physical environment influenced the residents' activities and interactions. Private apartments and dining areas showed high environmental quality at both RCFs, whereas the overall layout had lower quality. Safety was highly supported. Despite high environmental quality in general, several factors restricted resident activities. To optimise care for older people, the design process must clearly focus on accessible environments that provide options for residents to use the facility independently.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=126461968&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	900	nordin,susanna	nordin	susanna
643	'Shadowing' As A Management Strategy For Chemotherapy Outpatient Primary Support Persons.	2017	901	10.1111/scs.12410			170	31	4	887	Despite growing numbers of patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy in outpatient settings and the corresponding increase in care demands on family and close friends, little is known about the experiences of those informal carers supporting people with cancer during their chemotherapy trajectories. Using an interpretivist theoretical framework, this study explored the experiences of primary support persons of chemotherapy outpatients through in-depth interviews with 17 participants nominated as their primary support persons by people receiving chemotherapy at a large tertiary hospital in Australia. The study demonstrates that primary support persons of chemotherapy outpatients face distinct challenges, being at the frontline of treatment and managing side effects with minimal support at home. This role involves sensitive provision of complex medical and social care in circumstances that profoundly challenge the everyday worlds of both patient and carer. From the moment of diagnosis, informal carers in this context face the 'double whammy' of needing to 'manage' the cancer diagnosis experience as well as the chemotherapy trajectory experience. This study points to the significant level of responsibility that primary support persons take on, and the extent to which patients and clinicians rely on their support and management skills. It also points, however, to the lack of recognition they receive for assuming this role, and their sense of frustration in the face of this invisibility. The conceptualisation of the informal carer role as a 'shadowing' role explicitly represents the protective, vigilant, but almost invisible, support role described by the participants in this study.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=126461960&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	901	mckenzie,heather	mckenzie	heather
644	What Do Older People Experiencing Loneliness Think About Primary Care Or Community Based Interventions To Reduce Loneliness? A Qualitative Study In England.	2017	902	10.1111/hsc.12438			18	25	6	1733	Loneliness in later life is a common problem with poor health outcomes. However, interventions to prevent or ameliorate loneliness have a weak evidence base. The views of older people experiencing or at risk of loneliness in the community are important in identifying features of potential support, but have been little studied. Twenty-eight community dwelling people, aged 65 and over who reported being 'lonely much of the time' or identified as lonely from the de Jong Gierveld six-item loneliness scale in a larger study, participated in in-depth interviews, between June 2013 and May 2014. Views and experiences on seeking support from primary care and community based one-to-one and group based activities, including social and shared interest groups, were explored. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team, including older people. Using two different measures of loneliness enabled a spectrum of loneliness experience to be explored. Two-thirds of the participants were the 'younger old' and all were able to leave their homes independently. Older people with characteristics of loneliness were generally knowledgeable about local social and community resources but, for the majority, community and primary care based services for their loneliness were not considered desirable or helpful at this point in their lives. However, group based activities with a shared interest were thought preferable to one-to-one support (befriending) or groups with a social focus. Descriptions of support as being for loneliness and specific to older people discouraged engagement. Older people experiencing or at risk of loneliness did not consider that primary care has a role in alleviating loneliness because it is not an illness. They thought primary care practitioners lack understanding of non-physical problems and that a good relationship was necessary to discuss sensitive issues like loneliness. For many, loneliness was a complex and private matter that they wished to manage without external support.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=125423048&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	902	kharicha,kalpa	kharicha	kalpa
645	Views On Ageing In Place From Relocated Low-Income Housing Residents In The Us.	2017	903	10.7748/nop.2017.e950			10	29	8	35	Background Ageing in place (AIP) is the ability to live in one's home and community independently, despite age, ability level or income. Aim To elicit knowledge and feelings about AIP from low-income older adults relocated to low-income housing. Method Nursing students, supervised by nursing faculty trained in research, conducted semi-structured interviews about AIP with volunteer residents living in a low-income apartment complex in the southern US. Findings Seven participants discussed common fears and worries as well as needs for AIP in low-income housing. Mental health issues were prominent. Conclusion Mental health warrants consideration along with physical, social and emotional well-being in beginning to identify and address the needs of older people ageing anywhere, perhaps especially in relocated low-income older adults. This information could inform future interventions to encourage AIP in the US and potentially in other countries.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=125590585&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	10	Nursing Older People	1	903	van,ravenstein.kathryn	van	ravenstein.kathryn
646	Management Of Long-Term Conditions And Dementia: The Role Of The Admiral Nurse.	2017	905	10.12968/bjcn.2017.22.6.295			163	22	6	295	As life expectancy increases so people often develop a range of conditions and disabilities in the years before death. Multimorbidity represents the most common 'disease pattern' found among the elderly and is characterised by complex interactions of co-existing diseases where a medical approach focused on a single disease does not suffice. People with dementia who also have other comorbidities do not always have their comorbid conditions managed as those without dementia which often lead to a high number of hospital admissions with longer lengths of stay and greater treatment costs. This case study presents the case management approach taken by Admiral Nursing in managing the complexities where there is comorbidity of a long-term condition and a diagnosis of dementia. By empowering the person and their carer with information and choices and through good case management and communication, people can be supported to live well and avoid inappropriate hospital admissions.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=123429175&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	163	British Journal of Community Nursing	1	905	knight,cathy	knight	cathy
647	Complex Caring Needs Without Simple Solutions: The Experience Of Interprofessional Collaboration Among Staff Caring For Older Persons With Multimorbidity At Home Care Settings.	2017	906	10.1111/scs.12352			170	31	2	342	Background Older persons with multimorbidity being cared for at home often have complex needs which cannot be met by one single caregiver. Interprofessional collaboration is therefore considered necessary if care is to be organised according to the needs of the older person. To achieve coherent health care, municipalities and county councils need to develop their collaboration. Aim The aim of this study was to illustrate how various professionals belonging to homemaker services, home care services in municipality and hospital-based home care services experience collaboration in caring for older persons with multimorbidity. Method A hermeneutic approach was used. Eleven informants participated in the study and were individually interviewed. Findings The findings show that collaboration between players comprises various types of experiences which influence not only the staff who are involved in collaboration but also the outcome of the collaboration itself. The informants' experience of collaboration was defined by distrust and trust and by insecurity and security. To focus on patients' needs and to develop the collaboration further, it was important for informants to take the relations into account and have a reflective and questioning approach. This attitude resulted in a feeling of trust and security, and a flexible and critical approach without boundary drawings between basic and specialised care. Conclusion and relevance of practice Complex situations cannot be solved with simple models. Instead, a flexible approach appears necessary with focus shifting from structures to interpersonal relations and interactions. Therefore, the different professionals have to work as a transprofessional team where close interactions, flexibility and improvisation are keys to success. The transprofessional team approach is suggested to have the potential to take the competence of all staff into account when high-quality home health care to older persons with multimorbidity is to be provided by multiple caregivers.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=123838181&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	906	larsen,anne	larsen	anne
648	Meeting The Health Needs Of Older People With Intellectual Disabilities: Exploring The Experiences Of Residential Social Care Staff.	2017	907	10.1111/hsc.12380			18	25	3	923	Older people with intellectual disabilities often experience high levels of health needs and multiple morbidities but they may be supported by residential care staff with little or no previous experience of identifying and meeting health needs. Little is known regarding how they undertake this health-related role and this exploratory study seeks to address this gap. A purposive sample of 14 managers of supported living accommodation in Wales were interviewed in 2014 to determine their experiences of supporting tenants in relation to age-related health needs. The semi-structured interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed. Three of the emerging themes are reported in this paper: meeting health needs, the consequences of ageing and relationships. Findings indicate that residential care staff support older people with intellectual disabilities with complex and multiple health needs: they monitor health status, support access to healthcare, provide additional support arising from changing health needs and advocate for tenants in the context of healthcare. However, their role is often not understood by healthcare professionals. The importance of staff having a long-term relationship with those they support was identified as being important to identifying any health-related changes. The need to develop effective relationships with healthcare staff was also noted. It is concluded that there is a need for better understanding among health staff of the role of residential social care workers and for further research regarding health-related communication.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=122251255&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	907	northway,ruth	northway	ruth
649	An Extra Care Community'S Perceived Priorities For 'Whole System' Relationships: A Q-Methodological Study.	2017	908	10.1111/hsc.12417			18	25	3	1169	Health and social care settings worldwide need to sustainably improve the quality of relationships across communities or 'whole systems'. This research informs the development of a relational framework based on stakeholder perspectives. It is grounded in an action research project with practitioners, and draws on a previous literature review, to present the underpinning elements of quality relationships as statements, organised under the headings of integrity, respect, fairness, compassion and trust. Using Q methodology, 27 participants, comprising a range of stakeholders (staff, residents, family and service providers), rank-ordered 48 statements based on perceptions of the importance of differing aspects of relationships. By-person factor analysis was used to create five factors or viewpoints by comparing and contrasting using the composite rankings alongside interview data collected for each participant. The first view 'Altogether now' prioritises compassionate engagement. Second, 'Respect is a two-way street' emphasises the need for reciprocal respect and recognition of history. The factor labelled 'Free spirits' posits the dominant view of freedom. The fourth view 'Families ... strengths and challenges' focuses on the necessary and complex involvement of families and finally, 'Helping hands' emphasises the role of relationships in increasing previously low expectations of social integration for previously isolated residents. The different views that exist on the composition of quality relationships can be used to help extra care communities to understand and utilise relationships as a powerful and effective resource.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=122251217&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	908	grimshaw,paul	grimshaw	paul
650	General Practitioners' Experiences As Nursing Home Medical Consultants.	2017	910	10.1111/scs.12310			170	31	1	37	Objective To describe general practitioners' experiences of being the principal physician responsible for a nursing home. Method Fifteen general practitioners assigned to a nursing home participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Data were analysed using systematic text condensation. Result Medical assessment is the main duty of general practitioners. Advance care planning together with residents and family members facilitates future decisions on medical treatment and end-of-life care. Registered Nurses' continuity and competence are perceived as crucial to the quality of care, but inadequate staffing, lack of medical equipment and less-than-optimal IT systems for electronic healthcare records are impediments to patient safety. Conclusion The study highlights the importance of advance care planning together with residents and family members in facilitating future decisions on medical treatment and end-of-life care. To meet the increasing demands for more complex medical treatment at nursing homes and to provide high-quality palliative care, there would seem to be a need to increase Registered Nurses' staffing and acquire more advanced medical equipment, as well as to create better possibilities for Registered Nurses and general practitioners to access each other's healthcare record systems.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=121443500&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	910	kirsebom,marie	kirsebom	marie
651	Health And Social Care Management For Older Adults With Multimorbidity: A Multiperspective Approach.	2017	911	10.1111/scs.12322			170	31	1	96	Multimorbidity, a condition common among older adults, may be regarded as a failure of a complex system. The aim of this study was to describe the core components in health and social care management for older adults with multimorbidity. A cross-sectional design included two methods: individual interviews and group discussions. A total of 105 participants included older adults with multimorbidity and their relatives, care staff and healthcare policymakers. Data were analysed using content analysis. The results show that seven core components comprise a multiperspective view of health and social care management for older adults with multimorbidity: political steering, leadership, cooperation, competence, support for relatives, availability and continuity. Steps should be taken to ensure that every older adult with multimorbidity has a treatment plan according to a multiperspective view to prevent fragmentation of their health care. This study provides relevant evidence developing a multiperspective model of health and social care management for older adults with multimorbidity.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=121443485&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	911	meranius,martina.summer	meranius	martina.summer
652	Determinants Of The Caregiving Experience...Second In A Series	2016	913				913	19	3	6	The traditional discourse of caregiving focuses on burden, depression and anxiety. However, there is an emerging understanding of the complexities of the caregiving experience. This review paper highlights the complexity and often ambiguous reporting of variables associated with the caregiving experience and raises a number of research questions. The paper concludes that the identification of determinants that affect aspects of the caregiving experience, including anxiety and depression symptoms, is required to inform health care professionals of carer support needs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=120615242&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	913	Journal of the Australasian Rehabilitation Nurses' Association (JARNA)	1	913	aggar,christina	aggar	christina
653	Care Arrangements For Community-Dwelling People With Dementia In Germany As Perceived By Informal Carers - A Cross-Sectional Pilot Survey In A Provincial-Rural Setting.	2016	917	10.1111/hsc.12202			18	24	3	283	The majority of people with dementia live at home, and informal carers assume the role of key care providers, often supported by formal services. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess home-based care arrangements, to illustrate utilisation of formal services over time and to identify factors associated with perceived stability of the care situation from the informal carer's perspective. A self-administered questionnaire (D- IVA 'Instrument for Assessing Home-Based Care Arrangements for People with Dementia') was developed and distributed in a provincial-rural setting in Germany as a cross-sectional survey. Data analysis used descriptive statistics, unbiased conditional inference trees and thematic analysis for open-ended questions. In total, 84 care arrangements were assessed. The majority of participants were direct relatives of the care-dependent person [mostly adult children (48.8%) or spouses (27.4%)]. Formal services were already sought in the first year after onset of memory problems. The most frequently used formal services were home care nursing services (53.0%), day care (49.4%) and respite care (29.6%), whereas 15.5% did not use any type of formal support. Companion home visit, home care nursing service and day care were used over the longest periods of time. The recruitment strategy used in this study may have recruited persons who were relatively more dependent on their informal carers. In this small sample, carers' perceived stability of the care situation was high, and this was associated with the country of origin and sex of the person with dementia ( P = 0.004 and 0.023 respectively). Most care arrangements consisted of a mix of informal and formal services. However, informal carers assumed prime responsibility. The questionnaire D- IVA proved to be suitable. It remains a challenge to further examine factors associated with perceived stability and to explain the phenomenon in its whole complexity. Further research using the D- IVA should consider applying complementing quantitative measures as well as qualitative methods.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=114245458&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	917	kutzleben,milena	kutzleben	milena
654	A Review Of Instruments To Measure Interprofessional Collaboration For Chronic Disease Management For Community-Living Older Adults.	2016	918	10.3109/13561820.2015.1123233			231	30	2	201	It is acknowledged internationally that chronic disease management (CDM) for community-living older adults (CLOA) is an increasingly complex process. CDM for older adults, who are often living with multiple chronic conditions, requires coordination of various health and social services. Coordination is enabled through interprofessional collaboration (IPC) among individual providers, community organizations, and health sectors. Measuring IPC is complicated given there are multiple conceptualisations and measures of IPC. A literature review of several healthcare, psychological, and social science electronic databases was conducted to locate instruments that measure IPC at the team level and have published evidence of their reliability and validity. Five instruments met the criteria and were critically reviewed to determine their strengths and limitations as they relate to CDM for CLOA. A comparison of the characteristics, psychometric properties, and overall concordance of each instrument with salient attributes of IPC found the Collaborative Practice Assessment Tool to be the most appropriate instrument for measuring IPC for CDM in CLOA.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=114192809&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	231	Journal of Interprofessional Care	1	918	bookey-bassett,sue	bookey-bassett	sue

Linear regression was used to compare global cognitive performance scores of housewives (G1) and women exposed to work of low (G2) and high (G3) complexity. The sample comprised 477 older adult Brazilian women, 430 (90.4%) of whom had performed lifelong jobs. In work with data, the G2 group's cognitive performance scores were 1.73 points higher (p =.03), and the G3 group scored 1.76 points (p =.02) higher, than the G1. In work with things and with people, the G3 scored, respectively, 2.04 (p <.01) and 2.21 (p <.01) cognitive test points higher than the G1. Based on our findings we suggest occupation of greater complexity is associated with better cognitive performance in women later in life.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111070163&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	925	Health Care for Women International	1	925	ribeiro,pricila.cristina.correa	ribeiro	pricila.cristina.correa
656	End Of Life Of Patients Treated With Haemodialysis As Narrated By Their Close Relatives.	2015	926	10.1111/scs.12209			170	29	4	776	Aim: The study aimed to describe end of life for patients treated with maintenance haemodialysis as narrated by their close relatives. Introduction: Many patients undergoing haemodialysis are older, have several comorbidities and underestimated symptoms and are in their last year of life. To improve care, we need to know more about their end-of-life situation. Design: Qualitative and descriptive. Methods: Qualitative retrospective interviews were conducted with 14 close relatives of deceased haemodialysis patients (3-13 months after death). Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The study is ethically approved. Findings: In the last months, a gradual deterioration in health with acute episodes necessitating hospital admissions was described. This involved diminishing living space and expressions of dejection, but also of joy. Three patterns emerged in the last weeks: uncertain anticipation of death as life fades away; awaiting death after haemodialysis withdrawal; and sudden but not unexpected death following intensive care. Findings show complexities of decisions on haemodialysis withdrawal. Conclusions: Different end-of-life patterns all involved increasingly complex care needs and existential issues. Findings show a need for earlier care planning. The identification of organisational factors to facilitate continuity and whole person care to meet these patients' specific care needs with their complex symptom burdens and comorbidities is needed. Findings indicate the need for integration of a palliative care approach in the treatment of patients in haemodialysis care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111812000&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	926	axelsson,lena	axelsson	lena
657	Towards An Optimal Multidisciplinary Approach To Breast Cancer Treatment For Older Women.	2015	927	10.5737/23688076254384395			927	25	4	384	The treatment of breast cancer presents specific concerns that are unique to the needs of older female patients. While treatment of early breast cancer does not vary greatly with age, the optimal management of older women with breast cancer often requires complex interdisciplinary supportive care due to multiple comorbidities. This article reviews optimal approaches to breast cancer in women 6j years and older from an interdisciplinary perspective. A literature review was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE, choosing articles concentrated on the management of older breast cancer patients from the point of view of several disciplines, including geriatrics, radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology, psycho- oncology, palliative care, nursing, and social work. This patient population requires interprofessional collaboration from the time of diagnosis, throughout treatment and into the recovery period. Thus, we recommend an interdisciplinary program dedicated to the treatment of older women with breast cancer to optimize their cancer care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=111108619&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	927	Canadian Oncology Nursing Journal	1	927	thavarajah,nemica	thavarajah	nemica
658	Prescribing For Uncomplicated Hypertension In The Elderly.	2015	932	10.12968/npre.2015.13.5.224			932	13	5	224	The treatment of older people with high blood pressure (BP) is a challenge as under- and over-treatment can lead to poorer outcomes. There is strong evidence from epidemiological and trial data to show that older people with high BP should be treated at the same threshold and to the same target BP (BP <140/90 mmHg) as younger patients, with the exception of the very elderly (those over the age of 80 years), in whom a less aggressive treatment target is recommended (BP <150/90 mmHg). With anti-hypertensive therapy, older people can experience orthostatic hypotension, drug--drug interactions and adverse drug reactions; older people often have complex co-morbidities and may have barriers to adherence to therapy. Drug therapy should be tailored to achieve a satisfactory BP reduction with minimal adverse effects. Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease in older people should be identified and addressed. Particular consideration should be given to the use of statins.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=102674755&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	932	Nurse Prescribing		932	parmar,paresh	parmar	paresh
659	Patient Participation In Pressure Injury Prevention: Giving Patient'S A Voice.	2014	935	10.1111/scs.12088	NLM24117711		170	28	4	648	Pressure injuries burden patients and healthcare organisations, with some preventative practices having little impact on prevalence reduction. Patient participation in care may be an effective pressure injury prevention strategy, yet patient preferences are unknown. The aim of this interpretive study was to describe patients' perceptions of their current and future role in pressure injury prevention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 adult inpatients recruited from four medical units, at two Australian metropolitan hospitals. Interview data were analysed using content analysis, with three categories emerging: 'experiencing pressure injuries'; 'participating in pressure injury prevention'; and 'resourcing pressure injury prevention and treatment'. These categories reflect the complex nature of participants' pressure injury experience. The findings suggest participants gather pressure injury knowledge from first-hand and vicarious experience; knowledge they bring to hospital. Most participants preferred a proactive pressure injury prevention role. Many identified barriers in the healthcare environment that impeded their participation and affected their experience of pressure injuries and pressure injury prevention. If patient participation as a pressure injury prevention strategy is to be considered, nurses and organisations need to view patients as partners.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=103858880&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	935	latimer,sharon	latimer	sharon
660	Biopsychosocial Aspects And The Complexity Of Care Of Hospitalized Elderly.	2014	937	10.1590/19820194201400071			937	27	5	427	Objective: To investigate the biopsychosocial aspects and aspects of the health system of hospitalized elderly and to classify their degree of care complexity. Methods: This was a quantitative study whose convenience sample consisted of 279 elderly. The Interdisciplinary Medicine Instrument (INTERMED) method was used, a tool that identified biopsychosocial aspects and conditions of the health system and classified the complexity of the patient. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis. Results: The prevailing profile was of elderly women, retired, white, with low educational levels, married and satisfied with their life conditions. The mean age was 72.3 years. The biological domain was the most compromised. As for the complexity of care, 34.8% of the patients required multiprofessional care. Conclusion: The elderly had high care complexity, with the biological and health system domains being the most compromised.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=99022122&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	937	Acta Paulista de Enfermagem		937	ozello,gutierrez.beatriz.aparecida	ozello	gutierrez.beatriz.aparecida
661	An Examination Of Assessment Arrangements And Service Use For Older People In Receipt Of Care Management.	2014	939	10.1891/1521-0987.15.2.66			939	15	2	66	With anticipated greater demand for formal care services globally, this article examines the sociodemographic and health characteristics of frail older people in receipt of community support. Data were collected from audits of case files of older people receiving care management at two time points during which two government policy initiatives were implemented to promote greater standardization in health and social care provision for older people in England. Findings at Time 2 revealed that there were higher levels of physical and mental impairment and more health care assessments undertaken. There was a slight decrease in home care receipt but a marginal increase of more intensive home care provision. Service users living with a carer were less likely to receive home care but more likely to receive respite care or day care than those living alone. The policy goal of widening access to specialist health and social care services for older people with mental health problems was achieved. Guidance that focused eligibility criteria on the identification of older people with complex needs required the availability of appropriate support and services. Irrespective of policy initiatives, the sociodemographic characteristics of older people and the availability of informal support are principal determinants of service provision.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=96546909&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	939	Care Management Journals		939	sutcliffe,caroline	sutcliffe	caroline
662	Electroceutical Therapy To Manage Complex Leg Ulcers: A Case Series Of Three Patients.	2014	940				940	10	2	96	Despite efforts to promote tissue repair, many wounds heal slowly, do not heal or deteriorate. Management of these chronic wounds is a growing problem. Innovation and cost cutting is key to current health policy and therefore clinicians should be taking advantage of emerging technologies that can improve outcomes for patients while reducing costs. Accel-Heal is an innovative electroceutical device that uses a patented synapse sequence programmed to deliver a specific series of electric energy interactions through the skin to manipulate gene expression and modify specific physiological functions in dermal tissue, improving and accelerating healing. This article examines the use of Accel-Heal in three case studies.  INSET: Box 1.

663	Community Palliative Care Clinical Nurse Specialists: A Descriptive Study Of Nurse–Patient Interactions.	2014	942	10.12968/ijpn.2014.20.5.246			311	20	5	246	Background: With an ageing population and changes to the UK process of commissioning health-care services, it is important that the role of the community palliative care clinical nurse specialist (CPC-CNS) is better understood. Aim: This study aimed to describe CPC-CNS activities during interactions with patients. Methods: Four CPC-CNSs were observed and audio-recorded during interactions with 34 patients. The data was assessed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Results: An enormous breadth of activities were observed, within a framework of assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation. Cross-cutting themes were real-time decision making, leadership, ability to respond to and coordinate complex and varied situations, and communication techniques. Data saturation was not achieved. Conclusion: CPC-CNSs provide multifaceted care, requiring wide-ranging knowledge to enable them to act as liaison points in a complex health service, respond independently to the fluctuating needs of patients, and provide effective advance care planning, particularly to those with advanced disease, multi-morbidity, and frailty.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=96208526&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	311	International Journal of Palliative Nursing	1	942	howell,debra	howell	debra
664	Social Provision And Loneliness Among Older People Suffering From Chronic Physical Illness. A Mixed-Methods Approach.	2014	947	10.1111/scs.12041	NLM23550895		170	28	1	104	Aims To describe and compare the perceived social provision for a group reporting never feeling lonely with that of a group reporting feeling lonely and to explore the meaning of loneliness. Subjects Participants (N = 101) were recruited from geriatric wards. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 65 years or more, the absence of dementia, one or more chronic physical disorders and plans to be discharged from the hospital to their home. The mean age was 81.3 years (range: 65-96 years), 68% were women, and 66% lived alone. Measures Assessments of social provisions and loneliness were collected by a subjective report using the Social Provision Scale ( SPS), and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS) was used to assess depression. The participants were also asked whether they felt lonely and were then asked to describe the meaning of loneliness if they had indicated feeling lonely. Narratives were then condensed by the participants into short sentences. Results Seventy-five per cent of the participants reported feeling lonely, of these 54% were living alone, and 18% identified with depression. Three subscales of SPS scores were significantly lower in the lonely group: attachment (p < 0.001), a sense of reliable alliance (p = 0.001) and the obtaining of guidance (p = 0.01). The overall view of the experience of loneliness was dominated by emptiness and negative emotions. The following themes were identified: Emotions were dominated by sadness, anxiety and restlessness, anger and guilt. Relationships were dominated by being left alone, being confined and feeling useless. Existential dimensions were characterised by emptiness, endless boredom, isolation and the potential for change. Conclusion The study shows that loneliness is prevalent among older people suffering from chronic physical illness and confirms the complexity of the concept. A mixed-methods design contributed to nuanced and detailed information about the meaning of loneliness.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104005342&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:25	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	947	kvaal,kari	kvaal	kari
665	In Search Of Quality Of Life For A Practical Centenarian And His Artistic Wife.	2013	950	10.1108/QAOA-08-2013-0024			950	14	4	270	Purpose - The purpose of this case study is to highlight the importance of empowering and meeting the 'higher needs' of the very old, which prolong a fulfilling life. Frailty in old age need not be feared and abhorred if society would accept that all of us need to live our lives as we wish until the end, and value those who assist us to do this. With the right attitudes to ageing and death and with the appropriate investment for a seamless care system that listens to, and functions well for those who need it, old age should be as enriching as any other time in life. Design/methodology/approach - Personal narrative of the author's parents ageing, this paper gives the background and personality of the frail older person and his wife, that contextualises the challenges they face in his very old age. The professional and personal experiences of the author as she tackles the obstacles to support them are drawn from her career in social care with memories from diaries written, as she accompanies her parents on their journey of physical and mental deterioration along with a quest for realising what they have and making the most of it. Findings - Given how challenging this journey is for an informed family, the implications are that in 2013 our 'civilised' society still misunderstands the special and complex needs of frail older people, devalues them, and writes them off with institutionalised, rigid attitudes and services instead of working creatively to improve their lives. The paper observes how deeply rooted this is in us all. Originality/value - The combination of the author's background in social work and expertise in health and care with living so close to relatively unusually long-lived parents, offers a unique insight into why it is so challenging to achieve quality of life for very older people needing care and should be of interest to CCGs, social services departments, older people's care providers and carer and user organisations.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104127216&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	950	Quality in Ageing & Older Adults		950	stevenson,annie	stevenson	annie
666	Professional Caregivers' Work With The Dying In Nursing Homes - A Foucault-Inspired Analysis Of Discourses In The Last Decade In A Danish Context.	2013	951	10.1111/scs.12021	NLM23336738		170	27	4	983	International studies on the death of elderly nursing home residents show the complexity in the understanding of the professionals who care for the dying. The aim of this study is to explore the discourses about professional caregivers caring for those dying in Denmark in the last decade. A discourse analysis inspired by Foucault was constructed. The material consists of different source documents: research articles, newspaper articles, theses, books, websites - 35 sources in total. There are constructed six positions of speech, five discourses and three themes: (1) 'the work of the professional caregivers - a complex low-status work'; (2) 'the education of the professionals - the way to ensure a good death or possessing the right qualifications' and (3) 'the vulnerable professionals'. The study concludes that an economical/political discourse is dominating and sets up the frames within which the professionals care for dying residents, although the medical, the social/critical and the religious discourses attempt to speak against it. All positions articulate that the professional caregivers' job has a low status and that it is not possible to provide an optimal care due to lack of time, resources and education. Psychical or mental demands make the professionals vulnerable. The meaning of optimal care varies according to the positions of speech.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104147763&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	951	nielsen,karen.t	nielsen	karen.t
667	The Importance Of Nutrition In Wound Healing.	2013	954				940	9	3	61	Wound healing is a complex process that follows a progressive three-step sequence; the inflammatory phase, proliferative phase and remodelling phase. It is possible that all of these phases will be active in the same wound at the same time (Thomas and Bishop, 2007) and the duration of each stage will be influenced, among other factors, by the nutritional status of the individual. This article focuses on the role of nutrition, and the benefits of protein supplementation, in the management of chronic wounds, with a focus on pressure ulcers.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=91934196&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	940	Wounds UK		954	acton,claire	acton	claire
668	Older Breast Cancer Survivors: Can Interaction Analyses Identify Vulnerable Subgroups? A Report From The American Cancer Society Studies Of Cancer Survivors.	2013	956	10.1188/13.ONF.325-336	NLM23803266		346	40	4	325	Purpose/Objectives: To explore interactions among personal, cancer, aging, and symptom variables relative to physical function (PF) in older adult breast cancer survivors to better identify vulnerable subgroups.Design: Secondary analysis of the American Cancer Society Studies of Cancer Survivors II.Setting: U.S. population-based mail and telephone survey.Sample: 2,885 breast cancer survivors from 14 different state cancer registries stratified by cancer type and time since diagnosis. A total of 184 female breast cancer survivors, aged 70 years or older, had complete data on variables of interest and were, therefore, included in this analysis.Methods: Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analysis was used to examine variable interactions.Main Research Variables: PF, symptom bother, comorbidity, social support, length of survivorship, treatment, stage, body mass index, physical activity, emotional health, and personal characteristics.Findings: An interaction effect between symptom bother and comorbidity was found in 39% of older adult breast cancer survivors, and an interaction effect between symptom bother and marital status was found in 40%. The most vulnerable group (8%) had high symptom bother and more than four comorbid conditions.Conclusions: Symptom bother, comorbidity, and marital status were found to have significant interactions such that high comorbidity and high symptom bother were significantly related to lower PF. Married participants with lower symptom bother had significantly higher PF scores. Comorbidity may be the best predictor of PF for the extreme ends of the symptom bother continuum. Advancing age alone was not a sufficient predictor of PF in this analysis.Implications for Nursing: Specific attention to symptom reports, comorbidity, and marital status can guide identification of older adult cancer survivors in need of ongoing survivorship care. The findings support use of a comprehensive assessment and tailored approach to care based on factors other than age.Knowledge Translation: CHAID interaction analysis may be useful in exploring complex nursing problems, such as the needs of older adult cancer survivors, and help oncology nurses develop appropriate interventions and referrals.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104186843&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	346	Oncology Nursing Forum	1	956	bellury,lanell	bellury	lanell
669	Care Coordination: Translating Policy Into Practice For Older People.	2013	957	10.1108/14717791311327033			950	14	2	81	Purpose -- The authors aim to present findings from their research on the implementation of Unified Assessment (UA) policy and the work of care coordinators who oversee the delivery of support to older people with complex needs. Design/methodology/approach -- A mixed methods approach included staff interviews (n 95) and focus groups (n = 3). Findings -- The care coordinator role is controversial and the lack of common terminology across health and social care obscures its importance. It is seen as a social care responsibility. Limited ownership amongst healthcare professionals leads to tensions in practice. The challenges of breaking down silo thinking embedded in established professional practices are highlighted as are infrastructural and capacity deficits. Disparities between policy intentions and practice means that UA is failing to meet core objectives relating to the delivery of seamless support. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to develop and evaluate evidence-informed interventions that test solutions to the problems faced in practice and support the delivery of more effective arrangements. Practical implications -- Practice development may be supported by: guidelines that are more prescriptive and include a formal role definition; joint training to promote shared understanding of key concepts; investment in administrative and IT infrastructures; and more coordinated direction at strategic level. Originality/value -- Over a decade has elapsed since the publication of UA Policy Guidance; however, there is limited published evidence on the effectiveness of UA policy and its translation into practice.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107964277&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	950	Quality in Ageing & Older Adults		957	seddon,diane	seddon	diane
670	Long-Term Experiences After Oesophagectomy/Gastrectomy For Cancer--A Focus Group Study.	2013	959	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.08.011	NLM22959588		141	50	1	44	Background: After surgery for oesophageal or gastric cancer, patients suffer from a variety of problems that affect their physical and mental health. Most previous studies on quality of life after this type of surgery are based on quantitative methods, and no studies to date have focused on the patient's subjective experiences of their quality of life from a long-term perspective. Objective: To illuminate patients' experiences of their quality of life, and how they handle their new life situation, from a long-term perspective, after oesophagectomy or gastrectomy for cancer. Method: This study was carried out in accordance with a descriptive explorative design focusing on the patients' quality of life after surgery for oesophageal/gastric cancer. Data collection was carried out using semi-structured focus group interviews. A total of 17 participants divided into 4 focus groups were included (2-5 years after elective surgery) in the study. Data was analysed with qualitative content analysis. Results: The results show that the patients' lives are severely hampered by adverse symptoms long time after surgery. The patients experienced the recovery period as a struggle and the theme ''When moving on becomes a struggle'' was shown to capture the patients' experiences. The main problems that acts as barriers in the patients' new life situation are those connected with nutrition and diarrhea who was shown not only affecting the patients from a physical perspective but also on a social and emotional level. The feeling of losing control of life was shown as a prominent problem and resulted in anxiety and fear about the future. Conclusion: This study shows that the patients' quality of life is heavily influenced by the remaining symptoms for a long time after surgery. However the patients ability to handle their new life situation does not only depend on the remaining symptom but on their ability to take control of the new life situation and learn to live life whit the symptoms instead of letting the symptoms limit their life. The complex new life situation that the patients meet after surgery motivates the needs of a supportive care programme, focusing on the patients' physical, mental and social needs.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104246665&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	141	International Journal of Nursing Studies	1	959	malmström,marlene	malmström	marlene
671	An Exploration Of The Hydration Care Of Older People: A Qualitative Study.	2012	961	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.04.009	NLM22575619		141	49	10	1200	Abstract: Background: Older adults are more susceptible to water imbalance and ensuring they drink sufficiently is a complex and challenging issue for nurses. The factors that promote adequate hydration and the barriers which prevent older people from drinking are not well understood. Objective: This study aimed to understand the complexity of issues associated with the hydration and hydration care of older people. Design: A qualitative study using multiple methods. Settings: Two healthcare sites providing care for older people in the South West of England: a hospital ward in a major hospital and a care home providing personal and nursing care. Participants: Twenty-one older people aged 68–96 years, were recruited to the study from the hospital ward and care home. The inclusion criteria for older people to participate were men or women aged 65 years and over and the exclusion criteria were being unable to provide informed consent, or being too ill or distressed to take part in the study. The staff participants of nurses and health care assistants totalled 21. The inclusion criterion for staff was any nurse or health care assistant providing hydration care. Seven friends or relatives participated by making anonymous comments via a suggestion box available to all friends and relatives. Methods: Data were collected via interviews with older people, focus group discussions involving staff, suggestion box comments made by friends and relatives and twelve hours observation of hydration practice. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Health professionals successfully employed several strategies to promote drinking including verbal prompting, offering choice, placing drinks in older people''s hands and assisting with drinking. Older people revealed their experience of drinking was diminished by a variety of factors including a limited aesthetic experience and a focus on fluid consumption rather than on drinking as a pleasurable and social experience. Conclusion: The rich and varied dimensions usually associated with drinking were lacking and the role of drinking beverages to promote social interaction was underplayed in both settings. Hydration practice which supports the individual needs of older people is complex and goes beyond simply ensuring the consumption of adequate fluids.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104420913&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	141	International Journal of Nursing Studies	1	961	godfrey,helen	godfrey	helen
672	Complexities Of Pain Assessment And Management In Hospitalised Older People: A Qualitative Observation And Interview Study.	2012	962	10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.05.002	NLM22640777		141	49	10	1243	Abstract: Background: Pain continues to be a common problem for older hospitalised patients, but little is known about how the complexities of actual clinical practice affect pain assessment and management in these patients. Objective: To examine how pain was assessed and managed in older patients who were admitted to geriatric evaluation and management units. Design, setting and participants: A naturalistic observational research design was used involving observations of interactions between nurses and patients, and follow-up interviews with nurses. Three observation periods were conducted between midnight and midday, which commenced at 03:30, 07:30, and 10:30, and three observation periods were conducted between midday and midnight, which commenced at 15:30, 18:30, and 22:30. Between 12 and 13 observations were conducted for each observation period, each ranging from 2 to 3h. The study was undertaken in two units, each located in an Australian public teaching hospital. Participants included registered nurses employed in the units, and patients in their care. Results: Four major themes were identified: communication among nurses and between older patients and nurses; strategies for pain management; environmental and organisational aspects of care; and complexities in the nature of pain. Nurses tended to use simple questioning with patients about the pain experienced. Despite the availability of ‘as required’ opioid medication for breakthrough or incident pain, nurses often preferred to wait to determine if pain was relieved following administration of fixed-dose paracetamol. Time of day impacted on how pain was managed due to availability of nursing staff. It was unit policy for doctors to reduce medications prescribed, which often extended to analgesics, and nurses were left to deal with patient tensions in addressing analgesic needs. Complexities were associated with the nature of pain experienced, in terms of perceived level of tolerable pain, the simultaneous presence of chronic and acute pain, location of pain, and differentiation of pain from discomfort. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the intricacies associated with how analgesic needs are addressed in older patients, especially those with communication deficits, the complex nature of older patients’ painful experiences, and the precarious balance of attempting to treat pain effectively while avoiding adverse effects of analgesics.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104420916&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	141	International Journal of Nursing Studies	1	962	manias,elizabeth	manias	elizabeth
673	Home Care For Older People In Sweden: A Universal Model In Transition.	2012	963	10.1111/j.1365-2524.2011.01046.x	NLM22141377		18	20	3	300	One aspect of universalism in Swedish eldercare services is that publicly financed and publicly provided services have been both affordable for the poor and attractive enough to be preferred by the middle class. This article identifies two trends in home care for older people in Sweden: a decline in the coverage of publicly funded services and their increasing marketisation. We explore the mechanisms behind these trends by reviewing policy documents and official reports, and discuss the distributional consequences of the changes by analysing two data sets from Statistics Sweden: the Swedish Level of Living surveys from 1988/1989 and 2004/2005 and a database on all users of tax deductions on household and care services in 2009. The analysis shows that the decline of tax-funded home care is not the result of changing eldercare legislation and was not intended by national policy-makers. Rather the decline was caused by a complex interplay of decision-making at central and local levels, resulting in stricter municipal targeting. The trend towards marketisation has been more clearly intended by national policy-makers. Legislative changes have opened up tax-funded services to private provision, and a customer-choice (voucher) model and a tax deduction for household- and care services have been introduced. As a result of declining tax-funded home-care services, older persons with lower education increasingly receive family care, while those with higher education are more likely to buy private services. The combination of income-related user fees, customer-choice models and the tax deduction has created an incentive for high-income older persons to turn to the market instead of using public home-care services. Thus, Swedish home care, as a universal welfare service, is now under threat and may become increasingly dominated by groups with less education and lower income which, in turn, could jeopardise the quality of care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=104552436&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	963	szebehely,marta	szebehely	marta

The presence of multiple comorbidities and associated frailty make management of an already complex disease process more challenging. A practical and pragmatic approach is presented in this paper with regards to pharmacological interventions, the role of heart failure specialist nurses in the context of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and end-of-life care issues.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=70905466&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	967	British Journal of Cardiac Nursing	1	967	desai,tejal	desai	tejal
675	The Experience Of Patients With Complex Wounds And The Use Of Npwt In A Home-Care Setting.	2011	972	10.12968/jowc.2011.20.11.512			853	20	11	512	Objective: To explore the experience of patients living with complex wounds and the impact of undergoing negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) as part of their treatment.Method: Qualitative data were collected from eight patients, using semi-structured interviews. A purposive, stratified sampling approach was used to identify participants with a range of wound types, as well as age and gender. Participants were recruited from one primary care trust and were interviewed, following 10 days of treatment with NPWT. The matrix-based 'Framework' approach, from the National Centre for Social Research, was used to structure the analysis.Results: Of the eight participants recruited, five were female and three male, with an age range of 46-77 years. Five overarching categories, with their constituent themes, were identified from the data. The first, developing a wound through crisis, has three themes: a failing body, missed diagnosis and failed professional intervention. The second category, decreased control, has four related themes: poor communication; failed wound healing; poor discharge planning and failure to recover. The third category, increased control, has four themes: understanding what is happening; symptom control; positive professional relationships and returning to health. The fourth category, using NPWT, has two themes: information and understanding of NPWT and expectations and experience of NPWT. The final category sets out participant recommendations about the device and has two themes: device issues and improving professional practice.Conclusion: This study investigated the experience of patients undergoing NPWT for complex wounds in the home setting and reveals a number of the psychosocial effects of using this therapy in this environment. Participants saw NPWT as an active intervention, associated with improved wound healing and symptom control. The participant experience described in this study, and the recommendations they make, provide a valuable resource to inform service improvement programmes and wound research.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=70851602&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	1	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	853	Journal of Wound Care	1	972	moffatt,c.j	moffatt	c.j

678	A Multifaceted Intervention To Address A Case Cluster Of Cellulitis Associated With Hypodermoclysis In A Geriatric Complex Continuing Care Unit.	2010	986				986	25	2	101	Purpose To assess whether a multifaceted inter vention can reduce the incidence of cellulitis in patients receiving hypoder moclysis on a complex continuing care unit in a geriatric facility. Method The multifaceted intervention consisted of the following: in-services on the safety engineered devices for nurses and education to reinforce best practice techniques; implementation of checklist auditing tool to monitor procedure, frequency and duration of hypodermoclysis; updating Baycrest nursing skills package; upgrading from 0.5% to 2% chlorhexidine gluconate skin preparation solution; switching from V-adapter to a single-port system. The main outcome measure was the number of documented cellulitis cases on the unit post-i ntervention. Results From September 1 to November 30, 2008, 12 cases of cellulitis associated with hypodermoclysis were documented. Post-intervention, three case of hypodermoclysis-associated cellulitis were documented. The frequency of hypodermoclysis pre-intervention was 68.6 per 1000 patient days versus postintervention at 63.1. The hypodermoclysis-related cellulitis incidence on the unit decreased Significantly from 23.2 pre-intervention to 6.6 post-intervention per 1000 patient days (p < 0.05, chisquare analysis). Conclusion A multifaceted intervention was successful in reducing the incidence of cellulitis associated with hypodermoclysis on a complex and continuing care unit in a geriatric facility.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105074980&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	986	Canadian Journal of Infection Control		986	candon,heather.l	candon	heather.l
679	The Link Between Chronic Conditions And Urinary Incontinence.	2010	987				987	16	1	7	Urinary incontinence is commonly associated with chronic diseases. Strong associations exist between continence problems, impairments outside the lower urinary tract and activity limitations. These associations also occur in diseases that directly affect the neurological control mechanism for continence. The World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a paradigm for thinking about disease and its consequences, including urinary incontinence. This paper reviews the association between disease, impairment and activity limitation for some common chronic diseases and for older adults. The complexity of the relationships between different aspects of urinary incontinence has important implications for the assessment and management of urinary incontinence in chronic disease and for older adults.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105141180&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	987	Australian & New Zealand Continence Journal		987	chiarelli,p	chiarelli	p

681	Relational Practice As The Key To Ensuring Quality Care For Frail Older People: Discharge Planning As A Case Example.	2009	994	10.1108/14717794200900024			994	10	3	44	Discharging frail older people from acute hospital settings has been an issue of concern for over 40 years and recent studies suggest that enduring problems remain. This paper explores the experiences of discharge from three different units: an acute surgical ward, an acute medical ward and a specialist ward for older people. Based on extensive data from interviews with older people, their family carers and ward-based staff, a grounded theory of the discharge experience is presented. This suggests that the quality of discharge hinges largely on whether the focus of efforts is on 'pace' (the desire to discharge older people as rapidly as possible) or 'complexity' (where due account is taken of the complex interaction of medical and wider social issues). When pace is the focus, 'pushing' and 'fixing' are the main processes driving discharge. However, when attention is given to complexity, far more subtle processes of 'informing' and 'brokering' are in evidence. These latter processes are conceived of as forms of 'relational practice' and it is argued that such practices lie at the heart of high quality care for older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105322109&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	994	Quality in Ageing		994	williams,s	williams	s
682	Reliability And Validity Of The Korean Version Of The Way-Finding Effectiveness Scale For Persons With Dementia.	2009	997	10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02649.x	NLM19220622		351	18	11	1625	Aims and objectives. To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Way-finding Effectiveness Scale (WES) for Korean persons with dementia (PWDs). Design. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey method was used. Methods. Data were collected with a non-probability sampling strategy using structured format face-to-face interviews. A convenience sample of 83 community-dwelling PWDs and their family caregivers were recruited. The participants were PWDs who were over 60 years of age, had been medically diagnosed with dementia or showed signs and symptoms of dementia, had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of less than 24 of 30 and were independent in walking. Results. Internal consistency for the 29-item KWES was 0·93 and exceeded 0·70 for the four subscales (complex way-finding goals, CWG; analytic strategy, AS; global strategy, GS; and simple way-finding goals, SWG). The intercorrelations for total KWES and subscales demonstrated a high to moderate relationship ranging from 0·84 (total and CWG) to 0·24 (AS and SWG). Pearson correlations between each subscale scores of the KWES and K-MMSE demonstrated significant, moderate relationships ranging from 0·41 (CWG and K-MSE) to 0·28 (AS and K-MMSE). Differences in current and prior behaviour of KWES were significant for the total (t = -21·00, p < 0·001) and subscales (t = -28·33- -9·33, p < 0·001). Conclusion. Acceptable reliabilities and validities support the conclusion that the KWES is a valid and reliable instrument for examining way-finding effectiveness for Korean PWDs. Relevance to clinical practice. The KWES will contribute to the development of understanding of way-finding ability for community-dwelling PWDs in both research and clinical practices.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105537648&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	351	Journal of Clinical Nursing (Wiley-Blackwell)	1	997	hong,gs	hong	gs
683	Delayed Transfer From Hospital To Community Settings: The Older Person'S Perspective.	2009	998	10.1111/j.1365-2524.2008.00796.x	NLM18564193		18	17	1	45	Prevention and management of delayed transfer of older people from hospital to community settings is an enduring issue in industrialised societies and is the subject of many recent policies in the United Kingdom. A deeper, evidence-based understanding of the complex organizational and interprofessional issues which contribute to delays in transfer has emerged in recent years. Despite this, and the relative success of recent policies, two recent reviews of the area highlight the lack of studies on patients' perspectives. We sought to address this deficit by using conversational interviews and a phenomenological approach to explore and interpret participants' perceptions of delayed transfer from hospital into the community. A purposive sampling strategy was employed to incorporate participants from different categories of delay identified on weekly Situation Reports. Participants aged 65 years and over (mean age 82 ± 5.4 years) and with a mean delay of 32 days (± 26) were recruited from three hospitals based in two NHS Trusts in the South of England. This paper focuses on their perceptions of the effects of delayed transfer into the community, their involvement in discharge planning and future community care needs. Our findings show that participants actively or passively relinquished their involvement in the processes of discharge planning because of the perceived expertise of others and also feelings of disempowerment secondary to poor health, low mood, dependency, lack of information and the intricacies of discharge planning processes for complex community care needs. Participants expressed a longing for continuity, emphasised the importance of social contact and sometimes appeared unrealistic about their future care needs. While current policies may have helped reduce overall numbers of delayed patients in the UK, our study suggests that there is scope for improvement in the involvement of delayed patients in planning their discharge into the community.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105599459&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	998	swinkels,a	swinkels	a
684	A Case Study Of A Canadian Homelessness Intervention Programme For Elderly People.	2008	1000	10.1111/j.1365-2524.2008.00783.x	NLM18371167		18	16	6	593	The aims of this study were to describe: (1) how the Homelessness Intervention Programme addressed the needs of elderly people who were homeless or at risk of homelessness; and (2) the factors that influenced the ability of the programme to address client needs. The programme was offered by a multi-service non-profit agency serving low-income families and individuals in an urban neighbourhood in Ontario, Canada. Using a case study approach, we conducted 10 individual interviews and three focus groups with programme clients, programme providers, other service providers and programme funders. Programme providers completed intake forms, monthly follow-up forms and exit/housing change forms for each of the 129 clients served by the programme over a 28-month period. Approximately equal proportions of clients were between 54 years old and 65 years old (47%) and over 65 years (53%). There were equal proportions of women and men. In addition to being homeless or marginally housed, clients lived with multiple and complex issues including chronic illness, mental illness and substance abuse. Through the facilitation of continuity of care, the programme was able to meet the needs of this vulnerable group of elderly people. Three types of continuity of care were facilitated: relational, informational and management continuity. The study confirmed the value of a continuous caring relationship with an identified provider and the delivery of a seamless service through coordination, integration and information sharing between different providers. Study findings also highlighted the broader systemic factors that acted as barriers to the programme and its ability to meet the needs of elderly people. These factors included limited housing options available; limited income supports; and lack of coordinated, accessible community health and support services. The central findings stress the importance of continuity of care as a guiding concept for intervention programmes for homeless and marginally housed elderly people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105564657&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	1000	ploeg,j	ploeg	j
685	Exploring Relationship Of Psychotropic Medications To Fall Events In An Inpatient Geriatric Psychiatric Population.	2008	1001				1001	14	1	1698	Background: Falls are the leading cause of serious injury and deaths among the elderly. A recent study found that psychotropic medication had the strongest relationship to a fall episode. Objectives: To examine the relationship of psychotropic medications to falls in an inpatient geriatric psychiatric setting, and utilize this knowledge to enhance fall prevention strategies in psychiatric settings. Design: One-year prospective, exploratory and descriptive study. Results: Patients age >/=70 were slightly more than 5 times as likely to fall, and those on atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants were approximately 1/5th as likely to. Conclusions: Falls have multiple causes and prevention requires a multifaceted approach. Antipsychotics should be used with caution, especially among elderly with a high risk of falls. Each hospital fall should be examined in 'real' time, and evaluated regarding patients' symptoms, medications, and co-morbidities. There is a great need to continue to study and learn as much as possible about the complex array of factors that contribute to the phenomena of falls in an acute geriatric psychiatric hospital unit.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105601238&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	1001	International Journal of Psychiatric Nursing Research	1	1001	blair,ew	blair	ew

A total of 24 seniors participated in individual face-to-face interviews. Through thematic analysis, the overarching theme identified that past experiences, life transitions, and future concerns influence seniors' participation in physical activity. This overarching theme helps explain the complexity of physical activity participation in later life. The subthemes included intergenerational influences, establishment of early physical activity patterns, family transitions over the life course, changing health status over the life course, and future health concerns. A greater understanding of an individual's life history is paramount for nurses to help increase participation in physical activity among seniors.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105793795&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	999	Journal of Gerontological Nursing	1	1003	weeks,le	weeks	le

688	Evaluation Of A Generic Integrated Care Pathway For Rehabilitation.	2007	1005				1005	25	2	62	Objective The aim of this study was to determine if a process-oriented integrated care pathway (ICP) was effective in a rehabilitation setting and whether the improvement gained through the rehabilitation process was sustained post discharge. Design This study incorporated a quantitative analysis of the Barthel Index Score (BIS) for a retrospective convenience sample of patients who had been discharged from the rehabilitation unit. A longitudinal examination of this sample group was conducted and BIS results were compared between admission, upon discharge, and three months post discharge. Setting The study was conducted at a rehabilitation unit (the Unit) at a medium-sized general hospital in a rural centre northwest of Melbourne, Victoria Subjects The sample consisted of a convenience sample of thirty participants who were discharged from the Unit between December 2003 and January 2004. The mean age of participants was 75 years. Main outcome measures Health outcomes and improvements in functional and dependency status were determined using the Barthel Index Score (BIS). Results The introduction of the generic clinical pathway yielded positive results with the sample group maintaining functional status and independence post discharge. Conclusions Although this study is limited by sample size and homogeneity of sample; nevertheless it demonstrates that process-oriented integrated care pathways may be useful to effectively manage rehabilitation and aged-care units that contain patients with a wide range of complex presentations and diagnosis-related groups.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105872364&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1005	Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing	1	1005	chew,d	chew	d

Analyses were based on interviews with 78 older adults recruited from a large urban case management program. To be eligible for the study, the older adult had to coreside with an individual under age 60 who had disabilities or chronic health problems and/or with minors. Results indicated that the majority of older adults were primary caregivers for at least one younger individual. In a substantial number of families, the older adult depended on a younger adult with disabilities for primary care. Older adults who lived with both younger adults with disabilities and minors experienced more negative affect than those who lived with only one of these two kinds of younger individuals. Positive affect among elders living with younger adults with disabilities was positively related to the number of formal services received by the younger adults. The implications of these findings for service delivery to families with complex needs for care are discussed.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105946461&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	939	Care Management Journals		1006	essex,el	essex	el

691	Exploring Determinants For Quality Of Life Among Older People In Pain And In Need Of Help For Daily Living.	2007	1009				1009	16	1	95	Aims and objectives.  The aim of the study was to investigate the quality of life and related factors among older people who are in pain and in need of help to manage daily living. Background.  To intervene against the low quality of life in nursing care knowledge about factors affecting it is needed and this is especially important for vulnerable people such as those who suffer from pain and who are in need of help to manage daily living. Methods.  Five hundred and twenty-six people, aged 75–102 years participated in this study. Results.  Those in pain reported a significantly higher degree of all complaints and lower quality of life in all measures compared with those not in pain. Overall quality of life was associated with mobility problems, sleeping problems and depressed mood, while health-related quality of life was associated with living in special accommodations, walking problems, mobility problems and fatigue. Conclusions.  Those in need of help to manage daily living and in pain seem to be at higher risk of lowered quality of life than those not in pain and the lower quality of life among those in pain is probably caused by the complex of complaints rather than pain per se. Relevance to clinical practice.  Daily nursing care should identify and treat the complex of complaints related to pain as well as pain itself, to improve everyday life and quality of life for older people in pain.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105705059&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1009	Journal of Nursing & Healthcare of Chronic Illnesses	1	1009	jakobsson,u	jakobsson	u
692	Framing The Public Health Of Caregiving.	2007	1011	10.2105/AJPH.2004.059337	NLM17194871		362	97	2	224	Caregiving has only recently been acknowledged by the nation as an important topic for millions of Americans. A psychological or sociological approach to care-giving services has been most often applied, with little attention to the population-based public health outcomes of caregivers. We conceptualize caregiving as an emerging public health issue involving complex and fluctuating roles. We contend that caregiving must be considered in the context of life span needs that vary according to the ages, developmental levels, mental health needs, and physical health demands of both caregivers and care recipients.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105945348&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	362	American Journal of Public Health	1	1011	talley,rc	talley	rc
693	Definition Of Health And Health Promotion Behaviors Among Midwestern Old Order Amish Families.	2006	1012				1012	12	3	44	OBJECTIVES: To investigate health beliefs and behaviors among Old Order Amish. METHODS: 87 Old Order Amish adults. Open-ended questions and quantitative measures - Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), and Perceived Social Support (PSS) scales. Hermeneutic analysis of qualitative data. Comparison of means of quantitative measures across gender and generation using ANOVA. RESULTS: Support for multidimensional concept of health, 2) Dominance across generations of exercise/physical activity and nutrition as health-maintaining behavior, 3) Definition of health as ability to continue working to provide for family, 4) Work-related physical activity most frequent health-maintaining behavior; 5) Internal-HLOC consistently scored most highly; 6) Chance-HLOC scores were higher than powerful others-HLOC scores; 7) HPLP - nutrition ranked among highest and exercise ranked lowest; and 8) PSS family scores were higher than PSS friends scores. CONCLUSIONS: Strong Amish family support system makes family involvement in health maintenance essential, 2) Findings important for clinicians working with persons who prefer natural remedies to complex scientific options, 3) Evidence that health/illness of culturally-diverse rural persons may be unique, and 4) Need for further examination of cultural appropriateness of measures in research with diverse groups.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106227863&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1012	Journal of Multicultural Nursing & Health (JMCNH)	1	1012	armer,jm	armer	jm
694	Ways Of Relating To Death: Views Of Older People Resident In Nursing Homes.	2006	1013	10.12968/ijpn.2006.12.7.21611	NLM16926732		311	12	7	334	Few studies shed light on what older people themselves consider a good or dignified death. This study is part of a larger project where interviews were used to follow 12 nursing home residents over time. The aim of the present study was to reach a deeper understanding of seven older people's thoughts, feelings and attitudes towards death. The participants were interviewed on four occasions across 18-24 months, and the interviews were analysed using a hermeneutic method. The findings revealed three main themes: 1. Zest for life, 2. Indifferent additude, 3. Longing for death. The themes mirror the complexity of what ageing and nearing the end of life can mean. A strong desire among the participants was to be more involved in their own personal care and in everyday life at the nursing home. Person-oriented care based on the philisophy of palliative care, and including conversation as a natural component, might promote the older person's possiblities to obtain a good death.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106358693&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	311	International Journal of Palliative Nursing	1	1013	ternestedt,b	ternestedt	b
695	Fostering Student Interest In Geriatric Nursing: Impact Of Senior Long-Term Care Experiences.	2006	1014		NLM16921803		341	27	4	190	Preparing nurses to meet the care needs of an expanding aging population is a challenge for nursing. Student experience in long-term care is typically limited to initial practicums. Students are rarely able to appreciate the complexity, challenge, and rewards of geriatric nursing. Few students seek geriatric nursing roles upon graduation, and care facilities report an inability to fill current vacancies. This article describes the integration of long-term care experiences into senior year community health practicums and reports on a qualitative analysis to evaluate the project's impact on student attitudes and intentions toward geriatric nursing roles.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106338070&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	341	Nursing Education Perspectives (National League for Nursing)	1	1014	williams,kn	williams	kn
696	Technological Dependency -- The Experience Of Using Home Ventilators And Long-Term Oxygen Therapy: Patients' And Families' Perspective.	2006	1015	10.1111/j.1471-6712.2006.00375.x	NLM16489956		170	20	1	18	Technological dependency is defined as a short or long-term reliance on machines and techniques to evaluate, satisfy or resolve health problems. In nursing technological dependency has been explored in the context of caring. Hitherto it has been maintained that technology and caring are contradictory, but a more prominent view is that technology and caring can and must be reconciled to provide high-quality care. This study describes patients' and families' experience of long-term home treatment with noninvasive ventilation during sleep with or without additional oxygen therapy. Considering the potential burden of undergoing this treatment the research question is: What is patients' and families' experience of being dependent on technical breathing assistance during sleep? The methodological approach draws from interpretive phenomenology and narrative analysis. Participants were six patients aged 45-70, five spouses and one daughter. Data, generated through two 1-hour semi-structured interviews with each pair of participants, were analysed into themes. Results are presented by the following narratives: (i) mixed blessing: life-saving treatment - meaningless exertion; (ii) compassion and understanding central amid use of complex machines; (iii) listening to the body; (iv) wanting to be seen as healthy; (v) dominance of technological thinking; and (vi) sustained work in maintaining the treatment. It is concluded that being dependent on technical breathing assistance during sleep, with or without oxygen, was a major life event for participants. The treatment was experienced as constraining and intrusive, particularly at the beginning, but concurrently it dramatically relieved difficulties for most participants. Regardless of its usefulness it provoked questions on purpose, indicating that the way to implement the treatment is crucial. Professionals need to pay close attention to how they introduce noninvasive ventilation technique, putting caring concern and respect for unique needs of patients and their families at the forefront.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106426086&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:26	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	1015	ingadóttir,ts	ingadóttir	ts

More of these patients are choosing to be managed conservatively, without dialysis. Palliative provision for these patients within UK renal services is limited, but the recent National Service Framework for Renal Services (Department of Health, 2005) has promoted service development. However, few models of service provision have been described. This article describes a retrospective review of a new service for conservatively-managed patients with end-stage renal disease. The range and complexity of the health needs of this population is demonstrated, and an example of service development described. A model of the stages of the conservative pathway and appropriate interventions was developed. The absence of research evidence prevented development of formal audit standards, and highlighted the urgent need for evaluation of models of care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106422407&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	208	British Journal of Nursing	1	1016	murtagh,fem	murtagh	fem
698	What Does Phenomenology Offer To The Study Of Care-Giving?	2006	1017		NLM16459889		1001	11	2	1241	Care giving to a dementia sufferer is complex (Parsons, 1997) and inherently stressful (Baldwin et a1 1989). It is suggested that the predominance of the care-giver stressor-burden research paradigm during the last thirty years has frequently been uni-dimensional, objectively oriented, generally equivocal, and unconvincing in its findings. Dillehay and Sandys (1990), suggest that preoccupation with such typically narrow approaches has delayed the much-needed development of a more accurate understanding of the lived experience (the phenomenology of are-giving). Researching the experience of care giving to a dementing relative requires a research strategy, which acknowledges the intricacies, complexities, subjectivity and humanness of that experience. That is the premise behind this paper. A multi-dimensional phenomenological PhD study is presented. The focus is on understanding care giving from the individual and collective perspectives of forty-six spouse caregivers. The methodological implications (including influences of Husserl and Heidegger) are outlined before the phenomenological research fmdings are presented and discussed. Ethical approval was given by the Bassetlaw Hospital and Community NHS Trust Ethics Committee (now part of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust).	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106408794&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1001	International Journal of Psychiatric Nursing Research	1	1017	upton,n	upton	n
699	Deconditioning In The Hospitalized Elderly.	2005	1018		NLM16121472		1018	101	6	16	Deconditioning is a complex process of physiological change following a period of inactivity, bedrest or sedentary lifestyle. It results in functional losses in such areas as mental status, degree of continence and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. It is frequently associated with hospitalization in the elderly. The most predictable effects of deconditioning are seen in the musculoskeletal system and include diminished muscle mass, decreases of muscle strength by two to five per cent per day, muscle shortening, changes in periarticular and cartilaginous joint structure and marked loss of leg strength that seriously limit mobility. The decline in muscle mass and strength has been linked to falls, functional decline, increased frailty and immobility. The authors describe a three-pronged strategy to combat deconditioning that includes a model of care appropriate to the growing population of elderly clients, the creation of an 'elder-friendly' hospital environment and an exercise program.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106513880&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1018	Canadian Nurse	1	1018	gillis,a	gillis	a
700	Family, Caring And Ageing In The United Kingdom.	2005	1020		NLM15737166		170	19	1	53	This paper provides a critical exploration of the assumptions and narratives underpinning the development of social policy initiatives targeting caring relationships based upon family ties. Using a narrative approach attention is drawn to the ways in which family identities are open to a far greater range of negotiation than is assumed by policy. Drawing on the United Kingdom as a case example, questions are posed about intergenerational relations and the nature of late life citizenship. The comparatively recent invention of narratives supporting 'informal care' and the link with neo-liberal and 'third way' notions of active citizenship are explored. As is the failure of policy developments to take into account the diversity of care giving styles and the complexity of caring relationships. It is argued that the uneven and locally specific ways in which policy develops enables the co-existence of a complex range of narratives about family, caring and ageing which address diverse aspects of the family life of older people in often contradictory ways.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106624348&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	1020	gilbert,t	gilbert	t

702	Do They Look After Their Own? Informal Support For South Asian Carers.	2004	1022	10.1111/j.1365-2524.2004.00509.x	NLM15373818		18	12	5	398	Policy on care in the community was founded on the premise that the care of frail elderly people with disabilities would be a joint responsibility for health and social care professionals, and family carers, supported by people within their social networks. The policy assumes that such social networks are common features of all communities in contemporary Britain, containing a reserve of people who can be called upon to provide support to carers. The present paper draws on material gathered for a qualitative study of the experiences carers in South Asian communities to examine the quality and quantity of informal support that was available in different types of households. Male and female carers were selected from the Punjabi Sikh, Gujarati Hindu, and Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities. A total of 105 carers participated in the project. Participants were caring for people in all age groups with physical and/or mental distress, and in some cases, with multiple and complex impairments. The analysis of carers' accounts suggested that, for a variety of reasons, the main carer, irrespective of gender, had limited support both in nuclear and extended households. In addition, societal attitudes towards disability and the fear of obligation prevented the seeking and accepting of help from wider social networks. The paper concludes that the evidence does not support the assumption about extended families, and their willingness and ability to support carers. Many issues highlighted in this paper have far-reaching implications for policy makers in many countries in the West where South Asian people have made their homes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106676966&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	1022	katbamna,s	katbamna	s
703	Learning And Performing Care Management: Experiences Of A Newly Formed Interdisciplinary, Assessment And Rehabilitation Team.	2004	1023	10.1111/j.1473-6861.2004.00069.x			1023	3	3	129	Developments in primary and intermediate care services have enhanced interest in the notion of care management, the processes that it encompasses and the challenges that it poses to practitioners who are more used to working in a uni- or multidisciplinary manner. This article explores the way that a set of practitioners, new to care management, coped with the challenges of working within a newly created care-managed assessment and rehabilitation service for older people in one UK county. Data were gathered via non-participant observation, and group and individual interviews, as part of a wider action-research evaluation study. Three themes emerged from the data: the processes of 'learning' to become a care manager; 'doing' care management; and 'experiences' of the role. In order to 'learn' care management, staff needed to develop a range of new skills, establish supportive care-management processes, develop a new identity and work in an interdisciplinary way. 'Doing' care management involved working with a small group of patients with complex needs and precarious levels of homeostasis. Problem solving and crisis management were key activities and often required a creative approach to practice. Although care managers derived great satisfaction from their role, their 'experiences' were characterized by stress and anxiety. The practitioners from healthcare backgrounds needed more preparation to adapt to their new levels of responsibility and client risk. Successful management of the transition to care manager requires support from the key stakeholders and strong leadership within care manager teams. In-house competency-based training and induction programmes, and mentorship, can also play an important role, together with innovative forms of postqualifying education and training, for example, via job exchanges or an apprenticeship model.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106556262&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1023	Learning in Health & Social Care		1023	kneafsey,r	kneafsey	r

Increasingly, family members and friends are being called on to provide complex levels of care for older loved ones, which lends to both psychological and physiological stressors for the caregivers (Donelan et al., 2002). A variety of interventions have been implemented to help caregivers cope with the stresses associated with this demanding role.

705	Support For Family Carers Who Care For An Elderly Person At Home -- A Systematic Literature Review.	2004	1025		NLM15147473		170	18	2	111	Family carers are a major source of help and assistance to the persons they provide care for. They are also major contributors to the welfare system, balancing the national health care expenditure. Increasing attention, in research as well as government policy, is being paid to their role as informal caregivers. Support to family carers seems to be a new 'buzzword' in Swedish Government policy. However, supporting family carers may prove to be a more complex endeavour than one initially might be led to believe. Support could here be understood as any services, assistances, education, information, attitudes, and lay or professional person's provision for the benefit of the family carer. The aim of this systematic review was to identify modes of, and scientific evidence on, support for family carers of cohabiting elderly persons. The method followed a seven-step model: a focused research question was formulated creating a base for deriving search words and inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies. Systematic database searches identified several studies some of which were retrieved, critically appraised and classified by two independent reviewers. A total of 26 articles were finally included, revealing that family carers fear social isolation and wish to network in groups with peers, either for social or for learning needs purposes. Family carers also desire respite care. However, it is unclear whether they actually benefit from any of the above or how service provision should be attempted.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106759874&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	170	Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences	1	1025	stolz,p	stolz	p

Urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in more than two thirds of nursing home residents, was the focus of the faculty practice. Advanced practice nursing skills developed by students included advanced physical assessment and diagnostic reasoning techniques, critical appraisal of the scientific evidence for UI management, and the ability to teach evidence-based approaches to UI care to bedside nursing staff. Outcomes of the practice for the facilities included improved detection of urinary retention, reduced wetness rates, and strengthened systems of care for UI. Student outcomes included an increased sense of self-efficacy in management of UI and other complex geriatric problems. Complexity theory guides a discussion of how curriculum design and research-based practices can be implemented to enhance both student and facility outcomes.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106720196&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1027	Journal of Nursing Education	1	1027	mcconnell,es	mcconnell	es
708	Fall Prevention In Frail Elderly Nursing Home Residents: A Challenge To Case Management: Part I.	2003	1028		NLM14646782		1028	8	6	246	Parts I and II of this article examine the impact of a falls prevention program on the fall incidents among the residents in a nursing home. It was hypothesized that a diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approach should be used for nursing home residents identified as being at high risk for falls in order to reduce the number of fall incidents and to improve quality of life for this vulnerable population. The program effectively targeted both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to reduce risks facing the residents. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by examining changes in the rate of falls after the program was implemented. The results identified that a multifaceted program, one that utilized multiple personalized interventions, was effective in reducing the falls rate of frail (those with complex medical and psychosocial problems) nursing home residents, and that muscle-strengthening interventions may be beneficial for this vulnerable population. Program outcomes verified that case managers can impact quality of life for frail elderly nursing home residents by promoting their independence and safety, and postponing problems resulting from inactivity. Part I discusses the background and process of a falls program and factors contributing to the occurrence of falls. Part II will examine the interdisciplinary team approach to assessment, method, and implementing strategies for an effective fall prevention program. Tools used for prevention, monitoring, and investigation of falls will be detailed in Part II.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106708052&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	1028	Lippincott's Case Management	1	1028	theodos,p	theodos	p
709	Cognitive Impairment In Heart Failure: Issues Of Measurement And Etiology...Ce Online	2002	1031	10.4037/ajcc2002.11.6.520	NLM12425402		1031	11	6	520	BACKGROUND: Clinicians need easy methods of screening for cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure. If correlates of cognitive impairment could be identified, more patients with early cognitive impairment could be treated before the problem interfered with adherence to treatment. OBJECTIVES: To describe cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure, to explore the usefulness of 4 measures of cognitive impairment, and to assess correlates of cognitive impairment. METHODS: A descriptive, correlational design was used. Four screening measures of cognition were assessed in 42 patients with heart failure: Commands subtest and Complex Ideational Material subtest of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Draw-a-Clock Test. Cognitive impairment was defined as performance less than the standardized (T-score) cutoff point on at least 1 of the 4 measures. Possible correlates of cognitive impairment included age, education, hypotension, fluid overload (serum osmolality < 269 mOsm/kg), and dehydration (serum osmolality > or = 295 mOsm/kg). RESULTS: Cognitive impairment was detected in 12 (28.6%) of 42 participants. The 4 screening tests varied in effectiveness, but the Draw-a-Clock Test indicated impairment in 50% of the 12 impaired patients. A summed standardized score for the 4 measures was not significantly associated with age, education, hypotension, fluid overload, or dehydration in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is relatively common in patients with heart failure. The Draw-a-Clock Test was most useful in detecting cognitive impairment, although it cannot be used to detect problems with verbal learning or delayed recall and should not be used as the sole screening method for patients with heart failure. Correlates of cognitive impairment require further study.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106802155&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1031	American Journal of Critical Care	1	1031	riegel,b	riegel	b
710	Global Aging. The Complexities Of Documenting Clinical Information In Long-Term Care Settings In Australia.	2002	1033		NLM12035829		999	28	5	8	Clinical nursing documentation, written, verbal or supported by technology, is being affected by both the worldwide 'information explosion' and budgetary constraints. In Australia, the necessity of documenting complex care needs and treatment plans in older adult care settings has become more imperative because funding levels and sources are frequently tied to these documents. As a consequence, the statutory requirements for documentation have become a significant driving force in shaping nursing practice. Although the value of quality documentation is or should be recognized, the seemingly vast amounts of time required inevitably distracts nurses from what they see as their primary purpose-the provision of direct patient care. Older adults who are frail are among the most complex clients requiring services in what is traditionally a poorly resourced sector. Under-funding frequently impacts on the staff skill mix, resulting in low levels of senior, highly qualified, and skilled staff. These factors impact the quality of the documentation and possibly the usage of the information itself. This article will provide an overview of the issues related to documentation of clinical information in older adult care settings with particular reference to some of the 'unique' inefficiencies inherent in the Australian system.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106942319&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	999	Journal of Gerontological Nursing	1	1033	pelletier,d	pelletier	d
711	Managing Pain In The Older Adult Patient.	2002	1034				1034	24	1	10	This article reinforces the importance of pain management in the older adult population. It is important to first understand the complexity of pain in older adults as well as the myths health care providers may believe, which could lead to undertreatment of their pain. The older adult patient experiences many types of pain; in some cases, these individuals may have combined types of pain. Many medications can be given safely to older patients; nonopioids, opioids, and adjuvant medications can be tried for pain relief.

712	The Responsibility To Care For Single Homeless People.	2001	1036		NLM11846823		18	9	6	436	This paper examines the reasons why in contemporary Britain many single homeless people with severe physical and mental health problems and welfare needs do not receive the treatment, care and financial support that they manifestly need, and in particular considers the interaction between their personal characteristics and the organisation and the obligations of services. Homelessness is a complex concept associated with problems of housing, health, social care and income. The greatest weaknesses of the service system are that no single agency has a statutory responsibility to ensure that vulnerable homeless people are served, and none of the generalist welfare agencies have a duty to seek out those who do not present. As a result, single homeless people fall between the housing, health and social services and amass exceptional unmet needs. The paper appraises the approaches to single homeless people's problems that have recently been introduced by the Rough Sleepers' Unit (RSU), and discusses the ways in which current reforms of the welfare services may impact on the situation of homeless people. With the possibility that the RSU's prime responsibility for commissioning single homeless people's services will transfer to local authorities in 2002, the paper concludes by specifying the implications for voluntary and statutory providers and makes recommendations about the attribution of the responsibility to care for this vulnerable group.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106918715&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	18	Health & Social Care in the Community	1	1036	crane,m	crane	m
713	The Twilight Zone? Nhs Services For Older People In Residential And Nursing Homes.	2001	1037				994	2	2	3	This paper reviews evidence about the relationships between NHS services and nursing and residential homes in England and Wales. Since the transfer in 1993 of responsibility for funding nursing and residential home care for less affluent older people to local authority social services departments, nursing and residential care has been widely assumed to constitute part of 'social care' services. 'This obscures the fact that residents of nursing and residential care homes frequently have substantial and complex healthcare needs. While some of these healthcare needs may be met through the care provided within homes themselves, most will require substantial contributions from NHS medical, nursing, pharmaceutical and other services. The National Service Framework for Older People (Department of Health, 2001) prioritises reinvestment in intermediate care services, building on the expectation in The NHS Plan (Department of Health, 2000a) that residential and nursing homes will play a major role in the development of these services. This expectation has been further reinforced by the Concordat with the private and voluntary healthcare provider sector (Department of Health, 20001)). However there is little evidence about the NHS services which are currently provided to nursing and residential homes, nor about the capacity of mainstream NIPS services to meet the projected development of intermediate care services within the independent institutional sector. This paper reviews the evidence which is available and highlights some of the priorities which primary care groups in England (local health groups in Wales) will need to consider if they are to develop integrated and good quality services for frail older people.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107050290&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	994	Quality in Ageing		1037	jacobs,s	jacobs	s
714	Pegs And Ethics.	2001	1038		NLM11847863		1038	24	3	138	The ethics of dealing with the provision of nutritional therapies has been complicated by technological advances that have affected all of medical science. As a result, nurses are increasingly confronted with decisions regarding the provision of invasive treatments. Indeed, enormous faith is invested in the ability and wisdom of healthcare professionals to alleviate suffering and accomplish cure through the application of invasive therapeutic interventions such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Such decisions are often complex, present a moral dilemma, and are further complicated by prevailing politico-economic, social, and cultural influences. The insertion of tubes for artificial nutritional support in those patients who can be defined as 'vulnerable' is no exception. This article explores both the clinical and ethical realities of PEG tube placement and use thereafter in vulnerable patients. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice are discussed within the context of PEG placement and feeding and recommendations are given for nurses practicing in the area of gastroenterology.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107066443&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	1038	Gastroenterology Nursing	1	1038	mackie,sb	mackie	sb
715	Case Management For Elderly Persons With Heart Failure: The Quality Of Life And Cost Outcomes.	2001	1039				1039	10	2	71	Heart failure is an increasingly common, complex disease that has far-reaching consequences for patients, families, and the health care industry. An innovative care delivery model was developed and implemented with a group of elderly persons with heart failure. The Partners-in-Care Model included a patient monitoring protocol used in conjunction with ongoing care provided by a nurse case manager for the purpose of improving health outcomes for the elderly with heart failure. This delivery model was no more expensive than usual care and while no statistically significant differences in other outcomes were found, positive trends, including improved quality of elder life were identified.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107021635&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1039	MEDSURG Nursing	1	1039	pugh,lc	pugh	lc
716	Nursing Home Placement: Factors Affecting Caregivers' Decisions To Place Family Members With Dementia.	2001	1040		NLM11915265		999	27	2	44	While much is known about the risk factors or predictors of nursing home placement for the frail elderly, much less is known about the process of how caregivers make the decision to seek nursing home care for their elderly loved ones.This exploratory study used qualitative research methods to interview family caregivers of elderly family members with dementia about the decision-making process of whether or not to place their family member in a nursing home.The study found a number of factors influencing placement related decision-making, including independence, perceived presence of others, fear of loneliness, negative nursing home attitudes, sense of existential self, and guilt.The study suggests that the decision to place a family member in a nursing home is a complex one, and nurses may need to address deeper issues with clients who are unable to make a decision about nursing home care.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107020136&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	999	Journal of Gerontological Nursing	1	1040	hagen,b	hagen	b
717	The Importance Of Individualized Wheelchair Seating For Frail Older Adults.	2000	1042		NLM11883618		999	26	11	24	Individualized seating requires identifying an individual's body contours, range of motion, and orientation in space, and implementing a seating system that positions and supports the individual for comfort and function.Care providers and family members of frail older adults need to be aware that individualized seating can improve comfort and function.The 'one size fits all' approach to wheelchairs for frail elderly adults is being replaced with new knowledge and products that fit a wheelchair to the unique needs of the individual.Positive outcomes for individualized seating can include improved comfort and wheelchair tolerance, prevention of skin breakdown, improved self-care, better use of limited endurance, improved quality of life, and easing of caregiver burden.Until changes are made to third party payers' practices, obtaining funding for needed equipment can be a complex, slow, and uncertain process. Families and charitable organizations may need to be approached for individuals who lack resources to purchase needed equipment.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107000617&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	999	Journal of Gerontological Nursing	1	1042	rader,j	rader	j
718	Applying The Transitional Care Model To Elderly Patients With Heart Failure.	2000	1043	10.1097/00005082-200004000-00008	NLM10756474		5	14	3	53	Elderly patients with heart failure present a tremendous challenge to the current health care system. Decreased length of hospital stay for patients with increased numbers of comorbid conditions and complex medication regimens contribute to a revolving door of rehospitalizations. Using a transitional care model designed to decrease rehospitalizations, advanced practice nurses (APNs) in an ongoing clinical trial provide discharge planning in the acute care setting with home follow-up by the same APN for a 3-month period. This article reviews three case studies to provide a view of the complex and challenging situations in which elders with heart failure live and the care provided by APNs using the transitional care model to guide their practice. Social, economic, and emotional factors overlay the illness in each of these cases. The APNs, with advanced knowledge of cardiac disease and research-based management, help the patients and their caregivers to prioritize information and take the appropriate actions, while coping with the complexity of their conditions and the challenges they face. Keeping these patients from returning to the hospital provides evidence of the success of this transitional model of care.

719	Nursing Case Management For Psychogeriatric Patients And Their Families: Description Of A Clinical Model.	1998	702		NLM9719696		1045	33	3	529	A theoretical model of clinical case management for psychogeriatric patients and their families is described. Psychogeriatric patients often have complex health care needs, requiring specific nursing interventions. The increasing frailty of these patients over time, together with the risk for institutionalization, make professional nursing contribution to their care even more desirable. Nursing case management is described by means of a conceptual-operational continuum. On the conceptual site, the continuum includes a geriatric definition and core principles of case management. On the operational site, case management is described as a clinical system, a process, a technology, and a role. The process of case management is a deliberate, intellectual activity whereby the practice of nursing is approached in an orderly, systematic manner. It includes components of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The case management approach requires nurses to assume an active role in designing care maps and to work collaboratively with members of a multidisciplinary team. Copyright (c) 1998 by W.B.

720	Long-Term Care For Elderly Individuals And Methods For Financing.	1998	1046		NLM9631591		1046	15	2	77	As people age, there is an increase in chronic illness and disability and thus a growing need for long-term care. Unfortunately, the concept of long-term care can be very complex and confusing. Elderly individuals and their family members frequently have many questions, such as the following: What is long-term care, and who needs it? What long-term care services are available? Who will provide the services? Where will the services be provided? How much will the services cost, and who will pay for the expenses? Indeed, the cost of providing long-term care, whether in an institution or in one's own home, may represent an enormous burden for individuals and their families. Nurses, especially community health nurses, are in a prime position to address these questions and concerns to ensure appropriate care and services for their clients. This article addresses the questions clients frequently ask by defining long-term care and discussing long-term care services, settings, and providers. In addition, 4 methods of financing long-term care will be presented.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107280676&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1046	Journal of Community Health Nursing	1	1046	ross,met	ross	met
721	Failure To Thrive: The Silent Epidemic Of The Elderly.	1995	1047		NLM7755414		1047	9	2	99	Demographic changes have created the need for psychiatric nurses to examine knowledge and practice in the area of geropsychiatry. Older adults present unique challenges. The interaction of biological and psychosocial problems are most evident in the oldest old and necessitate a holistic approach. This report addresses psychosocial causes and treatment of 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT) in the elderly. FTT is a label commonly used to describe a complex of nonspecific symptoms that often leads to increased disability and premature death. Psychiatric nurses are challenged to take a leadership role in case finding, as well as assessment and intervention.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107410705&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	1047	Archives of Psychiatric Nursing	1	1047	kimball,mj	kimball	mj
722	Circles Of Care: Home Care And Community Support For Rural Older Adults.	1994	704		NLM8203828		1044	16	3	22	Rural dwelling, frail older adults are a vulnerable population owing to the complexity of health problems superimposed upon limited health care resources. Home care facilitates managing complex health needs and is congruent with rural valued independence. An ethnography was conducted to describe rural home care for frail older adults from the perspective of those delivering and receiving services. A major theme identified was 'Circles of Care.' Grounded in rural culture, the circles assisted the system of formal care to work in harmony with informal care, maintaining independence for vulnerable rural elderly and their families.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107443078&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	0	1044	Advances in Nursing Science	1	704	magilvy,jk	magilvy	jk
723	Challenges Of Nursing Research With The Frail Elderly.	1992	1049	10.1177/019394599201400604	NLM1455847		1049	14	6	721	The complexities and challenges of conducting nursing research with the frail elderly have been poorly identified in the nursing literature. This literature examines geriatric research issues but fails to examine issues involved in doing field research with any special population, including the frail elderly. In-depth consideration of the special problems associated with studying the elderly generally, or the frail elderly specifically, are omitted. These two groups differ based on extent of functional impairment. Due to market constraints, a specialized text on gerontological nursing research simply does not exist. Although some articles about doing nursing research with frail elders exist, the issues raised in these articles are limited. The most popular issues in the nursing literature about doing research with the elderly have related to ethics (e.g., Archbold, 1981; Davis, 1981; Wolanin, 1980, 1984). Although ethical issues are important, knowledge of ethics does not solve the complex, practical problems of formulating conceptualizations and designing measures and procedures for studying the frail elderly.	http://www.systems.wsu.edu/scripts/wsuall.pl?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=107459214&site=ehost-live	2021-07-02 01:33:27	0	Mhallagingandcomplexityorcomplexandfrail_nursjournals_2021.06.23.xml	1	1049	Western Journal of Nursing Research	1	1049	phillips,lr	phillips	lr
